# Ryan Cordell: DHSI Course Proposal

## 1. Proposed Title

Introduction to Humanities Data Analysis & Visualization in R (HDA)

## 2. One Paragraph Description
This course introduces humanities researchers to the R programming language, with a focus on the analysis and visualization of tabular data (e.g. census records, bibliographic catalogs, etc.) using the [Tidyverse suite of R packages](http://tidyverse.org/). Before the course week, students will be asked to read a few touchstone essays wrestling with the peculiar qualities of humanistic data and the transformations of computational analysis. These essays will undergird our work during the week, helping us tie our practical work with R to broader questions about the nature of evidence in the humanities. The bulk of HDA will be devoted to demystifying the basic syntax of R (along with the operations of RStudio) and learning to import data (primarily as data frames); explore data through common but essential transformations; and visualize data using scatterplots, histograms, and related graphs. Given time and student interest, we may also dip our toes into the basics of text analysis, mapping, topic modeling, classification, or vector space analysis as implemented in R: or we might learn to build Twitter bots! This course presumes no prior knowledge of R and datasets will be provided for students, but I will also be in touch with students about using their own data, particularly in the final few days of class. I imagine this course as a condensed version of [this graduate seminar](http://s17hda.ryancordell.org/) I teach at Northeastern. 

## 3. Fit with DHSI Curriculum
I imagine HDA as a complement to "Fundamentals of Programming/Coding for Human(s|ists)," which teaches students Python. The course proposed here focuses on R and will appeal to students with a particular interest in statistical analysis or visualization, for which R is especially well suited, or who have other reasons for choosing R over Python (such as when R is the preferred language of collaborators). HDA will be introductory, but would be both broader and narrower than "Introduction to Computation for Literary Criticism." HDA will be broader in taking tabular data as its object, which should appeal to historians and scholars from a range of disciplines beyond literary studies (though perhaps including literary studies). HDA would be narrower in focusing on helping students gain beginning proficiency in a single programming language, rather than the broad overview of tools in "Intro to Computation." Finally, this course could serve as an excellent bridge to courses such as "Stylometry with R: Computer-Assisted Analysis of Literary Texts" or "Understanding Topic Modeling," both of which use R but cannot offer a robust introduction to R itself or the RStudio environment.

## 5. Instructor's CV

My most up-to-date CV can be found [on my personal research website](http://ryancordell.org/about/cv/). I would anticipate bringing a co-instructor on board for this class, likely a Northeastern graduate student who has taken my Humanities Data Analysis grad seminar and would benefit from experience teaching a DH course (which our graduate students would rarely have the opportunity to teach).
