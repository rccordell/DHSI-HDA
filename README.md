# Acknowledgements

The course is taught by Ryan Cordell (<https://ryancordell.org/>) and Gregory Palermo (<https://palermog.github.io/>) and draws extensively from previous courses taught by Ryan Cordell and Jonathan D. Fitzgerald (<http://jonathandfitzgerald.com/>) at Northeastern University in Spring 2017 (<http://s17hda.ryancordell.org/>) and by Benjamin Schmidt in 2015 (<http://benschmidt.org/HDA15/>). Some course exercises are modeled on chapters in Julia Silge and David Robinson's book *Text Mining in R: A Tidy Approach* (<https://www.tidytextmining.com/>), as well as on Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton's *Programming Historian* tutorial, "Basic Text Processing in R" (<https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/basic-text-processing-in-r>). There are other necessary acknowledgements, which we have attempted to include in the pertinent exercises.
