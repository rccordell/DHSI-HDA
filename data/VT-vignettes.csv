a year, and the other lust arrived, were
accidentally overheard in the following

A young man happened to sit at church
in a pew adjoining that in which sat a
young woman for whom be conceived a
sudden and violent passion. He was de­
siroes of entering into a courtship on the
spot; and, the surroundings not permitting
a declaration in orthodox form, the exi­

ingenious plan:
He politely handed to his fair neighbor
a Bible open, with a pin stuck in the fol­

verse: ""Aud now I beseech thee, not as
though I wrote a new commandment unto
thee, but that which we had from the be­

10th verse of the 2nd chapter of Ruth:
""Then she fell on her face, and bowed
herself to the ground, and said unto him:
Why have I found grace in thine eyes,
that thou shouldst take knowledge of me,
seeing that I am a stranger'""

marking the 12th verse of the 3rd Epistle
of John: ""Having many things to write

The Happy Man.
I noticed a mechanic among a anmber
of others at work in a house erected but a
little way front my office, who always had
a kind word and a cheerful smile for every
one he met. Let the day be ever so cold,
gloomy, or sunless, a happy smile danced
as a sunbeam upon his countenance. Meet­
ing him one morning, I asked him to tell
me the secret of his constant happy flow
of spirits. ""No secret, Doctor,"" he rep lied.
""I have one of the best of wives,, and when
I go to work she has a word of encourage­
ment for me; when I go home she always
meets me with a tel:der kiss; and she is
sure to be ready with my meals; and she
has done so many things through the day
to please me, that I cannot find it in try
heart to speak unkindly to any one."" iWha
influence, then, hath woman over the heart
of man, to so.ten it, and to imake it the
fountain of cheerful and pure emotions!
Speak gently, then ; a happy smile and a
kind word of greeting after the toils of the
day are over, cost nothing, and go far to­
ward making a home happy and peaceful.

THE HAPPY MAN.-I noticed a mechanic among
a number of others at work in a house erected but
a little way from my office, who always appeared
to be in a merry humour, who always had a kind i
word and a cheerful smile for everyone he met.
Let the day be ever so cold, gloomy, or sunless, a 1

to tell me the secret of his constant flow of spirits.
'No secret, doctor,' he replied. 'I have one of the

and she is sure to be ready with my meals; and
she has done so many things through the day to l
please me that I cannot find it in my heart to speak
unkindly to anyone.'-Dr. FAanklin.

The Secret.
""I noticed,"" said Dr. Franklin, ""a
mechanic among others, at work on
a house erecting but a little way from
my office, who always appeared to be
in a merry humor, who had a kind
word and cheorful smile for every
one he met. Let the day be ever so
cold, gloomy or sunless, a happy
smile danced like a sunbeam on his
cheerful countenance. Meeting him,
one morning, I asked him to tell me
the secret of his happy flow of spirits.
""My secret, doctor,"" he replied,
""is that I have got one of the
be»t wives, and when I go to
work she always has a kind word of
encouragement for me, and when I
go home she meets me with a smile
and a kiss, and then tea is sure to be
ready, and she has done so many lit­
tle things through the day to please
me that I cannot find it in my heart
te speak an unkind word to any­
body."" What an influence, then,
bath woman oyer the heart of man,
to soften it and make it the fountain

Speak gently, then; a happy smile
and a kind word of greeting, after
the toils of the day are over, cost
nothing, and go far toward making a
home happy and peaceful
