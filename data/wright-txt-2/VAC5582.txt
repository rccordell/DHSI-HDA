            TO My father,
            THIS WORK IS DEDICATED,
            BY FLORENCE.
            
               DEAR FATHER, take this little book,
               My heart of love doth offer thee;
               Of days now past it oft may bring
               To thee, some pleasing memory.
            
            
               The gift I bring has little worth,
               Save, what it borrows from the heart;
               'Twas wrought in love, and so may now
               Some joy to thee impart.
            
            
               Of thought's sweet thornless Bowers I've twined
               A New-Year's wreath for thee;
               Despise it not, but wear it then
               In memory of me.
            
            
               In Heaven, again I'll wreathe a crown
               Of Amaranth flowers for thee,
               Unfading, deathless, it shall, bloom,
               Through all Eternity.
            
            
            
               As Time, with restless wings, speeds on,
               And circling years glide by,
               
                  I may be called from darkness here
               To worlds of light on high,
            
            
               And thou be left; if this it be,
               When Memory calls on thee
               To roam with her, through scenes of yore,—
               Then think, oh think of me!
            
         
         
            PREFACE.
            IT is not without some hesitation that I venture to introduce the ideal personages of
               my story to the public, as candidates for its favorable consideration. May I be
               pardoned, when I express the hope that many allowances will be made for the faults,
               doubtless but too apparent, in this the first work of a young and inexperienced
               writer? If it be deemed unworthy a place among the popular fictions of the day, let
               it be passed by in silence; but if there be in the book any germ of truth any bud of
               promise, let it be expanded under the genial influence of kindly appreciation, not
               withered by the blighting frost of harsh censure.
            If I may beguile the tedium of a weary hour, afford pleasure to friends who love me,
               or sow one seed of good, can it be said "Ocni funiculum
                  torsit"—She hath labored in vain?

               CHAPTER I.
               "COME, Antoinette," said Mrs. Cabell to her friend, Mrs. Bainbridge, "suppose we
                  take a stroll this fine evening. I will guide you in one of my favorite paths, and
                  will be delighted to point out to you some of the beauties of our sylvan
                  landscape."
               With their permission, we will follow these ladies, as they emerge from the
                  stately avenue of trees which formed the entrance to the grounds of Cabell Manor,
                  and take the path along the side of this little streamlet, now winding among
                  forest-trees of many centuries' growth, whose foliage is so dense that at midday a
                  ray of sunlight penetrates with difficulty; now emerging from this natural temple,
                  where silence is supremely eloquent, upon a stretch of velvet-like greensward,
                  dotted with clumps of trees. A little rustic bridge here spans the gurgling waters
                  of the brook, and from it the path winds up the gentle acclivity of a hill, which
                  is one of many that diversify the landscape.
               Mrs. Cabell pauses upon the summit, for the ascent has fatigued her.
               
               "I," she said, "am not so active as I have been, and must rest awhile here; but,
                  Antoinette, take a peep at that pretty pottage below us, nestling among vines and
                  trees. That is the goal I had in view when I left home. I must introduce you to
                  the inmates of this rural paradise, and I hope you may like them, as you will soon
                  be located near them."
               A few minutes' walk brings us to the cottage gate. The appearance presented by the
                  place is more than usually attractive; for the rain-drops from the recent shower
                  still gem the flowers and leaves, and reflect the last rays of the sun, which
                  linger lovingly upon the quiet beauty of the spot. While we pass slowly up the
                  graveled walk which leads to the house, let us examine closely, analyzing the
                  elements which combine so harmoniously to form this simple but charming picture.
                  The yard is not large; but contains fine specimens of some of our most beautiful
                  forest-trees,—a large oak, several maples, and the dense beech. In one corner,
                  forming a natural bower, with their drooping branches, stand two weeping-willows,
                  while rose-bushes and various kinds of flowering shrubs skirt the borders and peep
                  at us, with their bright-eyed blossoms, from their hiding-places in the grass.
                  Wistarias and honeysuckles twine round the trees, and hang garlands from their
                  lower branches. The cottage-front presents one mass of flowering vines, roses,
                  jessamines, and clematis, inseparably intertwined, arching above the entrance, and
                  hanging so low that they salute our cheek as we pass under.
               In this sweet nook we find one of the birds who makes his secluded spot vocal,
                  when she can be roused from her books or from the reveries in which she
                  indulges.
               She is now so intent upon some volume, too ponderous for her little hands, that
                  she is not aware of our approach until addressed by name; for had she known that
                  we were coming, she would have sought, hastily, some more secure hiding-place, so
                  shy is she of strangers. Now she startles at the sound of her wild, soft name, as
                  though still undetermined whether to run, or remain to entertain the guests, until
                  released by the arrival of her father or elder sister.
               The family of Mr. Morris, the proprietor of Willowbrook, consisted of his two
                  daughters, Helen and Zenaida, and several servants. He was a gentleman of good
                  lineage, cultivated mind, and limited pecuniary resources, which enabled him to
                  live upon this little place, supplied with the necessaries of life, but restricted
                  in the indulgence of its luxuries.
               To the education of his girls he devoted his time, deeming knowledge the best
                  inheritance he could bequeath to them.
               Helen, the eldest, was a specimen of country beauty—black haired, black eyed, and
                  rosy cheeked, a practical, energetic, sensible girl, cheerful and obliging in
                  disposition, the favorite companion of her father. Although but seventeen years of
                  age, she superintended the domestic arrangements of the household in a manner
                  which would have done no discredit to older and more experienced housekeepers. The
                  house under her dominion always presented an air of perfect neatness, though its
                  adornments were of a character so simple that they would have called a smile of
                  contempt to the lip of those accustomed to the regal magnificence of the
                  palace-like residences now so common in our land.
               
               The parlor, or best room, on this day presented an aspect at once cheerful and
                  elegant; for in it the hands of Zenaida had arranged bouquets and vases of flowers
                  with an artistic effect which they alone could produce. Her canary hung by the
                  open window, through which the soft evening breeze came in, swaying the light
                  muslin curtain with a billowy motion.
               Outside the window the vines furnished a safe retreat for the birds, which Zenaida
                  esteemed it her especial privilege to feed and tend with a devotion truly
                  admirable.
               On a little table by this window were many books, and a little basket, containing
                  the fancy needle-work, which was another favorite occupation of Zenaida. She would
                  here ply her needle, watching with pleasure the figures that grew into beauty
                  beneath her fingers, and wishing that she could become skillful in the
                  time-honored art of embroidery, as some of the heroines of old, of whom she read,
                  that she might thus perpetuate the memory of incidents in her life, if she should
                  ever experience any worthy of being recorded; while before her, as examples, would
                  rise the sad Andromache, the fair, unfortunate Mary Stuart, and many others.
               But we have given no idea, however unsatisfactory, of our wild-flower, Zenaida.
                  She could not be called perfectly beautiful; but the expression of her face was
                  such that the beholder was not content with a passing glance. Her face wore not
                  the vivid bloom of her sister's, but was fair, too fair for a child, and her eyes
                  haunted you, long after seeing her, with the mournful intensity of their gaze.
                  When not employed with her books, or sewing, they were fixed on vacancy, with an
                  eager, questioning glance, as if she sought penetrate the hidden mysteries of
                  futurity. She was habitually silent; but when roused from her apparently dormant
                  state by any act of injustice, or what seemed such to her sensitive spirit, her
                  eyes would flash, her nostril dilate, and her tongue loosed from the thraldom of
                  silence, would give utterance to a torrent of eloquence irresistible and
                  overwhelming.
               Although younger by two years than Helen, her acquirements were superior as far as
                  the knowledge of books and the appreciation of the noblest sentiments of lofty
                  minds was concerned. The little room, which was called the library, was her
                  favorite resort in the house, and all the books (of which Mr. Morris had preserved
                  a good collecting, a relic of happier days and better fortune) had been devoured
                  by her, without being sufficient to satisfy the cravings of her appetite for
                  knowledge.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               "O PAPA," said Helen, springing to meet him as he came through the gate, "where
                  have you been? Supper is ready, and I have been waiting for you, until I began to
                  feel uneasy at your prolonged absence. What detained you?"
               "Nothing of importance, my child," replied Mr. Morris; "I rode over to Montrose,
                  and while there met with some acquaintances, with whom I chatted, not noticing the
                  lengthening shadows of evening, until the sun was nearly gone. I then started as
                  soon as possible, but it has taken me until this time to reach home. But where is
                  Zenaida?"
               
               "I do not know where she is," responded Helen. "Our neighbor, Mrs. Cabell, called
                  here this evening with a friend of hers, and Zenaida was reading so absorbedly
                  that they came upon her in the portico before she saw them, and it was then too
                  late to escape. She overcame her bashfulness sufficiently to invite them in, and
                  to request them to be seated, until she could summon me. As soon as I came, she
                  vanished, and I have not seen her since. I wish she would conquer her timidity, or
                  at least try to do so; for it is positively painful to see her blush, when any one
                  happens to look at her."
               "She is a strange child," replied Mr. Morris; "time, however, may conquer this
                  defect, if it may be so considered. But I want to see her. Helen, ring the
                  bell,"
               A neat, bright-eyed black boy answered the summons. "Milton," said Mr. Morris,
                  "tell Miss Zenaida I wish to see her."
               The boy bowed, and departed with alacrity to obey the mandate of his master; for
                  he was one who ruled by love, and not by fear, and all seemed to strive to be
                  first to execute the orders of one whose yoke was not galling even to the most
                  sensitive.
               Zenaida was found in the garden, where she had been tying up the flowers that were
                  bending with the weight of their own sweetness.
               As soon as she heard that papa had come, she hurried to the house, with heart
                  brimming with affection and eyes beaming with love; and, entering with her
                  noiseless step, her arms were round his neck, her soft kiss upon his brow, before
                  he knew that she had come.
               "Ah! little daughter," said Mr. Morris, "where were you hiding, not to know that
                  papa had come, or that supper was ready?"
               "I was in the garden, papa," replied the soft voice of Zenaida.
               "Well, Zenaida," he continued, "why did you run away from Mrs. Cabell this
                  evening, as Helen tells me you did? Was she not friendly?"
               "Yes," replied Helen, "she was very friendly, and invited me very kindly to come,
                  to see her, and I will go. May I not, papa?"
               Still Zenaida said nothing, and her father seemed at a loss to know what
                  interpretation to put upon her silence.
               "Certainly, I wish you to go, Helen," he said. "You have never returned Miss
                  Annie's visit, have you?"
               "No, papa," she replied; "but I would rather go to see Mrs. Cabell than Annie. She
                  is so haughty."
               "And, papa," broke forth Zenaida, "if you could have seen that Mrs. Bainbridge,
                  the lady who was with Mrs. Cabell. Her pretty lip (for it is still pretty, though
                  she is no longer young) curled as she came in, and she said in an undertone to
                  Mrs. Cabell, 'That it was really surprising to her that people, if they were poor,
                  could exist in such a pigeon-box as this;' and then she drew her dress up, as she
                  sat down, as though she feared it would be contaminated by coming in contact with
                  the carpet. Mrs. Cabell, fearful that this ill-timed remark had been heard, was
                  more than usually polite to me. I watched this Mrs. Bainbridge when Helen came in,
                  and though she addressed her in the sweetest, blandest tone imaginable, I felt
                  assured that she was indulging dulging
                  her contempt, at the expense of Helen's plain muslin dress, which despite its
                  plainness, was perfectly neat and very becoming. I have no patience with persons
                  who value others according to mere external adornments—the jewel, however rare,
                  being counted as worthless, unless displayed in costly setting. A trite simile, I
                  confess, but well adapted to the text."
               "Nay, Zenaida," said Mr. Morris, "perhaps you judge the lady harshly. The few
                  minutes during which you were with her were insufficient to enable you to form a
                  definite, correct opinion concerning her."
               "Some persons," she replied, "I know intuitively, and I am either attracted or
                  repelled so forcibly that it is with difficulty I ever subdue or erase a first
                  impression."
               "The feelings of one whose sensibilities are so acute, so easily roused as yours,
                  are not an infallible criterion upon which to form an opinion of another," said
                  Mr. Morris.
               "Well," replied Zenaida, "if you were fortunate enough to convince me that my
                  theory of attraction and repulsion was erroneous, you know 
                     
                        'A man convinced against his will,
                        Is of the same opinion still;'
                     
                   so a truce to this uninteresting discussion. What news did you bring from
                  Montrose to-day, papa?"
               "None worthy of repetition, I believe," he answered. "Oh, yes! There is a new
                  minister at our Grove Church, and Mr. Bainbridge has purchased the beautiful
                  estate of Maplehurst, and will soon take up his abode there for the summer; so
                  that your unfavorable impression in regard to Mrs. Bainbridge bridge is
                  unfortunate, as she will be a near neighbor, and her children might prove valuable
                  acquisitions to your limited circle of acquaintances. Look on the table, Zenaida,"
                  he continued, "and you will find a book I brought for you—a copy of
                  poems—Coleridge and Keats bound together."
               "Oh, how delightful!" exclaimed Zenaida, as she turned the leaves. "The Ancient
                  Mariner, Hyperion, Endymion, and many other things I wished so much to see. You
                  are so good, papa, to think of me."
               "My child," he said, imprinting a good-night kiss upon her fair forehead, "do not
                  sit up all night to read that book, or I shall regret that I brought it to you.
                  Your cheek is pale now, and I fear you read too much—take too little exercise. I
                  do not wish you to cultivate your intellectual faculties at the expense of your
                  physical powers. Remember my old advice—preserve the 'mens
                     sana in corpore sano.'"
               "Good-night, papa," replied Zenaida; "do not disturb your kind, solicitous heart
                  about my pale face. I will not sit up late, though this book is an almost
                  irresistible temptation."
               With these words she proceeded to her room. She was about to obey the injunction
                  of her father, not to sit up longer; but the window was open, and through it the
                  moonlight came in, illuminating the room with its silvery radiance. She sat down,
                  and, leaning her head on her hands, remained spell-bound.
               
                  
                     She gazes on the still earth, calmly sleeping
                     Beneath the moon's soft, holy, silvery light;
                     She gazes on that moon forever keeping
                     Her watch as a guardian of the silent night.
                     
                     She sees those far blue heavens reflected clearly
                     In the bright mirror of the sylvan stream,
                     And all the tales of sin seem to her merely
                     The dread imagining of some hideous dream.
                  
                  
                     The air that whispers soft, to her seems laden
                     With odors from the groves of paradise,
                     And its low-murmured music, heard of old in Eden,
                     The voice of her soul's God, who made those skies
                     With all their shining hosts; and as she hears, she bows
                     Her soul in deepest reverence, and of Him she prays
                     That her whole life be holy as this evening's close,
                     Calm as the solemn twilight all her days.
                  
                  
                     There is no note of wail amid the soft sweet numbers
                     That lull her spirit to this deep repose;
                     Her heart is ignorant of the grief which slumbers
                     In it, like perfume in the unopened rose.
                     The branches of life's tree for her grow upward,
                     And joyous rustle in each passing breeze;
                     She, blissful, knows not it may soon droop downward,
                     A weeping-willow, saddest 'mong the trees.
                  
               
               With heart attuned to prayer, she slept the sleep of the innocent, while round her
                  hovered holy angels, bringing with them, from the gates of heaven, dreams, upon
                  which the glory of the abode of the blest still lingered, when they encompassed
                  the sweet sleeper.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               THE next morning, when Helen woke, Zenaida had flown from her nest by her side;
                  but as she never interfered with her disposition of her leisure time, she rose,
                  and went down to set in order her domestic machinery for the day.
               Zenaida, roused from her slumbers by the sweet matin songs of the early birds, had
                  stopped for awhile in the portico to see how many fresh blossoms the night-dews
                  and the new light of another morning had awakened into life.
               
                  
                     Above the door, with tendrils closely twining,
                     The vines are interknit; and starry eyes
                     Upon her through the dark-green leaves are shining,
                     Looking their love with many fragrant sighs.
                     As the wind sweeps, they bend with graceful motion
                     To press a soft kiss on her brow of snow;
                     Then, as they wave, they gleam like foam of ocean,
                     Flushed with the rosy morning's crimson glow.
                  
               
               We may trace her path by the trail along the grass, where her light feet have
                  brushed the moisture from the dripping blades. This path leads you to the garden
                  gate, where, peeping under its arch of vines, we see Zenaida; her cheek fanned by
                  the morning breeze, her hair glistening in the early sunlight. In this undisturbed
                  retreat she communes with herself, giving utterance to her thoughts and feelings;
                  but were any to intrude, her fancies would take flight like a frightened covey,
                  and remain beyond recall until she was once more alone.
               
               
                  
                     Her flowers were her companions ever dear,
                     Who smiled with her in joy—in sorrow wept;
                     In glowing spring she loved them, and when sere
                     The yellow wings of autumn o'er them swept;
                     For her their bright eyes looked with glance of pleasure,
                     When first the orient beams shone o'er the fields—
                     For her at evening, in the fullest measure,
                     Each swinging censer richest perfume yields.
                     Now as she stands, the loving red rose bends
                     To flush her pearly cheek with its own hue,
                     And now the queen-like lily to her lends
                     Her cup o'erflowing with bright morning dew.
                  
               
               Every flower is closely inspected by her, each new beauty producing an
                  ever-recurring, ever-increasing thrill of delight. She tries to decide which is
                  most beautiful—the white, red, or pink roses, the lilies, pansies, pinks, or
                  jasmines, and her heart refuses to pronounce a verdict. Each one has a glory
                  peculiarly its own, and each differs from the other in glory.
               As she looked upon them, she fancied she could see the beautiful face of a
                  flower-angel peeping out from each—could hear the faint, silvery tones of their
                  voices, calling upon her in accents of love. But among them were no
                  jealousies.
               "Were the Goddess of Discord to throw her apple here, with the inscription 'Detur
                  pulcherrimæ," she said, with a smile, "and I were appointed umpire between these
                  fair disputants, my task would be as difficult as that of Paris; but, like him, I
                  suppose; I would finally decide in favor of the rose, the flower of Venus." So she
                  stood, rapt in a glow of enthusiastic admiration, before a bush covered with
                  blooms, some full blown, some half open. The leaves, folded like the spiral curves
                  of a delicate shell, whose heart glowed with rosy fire, were gemmed with
                  dew-drops, glittering in the first beams of the sun.
               "My rose," said Zenaida, "is a veritable queen of diamonds this morning; so
                  dazzling that my eyes are almost bewildered by her extreme brilliancy. I am sure
                  'Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.' I wish that I were
                  as lovely as that sweet flower; but the days of fairy are gone by, and there is no
                  one to grant my wish as Cinderella's godmother did hers. But if I must, perforce,
                  be content with my own degree of physical comeliness, I can adorn my mind, my
                  heart, with the sweetness of the rose, the modesty of the violet, the purity of
                  the lily. Oh that my hand possessed the skill to perpetuate the glowing beauties
                  of these flowers! My soul is haunted by their remembered loveliness long after
                  their forms have perished, and my spirit longeth unutterably for them when their
                  familiar, friendly faces no longer meet my eye."
               While these thoughts were passing, she gathered a bunch of the freshest buds, and
                  adding to them some jasmines, heliotropes, and geranium leaves, formed a small
                  bouquet, which she presented to her father with her morning kiss. She then
                  replenished her vases, fed her birds, and conned her lessons, which were
                  dispatched more quickly than usual, that she might read the book presented by her
                  father.
               From the fairy-land of the poet's dream she was recalled, some days after, by the
                  voice of Helen, whom she found preparing for an evening walk to the Manor.
               "Zenaida," said Helen, "I wish you to go with me to Cabell Manor. Will you
                  not?"
               "I would rather track Endymion through the caves of ocean," she replied. "Cabell Manor will not
                  compensate for the pleasures I resign."
               "You will have ample time to read your book," said Helen. "You have been poring
                  over it every leisure minute for some days, and I think you ought to be grateful
                  to me for proposing so pleasant a walk, by way of variety."
               "Well," replied Zenaida, "the walk will be delightful, and I will go, if you wish
                  it, sissy; but—" and she paused, leaving the sentence unfinished.
               "But what, Zenaida?" inquired Helen, smiling.
               "You will see what I mean," she replied.
               They followed the path we have designated, until they came to the lodge gate
                  opening into the grounds of the Manor.
               Zenaida, too much engrossed by the beauty of the scene before them to speak,
                  except occasionally to give utterance to her delight in interjectional
                  exclamations, was, for the time, forgetful of the stately grandeur of the Manor,
                  and the impressive hauteur of Miss Annie.
               The Manor was a grand old place, with its broad avenue of forest-trees, the
                  branches of which met overhead, clasping each other in loving greeting, forming a
                  vaulted roof like that of some vast old cathedral, above the emerald turf
                  beneath.
               At the extremity, through the dim, leafy vista, was seen the old mansion; no fancy
                  modern house with more points than the compass, adorned with no huge humming-tops,
                  or other useless appendages, but a substantial building, defying the rage of the
                  elements, conveying to all an impression of durability, comfort, and unlimited
                  hospitality. Under the auspices of former Cabells, and during the early years of
                  the present owner's administration, the old hall had been thronged with guests;
                  but now the unfrequent wheels suffered the grass to grow in the avenue, and the
                  long dancing saloons and dining halls looked quite desolate, being less frequently
                  called into requisition by their widowed mistress. The house was built on three
                  sides of a square, with a long piazza running entirely round on the inner side,
                  inclosing a pretty green plat, in the centre of which was a fountain. The water
                  fell from an overflowing urn in the hands of a naiad, keeping the grass ever fresh
                  and luxuriant by the falling spray.
               Helen and Zenaida walked slowly, admiring the beauties here so lavishly displayed;
                  but at length they reached their destination, ascended the broad flight of steps,
                  rang the bell, and were admitted by a servant, who ushered them into the parlor,
                  where they awaited the appearing of the lady of the Manor and her fair
                  daughter.
               Although Helen was not unaccustomed to the display of wealth, (for she had not
                  always dwelt beneath the lowly roof which she now called by the endearing name of
                  home,) yet her pulse throbbed, and she felt oppressed and saddened in spite of
                  herself.
               Zenaida, in the mean while, was noting everything with her eye, so quick to detect
                  any deviation from the standard of true taste, which she had elevated; but nothing
                  here met her eye which was not in harmony with the general character of the
                  place.
               The furniture was old and massive, black with age, and richly carved. Portraits of
                  the Cabells of past generations adorned the walls. Zenaida amused herself tracing
                     out imaginary scenes and incidents in
                  their various histories. The folding doors between the rooms beyond, which were
                  two in number, were thrown open, and the windows in the farthest room also,
                  through which might be caught glimpses of waving trees and green grass.
               Unbroken stillness reigned, and Zenaida was lost in a reverie, when she heard the
                  sound of a closing door, then the rustle of a dress on the stairs, and the next
                  moment Mrs. Cabell entered, followed by Miss Annie, who looked as if she thought
                  this visit might have been dispensed with without dissatisfaction on her part. In
                  her eyes it was unpardonable that people should live in cottages from necessity,
                  and wear clothing less costly than her own.
               Miss Annie was particularly unamiable this evening; for she was reclining at ease
                  upon a sofa in her room, deeply absorbed in the intricate mazes of some thrilling
                  romance, when the visitors were announced.
               "Some ladies in the parlor, Miss Annie," said the servant girl who had admitted
                  Helen and Zenaida.
               "Who is it, Penelope?" inquired Miss Annie, without raising her eyes from her
                  book.
               "Mr. Morris's girls," replied Penelope.
               "I shall not go down to see them," said Annie, decidedly, resuming
                  her reading.
               "Come, Annie," said her mother, as she passed her door, "are you ready?"
               "I am not going down," replied Annie. "I could be ready in a minute if I chose,
                  but I do not."
               "But you must go," said Mrs. Cabell in her most authoritative manner; and Miss
                  Annie most reluctantly laid aside her book, and followed her mother down stairs,
                  where she appeared with the ungracious mien we have described.
               Mrs. Cabell was a lady of noble presence, but her manners were free from that
                  assumption of superiority which rendered Annie so unpopular. She advanced to meet
                  Helen and Zenaida, saluted them with kindly warmth, expressed her pleasure at
                  their coming, and endeavored to make them feel perfectly at their ease; but Annie
                  received them coldly, and conversed in the most ceremonious manner. She talked to
                  Zenaida of things of which she was ignorant, the knowledge of which would not have
                  profited her much had she possessed it.
               Mrs. Cabell at length proposed some music, by way of relieving the constraint
                  under which they labored. Annie complied with her mother's request that she would
                  play for them, with more cheerfulness than she had yet manifested; for although
                  she looked upon these girls as insignificant children, yet she lost no opportunity
                  to show off her superior accomplishments.
               Before she sat down, she turned to Helen; "Miss Morris," she said, "will you not
                  play first?"
               "No," replied Helen, "I prefer to hear you."
               "I am so out of practice," sighed Miss Annie aloud, while she mentally determined
                  to play her most brilliant pieces, that she might rouse the envy of her young
                  listeners.
               She played skillfully, but the heart of Zenaida was not moved. It was merely a
                  display of mechanical proficiency, and Zenaida loved the music which came from the
                  heart and appealed to the heart. She loved music passionately, but she would have
                  given expression to the passing emotions
                  of her own soul, had she possessed the power to awaken the melodies slumbering in
                  these keys. She would have been an improvisatrice, not an exponent of the thoughts
                  and feelings of another.
               This accomplishment had been neglected in the education of Helen and Zenaida,
                  partly on account of the limited means of Mr. Morris, partly because he had deemed
                  other studies of greater importance. Helen regretted it but little, but Zenaida
                  mourned over this deficiency. Her father, seeing how her mind dwelt upon this, had
                  offered to make any sacrifice to secure instruction for her; but she knew how
                  heavily the tax would, fall upon him, and refused to accept the sacrifice.
               Now the notes of the music, though not such as she would have awakened, revived
                  this old yearning of her heart. Deeper and deeper grew the shadow upon her fair
                  face; her heart was oppressed with the weight of its emotions, and when the music
                  ceased and Mrs. Cabell proposed a walk through the garden, she rose quickly and
                  prepared to follow her, for she always felt at home with nature. The trees, birds,
                  and flowers, were dear friends, who never requited her love with coldness; who
                  never, by want of sympathy, sealed her lips, that they should not give utterance
                  to the thoughts of her heart.
               The lady hostess led the way through the hall, along the piazza, where the naiad
                  with her urn attracted the attention and elicited the admiration of Zenaida, and
                  she could not forbear exclaiming—
               "Oh, Mrs. Cabell, what a beautiful place for flowers! why are there none here? I
                  would plant vines, and train them over the piazza, and have some water-lilies and
                  all other kinds of flowers around the fountain. The spray would keep them so
                  fresh."
               "Ah, my dear," replied Mrs. Cabell, "the vines would bring all sorts of worms
                  about the house, and the flowers, here in the plat, would be too much trouble. I
                  have not as much patience as you, and I do not know enough about the cultivation
                  of flowers to make them thrive under my care."
               Zenaida was effectually silenced; for the idea about the worms was an objection
                  which had never urged itself upon her consideration, and, to her, a home without
                  flowers would have been as desolate and drear as a sky without stars.
               The lady appeared wholly unconscious of the shock she had given to the little
                  sensitive plant by her side, and continued her walk in a most complacent,
                  comfortable frame of mind.
               The garden, with her opinions about flowers, could not be one to please Zenaida;
                  though one more utilitarian in theory, with an eye to the plenishing of the table,
                  might have seen in it beauties more worthy of admiration than a world of flowers
                  would possess in his or her estimation.
               As they passed by one of the cabins, Mrs. Cabell called a little African, who was
                  lurking behind a tree, peeping at the ladies as they passed. He came forth from
                  his hiding place, grinning so as to show every tooth in his head, taking a very
                  deliberate survey of the sisters, his eyes rolling with delight as they rested on
                  Helen, as much as to say "Good Lordy, but you is purty!"
               "Pompey," said his mistress, "I want you to climb the cherry trees and get us some cherries. You can
                  climb, can't you?"
               "Yes, ma'am," replied Pompey deliberately, "I can; but dere's mighty few cherries
                  dar; for de birds is done eat 'em all up, mighty nigh."
               "Black birds, I suppose," said the lady; "but come, let us see if we cannot find
                  some."
               Pompey proceeded under protest, and they soon arrived at the trees, which he
                  climbed with the agility of a squirrel, showing conclusively that he had had
                  considerable practice.
               "Now, Pompey," said Mrs. Cabell, "my rule, when I send any of you boys up the
                  cherry-tree, is to make you whistle while you gather; so that you cannot eat them
                  as fast as they are pulled. Come, whistle."
               "Could'nt do it ef I was gwine to die fur it," replied Pompey, puckering up his
                  mouth and making an ineffectual attempt to whistle, which, ended in a laugh,
                  during which he choked with the seed of a cherry which he had surreptitiously
                  slipped into his mouth. He succeeded better than he had expected, for he filled
                  the little basket which Mrs. Cabell had given him. The lady handed it to Zenaida,
                  expressing her regret that there were so few. Zenaida took them, thanked her, and
                  said "How pretty!"
               Her remark "how pretty" reached the ear of Miss Annie, who, with contemptuous
                  smile and curling lip, exclaimed—
               "What a curious creature you are! Why did you not say 'how good?' I believe you
                  value nothing unless it accords with your ideas of beauty."
               "I may be a 'curious creature,' Miss Cabell," replied Zenaida, emphasizing Miss
                  Annie's words, "but I think it perfectly fectly natural to admire all the works of
                  God, and I see in these little cherries, which he has dyed with this beautiful
                  glow, the impress of his hand, as clearly as in the loftiest tree or most majestic
                  river."
               The transient feeling of indignation which had been roused by Miss Annie's tone
                  and look, more than by her words, flushed her usually pale cheek with a bright
                  color, (which looked as if it might have been given her by the cherries as a
                  reward for her championship,) and lent to her step and air a haughty dignity which
                  Miss Cabell herself might have envied.
               Mrs. Cabell noted all, but said nothing then. She was interested in this child,
                  who, though at present occupying a humble position in society, gave evidence of a
                  degree of refinement, a keenness of susceptibility, rare among those most highly
                  favored by fortune. She resolved to see more of her, and with this in view invited
                  the sisters to spend the evening, or stay all night with her.
               They declined, Helen urging as her plea that she was housekeeper, and must be at
                  home to have supper prepared for her father. Zenaida had seen enough of Miss Annie
                  to suffice for that time, and had no desire to prolong her visit. She bowed
                  haughtily her adieu to Annie, but extended her hand to Mrs. Cabell, who took it,
                  drawing her close to her and imprinting a kiss upon her fair brow. At this
                  unlooked-for kindness, the blood mantled all over her cheek and brow, her eyes
                  filled with tears, which her pride would not permit to fall before the eyes of
                  Annie, as she murmured, "My mother used to kiss me there; I have no mother
                  now."
               Mrs. Cabell was much affected at this show of uncontrollable trollable emotion, which she saw that Zenaida
                  vainly endeavored to conceal; she pressed her hand, and cordially invited her to
                  come often to see her.
               "You love to walk," she said, "and the path from your house to the Manor is very
                  tempting. I am going to have a visit from some young relatives of mine. You must
                  come to see them."
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               "HELEN," exclaimed Zenaida, abruptly, as they were walking homeward, "you now see
                  why I did not want to go to the Manor. That Annie Cabell called me a 'curious
                  creature,' and eyed me with her contemptuous smile, as if I were an animal in a
                  menagerie, set upon exhibition for her especial delectation and amusement; but our
                  name is as good as hers, our blood as pure and free from all stain or reproach. To
                  be sure, she lives at Cabell Manor, while we are dwellers in Willowbrook Cottage,
                  and she is surrounded by those painted semblances of her departed ancestors; but
                  we have had as many honorable names before us, though we are not fortunate enough
                  to possess their faces on canvas."
               "Now, little sis," responded Helen, laughing, "you are expending entirely too much
                  of your eloquent indignation upon Miss Cabell. Reserve it for some more worthy
                  object. Do not permit her rudeness to raise the temperature of your usually
                  equable feelings."
               The quiet beauty of the evening soothed the disturbed feelings of Zenaida. In the
                  contemplation of the loveliness around her she forgot Miss Annie, and when they
                  reached the summit of the hill on their return, no unpleasant thought or feeling
                  marred the harmony of her spirit.
               From this eminence they had a fine view of the summer sunset and of the landscape,
                  partly in deep shadow, partly illumined by the last flashes from the jewelled
                  crown of the departing king, who never ceases from his appointed work,
                  disappearing from one hemisphere to rise in undiminished glory upon another.
               "The last golden arrows from the day-god's quiver are about to be spent, but they
                  fall more harmless on me than they did on the children of Niobe, who all perished
                  by a coup de soleil," soliloquized Zenaida, as she threw off her bonnet and seated
                  herself upon a large rock.
               "Helen," she exclaimed, after a pause, during which she had contemplated the earth
                  and sky in silence, "do you believe the sunsets of Italy are more gorgeous than
                  this? Look at those clouds. Some a deep rich purple, fringed with gold; some a
                  deep crimson, with silver lacings, like the trappings of a throne, so brilliant
                  that the light is reflected with a bright-rose glow upon the clouds above the
                  opposite horizon; and all these colors are harmoniously arranged as only the great
                  Painter of heaven can arrange them."
               "Sometimes I think," she continued, "that I would give anything I possess even in
                  my dreams to roam through the vast galleries of paintings, the works of the old
                  masters, the boast of the Old World, the envy of the New, to fill my soul to
                  repletion with the images of beauty they portray; but then I think that I have the
                  privilege of beholding, every day that I
                  live, pictures in the great gallery of Nature, (who holds her exhibitions without
                  money and without price,) and these pictures are as far above the works of man as
                  the heavens are above the earth, one set being painted by the creature, the other
                  by the Creator. And then, too, the pictures in my collection are never the same
                  when I look twice upon them, but change even while I gaze; so that I am kept in a
                  state of perpetual admiration at the wondrous skill of the great Artist."
               She turned, as she concluded, to see why she elicited no response from Helen; but
                  she was nowhere visible. After calling to Zenaida that it was nearly dark, she had
                  left her so absorbed in the thoughts to which she was giving expression that she
                  did not see or hear that she was gone.
               "Well," said Zenaida, stooping to pick up her bonnet, "she has left me very
                  unceremoniously, and I have been talking to the winds, as many wise people have
                  done before me. I hope they have not failed to derive instruction from my audible
                  soliloquy."
               At that instant, remembering a piece she had commenced to read before going to the
                  Manor, she darted down the hill, and soon traversed the space that intervened
                  between it and the cottage.
               As she entered the gate, her pet dog, a fine specimen of the Newfoundland breed,
                  bounded to meet her, nearly overwhelming her with his caresses. He was a
                  noble-looking animal; his face expressive of the deepest affection for his young
                  mistress, who patted him gently on the head, smoothing his long silky hair, and
                  talking all the while as she would have, done to a rational being; but the dog
                  Beppo, by his demeanor, showed that he was sufficiently rational to appreciate her
                  caresses, if he could not understand the words by which he was addressed.
               "Beppo," she said, "do you love me?"
               He answered by licking her hands, and clasping her feet affectionately with his
                  big paws, glancing up at her with his great loving brown eyes.
               He followed her to the door, where she took her seat upon the step, attracted
                  irresistibly by the perfume of the flowers which hung round on all sides. The
                  birds were twittering in their nests, preparatory to retiring for the night.
               After looking up at her face, as if to read there the thoughts and intents of her
                  heart, Beppo composed himself to rest at the feet of Zenaida; for he saw that she
                  had played enough with him, and that he must content himself with the measure of
                  attention which had already been bestowed on him.
               As Zenaida sat there, she again reverted to the evening she had just passed, and
                  again forgetting the wise injunction of Helen, her indignation rose against Miss
                  Annie. But she recollected that she was the only child of wealthy parents, that
                  she had been indulged in every whim, and that, by this injudicious treatment, her
                  overbearing manners had been fostered, until it was evident that even her mother
                  perceived how disagreeable it rendered her, particularly to those whom she
                  considered beneath her in wealth and social position, to whom she exhibited
                  herself in her true colors, not thinking it necessary that she should
                  inconvenience herself, even in the slightest degree, to oblige them, or render
                  herself charming in their sight.
               
               "I wish," said Zenaida, "that she would get married, and go away from Cabell
                  Manor; for I am sure that the place would be much more attractive without her
                  presence. She stirs up all the latent antagonism of my nature. But," she
                  continued, "I am selfish; for she is her mother's only child, and however
                  obnoxious she may be to me, of course she is dear to her mother's heart, and not
                  without much sorrow could that mother part with her."
               Just then she heard a footstep behind her, and, turning, beheld Aunt Rebecca, or
                  "black mammy," as Zenaida called her. The sable lady was worthy of her name, which
                  sounds as if it should be the cognomen of a princess; and Aunt Rebecca was as
                  majestic in her figure and deportment as if her African ancestors had been all of
                  royal blood. Perhaps they were; but on this point no one was competent to
                  pronounce a decision, as the old dame had no genealogical tree, the fame of her
                  progenitors being perpetuated by oral tradition only.
               Zenaida had always looked with great respect upon her black mammy, who loved her
                  almost to idolatry, and also felt privileged to exercise her authority, which she
                  held by right of seniority, when she saw "the child" do anything which she thought
                  ought not to be done.
               "Laws-a-mercy!" she began, "why, honey, what you down thar in the dirt fur,
                  settin' on that ole step wid that clean white coat on? That the way you show your
                  black mammy's raisin'? Git up dis blessid minnit, and come into de porch. And your
                  har all down, an' supper so nigh ready! Why, bless the Lord, chile, people 'ud
                  think I didn't know nothink, to see you so furgitful of what's 'comin' to a young
                  lady!"
               "Never mind, mammy," said Zenaida in a coaxing tone, placing her hand over Aunty's
                  mouth; "don't scold any more. I was going to comb my hair before supper, and I
                  have not soiled my dress; so there's a good mammy."
               "Well, chile," said mammy, "I don't mean to be cross. You know dat, honey, an' you
                  know, too, how to git round me with your smooth tongue an' soft ways, that you
                  does. God bless de chile! I lub her like she war my own; I don't mind if my skin
                  ar' black, an' this poor darlin' widout any mudder. Miss Elsie, your mudder,
                  honey, had just the same way wid her when she talked, an' the' same look out'n her
                  eyes, as you'se got. Bless God!" said mammy fervently, "but she war a sweet thing
                  w'en ole massa come an' took her from home."
               "Tell me about my mother, mammy," said Zenaida.
               "Well," replied mammy, "that picter you war round your neck will tell you what she
                  looked like, only 'tisn't half so purty. Your gran'pa, my ole massa, Col.
                  Rutledge, loved her better'n anythink in this worl', an' he wouldn't a bin willin'
                  fur her to marry anybody; but he let your pa have her, 'cause he was so good, an'
                  Miss Elsie set her heart on him. Your gran'pa used to live mighty grand, an' when
                  he died he left nothink to Miss Elsie 'ceptin' me an' what he gave her when she
                  war married; an' massa Morris is so good; he's jist too good to git along in this
                  worl', an' since Miss Elsie died, he's never bin like the same."
               "Did you say I looked like my mother, mammy?" said Zenaida.
               "Like as two peas, chile, only her cheeks war rosier than your'n; but you'll be jist like her when you is
                  done growin' an' readin'," and with this prophecy, Aunt Rebecca retired.
               That night Zenaida gazed long upon the miniature likeness of her mother, which she
                  always wore next her heart; which she often dwelt upon, in contemplation, until to
                  her excited fancy the lifeless shadow was endowed with animation—the eyes beamed
                  upon her with love unutterable, and the lips smiled with sweetness unrivaled by
                  any mortal lips that she had ever seen. Then the cry would come from her loving
                  heart—
               "Mother, my mother! would that I could but hear the words that would issue from
                  those lips, that my heart might be warmed by the love-light in those eyes; but,
                  alas the grass grows green above thy grave, and from this, even, mountains and
                  rivers divide me, though oft, in spirit, I kneel beside it. When the winds howl
                  and shriek round my chamber, like the wail of the lost, and when the pitiless rain
                  descends in torrents, I weep that the form of which this, though beautiful, is but
                  an imperfect image the lovely casket which enshrined a soul more lovely—should be
                  exposed to the rage of the merciless elements. But my mother was good, and she is
                  in heaven."
               These thoughts thronged her waking hours, and in her dreams that night she saw the
                  angel-face of her mother bending to her from a bright cloud, and stretching out
                  her arms as if to clasp her in her embrace, and raise her pure young soul above
                  the contaminating influences of earth, placing it in the bright world of which she
                  was an inhabitant, where it would be safe forever.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               ONE evening Zenaida sat toiling over her Latin lesson, and some other studies in
                  which she was particularly interested, until Helen reproved her for her
                  assiduity.
               "Zenaida," she said, "do lay aside your books, and run out to exercise, and
                  breathe some fresh air."
               "That's right, Miss Helen," joined in black mammy, "make her go; she'll look for
                  all the worl' like a 'tater sprout as is bin raised in a dark cellar."
               "I am nearly through, Helen," replied Zenaida; "this ode is so pretty! But I
                  intended to hunt for some wild flowers this very evening, and I will go."
               "I would go with you," said Helen, "but I have been running about all day, and am
                  now weary."
               "Well," said Zenaida, as she started forth, "I'll take Beppo."
               "He is faithful as Ulysses' old Argus," she murmured, stroking his head, "and
                  brave as the Nemæan lion; a first-rate protector, equal to the one that guarded
                  the footsteps of the heavenly Una. Come, Beppo!"
               The fresh air which stirred the leaves, and shook out the sweet odors from the
                  flower-bells which clustered in such luxuriant profusion around the cottage, came
                  gratefully and with refreshing power to her weary, languid frame. She drew a long,
                  deep breath; her eye brightened with pleasure as it rested upon the landscape, so
                  familiar yet always presenting for her admiration something before unobserved.
               
               With an accelerated step she walked along the side of the "bonnie burnie" we have
                  before observed, taking the path opposite the one leading to the Manor. A short
                  distance from the cottage the bed of the stream became rocky and irregular, so
                  that it was diversified by a succession of miniature cascades. The water above was
                  so clear that the little fishes could be seen darting about their silver sides
                  gleaming in the sunlight.
               The cascades this evening were beautiful in their sparkling freshness to the eyes
                  of Zenaida, so long intent upon her books. The waters danced, and flashed with
                  dazzling brilliance in the rays of the evening sun; the tiny wavelets were crested
                  with snow-white foam, from fretting against the jagged edges of the rocks. A few
                  steps farther, and quiet again reigned, for here the waters flowed with calm
                  unrippled surface, save where they eddied in a dark pool, under shelter of the
                  overhanging branches of a huge old sycamore.
               Zenaida paused here awhile to watch the gambols of Beppo, who plunged into the
                  deepest place, then emerged in a dripping condition, and giving himself a hearty
                  shake, appeared anxious to bestow some caresses on his mistress, who declined the
                  intended honor as gently as possible, for fear of wounding the sensitive feelings
                  of her wet, affectionate playmate.
               She then turned into a grassy lane, searching, as she went, the fence-corners, for
                  any stray wild-flowers that might be nestling there; but the spring violets,
                  anemones, and blue forget-me-nots no longer reared their delicate heads. The lane
                  on each side was adorned with a hedge of elder, which flower, common as it is and
                  despised by many, Zenaida could not sufficiently admire. She now gathered some of
                  its rich blooms, which contrasted prettily with the clusters of bright
                  rose-colored flowers which she had culled before; at first she decided that the
                  flower in full bloom was prettiest, as it looked like a rich lace-work; then
                  spying a cluster of the buds not quite open, she awarded to them the palm of
                  superior loveliness, as they so nearly resembled a network of pearls. But having
                  now her hands full, she was content to examine the specimens already collected,
                  and to suffer those ungathered to remain until some other time.
               This road led to Grove Church, where Zenaida soon arrived. As its name indicated,
                  the church was situated in the midst of a beautiful grove. It was a pretty, modest
                  building, with no pretension to architectural display. The yard was inclosed with
                  a neat fence, the grass fresh and luxuriant; one portion of it was devoted to the
                  dead, who in this calm, secluded spot, slept undisturbed after the fitful fever of
                  life. There were not many inhabitants in this small city of the silent; but even
                  here some, were neglected or forgotten, while others were watched over by tender,
                  loving, eyes, and tended by kind hands. The branches of the graceful
                  weeping-willow hung over some, swaying with every passing breeze; roses glowed
                  brightly, shedding a mocking hue of life around the resting-place of death. Ivy
                  grew over the tombs of others, clinging and twining its tendrils closely, as the
                  hearts of the living still clung to the cold forms resting beneath, flourishing
                  more greenly around decay.
               To Zenaida this place was a favorite resort; for she was free from all
                  superstitious fears in connection with it, and its sad, tender beauty charmed her
                  pensive heart. She now seated herself
                  under one of the willows, and commenced assorting her flowers; but the frail
                  things were already withered and drooping, like the delicate human buds that pine
                  and fade when torn from the parent stem. So Zenaida twined them into a garland,
                  which she placed upon the grave Of a young girl, of whose purity the white
                  blossoms were a fit emblem, whose early death was typified by the wilted buds
                  which so lately were rejoicing in loveliness beneath the genial influences of the
                  dews and sunshine of heaven.
               She had arranged her garland, and was gazing with sad heart upon a mound where no
                  flowers bloomed, when she perceived that she was not the only one who had been
                  lured thither by the quiet stillness of the spot.
               An elderly gentleman of benign aspect, whose prematurely silvered hair gave an air
                  of venerableness to his still erect and vigorous frame, had been seated at a
                  little distance. He had noticed Zenaida when she first made her appearance; had
                  laid aside the book with which he had been occupied before she came, and had been
                  watching her, so intent upon her occupation that she was not aware of his presence
                  until the rustling of his footsteps announced his approach. As he came forward
                  Zenaida started, and turned as if to go; but a glance at his face reassured her,
                  and she resumed her seat, her curiosity being somewhat excited to ascertain who he
                  was; for she saw that he was to her a stranger.
               He bowed in a pleasant, kindly manner; said he hoped he had not startled her by
                  his unannounced and unlooked-for appearing. "I am the newly-elected minister of
                  this pretty church, and truly may I say, 'My lot is cast in a pleasant place, in
                  the green pastures, and beside the still waters.' My name is Thornley."
               Upon receiving this gratuitous piece of information, Zenaida took a very
                  deliberate survey of Mr. Thornley, scrutinizing his appearance as if to ascertain
                  thereby "what manner of man" he was, recollecting her theory of attraction and
                  repulsion, and hoping he might stand the test of her intuitive perception.
               He observed her as closely, and smiled as he marked the look she cast upon him, at
                  first full of mistrust and suspicion, but gradually giving place to a more
                  benignant expression, until her face assumed its natural and habitual sweetness.
                  Reassured by this favorable result, Mr. Thornley ventured to ask some
                  questions.
               "My child," said he, "have you a friend or relative in this sweet burial-ground?
                  It is one of the most beautiful places I ever saw; almost enough to make one in
                  love with death to look upon it."
               "No," she replied, "I have no kindred dust mingling with this soil. My mother is
                  dead, but she is buried far away, and I have not even the mournful consolation of
                  tending her grave."
               As she spoke, her eyes filled with tears and her voice quivered with emotion. A
                  look of intense sadness spread over her face, which appealed at once to the
                  ever-active sympathies and kindly heart of the good minister, who from the first
                  had been interested by her appearance and occupation.
               "My poor child," he exclaimed, "I indeed pity one who, at your tender age, is deprived of the watchful
                  guardianship of a mother's love."
               "I am not deprived of it," said Zenaida. "My mother is one of God's holy angels,
                  and she watches over me from heaven. She often comes in dreams, and with loving
                  words tells me of her bright home."
               Mr. Thornley gazed at her inquisitively; but she spoke in deep earnestness, and he
                  felt convinced that she implicitly believed in the reality of her angel-mother's
                  ministrations.
               "That belief, my child," he replied, "is a most happy one. But you have not yet
                  told me your name or place of residence; I suppose you are one of my flock."
               "My name," she responded, "is Zenaida Morris, and I live at Willowbrook Cottage,
                  about a mile from here, up the burn-side."
               "Zenaida," repeated Mr. Thornley; "that is a strange name. Where did you get it? I
                  never heard it before."
               "I am the Zenaida dove," she replied, "named from the plaintive mournfulness of my
                  cry when I was an infant. My mother called me so in sport at first, but Zenaida
                  was finally adopted as my name."
               "Well, Zenaida," said Mr. Thornley, "I hope we will be good friends. You must come
                  to the Parsonage and see Mrs. Thornley and the children."
               "I will," replied Zenaida. "But it is getting late, and I must bid you good
                  evening, as I have no company home but my dog."
               She bowed, and, calling Beppo, was soon out of sight behind a curve in the winding
                  lane.
               "This Mr. Thornley," she said, "I think I shall like. He has a pleasant
                  countenance, and is more genial in his manners than some ministers I have seen,
                  who are positively forbidding on account of their long-facedness and the doleful
                  tenor of their conversation. The sun of righteousness radiates both light and
                  warmth, vitalizing the dormant seeds of truth and goodness which are implanted in
                  our hearts causing them to grow and blossom, beautifying the otherwise barren
                  wilderness of life. Would that more of the followers of their great Leader would
                  emulate the example given them; but instead of bringing to light and life the
                  principles of good, many are as moral upas-trees, under whose deadly shadow no
                  good can flourish."
               With these thoughts she arrived at home, where she related to her father and Helen
                  her accidental meeting with Mr. Thornley, and her favorable first impression in
                  regard to him.
               "Helen," she said, "we must call at the Parsonage. Will you go?"
               "Certainly," replied Helen; "with the greatest pleasure."
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               A SHORT time after this, the relatives, of whom Mrs. Cabell had spoken, arrived,
                  bringing with them a young gentleman, who, having heard of Miss Annie and her
                  broad acres, wished to satisfy himself of the truth of these reports.
               As he came stamped with the impress of fashion's seal, (which often renders
                  current the counterfeit instead of the
                  genuine coin with those who judge superficially from outward appearance only, and
                  do not sound to see if it has the ring of the true metal,) Miss Annie received him
                  graciously, and her lip, which was curled with contempt for many, was wreathed
                  with smiles for him.
               But in introducing Mr. Lawrence Ridgely, we have lost sight of the niece and
                  nephew of Mrs. Cabell, Miss Florida Bernard and her brother Arthur.
               Miss Bernard, who was the senior of her cousin Annie by several years, was tall
                  and elegant in person, lofty in mien. Her hair was dark as starless midnight, her
                  eyes of the same ebon hue, her teeth of unsurpassed whiteness. Her dress was as
                  faultless as the art of the most skillful modiste, combined with her own exquisite taste, could make it. She
                  was suave in her manners to all, as one conscious of her own high
                  position, not fearing to be contaminated if she condescended to stoop to those
                  occupying a station less lofty. Her mind, cultivated and appreciative to a high
                  degree, was quick to discern in others thoughts and feelings accordant with her
                  own. Pride of birth, of station, was her inheritance, and had been strengthened
                  and fostered by her education and associations.
               Her brother Arthur was yet a student preparing for the practice of the law, the
                  profession of his selection. He was a generous, impulsive, high-spirited youth,
                  not endowed with talents of the highest order, but still above mediocrity; not
                  destined to carve his name indelibly upon the age, but capable and determined to
                  become an honorable and useful member of society.
               In the room of Miss Annie, which is situated in the second story, overlooking the
                  avenue, we will find that young lady and Miss Bernard on the morning after the
                  advent of the latter.
               Both of the young ladies are seated in large easy chairs; that of Miss Bernard
                  being placed by the open window, from which she can see the beautiful lawn and the
                  luxuriant fields beyond, one a meadow set with clover, now in full bloom. Through
                  them ran the labyrinthine mazes of the stream, its windings marked by the trees
                  which fringed its borders, through which Miss Bernard caught occasional glimpses
                  of the water, shining like molten silver in the morning sunlight. A herd of fine
                  cows pastured here, and, scattered about in the clover, or drinking in the
                  streamlet, heightened the picturesque beauty of the scene. The huge old oaks waved
                  their branches and rustled their leaves against the window; the breeze came in,
                  laden with the perfume of the clover-blooms, and, playing coquettishly around the
                  stately form of Florida, brought a deeper color to her cheek and brighter lustre
                  to her large dark eyes.
               "What a lovely view you have from your window here, Cousin Annie!" she at last
                  exclaimed. "What a contrast it presents to the view from my window in the city,
                  from which I so lately gazed as the captive from his prison window, sighing that I
                  was pent up, with walls on every side! Our little grass-plats, which are small at
                  best, are but poor substitutes for this extensive lawn, with its wide-spreading
                  oaks, and these undulating fields with their promises of plenty."
               "Yes," replied Miss Annie, indolently, "I suppose it must be pretty, as every one
                  thinks so; but give me the gayeties of the city, the throng of richly-dressed
                  people, the bustle and animation, the
                  balls, parties, concerts, and fashionable acquaintances. To be immured in this
                  dull country place, where you see nothing but trees and grass, and hear nothing
                  but the song of birds, the lowing of cows, and the tinkling of sheep-bells; where
                  we go only to the stupid meetings at Grove Church, while others are enjoying the
                  pleasures of life in the city, or at different watering-places, is a thraldom to
                  which I submit with little patience. But mother is so wedded to this place; she
                  thinks it such fine amusement to look at lambs, pigs, ducks, and turkeys; she is
                  so interested in making premium butter and cheese, in superintending the farm
                  operations generally—that I despair of ever being able to persuade her to leave
                  this odious place and go to the city."
               "Aunt Cabell is right," replied Florida; "there is more genuine pleasure in these
                  homely scenes and occupations than in the gay pleasures for which you long, the
                  pictures of which, in anticipation, dazzle you with their brilliant coloring. I
                  have drunk deeply of all these so-called fountains of pleasure, and I can assure
                  you that, though the cup when first tasted is sweet, the dregs are bitter. The
                  mind and, heart, wearied with the incessant whirling of the maelstrom of society,
                  turn with relief to scenes like these, where, if the pleasures are less exciting,
                  they leave behind a more durable and agreeable impression. But let us waive this
                  discussion for the present. Come, cousin mine, give me some information concerning
                  the neighbors I am likely to meet during my sojourn at Cabell Manor."
               "The task you impose is not very difficult," replied Annie. "There are the
                  Bainbridges, old acquaintances of mother's, who are our nearest neighbors. They
                  have recently purchased Maplehurst, a beautiful estate near us. They will
                  certainly call on you. Then, too, the village is only a few miles distant, and
                  there are several presentable families there, and some of the most eligible
                  country beaux—Elliston Hunter, Donald Hamilton, Percy Martin, and sundry others;
                  but they will all be shy of you, a city belle, whose proud pre-eminence they will
                  not dare to question."
               "But," said Florida, "have you no others worthy of being placed on our list? Your
                  neighborhood must be very sparsely settled."
               "There is a new minister just installed at the Grove Parsonage; but I know nothing
                  of him or his family, and I do not believe I will call on them, as I have an
                  inveterate antipathy to ministers' wives and children, who are always worse than
                  the children of any other class of men."
               "That is curious doctrine, Annie," laughed Florida, amused at the earnestness of
                  her cousin. "Upon what grounds do you found your belief?"
               "It is a self-evident proposition," replied Annie.
               Just then Mrs. Cabell entered.
               "Aunt," said Florida, "Annie has been giving me a list of your neighbors; and I am
                  really surprised to hear that there is only one family near you which you claim
                  friendship, the Bainbridges."
               "Annie forgot the Morris family," replied Mrs. Cabell.
               "I never dreamed of naming them, mamma," replied Miss Annie, with the old look of
                  scorn. "They are not in our sphere, and in my opinion are far from being desirable
                  acquaintances."
               
               "I am grieved to hear you speak in this unkind manner, my daughter," said Mrs.
                  Cabell; "for you are guilty of gross injustice to a gentleman who is in every
                  respect meritorious and above reproach, and to his daughters, who are such that
                  any parent might be proud of them. The beauty and grace of Helen, the penetrating
                  intelligence and keen susceptibility of Zenaida, commend them to the kind
                  consideration of every one who is capable of appreciating their excellence."
               "Your advocacy of their cause, Aunt Cabell," said Florida, "has already enlisted
                  me in their favor, and I hope soon to become acquainted with these young ladies
                  who have the power to enlist you as their champion, and to call forth such
                  encomiums from you, who have a holy horror of idle words."
               "Your curiosity shall be gratified," replied Aunt Cabell, smiling, "for they are
                  our nearest neighbors; but the girls are young, and shrink from all my advances so
                  sensitively that I scarcely know what plan to adopt to overcome their pride, for
                  such it is. Their father, though of good family and stainless character, is poor,
                  and the trial of going among those who despise them because not decked in all the
                  paraphernalia of wealth, is too severe for the sensitive, undisciplined hearts of
                  Helen and Zenaida; so they prefer to isolate themselves—to draw upon their own
                  resources for amusement."
               "This account of them but increases my interest," said Florida. "But how shall I
                  proceed? Shall I take these otherwise inaccessible damsels by storm in their own
                  castle, or wait till, as in etiquette bound, they call upon me?"
               "Annie wounded the feelings of the youngest, Zenaida, the last time she was here,
                  and I fear it will be long ere she comes again; but Helen will call. Annie," she
                  said, turning to her daughter authoritatively, "you must give Florida a party, and
                  remember, upon pain of my serious displeasure, that the Morris girls are not to be
                  omitted."
               So saying, she left the room. Annie knew that it would be useless to remonstrate,
                  for her mother's fiat had gone forth, and when the old lady was roused, as on the
                  present occasion, she knew her decrees to be immutable as those of the Medes and
                  Persians.
               "How provoking!" she exclaimed, as soon as the rustle of her mother dress could no
                  longer be heard. "Mother's head is full of kinks and crotchets. She is always
                  doing the things she ought not to do; but I am compelled to submit," she said,
                  angrily biting her lips and knitting her brows.
               "What a pity!" was Florida's mental comment, "that the mother should so far excel
                  her daughter in all noble qualities. Poor Annie! this uncontrolled pride and anger
                  of hers will cost her some severe trials yet."
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               THE next Sabbath being a fine, clear day, the Cabells, accompanied by Miss
                  Bernard, and Arthur, and Mr. Ridgely, made their appearance at Grove Church, to
                  wait upon the ministry of Mr. Thornley.
               Miss Annie was willing to undergo the infliction of the "stupid meeting" for the
                  sake of appearing before the admiring eyes of the country-folk escorted by a
                  cavalier so elegant, so unexceptionable
                  in dress, manner's and appearance, as Mr. Ridgely. Their entrance created quite a
                  stir in this quiet place, for all had heard of the arrival of the strangers, and
                  were anxious to obtain a glimpse of them.
               "Hem!" said Miss Annie, as she caught the backward glances of many which were cast
                  upon their party; "I think it probable that the services of a surgeon will be
                  called into requisition to set the neck-bones of some of these people, dislocated
                  by their sudden motions in turning to look at us."
               The congregation had scarcely subsided into its former quiet, when a rustle of
                  silks announced a new arrival. This time it was the Bainbridge family, consisting
                  of the father and mother, one son, and three daughters. The Misses Beatrice and
                  Alice were fine-looking girls. Alice, the younger of the two, was fair and pretty,
                  modest and gentle in appearance, with little force of character; Beatrice's
                  complexion was fair also, but her hair and eyes, were dark: she was dressed very
                  elaborately, and looked as if she had been rehearsing attitudes for the sake of
                  producing a sensation. The other daughter was a charming little fairy of four
                  summers.
               The young gentleman, Mr. Hamilton Bainbridge, deserved more than passing notice.
                  He entered the lowly church with a sublime air, as if conscious that he was
                  conferring the most inestimable of all blessings upon the poor benighted denizens
                  of that out-of-the-world place, by permitting them to behold the light of his
                  countenance—the said countenance embellished with an incipient mustache, which he
                  apparently regarded with great affection, as he stroked it often with tender care.
                  His hair was long, flowing ing down upon his shoulders in ringlets, which he
                  thought were the perfect model of grace and beauty. His hands, which were small,
                  and soft and white as a lady's, were inclosed in gloves so tight that he could
                  with difficulty grasp the little gold-headed cane which he carried. His pantaloons
                  were so tight that he must have followed a fashion which prevailed centuries ago,
                  that of having garments sewed up after they were put on. Lastly, his feet, which
                  were naturally small, were encased in the most exquisite little gaiters, so tight
                  that the pain must have been excruciating; but Hamilton would have suffered
                  martyrdom for the sake of that which he considered genteel and elegant.
               As he passed down the aisle, he glanced round with an expression of pity mingled
                  with contempt for these good people whom he denominated "outsiders."
               This expression change as soon as his eye fell upon Mrs. Cabell's party. The
                  elegance of Miss Bernard at once arrested his attention, and the most rigid
                  scrutiny of her dress failed to detect the slightest deviation from the
                  established rules of his all-potent lawgiver, Fashion. Once, as he turned his eyes
                  from Miss Bernard, the beautiful face of Helen Morris arrested them.
               "What a deucedly pretty girl that is!" he said mentally. "I wonder who she is?
                  Nobody, though, I presume, for there is no style about her dress. It is shockingly
                  simple. What horrid taste some people have! That girl by her would be pretty if
                  she had a little more life about her; her eyes are magnificent. But that tall lady
                  is the one for me. It is evident that she has not rusticated long enough to rub
                  the polish of the city off."
               
               With this reflection, he turned from the contemplation of Helen and Zenaida, as if
                  he thought he was wasting time, and renewed his observation of Florida, who sat
                  proudly unconscious, or if conscious, wholly indifferent to his admiring gaze.
                  Occasionally he bestowed a glance upon Mr. Thornley, as if to say that he thought
                  his performances decidedly tedious.
               "Going to church," he said, "would bore him to death, if it were not for the
                  pretty girls whom he saw there."
               This fastidious youth had traveled extensively in Europe—had lounged on the
                  Boulevards of Paris—had smoked a meerschaum in Germany—had floated over the
                  moonlit waves of the Adriatic in a gondola—had drunk wine in France and beer in
                  England—had climbed the Alps, and tried to read "Childe Harold", on
                  the Rhine. From these travels he returned with a few phrases of bad French and
                  worse German, some packages of kid gloves and perfumery, and the delicate mustache
                  of which we have spoken—with a great reverence for king's, lords, and ladies, and
                  a most supreme contempt for the vulgar republicanism of his own country.
                  Everything American he pronounced "plebeian," and no place in his own land did he
                  think worthy of being looked upon by his eyes, which had beheld the wonders of
                  aristocratic Europe.
               The sermon of Mr. Thornley was eloquent and impressive. He was endowed, in an
                  eminent degree, with the gift of language, the words flowing from his lips without
                  apparent effort. His theme, "The love of God manifest in redemption," was
                  calculated to call forth the devotional emotions of the soul, and he was so
                  absorbed in this theme, so earnest and full of deep feeling, that many said "It is
                  good for us to be here."
               Zenaida's favorable impression in regard to him was strengthened and indorsed by
                  the approbation of her father and many others.
               After the services were concluded, the people assembled in the yard to exchange
                  greetings and indulge in friendly conversation. Some strolled off into the corner
                  appropriated to the dead, who were dearer to them than any living.
               The Cabells and Bainbridges met, and Mr. and Miss Bernard and Mr. Ridgely were
                  duly presented to the family from Maplehurst. Mr. Hamilton Bainbridge immediately
                  assumed his most fascinating manner, bowing to Florida with a grace and dexterity
                  which could only have been acquired by long practice, flattering himself that the
                  heart of Miss Bernard could not possibly be proof against his many attractions;
                  but she, who in her experience of city life had seen many similar specimens,
                  honored him with slight and passing notice.
               "Aunt," she said, turning to Mrs. Cabell, "I have been thinking of your favorites,
                  the Morrises, and wish you to point them out to me."
               Helen and Zenaida were passing through the gate with their father, homeward bound.
                  Mrs. Cabell called them back, and they reluctantly obeyed the summons.
               "I wonder," said Zenaida, with an expression of dissatisfaction, "why Mrs. Cabell,
                  surrounded as she is by her friends and relatives, has chosen to bring us forward.
                  I am sure I would rather go home than be compelled to run the gauntlet of all
                  those curious eyes."
               
               But the lady greeted them most cordially. "My dears," said she, "I have called you
                  back to give you an introduction to my niece, with whom, I am confident, you will
                  be much pleased."
               Florida was all affability—expressed much pleasure at seeing them of whom she had
                  heard Aunt Cabell speak so favorably.
               "You must call on Florida," said Mrs. Cabell; "I desire that you become friends.
                  Will you not come?"
               Helen replied affirmatively. Zenaida said nothing; but her looks were more
                  eloquent than words. She glanced at Miss Annie, who had acknowledged their
                  presence by a slight bow, colored at the recollection of her last visit, then
                  drawing herself up to her full height, compressed her lips with unusual
                  firmness.
               As they walked home, she was eloquent in praise of the sermon of Mr. Thornley; the
                  beauty and elegance of Miss Bernard. Helen was silent; for while Zenaida had been
                  bestowing her regards on Florida, Helen had caught a glimpse of Arthur, who was
                  looking intently at herself with undisguised admiration.
               "Could he be Miss Bernard's brother?" she asked herself. "There is a striking
                  resemblance between them. What beautiful, eloquent black eyes he has! I wonder
                  what he thought of me?"
               Such was the tenor of Helen's thoughts, and the blush which dyed her cheek as she,
                  musing, said, "I wonder what he thought of me!" testified that the solution of her
                  query was satisfactory.
               "Honey," said Aunt Rebecca to Zenaida, after she had reached home, "who war that
                  young man wid all them long curls danglin' round his face, an' that fuzz on his
                  upper' lip, that looked fur all the world like cat hars? If I were his mammy, I'd
                  eider put petticoats on him, or else cut off his har; fur he looks jist like a
                  doll-baby. I vow to goodness! I never seed sich a lookin' whipper-snapper in all
                  my born days. Hope he won't make a pint a goin' to our meetin' always, fur he
                  'stracts my 'tention from the preachin'. Who was it, chile?"
               "I believe it was young Mr. Bainbridge," replied Zenaida. "He came with the
                  family."
               "Now, honey, mind me," said mammy, "don't you go an' fall in love wid that
                  painted-faced, long-hared young man."
               "Never fear, mammy, I am perfectly safe," replied Zenaida.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               HELEN, according to promise, called upon Miss Bernard, who received her with the
                  same graciousness of manner which had distinguished her bearing on the occasion of
                  their first meeting. Florida was charmed with the modest beauty and sweet
                  diffidence of Helen, so different from the assurance and independence of many
                  young ladies of her age.
               Arthur, from his seat under one of the trees, had watched the approach of Helen.
                  He recognized her immediately, for her image was so forcibly impressed upon his
                  memory that he had no doubt as to her identity. He waited until she had entered the house, and then going in as if
                  by accident through the back door, he availed himself of the first favorable
                  opportunity to present himself before his sister. He started with assumed alarm on
                  beholding Helen, and turned as if to leave the room, very fearful that his sister
                  would permit him to do so without noticing his entrance; but she called him, and
                  gave the much-desired introduction to Helen.
               The fair girl blushed as she met the gaze of those beautiful eyes, bent upon her
                  with the same look of admiration which she had seen in them at the church. Arthur
                  thought the blush an additional charm, and wished that he could devise some plan
                  to call it forth again; but Helen had now recovered her equanimity, and continued
                  her conversation with his sister, unembarrassed by his presence.
               Arthur ventured a few remarks, to which she replied with graceful sweetness; then,
                  though he would willingly have lingered indefinitely within sound of her voice, he
                  rose, and telling Florida that he was going on a voyage of discovery, bowed and
                  left the room, inwardly congratulating himself upon his unsuspected stratagem.
               Helen soon after left, and had proceeded homeward as far as the Lodge, when,
                  hearing approaching footsteps, she turned hastily and beheld Arthur Bernard, who
                  had loitered about the gate, looking for her coming, and now followed her. He
                  quickened his pace when he saw that she had discovered him, and coming up to her,
                  said—
               "Pardon me, Miss Morris; I hope I have not alarmed you by my sudden appearance. My
                  apology must be that I saw you passing unattended, and thought I would offer my
                  services vices as your escort home, if you would be so kind as to allow me the
                  privilege."
               "I am much obliged to you," replied Helen; "but you need not have troubled
                  yourself on my account. I am so accustomed to this path, so perfectly familiar
                  with every tree, bush, and rock along its course, that I do not fear to traverse
                  it at any hour."
               "I assure you, Miss Morris," he replied eagerly, "I take no trouble, but, on the
                  contrary, you afford me the greatest pleasure by allowing me to accompany
                  you."
               Helen thought the distance had never seemed so short, and she felt it very
                  delightful to be assisted by careful hands over the little unevennesses of the
                  ground, over which, on ordinary occasions, she had bounded without noticing
                  them.
               Arthur praised the beauties of the scenery, and listened with the most deferential
                  attention to every word that fell from the rosy lips of Helen, and when they came
                  to the cottage, his raptures did not subside.
               "What an exquisite little bower!" he exclaimed. "It looks as if it might be the
                  abode of Flora or the Fairy Queen Titania. Your home, Miss Morris, is a casket,
                  fit to enshrine so beautiful a gem. Pardon me," he continued; "the thought came
                  into my mind, and I expressed it without thinking that we were acquaintances of
                  only a few hours."
               "Why is it," said Helen, between a smile and a frown, "that all gentlemen are
                  flatterers?"
               "Truth," he replied, "when spoken to you, sounds like the exaggerations of
                  flattery, but does not seem so to those who speak it. You must accustom yourself
                  to judge us not as flatterers, for all
                  men will address you in language which may seem too extravagant for truth."
               "Worse and worse," laughed Helen. "But here we are at home, and after your long
                  walk on my behalf, I cannot permit you to return without resting. Come, I will
                  admit you into the charmed circle of the fairy queen's domains," she said, as she
                  held the gate open.
               Arthur entered with evident satisfaction. "I was born under a propitious star," he
                  said to himself, as he walked by the side of Helen to the house.
               Zenaida, who sat by the window reading, threw down her book when she heard the
                  sound of the closing gate, and ran to meet Helen, anxious to ascertain the result
                  of her visit; but she had advanced but a few steps when she perceived the
                  gentleman who was with her. She paused, irresolute whether to advance or retreat,
                  and compromised the matter by standing still. Helen presented her sister Zenaida
                  to Mr. Bernard, and the trio entered the house, where Helen left Zenaida to
                  entertain Arthur, while she retired to adjust her dress and smooth the glossy
                  bands of jetty hair which adorned her pretty head.
               Arthur felt more constrained, in the presence of this dreamy-eyed girl, than he
                  had ever felt before within his memory, and for once his ready flow of, words
                  failed him. He glanced at the figure before him, but Zenaida was not disposed to
                  break the ice of conversation, and in this emergency Arthur picked up the book
                  which she had been reading, and seeing that it was a copy of Horace, marked in
                  many places to designate favorite passages, he turned to the blank leaf to
                  ascertain the name of the owner, expecting to see that of Helen's father; but
                  there he saw "Zenaida Morris," written in a hand unsurpassed in elegance and
                  beauty of execution.
               "So," said he, mentally apostrophizing the young girl, "your pretty eyes, instead
                  of being employed with ribbons, laces, and finery in general, as is the case with
                  many who are older, and ought to be wiser, are poring over this old book of a dead
                  language, and, by the marked passages, I may infer that it is a labor of love, and
                  not a forced task. I wonder what other authors this little lady affects. I will
                  see." So saying, he looked over the collection on the table.
               "Shakspeare, Spencer, Byron, Scott, Shelley, Keats, Hood, Tasso, Goethe, Jean
                  Paul, and others too numerous to mention," ejaculated Arthur; "I believe I will
                  venture to ask her some questions, and see if she reads understandingly;" but just
                  as he formed this determination, Helen appeared, and Zenaida glided from the
                  room.
               "Does your sister read all these books?" he inquired. "I find her name in most of
                  them. What beautiful writing!" he exclaimed, as he again opened one of the
                  books.
               "Yes," replied Helen, "she reads all these, and many more. The most of these are
                  only her poets, and she reads all kinds of books. That, too," she said, taking the
                  book from his hand, "is her writing, but not half as well done as some specimens I
                  have. Ah! here is a copy of verses written by her. See, it is much more
                  beautiful."
               Arthur examined the paper, and here the subject dropped; for they found many
                  things, of greater interest to themselves, to discuss.
               Arthur was so well pleased with this visit, that as he walked back to the Manor he
                  resolved to go again, and to improve the
                  acquaintance which had commenced so pleasantly.
               "Why, brother," exclaimed Florida, as he entered the room where she sat, "where
                  have you been? Did you lose your way on this 'voyage of discovery?' You had better
                  take a guide next time."
               "I will," he replied aloud; then added to himself, "I did not lose my way, but I
                  lost my heart, which I will not regret, if I can win one in return."
               
               "Well, sis," said Helen, "what do you think of Mr. Bernard?"
               "I think," replied Zenaida, "that he was very much absorbed in the contemplation
                  of my books; so much so, indeed, that he did not honor me with a remark, by which
                  I might be enabled to judge of his conversational abilities. He is handsome
                  enough, and I suppose he can talk when he feels so disposed."
               "Yes," said Helen, "he can talk beautifully; but you are so quiet, so abstracted.
                  That must be the reason why he conversed none with you."
               "That may be," replied Zenaida; "but, Helen, allow me to ask you a question—what
                  do you think of Mr. Bernard?"
               Helen blushed, and her cheeks were, still glowing, her eyes sparkling with more
                  than their wonted brilliance, when her father returned.
               "Why, daughter!" he exclaimed, "what have you been doing to make you look so
                  bright?"
               "I will volunteer to give an explanation," said Zenaida, glancing mischievously at
                  Helen. "She went to Cabell Manor this evening, and Mr. Bernard, a fine-looking
                  young gentleman, was so pleased with her that he followed her home; and it is
                  doubtless the remembrance of some of his pretty speeches that makes her look so
                  blooming."
               "Nonsense, sis," said Helen, impatiently; "are you not ashamed to talk so?"
               But the blush grew deeper, and this silent witness, together with her manifest
                  vexation, convinced Mr. Morris that Zenaida was right in her conjecture; so he
                  patted Helen on the head encouragingly, saying—
               "Tell us what the young chap said, Helen; Zenaida and I would like to know."
               But Helen was in no mood for jesting then, and at her own expense too. She did not
                  wish her father to think that this young stranger could wield any power over her;
                  so, upon some slight pretext, she left the room, hoping that the current of
                  conversation might soon drift into some other channel.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               ARTHUR, thinking that he had succeeded in making a favorable impression upon Helen
                  during his first visit, determined that it should not be effaced if he could
                  prevent it; so after several days had elapsed, he again bent his steps in the
                  direction of Willowbrook Cottage.
               Helen and Zenaida were sitting on a rustic bench, which old Uncle Harry had made
                  of twisted grape-vines, occupied with some light needle-work—at least Helen was;
                  but Zenaida naida had laid hers aside,
                  and was now, twining some red and white buds in Helen's hair. She had just
                  arranged them to her satisfaction, when she looked upland saw Arthur at the
                  gate.
               "Oh, Helen!" she cried, "I have 'decked your hair with these roses rare' in good
                  time, for there is Mr. Bernard. I know he cannot fail to admire the effect of
                  these bright flowers, relieved against the dark background of your hair."
               Arthur approached and having saluted the ladies, proposed that they should take a
                  stroll along some of the pleasant wood-paths which abounded in the vicinity of the
                  Cottage.
               The plan met with their approbation, and, forth they started Zenaida taking the
                  precaution to call Beppo to be her companion; for she knew that she could not
                  expect to be entertained by Mr. Bernard or her sister.
               "Helen," she said, as she came to a point from which two paths diverged, "both of
                  these lead to the 'Fairies' Looking-Glass.' I will meet you there."
               She was soon out of sight; but as Helen and Arthur more leisurely followed the
                  windings of the other path, they occasionally heard the joyful bark of Beppo, or
                  the sweet sound of Zenaida's voice, as she warbled some old-time ballad.
               We will not repeat the conversation of these two young persons; for they were not
                  aware that they had listeners, and their words were intended only for each other's
                  ears. When they reached the spot appointed as a place of rendez-vous, they found
                  Zenaida already there, reclining on a mossy bank sprinkled with flowers, and
                  bending over to smooth her disheveled tresses, which were mirrored faithfully in
                  the clear depths of the Fairies' Looking-Glass, as Zenaida had named the pretty
                  place.
               "I am afraid, Miss Zenaida," said Arthur, "that you will share the unhappy fate of
                  Narcissus, if you gaze much longer at your own reflected loveliness."
               She sprang up at the sound of his voice, exclaiming—"I wonder why I did not think
                  of that before! This must have been the very place, or at least it was one just
                  like it, where Narcissus fled from the pursuing Echo—where he languished and died;
                  for the voice of the nymph still haunts these woods, and this is the fountain by
                  which he reclined."
               The place where they sat was a rocky ledge upon the verge of the water, which
                  above them flowed through a narrow opening between two rocks. It here widened out,
                  forming a pool, which was clear as crystal,—in which were seen glimpses of the
                  blue sky, so far above; over which the bushes hung so lovingly that their long
                  branches were laved by the pure water.
               Beppo stood quietly by Zenaida for a short time, but at last he was about to
                  plunge into the water, when a squirrel hopped from a tree, close beside him and
                  diverted his attention, much to the relief of his mistress.
               "I am glad he is gone," she said; "for the fairies would have punished him if he
                  had broken the smooth surface of their mirror."
               "If, as you say, this is the fountain where Narcissus perished," said Arthur, "you
                  must allow me to change the name by which you designate it. You must call it
                  Diana's Mirror."
               "I did not think of this fable when I named it," replied Zenaida, "or I would certainly have chosen the name
                  you recommend."
               
               The invitations to the party at Cabell Manor had been distributed, and Miss Annie,
                  contrary to her wish, had been compelled to include Helen and Zenaida among the
                  invited ones. Helen was in a flutter of delight at the thought of going, but
                  Zenaida said "She did not wish to go; she would not enjoy herself if she did, and
                  would rather be at home."
               Helen was anxious to look her prettiest, for a reason she would not have owned to
                  herself; and Zenaida busied herself about the arrangement of her dress with a zeal
                  quite foreign to her usual indifference on the subject, ambitious that Helen
                  should appear so that she would be free from all painful embarrassment on account
                  of contrast, presented by her attire, when compared with that of others.
               The important day at last arrived, and though to the excited mind of Helen it
                  appeared long as half a dozen ordinary days, it at last approached its finality,
                  and she began the important ceremony of robing for the festival with as much
                  solicitude as if she were to appear at a Tuileries' ball. Her dress was a simple
                  white muslin, beautifully clear, but unadorned, save by a fall of rich lace. A
                  beautiful necklace of pearls, which had been her mother's, was her only ornament.
                  Her hair, in the hands of Zenaida, was arranged with simple elegance, and,
                  decorated with the stars of the milk-white fragrant jessamine—in her hand she held
                  a bouquet, arranged by the same skillful fingers, with a perception of the
                  harmonious blending of colors, which was not an acquired art but an innate
                  gift.
               When the last touches had been given, Helen came down stairs, followed by Zenaida
                  in whose eyes she was more beautiful than Armida or Grecian Helen. Mr. Morris
                  bestowed upon her a look of affectionate pride, and together they departed for the
                  Manor, leaving Zenaida, to the companionship of silence and her own thoughts, or
                  that of black mammy, as she liked best.
               When they reached the Lodge, and the house was presented to view, Helen could not
                  repress an exclamation of delight. The night was very dark, and the whole front of
                  the mansion dazzlingly brilliant. The trees on each side of the avenue were hung
                  with lamps, which sparkled among the leaves, and irradiated the surrounding
                  darkness, giving the whole scene the character of a fairy-land revel.
               As Helen was ushered in by the servant, who conducted her to the ladies'
                  dressing-room, she caught a glimpse of Arthur, who, with several gentlemen, was
                  promenading in the piazza. He was apparently much engrossed, and she passed on,
                  thinking that he had not seen her.
               Mrs. Cabell received her affectionately, asked why Zenaida did not come, and hoped
                  that she might enjoy herself very much. Florida also met her cordially, adjusted
                  her dress, praised the beauty of her flowers, and promised to take her under her
                  own especial protection for the evening, which added greatly to Helen's
                  comfort.
               They soon proceeded to the parlors, where most of the guests were now assembled;
                  but, before they reached their destination, Arthur was by Helen's side. To him
                  Florida resigned her charge, and being soon besieged by applications for
                  introductions in conversing with her new-made acquaintances Helen was for the time
                  forgotten.
               
               Miss Annie was passionately fond of dancing, and a set was soon formed of those
                  who were disposed to indulge in this amusement, while those who preferred a
                  promenade, or quiet talk, strolled out into the yard, or on the piazza, which,
                  together with the court-yard, was hung with lamps. The brilliancy of these was
                  reflected by the spray of the fountain, which, in this magic light, was transmuted
                  into diamonds, pouring in a continuous stream from the urn of the Naiad, as if she
                  had collected all the gems of Sinbad's valley, and was now dispensing them on all
                  sides with the most reckless prodigality.
               "What an exquisitely lovely sight!" sighed Miss Beatrice Bainbridge, who, with her
                  attendant cavalier, Mr. Elliston Hunter, sought this place for a promenade. "Oh,
                  Mr. Hunter," she murmured softly, "did you ever witness a scene more
                  transcendently lovely? When I look upon it I can imagine that I am transported to
                  the realms of fairy, and that Titania, that lovely creation of the poet's dream,
                  is presiding over these revels. Don't you agree with me?" she said, with an
                  appealing look at Mr. Hunter.
               To this rhapsody of this most superlative young lady, the gentleman addressed
                  returned a doubtful sort of assent, as if he felt bound to say something, and did
                  not know exactly what to say. He was not at all imaginative, and could not
                  sympathize with the extravagant expressions of delight to which his dark-eyed
                  companion gave utterance. She, however, was not at all discomposed by his want of
                  proper appreciation; for it was a luxury for her to talk, and she was perfectly
                  satisfied if she occasionally elicited from her listener a monosyllabic
                  response.
               "If we," she said, after a pause, during which she had been contemplating the
                  youthful promenaders, "could but listen, how many words of love would be heard
                  to-night. Look at that handsome couple before us. What gloriously beautiful eyes
                  the gentleman has, and he casts them upon his fair companion as if he would say
                  with the poet— 
                     
                        'Without thy smile the monarch's lot
                        To me were dark and lone,
                        But with it even the lowliest cot
                        Were brighter than his throne.'
                     
                   Do you not think so?" she said, again appealing to her auditor, after
                  delivering these lines in the most impressive manner.
               "Yes," he replied, "he does appear to be very devoted, and, I think, displays good
                  taste; for the young lady is certainly very lovely. The gentleman is Mr. Bernard,
                  but the lady is a stranger to me. Do you know her, Miss Bainbridge?"
               This young lady, seeing that her companion was completely dazzled by the beauty of
                  the girl to whom she had directed his attention, now repented of her rashness, and
                  endeavored to divert him from his observation of her.
               The fair girl who was the subject of this conversation was Helen; her companion,
                  as Mr. Hunter had said, Arthur Bernard. The devotion, which Miss Bainbridge had
                  read so clearly in his eloquent eyes, was expressed also in words, which,
                  whispered in the inexperienced ear of Helen, were echoed by her heart, the chords
                  of which vibrated under the touch of his master-hand. But to this heart-melody which he had awakened, her lips refused
                  to give utterance, though her tell-tale eyes and blushing cheeks would have
                  betrayed her.
               Arthur was spell-bound by her beauty, her sweetness of disposition, her
                  uncontaminated purity; and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth spake. He
                  had just finished the quotation of the following verse— 
                     
                        "There's such a glory on thy cheek,
                        There's such a magic power around thee,
                        That if I would, I could not break
                        The spell with which thine eyes, have bound me,"
                     
                   when Miss Florida appeared. Her attention was at once attracted by seeing
                  them still together.
               "Arthur," she said, with a slight contraction of her brow, "is carrying his
                  flirtation too far. Of course, it can be nothing but a flirtation on his part, and
                  he may come out unscathed; but he will excite hopes in that young girl, which,
                  destined never to be realized, will blight all her future life. I must separate
                  them, for it was I who thoughtlessly threw them together." She walked toward them,
                  exclaiming—
               "Ah, my dear Miss Morris! have I found you at last? I will not permit my selfish
                  brother to monopolize you entirely. It is a shame that you should blush unseen out
                  here; so come, and I will introduce you to some of the beaux, whom we will find in
                  the parlors."
               With this she took, within her own, the unresisting arm of Helen, and moved away,
                  leaving Arthur to bewail his sad fate. He walked restlessly to and fro for a time;
                  then stationed tioned himself o the front, portico, where, through a window, he
                  had a view of the parlors—where he could also survey the whole lawn. The dancers
                  now paused for breath, and the music of the band was succeeded by that of the
                  voice, accompanied by harp, piano, or guitar. Arthur could not have failed to fall
                  under the sweet influences of the place. What fairer scene! The old hall that
                  night 
                     
                        In summer's richest flowers,
                        Decked like enchanted castle, while the light,
                        From many a colored lamp in softest radiance pours.
                        Soft music, drawn by love's own hand from the responsive strings,
                        Is with the faint, hushed murmur of the night-wind blent,
                        And low-breathed voices whisper precious things
                        Which only for the ear of one beloved are meant.
                     
                     
                        Gay, fairy forms in fleecy robes are gliding
                        Under the arches formed by clasping vines,
                        But now an intervening form is hiding
                        The one who fairest 'mong those fair ones
                           shines.
                        And now again she stands within the light
                        That falls so loving on her beauteous head,
                        Crowned with its wreath of starry jasmine white,
                        Fragrant as memory of the early dead.
                     
                  
               
               That star-crowned head, he sees that, and blesses its bright beauty.
               As they entered the parlor, the first object that attracted the attention of Helen
                  was Mr. Hamilton Bainbridge, who was leaning against the window in the most
                  graceful position, evidently thinking that the hearts of the ladies would be
                  carried by storm, merely by the elegance of his appearance, without any exertion
                  on his part.
               
               "Who is that gentleman attitudinizing by the window?" inquired Helen.
               "That," replied Miss Bernard, "is Mr. Bainbridge the Fascinating. Did you not
                  observe him at church the other day? He did you the honor to inquire who you were,
                  and as you seem to be struck with his elegant appearance, I must be mistress of
                  ceremonies and give you an opportunity of adding another captive to your train. He
                  has just returned from Europe, and is the vainest creature in the world; has
                  adopted as his motto the 'veni, vidi, vici' of
                  the old Roman; though, from all I can learn, do not think his success in
                  lady-killing sufficiently great to justify his presumptuous appropriation of this
                  venerable motto. I would like you to cultivate the acquaintance of this conquering
                  hero. I will present him to you the first time an opportunity offers."
               Helen would have declined, but Florida selected a seat near the window by which he
                  stood, and motioned to Helen to take one beside her. As soon as Hamilton became
                  aware of her close proximity, he roused himself from his abstraction, and
                  approached her.
               "Ah, Miss Bernard!" he exclaimed, "I am lifted from darkness into light by your
                  most fortunate return. This room without your presence is like the night, when
                  Luna veils her face behind the passing cloud."
               He delivered this set speech, which he thought the sublimation of compliment, with
                  a lisping accent, and a series of bows, each succeeding one more profound than its
                  predecessor, with which pantomime Florida was much amused.
               "Mr. Bainbridge," said she, "you are disposed to be complimentary plimentary to me
                  to-night at the expense of other fair ladies present, who, I am confident, shine
                  with a brilliancy not inferior to my own. But," she added, turning to Helen,
                  "allow me to present you to my friend, Miss Morris."
               Designated as "friend" by one occupying the unquestioned position of Miss Bernard,
                  Helen immediately assumed importance in the estimation of Mr. Bainbridge. He had
                  been compelled to acknowledge the power of her beauty when he first saw her at
                  church, and now that she was indorsed by the elegant, fashionable Florida, her
                  beauty was greatly enhanced. Helen was quite overwhelmed at the repetition of the
                  series of salaams with which he had saluted Miss Bernard.
               "He is like a Turkish courtier approaching his sultan," she said to herself. "I
                  wish Miss Bernard would not leave me to entertain him alone."
               But Florida, as soon as she had accomplished the introduction, entered into
                  conversation with some one, and left Helen to the undisturbed enjoyment of the
                  elegant attentions of Mr. Bainbridge. Helen could not help drawing contrasts
                  between him and Arthur, whose society she had been compelled to resign, to give
                  place to this disagreeable coxcomb.
               "Your friend, Mith Bernard," he began, by way of prolegomena, "ith a very
                  beautiful lady, Mith Morrith, almosth equal to some of the arithstocracy of
                  Europe. One might almosth imagine she had been brought up there, her mannerth are
                  so polisthed." Here the young gentleman looked very complacent, as if to say that
                  his manners had been formed there, so he felt fully competent to decide. "She
                  reminds me," he continued, "of a fathe I remember to have theen in thome of the celebrated gallerieth of
                  Europe, but I cannot recollect where."
               "Her beauty is as undenied as the beauty of a star," replied Helen, vainly wishing
                  that some opportune circumstance might release her. "Miss Bernard would no doubt
                  feel highly complimented, if she had heard your lofty panegyric. But do you award
                  the palm of excellence to Europe in everything—beauty, elegance, and taste? You
                  are exceedingly unpatriotic."
               "Yeth," he lispingly answered, "I do. America ith almosth intolerable, and you
                  would agree with me, if you had ever been fortunate enough to boast of several
                  yearth' residence in Europe."
               Helen cared not to prolong the discussion further, and was inexpressibly relieved
                  when she saw her father approaching, to inform her that it was time to return
                  home. She rose eagerly to meet him, and bowed her adieux to Hamilton and Miss
                  Bernard. As she passed out of the front door, she saw Arthur pacing disconsolately
                  to and fro beneath the trees. He came forward, and pressing her hand as he bade
                  her farewell, whispered "I will see you to-morrow."
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               HOW has Zenaida amused herself, or whiled away the long hours of this evening,
                  during which Helen has begun to realize the truth of the old song— 
                     
                        "There's nothing half so sweet in life
                        As Love's young dream"?
                     
                   She sat for some time contemplating, with her mind's eye, the gay scenes in
                  which Helen would mingle that night; but these scenes had little charm for her,
                  even in imagination.
               Black mammy came to sit with her; but she soon fell asleep, and Zenaida was again
                  alone. The darkness gradually deepened round her; for she loved no light, on a
                  summer night, but the soft moonlight. Now she sought her favorite seat by the
                  window, and gazed forth into the solemn stillness of the night, unbroken, save by
                  the whirring of insect wings—into the unfathomable depths of the sky, with delight
                  mingled with awe. Everything was so still, and the bright stars, unobscured by the
                  lightest cloud, were so far away, but they shone upon her from their height with a
                  twinkling radiance, like the light of love in tender eyes, and she fancied that
                  her mother beamed upon her from the brightest. She thought, too, that these
                  myriads of shining stars were all bright worlds, so vast, so numberless, that the
                  finite mind of man fails to grasp their extent, and wondered within herself if
                  these worlds were really inhabited, and if the dwellers in them were free from the
                  curse entailed upon the race of disobedient Eve. This earth appeared very small,
                  very insignificant, in comparison with the dimensions of these other worlds, and
                  very unworthy of the high place assigned it in the scale of the universe of
                  God.
               "But," said the voice of Zenaida's meditation, "God considered it of so great
                  importance, that his only Son was given to die for the salvation of its
                  sin-defiled inhabitants. If it appears insignificant in size, it is a very
                  beautiful world—so beautiful, even in its fallen state, as to be worthy the love
                  and admiration of all who draw their sustenance from its beneficent bosom. Glorious as thou art now, O
                  Earth! with so many of the impressions of thy Maker's seal effaced by the ruthless
                  hands of thy children, how inexpressible must have been thy beauty when in the
                  dawn of creation, before the blight of sin and death had fallen upon thee, God
                  looked upon his work and pronounced it good!"
               Alas! for the human soul born into this world of the conflicting elements of good
                  and evil, where the wicked too often flourish, while the righteous suffer! This
                  child, with her noble mind and elevated aspirations—her love for all that is pure,
                  and holy, and good—her abhorrence of vice, of meanness, of all moral
                  obliquity—what is to be her destiny in life? Her mind works upon this problem,
                  finding no solution; but well is it for her that she looks not here for that state
                  of happiness for which her soul yearns. Her young heart, in the dewy freshness of
                  its early morning, before it has been withered by the fiery breath of the furnace
                  of affliction, or tainted in its spotless purity by the mildew of sin, has been
                  offered upon the altar of her God—a sacrifice well pleasing in his sight.
               "Why," said she, "should we wait to pay this votive of offering, to the Most High,
                  until the heart has been given to the world and rejected by it, until we have
                  nothing to offer but a crushed and broken sacrifice? Is not our God a joy in
                  prosperity as well as a refuge in adversity? and are not all our pleasures
                  multiplied a thousandfold, when we commit ourselves to his care with the
                  undoubting confidence of a child in a loving, tender parent?"
               So Zenaida muses upon life—her life—and, standing upon its threshold, wonders what
                  task may be allotted to her, what mission it may be hers to perform; but the
                  future, looming giant-like in the distance, gives forth no voice of warning,
                  reveals nothing to the eye seeking to penetrate its hidden mysteries.
               Of one thing she is assured, that the life given here is but a term of probation,
                  in which to prepare for the realities of eternity; and, looking to the crown of
                  immortality, the joys of heaven, the high prize for which she aims, she shrinks
                  not from the dark valley that lies between, from the trials which are to refine
                  the pure gold of her spirit, purifying it from its earthly dross. With mind at
                  rest, and heart overflowing with love to God and all the creatures of his hand,
                  all unkind, harsh thoughts and feelings banished, our Zenaida keeps her watch in
                  the darkness. Are not angels hovering round her? Is not this murmur, that she
                  hears, the rustling of their invisible wings? She starts, but it is naught but the
                  night-breeze, or the leaves whispering softly in their sleep.
               Had Zenaida been reared in the Old World, with its hoary ruins, monuments of past
                  generations—with its wild legends, its haunted castles, its goblins, witches, and
                  other creations of excited and superstitious imaginations, she, with her love for
                  the unreal, would have been deeply impressed by their associations; but where her
                  lot had fallen, everything was so fresh from the hand of God, so free from
                  association with the sorrows, the sufferings, the crimes and calamities of man,
                  that the emotions excited were those of pleasure rather than terror. So the
                  darkness alarmed her not; no visitation of ghosts or evil spirits, no eerie sights
                  or sounds disturbed her loneliness. Thus Mr. Morris and Helen found her.
               
               "Why, sis," ejaculated Helen, "is it possible that you are sitting alone in the
                  dark? Why do you not have a light?"
               "Because I preferred to sit in the dark," she replied. "Neither am I entirely
                  alone, for mammy is here, in this big chair, fast asleep."
               Helen hastened to bring a light.
               "I hope," said Mr. Morris, patting Zenaida's head, and bestowing a kiss upon her
                  as she raised her face to his, "that you do not love darkness rather than light,
                  because your deeds are evil?"
               "No, papa," she replied, "I have neither thought nor done anything wrong, that I
                  am aware of; but I can think better in the dark, or with my eyes shut, for then
                  there is nothing to distract my attention."
               "You talk as if your thoughts were to influence the destiny of the world, little
                  sis," replied Helen. "Pray what has been the absorbing, subject of your important
                  meditations to-night?"
               "It would not interest you now," replied Zenaida, "if I were to tell you; for
                  doubtless you are thinking of the incidents that occurred at the Manor, or of
                  somebody whom I would name, but I spare your blushes before papa."
               Helen hastily took up her candle, and proposed that they should retire, as the
                  night was already far spent.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE summer advanced to its close, redeeming the promises of plenty, which its
                  early days had given; the trees were laden with luscious fruits, sweet as
                  ambrosial nectar; the vines were hung with heavy clusters of grapes, tempting to
                  behold,—and still the guests lingered at Cabell Manor.
               Mr. Ridgley had not wasted his precious moments, but had improved them by
                  rendering himself indispensable to Miss Annie. At every little party which was
                  held in the shady groves, within the stately walls of the Manor, or the
                  neighboring mansions, he was her constant attendant, her companion in the dance,
                  to the exclusion of all others. His flatteries fell gratefully upon her willing
                  ear, and their engagement was soon currently reported in the country.
               Florida had amused herself by exploring the country for miles around; had, after
                  some difficulty, prevailed upon Zenaida to accompany her in some of her
                  excursions. She had found her quite an agreeable companion, for she was acquainted
                  with every romantic or attractive spot for some distance, and was familiar with
                  every tree, shrub, plant, and flower, both by their technical and common names,
                  and knew every bird by its note. Her eye was quick to detect charms which escaped
                  those less observant, and she would point out to the astonished Florida not only
                  the constant changes in the cloud-pictures she loved so well, but the modest
                  beauties of the humblest plant or tiniest flower, which, but for her, would have been unheeded; for the eye of Florida
                  took in the picture as a whole, without examining the details.
               The thoughts of Zenaida, too, were clothed in language often poetic, always
                  elegant; for she had lived in intimate communion with poets and the best authors,
                  until her own ideas were unconsciously assimilated in expression to the words,
                  symbols of their thoughts. She did not adorn her speech with little bits of stolen
                  ornament, but the honey which she had industriously gathered was all her own. Her
                  mental food, unlike that of Miss Bainbridge, had not remained in its crude,
                  undigested state, but had been absorbed, contributing to the healthy growth of her
                  mind, as material food to the development of the physical powers.
               But, notwithstanding they had been thrown so much together, Florida had never been
                  able to remove the reserve of Zenaida. She felt that she had never gone beyond the
                  outer court of the temple of her heart. Strong, indeed, must be the claims of one
                  who would be admitted to its sacred penetralia; for Zenaida was not one to form
                  friendships lightly, to be as lightly broken. When she professed friendship, it
                  was with the utmost sincerity—not from the lips, but from the heart; and although
                  she held to her theory of first impressions, she drew no hurried conclusions when
                  the worth of a friend was to be decided.
               Miss Bernard was also extremely fond of riding on horseback, of which delightful,
                  invigorating exercise Zenaida was ignorant, until initiated by Florida. It
                  required but a few lessons from her more experienced companion, and a little
                  practice, to render her more fond of it than those who had been habituated to
                  it.
               "It is so exhilarating," she said; "it sends the blood dancing through my veins
                  with accelerated, joyful motion, tingling to the tips of my fingers, and causing
                  my whole frame to vibrate with a thrill of delight before unknown."
               Her cheek began to lose the pearly, lily-like whiteness so suggestive of
                  fragility, to assume the rosy flush of health, and Florida, who saw and rejoiced
                  at the change, would sometimes send her own elegant horse for Zenaida's use, when
                  her engagements did not admit of her going to ride with her.
               While they were riding, botanizing, and enjoying themselves, Arthur continued his
                  devoted attentions to Helen; and Florida, who had treated the matter with
                  indifference so long as she thought it mere pastime with her brother, hearing it
                  whispered that he was in earnest, that he had no intention of renouncing Helen's
                  love if he should succeed in winning it, as many thought he had done already, now
                  deemed it necessary to remonstrate earnestly with him. She appealed to his pride,
                  his worldly wisdom; she represented to him the alliances which he, handsome as he
                  was, rich as he would be, and talented as every one acknowledged, might aspire to
                  form—but all without effect.
               "Sister," he replied, "the arrows of your arguments, keen though they be, fail to
                  pierce my reason or convince my heart. Helen Morris (I confess it without the
                  faintest blush of shame) I love, and of my love I contend that she is worthy. Her
                  beauty, intelligence, her sweetness of disposition, her unsullied purity and
                  undoubted worth, are to me a dower more valuable than all the gold of Ophir, the
                  riches of the Rothschilds; and now hear my determination. If I can, I will woo and win the love of this dear girl;
                  for she will adorn any position to which I may hope ever to be able to raise her.
                  Your pride, my sister, is a false counselor, and were I to listen to it, would
                  lead me to a life of misery, which you would not fail to commiserate, when too
                  late."
               "He will not yield now," said Florida. "But I will not be discouraged. His pride
                  is now roused, and he delights to show his independence, his manly contempt for a
                  woman's counsels; but another opportunity will doubtless occur when I shall find
                  him more tractable, more willing to listen to admonition and remonstrance."
               Vain hope for that time, contrary to her expectations, did not arrive, and
                  Arthur's demeanor was such that she felt some hesitancy about renewing the contest
                  from which, to judge from appearances, she could not reasonably hope to gain any
                  advantage.
               The time for their departure was drawing nigh, and she hoped that he would return
                  home without having formed any engagement with Helen, or having any definite
                  understanding with her, and when once released from the fascination of her
                  presence, she flattered herself that his love would soon vanish; that this
                  temporary idol would be deposed from the shrine it now occupied, to give place to
                  another whom she might select, whom she might deem worthy to be admitted to a
                  sister's place in her affections.
               Arthur, however, as if predestined to disappoint the hopes and humble the pride of
                  his sister, determined to ascertain, without delay, the feelings of Helen toward
                  himself. With this view, he called a few days before the time appointed for their
                  departure, and invited Helen to walk with him.
               "Let us go to the Fairies' Mirror," said he, as she joined him. "The first walk we
                  took was to that sweet place, and as this may be our last we will go there
                  now."
               Helen assented sorrowfully, for the thought that this might be their last meeting
                  filled her heart with sadness, which was visible in her face. He told her of his
                  hopes and fears; his love, and his desire that she should share his future fate,
                  to smile upon him in joy and sympathize with him in sorrow.
               "Helen," he said, "I will strive, for your sake, to attain eminence in my
                  profession, if you smile upon my suit; but if you reject me, I shall have nothing
                  to look forward to—no hope, no ambition. I love you, Helen, and if you will
                  consent to be mine, not all the combined powers of earth shall be able to separate
                  us from each other."
               Helen heard this avowal with a heart throbbing with joy; for in all her day-dreams
                  of the future, he had long held a prominent place. She believed that he loved her,
                  even before his lips had uttered the words she so loved to hear, and, with all the
                  trusting hopefulness of her nature, she relied upon his assurances; nor did the
                  possibility of change, or faithlessness on his part, once cross her imagination.
                  Therefore, without hesitancy, she avowed her preference for him above all others
                  whom she had seen, and sealed his happiness by promising to be his.
               "In two years, Helen," said Arthur, "I shall call upon you to redeem the promise
                  you have made. I am studying law, and intend to adopt that as my profession; I
                  will apply myself with greater diligence, now that I shall work for you as well as to gratify my own ambition,
                  and as soon as I am located, I will come for you."
               Two years! The gloomy shadows of the dark-winged spirit of mistrust fell not on
                  them, and they thought not of the evil that might befall it those two years.
               "You will tell papa," said Helen, when they were about to part. "But I am his pet,
                  you know, and he will not interfere with any plan which will promote my
                  happiness."
               The gentle kiss, the tearful smile, the fervent, "God bless you" of the kind old
                  father, ratified their engagement, and their hearts were full of happiness when
                  they parted.
               
                  
                     True, they shed some tears at parting,
                     But they were like April showers;
                  
                  
                     For, while they were falling fastest
                     Light broke through the vapory cloud,
                     Tears were changed to gem-like dew-drops,
                     And their souls in joyance bowed,
                  
                  
                     As they hailed the arch of glory,
                     Hope's bright rainbow in the sky,
                     And the future whispered to them—
                     "See the promise ever nigh:
                  
                  
                     "Bright the past seemed to your vision,
                     Bright the flowers your pathway strewed;
                     But the future shall be brighter,
                     All its blossoms fairer-hued.
                  
                  
                     "Many sweets are mingled for you,
                     Love has crowned your cup of life
                     With his richest, rarest roses,
                     Stripped of every thorn of strife.
                  
                  
                     "God along your path has shaken
                     Gleams of light from Love's own sun;
                     He has woven your rose wreathed bowers—
                     His your treasures every one.
                  
                  
                     "His the love that doth awaken
                     In your souls their dreams of bliss,
                     As the Sun calls forth the flowers
                     From Earth with his balmy kiss."
                  
               
               Was hope's song a syren one? Will the future redeem its promises? The years will
                  tell.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE farewells had all been said; the guests had departed from Cabell Manor, taking
                  with them Miss Annie, who was quite elated at the prospect of a winter's campaign
                  in the city. Already in imagination many love-lorn suitors knelt at her feet, and
                  her eyes sparkled with her anticipated triumphs. As the distance between them and
                  Willowbrook increased, Florida breathed more freely. She could now influence
                  Arthur when he was no longer bewitched by the bright eyes of Helen Morris, so she
                  thought, little dreaming of the vows which had been exchanged before he left
                  her.
               The current of life at the cottage, which had been rippled by an occasional visit
                  from the Manor, now flowed in its former unbroken quietness and stillness. Helen's
                  heart, it is true, enshrined an image which formerly had there no place, but her
                  inner life alone was changed. Arthur was
                  constantly in her thoughts, and "I must do this to please Arthur," or "What would
                  Arthur say?" were phrases which she often repeated. She busied herself as usual
                  with her domestic duties, perfecting herself for the sphere of action which would
                  soon be allotted to her.
               Zenaida's chief delight out of doors, during the first autumn months, was her
                  garden, which, revived by the more genial temperature after the fervid heats of
                  summer, bloomed in beauty surpassing even the first flush of spring. The stately
                  dahlias bowed beneath the weight of their flowers of gorgeous dyes; the beds of
                  verbenas glowed in the chastened sunlight, with unrivaled prodigality displaying
                  every tone in the diapason of colors, from the regal purple and crimson of deepest
                  dye, the flaming scarlet dazzling the eye with its intense brightness, to the
                  softest, most delicate rose-color and pale lilac. Others, again, devoid of any
                  color, were pure as the spotless innocence of infancy, with an odor faint like a
                  strain of far-away music, stealing upon the senses, now distinguished, now
                  imperceptible, inspiring doubts as to its reality. The roses, which had languished
                  while Sirius raged, now put forth fresh leaves, buds, and blossoms, and, grateful
                  for admiration, rewarded every appreciative beholder with their exquisite
                  fragrance and beauty. "The jessamine faint, and the sweet tuberose" gave forth
                  their odors; amaranths, emblems of immortality, and mignonnette, like a modest
                  maiden, plain in appearance but delighting all by her unassuming worth, grew there
                  in great profusion.
               
                  
                     "There was a power in this sweet place,
                     An Eve amid this Eden."
                  
               
               And this power, this Eve, was our Zenaida.
               "Her garden," she said, "was her kingdom, her flowers her loyal subjects, with
                  whom she took greater delight in conversing than with her fellow-beings. In
                  communion with the latter, and with our own hearts, we are constantly reminded how
                  far we fall below the standard of ideal excellence; but some, many of my flowers
                  are perfect; I could not suggest an improvement if I would; the real is
                  unsurpassed by the ideal. They have beauty, grace, delicate ethereal loveliness,
                  combined with fragrance, which is the soul of flowers; and then, too, they are the
                  characters in which the name of God, most dear to us, is written upon the
                  earth—for what are they but symbols of the unrevealed love, the unimagined
                  beautiful? What heart so insensible that it has failed to learn wisdom from the
                  gentle teachings of these 
                     
                        'Floral apostles who, in dewy splendor,
                        Weep without woe, and blush without a crime!'"
                     
                  
               
               So, from their "voiceless lips," whose silence was more eloquent than words, did
                  Zenaida learn many lessons. The fragrance which they continually exhaled shamed
                  the heart from which the incense of prayer ascended not. From the daisy she caught
                  the upward look of faith; summer friendship was rebuked by the close-clinging
                  tendrils of the vine; gentle submission was taught by the blossoms which bowed
                  meekly before the storm; joy after adversity was learned from these same flowers,
                  which, after the storm was passed, lifted their heads, each tear-drop with which
                  their bright eyes were bedewed becoming a mirror from which the light of renewed
                  hope was reflected in many colors.
               Under these gentle influences her mind and heart expanded panded. Absorbed in the contemplation of the lovely
                  in Nature, she heeded not the poisonous weeds, and learned not the lessons of
                  hatred, strife and evil passions inculcated by them.
               
                  Her fair soul was a mirror which reflected
                  The beautiful and true, e'en as the placid lake
                  Reflects the golden stars; and ever she selected
                  The good, the pure, such as e'en here can make,
                  A heaven of earth.
               
               Oh, enchanted land of youth! garden of the imagination! blissful dreams before the
                  life-awakening!—she walks yet within thy precincts, where 
                     
                        The soul, lapped in Elysium,
                        Lulled with music here,
                        Half forgets its dreams of heaven,
                        Knowing earth so fair.
                     
                     
                        True, thy skies are not all cloudless,
                        Storms sweep o'er their clear deep blue;
                        But they pass, and sunlight brightens
                        All again with magic hue,
                     
                     
                        Till earth seems a fairy garden,
                        Dazzling with its witching gleams,
                        And the soul is filled with murmur
                        Of its dancing silvery streams.
                     
                     
                        Floral bells ring out their perfumes,
                        Melodies to spirit ears;
                        Bright birds flit among the branches,
                        Messengers from far-off spheres.
                     
                     
                        "God is love," the brook is murmuring,
                        "God is love," the flower bells ring,
                        "God is love," the bird is warbling—
                        Life is all one rosy spring.
                     
                  
               
               The fair aspect of the garden was soon changed. The frost came, and with its first
                  breath the delicate beauty of the flowers perished. Stripped of their festal robes
                  of crimson, purple, blue, and burnished gold, they looked unutterably sad in their
                  mute distress. The few pale sickly blooms, put forth by some more hardy, were so
                  like ghosts of their former selves, that Zenaida could not endure to look upon
                  them.
               From this scene of desolation she turned to the forests, which, in anticipation of
                  death, had donned their most gorgeous attire, as if, like a warrior-king, they had
                  determined to die gloriously. The conquering power could not triumph in their
                  decay, for in death they shone forth with a splendor so far transcending the
                  utmost beauty of their life, that the terror of the destroying influence was
                  merged in admiration for the heroism with which they met a late inevitable. Dead,
                  but not conquered; cast down, but not destroyed; yielding, but unintimidated, of
                  how much greater victory are they but the faint type, the dim shadow, even the
                  triumph of the blessed over the darkness, the terror of death and the grave!
               Zenaida roamed through the woods, noting the colors assumed by each tree. The
                  rustling of the fallen leaves was music which kept time to her thoughts, sweet yet
                  sad. When weary, she would sit upon the ground covered with a thick, soft carpet of leaves, and watch those that
                  were still falling; the bright red of the gum, like flakes of fiery snow; the
                  maple, bestrewing the earth with a shower of gold; the oak, king among kings, with
                  royal prodigality casting down myriads of rubies from his magnificent diadem,
                  until the last had been given, and his lofty head, without protection, was exposed
                  to the keen blasts of the icy winds, the pelting fury of the merciless storm.
               The view from the hill above the cottage was one upon which the eye would linger
                  long without satiety, could we upon this Indian-summer morn stand upon this
                  eminence by the side of Zenaida. The features of the landscape, seen through the
                  misty veil peculiar to this season, are softened into languor; the colors of the
                  forest blended in a mass, defying the power of words to describe, or artist to
                  portray, a correct representation of their glory; the fields spread out below,
                  adorned with stacks of grain and shocks of corn; one field, belonging to the
                  Manor, is covered with hemp which had fallen in rows before the reaper, and now
                  with the sunlight glancing on it, presents the appearance of a lake of burnished
                  gold, waving and rippling in the mellow radiance of the autumn day. Through this
                  the streamlet winds, in many curves, a thread of silver in this cloth of gold, its
                  surface freighted with a host of tiny barns, which have fallen upon it from the
                  overhanging tress, which fairy barks carry the departing angels of the leaves,
                  after whom the deserted tree look with a sad glance, and a sigh which Zenaida
                  hears upon the hill-top.
               Above all, the sky bends down protectingly, its deep blue ocean flecked with
                  particles of cloud, soft and fleecy, which float with a motion so full of bliss,
                  that they seem the snow-white sails of the pleasure-boats of heaven's angels.
                  Sometimes they glide over the sun, and a shadow falls upon the landscape,
                  immediately followed by a burst of joyous light, as joy and sadness chase each
                  other upon the human countenance.
               
               On one of the loveliest days of this lovely season, Mrs. Cabell sent over to the
                  cottage for the girls. She had made up a party to spend the day in the woods
                  hunting nuts, and she wished them to join it.
               They obeyed the summons with many anticipations of pleasure. Helen regretted the
                  absence of Arthur, for his presence would have lent an additional charm to every
                  pleasure; but Zenaida was free from all regrets of this nature, and though she
                  cared little for the formal reunions at the houses of her neighbors, she hailed
                  this with delight, for a party in the woods was in exact accordance with her
                  taste.
               Among, those who were assembled at the Manor they found Beatrice and Alice
                  Bainbridge; the little Amy and the exquisite Hamilton. Beatrice was not very
                  sensitively alive to the beauties of nature; but she counterfeited the feelings
                  and expressions of an ardent worshiper, and on this occasion rejoiced that she
                  would have an opportunity to utter some of the "beautiful sentiments" to quote
                  many passages from her "dear poets," appropriate to the season, which for some
                  time she had been assiduously studying.
               When they were about to start, the gentlemen appeared anxious to avoid her; but it
                  was Mrs. Cabell's care to provide vide
                  each lady with an escort, and having divided them out, allotting young Bainbridge
                  to Zenaida, she approached Elliston Hunter, (who had retreated to the piazza, upon
                  pretence of getting a drink of water, but really to avoid Miss Beatrice,) to
                  inform him that she expected him to play the agreeable to Miss Bainbridge.
               "Oh, Mrs. Cabell!" he exclaimed, "have you no mercy? I have had some experience of
                  Miss Bainbridge's conversational powers, and I know I shall be overwhelmed, almost
                  annihilated; for vain is my arduous effort to stem the tide of words that flows
                  from her lips. I was so stunned by the roar of this irresistible torrent of talk
                  when I last saw her, that I have not yet recovered."
               "For shame, Mr. Hunter!" rejoined Mrs. Cabell, "to speak so of this erudite young
                  lady. I will be relentless to-day, and compel you to go with her, that she may
                  avenge herself."
               "Oh, direful day! oh, woeful day!" he ejaculated, as he submissively followed Mrs.
                  Cabell.
               "Now," said that lady, motioning Elliston to his place by Beatrice, "we are all
                  here. Young ladies and gentlemen we will now take up our line of march; Amy and I
                  will command, and keep order in the company. And here I have the big dog and these
                  two little Africans, quite an imposing and brilliant staff and guard of
                  honor!"
               Zenaida on this day, conquering her natural timidity and reserve, and taking the
                  mental dimensions of Hamilton at a glance, determined to have some sport, and try
                  his patience not a little.
               "I wonder what pleasure he expects with all this finery on, going through the
                  woods?" she said. "He continually reminds me of Hotspur's description of the
                  gentleman who demanded his prisoners; for I am sure he is 'perfumed like a
                  milliner,' and no doubt 'talks like a waiting gentlewoman.' Well, as I am to be,
                  'pestered with this popinjay,' it still not be for naught."
               She yielded herself up to the influences of the balmy, invigorating air, and the
                  soft bright sunshine. She walked rapidly, and was continually diverging from the
                  path, followed by the rest of the party, in pursuit of leaves, which at a distance
                  attracted her by their brilliancy. She gathered as many as she could carry, and
                  then called upon Mr. Bainbridge to lend his assistance, which he did with secret
                  dissatisfaction. She next spied an Indian Arrow, or Wahoo-bush, with its clusters
                  of bright-scarlet berries. A desire to have some of them immediately took
                  possession of her. She ran to it, but they were above her reach, as she well knew;
                  so Hamilton's services were again called into requisition.
               "Oh, Mr. Bainbridge!" she cried "they are so pretty, and I cannot reach them! Do
                  come and gather some of these bright berries, for I must have some!"
               He obeyed with extreme reluctance, vowing that it should be the last time that he
                  would wait upon or follow this little will-o'-the-wisp, who led him in all sorts
                  of unheard-of places, with no guide but her own wild will. But when, after some
                  difficulty, he succeeded in reaching the berries and placing some beautiful
                  clusters in her hand, she looked at him with her beautiful blue eyes sparkling
                  with delight, her cheeks glowing with exercise, her rosy mouth dimpled with
                  smiles, and thanked him so prettily for taking so much trouble to gratify her, he forgot his vexation, and
                  was surprised to find himself contemplating with interest the pretty picture.
               Zenaida carefully deposited her treasures in the little basket which she carried,
                  and, for awhile, touched with compassion, walked more leisurely by the side of her
                  companion. In conversation they could not agree, for on most subjects their
                  opinions were diametrically opposed. She derived pleasure from the simple
                  amusements of her every-day life, and dilated with glowing words upon the beauty
                  of her favorite sylvan haunts; while he voted the country dull, its amusements
                  insipid. In fact, he was bored to death, and rejoiced that he would soon return to
                  the city, where his multitudinous graces could be exhibited to greater advantage
                  on the promenade and in the assembly rooms.
               "Ah, Mith Morrith!" he sighed, "you, who live in this dull country, can have no
                  idea of the attractions of the city, even one of our American cities, which are
                  the mosth indifferent spethimens of cities I ever saw. Ah!" he said with another
                  sigh, "you should thee thome of the cities of Europe which I have visited. Parith,
                  dear delightful Parith! how I long for a thight of your magnifithent sthreets and
                  stately palathes! How I do commistherate those unfortunate perthons who have never
                  been beyond the bounds of this miserable country!"
               But if Zenaida had never seen the places of which he spoke, she had read, and, by
                  a few judicious inquiries, she soon discovered that in his boasted "travels" he
                  had derived no pleasure from historical or poetic associations. The places he had
                  visited being viewed in the light of the present sent, not of the past, appealed
                  neither to his memory nor imagination. He had traveled because other young men of
                  fortune did;— 
                     
                        "Had stood in Venice on the Bridge of Sighs,
                        With Murray's red-backed guide-book in his hand,"
                     
                   and upon many spots immortalized by the pens of poets and historians; but no
                  voice from the past whispered in his ear of the things that had been.
               The conversation soon became uninteresting to Zenaida, who, at first amused at the
                  grand airs assumed by Mr. Bainbridge, now felt for him the most unmitigated
                  contempt and pity, as she thought of the time wasted, the opportunities
                  unimproved, by this conceited, insensible youth. The complacency with which she
                  had listened was soon laid aside, and the system of petty annoyances resumed.
               She saw that he liked to monopolize the attention of those with whom he was
                  brought in contact, so she called Amy, who was just in advance, and completely won
                  her favor by presenting her with some clusters of her berries. She was fond of
                  children, and this Amy soon discovered; and to-day her feelings were attuned in
                  harmony with the pretty child's. They laughed, and sang, and frolicked with Beppo,
                  to the amusement of Mrs. Cabell and the infinite disgust of Hamilton, and ere the
                  day closed a warm friendship was established between these two girls, alike
                  pure-hearted. Amy did not walk: she danced, as if her footsteps kept time to the
                  glad melody of her heart. Her laugh was musical as the caroling of birds; her deep
                  blue eyes sparkled with the happy light of childhood undimmed by care; her hair
                  curled in tiny rings, like pure gold,
                  above a face faultless in feature and expression, and to the admiring eyes of
                  Zenaida she seemed the personification of innocent joy and beauty.
               From present appearances, it was evident that Mrs. Cabell's company would return
                  home laden with few spoils, if they depended upon their own industry to collect
                  them; but they impressed into active service the colored recruits from the Manor
                  cabins, who had been invited that they might carry the dinner-baskets and climb
                  trees, and so this difficulty was obviated.
               When the hour for dinner arrived, they all assembled by the side of a clear spring
                  which gushed forth from a mossy rock, and, winding through the grass and leaves
                  for a few yards, poured its tributary waters into the "bonnie burn." Here the
                  cloth was spread, and the dinner brought forth, to which all did ample justice
                  except the pseudo-sentimental Miss Bainbridge, who protested that she was not in
                  the least hungry. "She had enjoyed such a feast of reason, such a flow of soul,
                  that she was not conscious of the need of any other refreshment. She could live
                  upon the odors of flowers, like that dear Namouna, the enchantress!"
               "That fare may suit you, Miss Bainbridge," said Mr. Hunter; "but it is too
                  unsubstantial for me after our long walk, so I beg you will pardon me for being so
                  commonplace and prosaic as to eat some of these good things which Mrs. Cabell has
                  so bountifully provided."
               After the repast was concluded, they remained for some time in this pleasant
                  place, and Zenaida being still more attentive to Amy than to her brother, that
                  much-injured individual proposed to one of the other gentlemen to change
                  partners.
               "Percy, my dear fellow," said he, "I am bored to death with that little evil
                  genius, who has made me run up hill, wade through dead leaves piled up knee-high
                  in those odious hollows, climb over huge fallen trees, and everything provoking
                  she could possibly think of. Look here," he continued, "my hat is full of red and
                  yellow leaves, which she told me to carry, as if I were a sumpter mule. My gaiters
                  are bursted, my straps broken, and all for the gratification of that deuced—"
               "Hold, Bainbridge!" exclaimed Percy, "I cannot permit you to call that pretty girl
                  any harsh names. I think you are very fortunate to have a companion who must be as
                  tricksy a sprite as Puck or Ariel, who, in addition to her other qualities, has
                  the power to make you quite eloquent in summing up your list of grievances."
               "If you consider me so fortunate," eagerly rejoined Bainbridge, "you will be not
                  only willing but anxious to make the exchange I proposed. Will you not?"
               "Pardon me, my dear fellow," replied Percy; "I could not possibly be so
                  disrespectful to Miss Hamilton as to leave her, who has made the hours fly winged
                  with delight, even for the charming companion you propose to resign."
               Concealing his delight at the evident vexation of Bainbridge, Percy turned to seek
                  again his fair partner, to whom, with enjoyment, he gave a ludicrous account of
                  the discomfiture of Hamilton Bainbridge.
               "He will either have a solitary walk home," he said, in conclusion, "or a tête-à-tête with the stately dowager of Cabell Manor;
                  for that pretty girl does not intend to trouble herself about him farther, and thereby she shows,
                  conclusively, that she is a lady of sense and taste."
               "Mr. Hunter," said Beatrice, after that gentleman had finished his dinner and
                  resumed his seat beside her, "do you not think there is something inexpressibly
                  mournful, and at the same time pleasing, in these melancholy days of autumn, 
                     
                        'When the leaves, brown, yellow, and red,
                        And white with the whiteness of what is dead,
                        Like troops of ghosts on the dry wind pass'?"
                     
                  
               
               "Oh, yes!" replied Mr. Hunter, laconically. "Elliston," he added to himself, "make
                  up your mind for what is coming."
               "The sadness," continued Beatrice, "which oppresses one while beholding the
                  transcendent glories of this season of death, is in a measure lightened by the
                  certainty with which we look forward to the re-awakening of Nature in the spring,
                  when the mantle of verdure will again be spread over the earth. Ah!" she sighed— 
                     
                        "'Too happy earth! over thy face shall creep
                        The awakening vernal airs, until thou, leaping,
                        From unremembered dreams, shall see
                        No death divide thy immortality.'
                     
                   Don't you agree with me, Mr. Hunter? Or am I unveiling my thoughts to one
                  devoid of sympathy? I am sure you agree with me."
               "Oh, yes!" again replied Elliston, his favorite monosyllables ever recurring, like
                  the "chorus of frogs" in the drama of Aristophanes, or the "chorus of swine" in
                  the Œdipus Tyrannus of Shelley.
               This assent was perfectly satisfactory to Beatrice, who was convinced by it that
                  Elliston was listening, and, to her, his silent comments were as if they had not
                  been. While she spoke, he was thinking of the one to whom she might fall in the
                  lot of life.
               "Thrice happy man! I hope he may be poor and fond of poetry, for then she will be
                  a convenient, portable compendium, a book of quotations always ready, never
                  failing. I have read of a girl out of whose mouth, whenever she spoke, fell pearls
                  and roses; but this is the first one I ever saw from whose lips came forth verses
                     ad infinitum. I wish I could think of some, I
                  would quote them for her, until she was as tired as I am. I wish her no harm, save
                  that she may yet meet one who will beat her at her own game."
               After another ramble the party returned to the Manor, where Mrs. Cabell detained
                  them for the evening. She was fond of young company, and watched with interest the
                  progress of the flirtations among her young guests. Zenaida, to whom Amy clung,
                  occasionally begging for a kiss, sat by. Mrs. Cabell, who gave her a history of
                  the portraits on the walls, and the ancient furniture, in which she was greatly
                  interested. When they parted for the night, Zenaida made Amy promise to come to
                  the Cottage, which promise she gave joyfully.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE two years, which were to be the period of probation with Arthur and Helen, had
                  now passed, not without many changes. Annie Cabell had become Mrs. Ridgely, and
                  only honored the Manor by an occasional visit. Her mother, unwilling to leave her
                  home, and oppressed by her loneliness, had sent for a niece, who now lived with
                  her. Mary Worthington was young, the orphan daughter of Mrs. Cabell's only sister,
                  and she now filled a daughter's place in the heart of her worthy aunt. She was a
                  girl of fine intellect, which had not been neglected in its cultivation. Her
                  spirits were naturally gay and buoyant, and the cloud which hung over her when she
                  first came to the Manor was soon dissipated. None of the haughtiness of Annie
                  could be seen in her, and when her aunt recommended the daughters of Mr. Morris as
                  her companions, she took them at once to her heart and friendship. Attracted by
                  her, Helen and Zenaida traversed more frequently the path to the Manor; and often
                  could Mary be found with Helen in the Cottage, chatting gayly, and plying her
                  needle with industrious zeal, or examining the flowers in the garden with Zenaida.
                  Under her care vines twined the pillars, around the stately portico of the Manor,
                  and flowers from Zenaida's stock bloomed around the fountain; water-lilies drooped
                  over its margin, to look at their forms reflected there; and gold-fish gleamed in
                  the waters of the basin.
               "Mary is a treasure," said Mrs. Cabell, as she looked approvingly upon her. "I do
                  not know what will become of me when you girls, like my Annie, leave me."
               "Do not distress yourself, aunt," said Mary; "you will be tired of me long before
                  you will find any one to relieve you of your burden."
               "You would not say that if you thought so, Mary," replied Aunt Cabell.
               The inmates of the Cottage bore witness to the lapse of time. The health of Mr.
                  Morris, always delicate, was now more so, though his indisposition was never
                  severe enough to excite gloom in the minds of his daughters; but his hair, which
                  had been black like the glossy braids of Helen, was now sprinkled thickly with
                  silvery white, and a languor was diffused through his whole frame, which warned
                  him of an approaching decline. Helen was much improved. Her manners, which had
                  always been pleasant, were more than ever winning.
               Arthur had proved constant, had studied hard, had graduated with honor, had been a
                  regular correspondent during the period of their separation, and Helen's heart
                  beat high with hope and pride in him, the object of her first love. No canker-worm
                  of grief or doubt destroyed the bloom of her fresh young cheek; no tear of sorrow
                  dimmed the bright lustre of her loving eye. She was happy; for Arthur had written
                  that he was coming in a few days, had also written to her father that he might
                  know if he still looked with approbation upon his suit. The thought of parting
                  with his Helen, whose tender smiles and loving voice exorcised the demon of pain,
                  filled the heart of Mr. Morris with sadness; but he had confidence in Arthur's integrity and
                  strength of character, and, knowing that his own death was approaching, felt that
                  it would be a consolation to him to leave her under the protection of one who
                  would cherish her with all the kindness of a noble, manly heart, and shield her
                  from the rude storms of life. So he called Helen, and having listened to the
                  outpouring of the tide of love which filled her guileless heart, reading in every
                  word and look the confidence stronger than life which she felt in her chosen one,
                  he again ratified the contract she had made, and bestowed upon her his blessing in
                  a voice so full of tender pathos, that Helen was touched with remorse to think
                  that she had been dreaming of deserting this dear father for one who was to her a
                  comparative stranger. She wept and clung to his neck. He leaned forward, imprinted
                  a kiss upon her brow, unclasped her twining arms, placed her in his chair, and
                  left the room; for her struggle between conflicting loves and duties unnerved him,
                  and unfitted him for the task imposed upon him.
               Zenaida! What new thoughts, emotions—what change in heart, mind, or form have
                  these two years brought to her? When we last saw her she was like a bud so tightly
                  folded in its green envelope that nothing of its rich fragrance, glowing color, or
                  beautiful proportions, could be discovered; but now the fair flower, in its
                  sheltered seclusion, was slowly unfolding, the pearly dew upon its fresh leaves,
                  unexhaled by the glare of public admiration, giving promise of a glorious
                  maturity. She was not so generally beloved as Helen, who was alive to all the
                  sympathies of common humanity, while Zenaida lived in an ideal world, surrounded
                  by creatures of thought and imagination. Fond of history, she was more at home in
                  the world of the Past than the Present. She was never lonely; for she possessed a
                  talisman more potent than the magic lamp of Aladdin, the wand of the Queen of
                  Fairies, or the cabalistic words of magicians, by which she could summon spirits
                  to minister to her in any mood—the talisman of intellect. They spoke to her from
                  books, in the murmur of the stream, the rustle of the wind-swept trees, in the
                  angry rush of the storm, and looked at her with loving eyes from the holy
                  stars.
               "The bark of her life was moored in a quiet haven," drawn up to a green shore,
                  enameled with flowers of light, love, peace, and happiness; and her heart arose in
                  gratitude to God who had permitted her, not more worthy than many less fortunate,
                  to learn lessons of wisdom from the gentle teacher, Nature, amid the beautiful
                  scenes which surrounded her.
               For a time Helen's face was like an April day, alternating between clouds and
                  sunshine, tears and smiles; smiles called forth by the anticipation of a meeting
                  with Arthur, tears by the thought of leaving the pretty nest where, in the absence
                  of the mother-bird, her father had so lovingly sheltered her with his protecting
                  wing. But her heart was strong, and, when Arthur came, the sunshine gained
                  supremacy; the tear-drops, lingering upon her long lashes, became iridescent in
                  the light of unclouded hope.
               Zenaida liked Arthur, and resigned her sister to him as willingly as she would
                  have done to any one; but she did not realize the change that would fall upon the
                  house with the departure of Helen, the sunshiny smiles of whom had been its
                  vitalizing principle. She pictured to herself the devotion with which she would attend upon her
                  father, that he might not miss the gentle ministrations of Helen, and the
                  additional importance with which she would be invested as the head of the
                  housekeeping department; but she could not know how the vacant chair by the
                  fireside; the quick, light footstep listened for and no longer heard; the absence
                  of the sweet voice warbling some song he loved, or greeting him with glad accent;
                  of the bright, beautiful face no longer presiding at his table, would affect the
                  spirits of her father, already depressed by bodily weakness, the extent of which
                  he strove to conceal. But to the young there was no spectre present at the bridal. 
                     
                        "Summer was dead, and Autumn was expiring,
                        And infant Winter laughed upon the land,
                        Cloudless and cold,"
                     
                   when Helen left the Cottage for her new home near the city of L——.
               The marriage was solemnized by Mr. Thornley, the good pastor of Grove Church, and
                  witnessed by Mrs. Cabell, Mary, and several other friends.
               "My dear," said Mrs. Cabell, as she offered her congratulatory kiss, "I did not
                  know that my nephew was laying plans to pluck our wild-rose when he was staying
                  with me. You see my forebodings are correct. I told you, you would all leave me.
                  You bear the bell, and lead off in the dance, and Mary and Zenaida will certainly
                  follow. Now I must wish you all happiness, although you have set a bad example
                  before my other girls."
               "You, also, aunt," said Mary, roguishly, "have given the weight of your example to
                  establish this precedent; and you know example is better than precept. When I can
                  find some one as handsome and clever as my Cousin Arthur, I shall most assuredly
                  'set my cap' for him.' Oh, cousin!" she cried, as Arthur thanked her for her
                  compliment, "I did not know that you were near, or I would not have flattered your
                  vanity, which is already in a flourishing condition; for I am so vexed with you
                  for taking our Helen away, that I could cry with good grace. What am I to do
                  without her? I shall be, without her, 
                     
                        'Like a bird with one wing,
                        A lute with one string,'
                     
                   or a book with a handful of leaves torn out at the most interesting
                  part."
               "I am sorry for you, Cousin Mollie," replied Arthur; "but I can afford you no
                  alleviation for your grief."
               With prayers mingled with tears, the father and sister embraced their Helen, and
                  saw her depart, leaning upon him to whom her future life was bound indissolubly,
                  who comforted her heart, sad at parting, with loving words and bright anticipatory
                  pictures of the life they would lead in their new home.
               After all the guests had left the Cottage, the feeling of desolation came upon its
                  inmates, and they yearned for the light which had shone for them, but would now
                  illumine another's dwelling.
               "I am desolate!" murmured the father. "My beautiful child has preferred
                  another—has left my love for that of a stranger, and I am lonely in my old
                  age!"
               
               "Am I, then, naught to thee, O my father?" said the plaintive voice of Zenaida
                  close beside him. "Cannot my love, my devotion, console you in some degree? I will
                  never leave nor forsake thee, father!" she continued, kneeling by his side, and
                  raising imploringly her blue eyes, swimming in unshed tears. "Will you not suffer
                  me to fill the place in your heart which my sister has left vacant?"
               "My child," replied the voice of her father, tremulous with emotion, "forgive the
                  grief I manifest, and think not I am insensible to your love. My words were hasty
                  and ill-advised, for I am not, cannot be desolate, while such love as yours is
                  mine. Forgive me that I said so."
               She smiled through her tears, and inwardly renewed the vow she had made; and from
                  that day his happiness and comfort were her study. The books he loved she read
                  aloud, and from the cells of her mind, which were stored with the honey of sweet
                  thoughts, she brought forth treasures which had been hidden from his eye, the
                  richness of which surprised and delighted him. The dishes he liked she learned to
                  prepare, and when illness set in, from a violent cold he had taken, she nursed him
                  with a skillful anticipation of his wishes which could not have been expected from
                  one whose experience was so limited.
               The physician, old Doctor Scott, from Montrose, praised her intelligence, and the
                  fidelity with which his prescriptions were followed; but the heart of Zenaida was
                  sick with sad forebodings, and the praise or blame from any lips but her father's
                  fell unheeded by her inattentive ear.
               She did not mention these sad forebodings in her letters to Helen. She said that
                  papa was sick, but she was unwilling willing to rouse her anxiety, to cloud the
                  bright morn of her married life with the shadow that fell upon herself from the
                  advancing form of the black-winged angel of death. Already she felt that the cold,
                  chill air was stirred by his dusk pinions; that he hung above, hovering round the
                  house, waiting for the moment when he might descend to seize his unresisting
                  prey.
               The neighbors were kind, and assisted her as much as possible in her labors of
                  love. As the winter advanced, the violence of fever subsided. Mr. Morris regained
                  sufficient strength to sit up for a few hours at a time in an easy chair, though
                  the cough, which at intervals convulsed his frame, forbade the hope of his
                  ultimate recovery.
               Mr. Thornley now proved himself to be "the friend in need, who is the friend
                  indeed." He would sit by the side of Mr. Morris with a patient assiduity almost
                  womanly, waiting upon him, reading for him, and praying with him. Noticing the
                  extreme paleness of Zenaida, and attributing it to confinement in the sick-room
                  and constant watching—knowing not that the sympathetic tie, which bound her to her
                  beloved and dying father, was so strong, that, as the tide of his life ebbed daily
                  lower, the tenure by which she held her existence grew gradually less strong—he
                  would with gentle words entreat her "to intrust her father to his care, to go
                  forth into the fresh air and walk, for to her, who had lived so much out of doors,
                  this monotony of the sick-room must be extremely irksome as well as
                  injurious."
               The changing hues and forms of the clouds, the variations of weather, which had
                  always been daily and hourly noted by Zenaida, had of late passed unheeded, save
                  when the howling of the wind, the
                  groaning of the trees, or the fitful sobbing of the winter rain had disturbed the
                  rest of her father.
               Now when, in obedience to the gentle command of her friend, she walked forth, the
                  earth was covered with a spotless mantle of new-fallen snow, which had turned to
                  rain ere the clouds were exhausted, and now clothed every bush, tree, and
                  house-top with pendant ornaments of translucent ice, sparkling, flashing, glowing
                  with the intolerable splendor of diamond-light in the clear, wintry sunshine. Had
                  she not been oppressed by the sad fancies which had crowded round her in the room
                  of illness, perhaps of death, Zenaida would have luxuriated in the cold brilliance
                  of the scene before her; but the white vestment of the earth brought before her
                  shuddering mind the garb of the grave, and the icy bonds which fettered the land
                  which the sun had not power, to dissolve, presented to her the body depraved of
                  the warmth of life, locked in the cold, inextricable embrace of death.
               At another time she would have been reminded of the spotless robe of the virgin
                  bride, adorned with gems to greet her bridegroom; for these gorgeous jewels were
                  all too glorious for the dark, narrow house of death.
               So she returned, drooping with increased sadness, to take her place again by that
                  dear father, upon whom she gazed, until his loved image was engraven indelibly
                  upon the retentant tablets of her heart.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               HELEN, all unconscious of the gloom which overspread her sister's life, was happy
                  in her husband's love; but not without some care of her own, for Arthur's marriage
                  with herself had not been pleasing to his family, who, having other views for him,
                  had not forgiven him for exercising his own taste and judgment in the selection of
                  his wife. They refused to receive sweet Helen as a daughter or sister, or to
                  render Arthur any assistance in his new life; but he had enough to purchase the
                  pretty place they occupied, and was hopeful for the future, notwithstanding the
                  ungracious demeanor of his parents and sister. He had never said anything to Helen
                  concerning the remonstrances of Florida, or the opposition of his parents, and it
                  now grieved her inexpressibly to think that she had been the innocent cause of
                  separating Arthur from his family, for he was so jealous of the meed of respect
                  due to his wife, that he refused to go where she was not admitted. He was
                  confident that the patient goodness and sweetness of Helen would, eventually,
                  triumph over their ill-grounded prejudices, and so he assured her.
               "Cheer up, Helen," he said; "all will yet be well; and even if it be not as I
                  anticipate, my singing-bird must not droop and pine, and beat its wings against
                  the bars of this pretty cage as if it were a prison-house. My father and mother
                  are good and true, and would only need to be acquainted with your excellence, to induce them to receive you
                  joyfully; but Florida is full of pride, false in its nature, and she has
                  influenced them. But, believe me, wife, it is only for a time that we must remain
                  beneath this ban, tabooed from the society of my home. Take courage, and believe,
                  with me, that all will be well."
               And she was comforted. The clouds were cleared from her brow, for Arthur must not
                  see her sad, and she sought, by increased devotion, to compensate the husband,
                  more than ever dear, for the sacrifice he had made so cheerfully for her.
               Their home was about two miles from the city, whither Arthur's business called him
                  every day. He was established in partnership with a gentleman, who, having been
                  engaged in business for many years, had acquired an extensive and lucrative
                  practice, and who, pleased with the industry, talent, and energy of Arthur,
                  augured well for his future prospects of success. Arthur had some friends, who,
                  uninfluenced by the cold reception which Helen had met with from his parents,
                  welcomed her cordially for his sake, and were soon won by her, as friends, for her
                  own sake.
               Tears of regret for the home she had left,—for her dear father, and her fair,
                  dreamy-eyed sister, would often come to her eyes; but Arthur, who had preferred
                  her to his own kindred, must not see her weep,—so the tears were dried in the
                  bright eyes, and the smile wreathed her lip to welcome his coming.
               The winter days dragged their weary weight heavily with Zenaida, who saw, day by
                  day, the loved form of her father grow thin, until his pale hand was translucent,
                  his eye become come more intensely, spiritually bright, as if with the reflection
                  from the glory of the invisible world, to which he was so rapidly approaching. His
                  mortal body was so purified by the fire which was consuming him, that, but for the
                  pain he sometimes suffered, she might have fancied him already a denizen of the
                  spirit-land.
               In his conversations with her, no murmur escaped his lips—no fear of the change
                  that awaited him was expressed; for his soul had already plumed its wings for its
                  final flight, and patiently awaited the signal for departure, the only backward
                  glance of regret cast upon the earth being called forth by the thought that he
                  would never again behold the face of his Helen, and the loneliness in which
                  Zenaida, his devoted child, would be left.
               "God will reward you, my child," he said fervently, "for your untiring
                  faithfulness to me, and will be thy Father, when thou hast no earthly parent."
               She sat upon a low seat at his feet, his pale hand clasped in hers, the glow of
                  the departing sunlight resting on her fair head, bowed in the mute awe of grief
                  upon his knee. The eye of the old man was upon the scene spread out beyond the
                  window,—the white earth, tinged with a rosy light, caught from the fiery splendor
                  of the sunset, the hoary trees, through the naked branches of which the wind
                  wailed mournfully, as though they sung the death-anthem for him, the beloved
                  master, who had trained their branches into graceful forms, had pruned them when
                  too luxuriant, and watched with joy the gratitude with which they put forth bright
                  leaves and buds, or strewed his path with flowers, to reward him for his labor,
                  which was one of love.
               
               The old cedars, the only green thing amid the general desolation, wreathed with
                  snow-flowers, which angel-hands had culled and cast down upon them from the
                  gardens of heaven, here and there put forth a green branch above the waste, like
                  the olive-branch of Noah's dove above the wilderness of waters, typical of hope
                  and life. After his eye had taken in the whole view without, the father looked
                  down with tenderest pity upon the young, sorrow-stricken head before him.
               "My child," he began, his voice falling so softly, so sweetly upon the hushed air,
                  that Zenaida started as if expecting to see that he was gone, and that the voice
                  was one from the other world; "my child, look out upon this dying day and read the
                  lesson it teaches. The sun is sinking, the sky above, in sorrow for his departure,
                  is clothed with clouds, sombre as those which shadow your heart; but the sun in
                  going leaves behind a light which transmutes these sad vestments into tissues of
                  glowing dyes; so let the memory of my love, when I am gone, illumine the clouds of
                  grief, which now threaten, to overwhelm and blot out all the joy of your heart. I
                  was not destined, like those old cedars, to bear upon my head the snows of many
                  winters; but God is merciful, and my days have not been cut short by the hand of
                  violence, like the oak, uprooted by the hurricane. He has permitted me to die
                  gradually, to feel, day by day, the bonds of clay dividing, and my soul has had
                  time to recover from the first terror of dissolution, to contemplate, with the
                  steady gaze of faith, the bright prospect of its eternal glory."
               "Dear father," said Zenaida, "I love to listen to you; but you will fatigue
                  yourself too much. Do not talk any more now."
               "I feel stronger this evening," he replied, "and talking does not appear to tire
                  me, my darling."
               Again his eye wandered to the out-door world, and brightened as it rested upon
                  each familiar tree and shrub; a smile was upon his lips, his eye kindled with
                  unwonted fire, and from his heart, touched by the rod of death, gushed forth his
                  farewell to earth,— 
                     
                        "I have loved thee, beautiful world; thou'st ever been to me
                        A nursing mother, gentle, kind, and true;
                        Thou'st spoken to my heart in every plant and tree—
                        In the sun's splendor, in the glittering dew.
                        I've gazed upon thee, when in glory drest,
                        "Thy clouds did shine like diamond crowns of kings,
                        When through the empurpled portals of the West
                        A flush of heaven was cast upon all earthly things.
                     
                     
                        "I have loved thee, when thy glory was o'ercast;
                        When all the ripples of thy laughing streams were still
                        I have loved thee, and will, love thee to the last,
                        'Till, as thy frozen tides, my bounding pulse is chill;
                        In the gushing joy of thy glad fragrant spring;
                        In the lush beauty of sweet summer's prime;
                        In the bright garbs which autumn angels bring;
                        In the cold winter's death-like ghastly time;
                     
                     
                        "In all thy moods arid changes I have loved,
                        And now, as my soul stands upon the brink
                        Of the vast, shoreless ocean,—it is moved
                        By no dim, shuddering fear,—why should I shrink?
                        
                        Thy beauties are but symbols, shadowy, faint,
                        Imperfect types of glory unrevealed;
                        No eye can see, no word, no hand can paint
                        The splendor by Death's curtain now concealed.
                     
                     
                        "Within that promised land, the air is sighing
                        O'er fields in beauty's bloom forever vernal,
                        And precious fruits, and gorgeous flowers undying
                        Hang tempting on the tree of Life Eternal.
                        No serpent lurks in those fair fragrant bowers,
                        To tempt the unwary heart with words of guile;
                        No poison-trail is over Love's sweet flowers,
                        No cloud of sin excludes the Savior's smile.
                     
                     
                        "Thy harmonies, O Earth, thy sweetest strains
                        Are but a broken prelude-note;
                        But the full swell Eternity sustains,
                        And every tone with rapture—bliss, is fraught;
                        No jarring discords there disturb the sound;
                        In one deep tide the Eternal music rolls;
                        There, only there, no pain, no death is found,
                        There bathe in pleasure our enfranchised souls.
                     
                     
                        "My child! thou'lt lift thy love to heaven, where Jesus reigns;
                        Thou'lt trust in Him who died thy soul to save;
                        Thou'lt long for that blest hour, when, free from pains,
                        Through Him thou'lt triumph over death—the grave.
                        When thou hast stifled in thine anguished heart
                        Its angry, deep, impassioned moan,
                        Thou'lt think that we shall meet no more to part,
                        And learn to say—'Thy will, O God, be done.'"
                     
                  
               
               The light fades again, the eye loses its unnatural brilliance, the hand relaxes,
                  and falls again softly, tenderly, upon the youthful mourner's head. She has drunk
                  in his words eagerly, and still they vibrate through her heart like melodies from
                  heaven. Who could doubt the peace, the joy of his soul; who could wish to hold him
                  back from that land of glory which was already visible to his spirit-eyes?
               That night, as Zenaida sat by the bedside, the Angel of Dreams, entering
                  noiselessly, touched her with its sleep-wand. The heavy eyes closed, and the
                  vision, which the midnight visitant had brought, encircled her. It was so vivid,
                  so palpable, that she gazed, holding her breath. She stood near where a broad
                  river mingled its torrents with the ocean; her father was in the current before
                  her, at first gliding near where she stood so that she could reach him with her
                  outstretched arms; then the force of the tide became stronger, and he was borne
                  away, away from her longing eyes, into the ocean beyond, ever, as he looked back,
                  casting upon her that glance of tender pity with which he had looked upon her that
                  evening. 
               Then the scene changed, and she stood with him upon a narrow path, which was
                  skirted with flowers, but ever, as she essayed to pluck them, the blood flowed
                  from her little fingers, pricked by the sharp thorns. While they thus stood, she
                  looked up and saw a large gate slowly unfolding, through which came a spirit-form,
                  which, as it first entered, was so radiant that she veiled her eyes from its
                  sight; but as it left the bright atmosphere behind, which had glanced through the
                  open gate, and approached the spot where they stood expectantly, the glory, which
                  had emanated from its presence, was clouded in the eyes of Zenaida, until scarcely
                  a ray was visible. The spirit-form advanced slowly and reached forth its hand to
                  the old man, who eagerly extended his
                  to meet it. Under the guidance of this messenger he left the side of his daughter,
                  and in silence, unbroken by the slightest sound, approached the gate which swung
                  voluntarily upon its hinges, again revealing a gleam of that glorious light, robed
                  in which was her father's form, as she caught the last glimpse of him. Then, as
                  she was still spell-bound in the spot where he had left her, another presence
                  stood beside her, and taking her hand gently in his own, whispered to her fainting
                  heart,—"Fear not, for I am with thee." As these words fell softly, breathed by the
                  voice of divine love, the angel again touched the white eyelids, dissolving the
                  dreams which it had invoked, to soothe the heart of the weary one.
               She awoke and bending above her father, caught the sound of his labored breathing.
                  His pulse beat faint and low. Zenaida was alone, in a presence which she felt must
                  be that of death. Dumb with grief, she knelt and clasped the hand of the dying
                  within her own. She had never before watched the breath as it grew fainter and
                  more faint—the blood, as it receded from the extremities, concentrating its little
                  remaining energy in the heart, the citadel of life; but her heart and the dreams
                  of the night whispered that the messenger had come. The hand she held was cold, so
                  cold that the warmth from her own did not affect it. She chafed it and kissed it
                  fondly, and the vital heat returned not; but, the eyes so dear opened, and beamed
                  upon her once more that last light of love; the lips parted in a smile of
                  ineffable sweetness, and moved in prayer or benediction, of which the only words
                  that fell upon her ear were these:—"My children," "Lord Jesus receive my spirit,"
                  and then were forever mute.
               The filmy veil was drawn down which hid forever the light of those loving eyes;
                  the hand, which had been so often placed in benediction on her head was still, oh,
                  merciful Father! so still, and pulseless as the insensible marble; and the spirit,
                  sublimated and refined by suffering, was gone, to try the realties of the unseen
                  world.
               Zenaida was alone—alone with the image of the loved and lost. No tears came with
                  blessed influence to dissolve her grief, no sob burst from her breast. Her eyes
                  were cold and dry, as if the Angel of Death, in pressing, had breathed with his
                  icy breath upon the fountain of her tears, and congealed them at their source. She
                  closed the eyes from which the soul no longer looked forth; she knelt beside the
                  dead, herself almost as cold, as pale; and there she was found by Aunt Rebecca who
                  sent immediately for some of the neighbors, as soon as she saw that the soul had
                  left its tenement of clay.
               Mammy, noisy in her lamentations, tried to rouse her poor young lady.
               "My baby, my pet, my darlin'," she cried; "God have mercy on the poor child. All
                  by herself, and massa gone; honey, don't look so, you'll break your mammy's
                  heart."
               She took Zenaida gently in her arms, as she had so often done when she was a
                  little child, and lamenting as she went, carried her to her own room, where she
                  placed her on the bed.
               "Oh, mammy, I am so cold!" she said, with a shudder, closing her eyes as though
                  she strove to shut out the reality of their grief that pressed upon her.
               
               "Poor baby!" sighed mammy, tenderly enveloping her in warm covering upon which the
                  big tears fell, welled from the depths of her faithful, loving heart.
               After this, seeing the eyes of Zenaida still closed, she hoped that sleep would
                  come to relieve the sick, wounded spirit and tired frame, and with noiseless step
                  she left the room, to assist in the preparations for the grave that were being
                  made in the apartment below.
               But the poor girl slept not, nor did insensibility deaden the intense pain in her
                  throbbing head and aching eyes, which could not endure the bright, fresh light of
                  the morning, now that her heart was in darkness. Memory was at work, bringing
                  faithfully back the life-long tenderness, the kind words, the gentle actions of
                  the father who lay so still, so pale; from whose eyes she had seen the light of
                  life go out; from whose lips she had heard the last words ever to be spoken by
                  them. No remorse mingled with this grief to make it yet more bitter, for no
                  undutiful word had ever been uttered by the lips of this holy-hearted girl, no
                  disobedient action had ever been committed by her, who reverenced her father above
                  all earthly beings. Now, as these memories awakened her to a full sense of her
                  desolation, she again saw the mildly beaming eyes, and heard the sweet words of
                  consolation which had fallen upon her in her dream:—"Fear not, for I
                  am with thee," and she felt that it was not the mere phantasm of her imagination,
                  but a real presence, and she was no longer alone.
               When the heart is encircled by human friends, the ways of approach to it are
                  occupied by them, and they do not give place to the friendly ministers from
                  heaven; but when these are removed, and the poor heart is famishing for the sweet
                  food of love, then these holy visitants come and bring the food divine, of which
                  the one that eateth shall never hunger.
               The footsteps of those in the chamber of death fell heavily upon the excited ear
                  of Zenaida, and again she moved restlessly, seeking ease for her aching head.
               Mrs. Cabell, Mrs. Thornley, and many others, hearing the news of her sad
                  bereavement, came, with friendly sympathy, to offer consolation; but she shrank
                  from seeing them, murmuring—"Not to-day; I cannot see them."
               The long, weary hours passed, and every stroke of the old clock fell, like the
                  deep tolling of the death-bell, upon Zenaida.
               By her request, her father was to be buried in the corner of the garden, where the
                  weeping-willows waved, where she might feel him always near.
               In a few words Mr. Thornley presented before those who had assembled to pay the
                  last tribute of respect to the departed friend, his many virtues, his retiring,
                  modest goodness, his firm, unwavering trust in Him who is "the Resurrection and
                  the Life." He contrasted the perishable nature of the earthly, with the undying
                  glory of the spiritual body; the cares, the trials, and sufferings of earth, with
                  the joys and bliss of heaven.
               "He sleeps in Jesus," he said, pointing to the still form before him; and no one
                  doubted that it was so; for the holy sweetness, which still lingered on the face
                  of the dead, confirmed his assertion.
               After the dust had been returned to dust, and the silence of the Cottage was no longer broken by the sound of
                  subdued voices and the muffled tread of many feet, the clouds, which had been
                  gathering, dissolved in rain, which beat upon the new-made grave, and tortured the
                  heart of the loving child, who would have sheltered that dear form from the
                  violence of the storm, and wept that she could not.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               DAYS passed, and the reign of Winter was over. The modest violets, with their
                  pretty blue eyes, peered timidly above the ground to reconnoitre; and when they
                  reported that the enemy had deserted the fields, were followed by many of the
                  faint, sweet-scented flowers of early spring.
               The beautiful iris, of many-colored rainbow dyes, the jonquils, narcissi, and many
                  others, appeared above the moist brown earth, or played at "hide-and-seek" among
                  the tender blades of grass, for the first time unheeded by the sad, drooping,
                  tearful eyes of their young mistress, to whom the spring, in lieu of renewed life
                  and happiness, had brought death and desolation.
               The grass grew greener day by day, its bright verdure, sprinkled with the pure,
                  white star-flowers, and golden taraxacum; the brook, emancipated from its icy
                  bondage, murmured musically, and laughed in glee, grateful to the Power which had
                  effected its release; the forest-trees budded forth, giving promise of shady
                  retreats in sultry summer-time, except one in the Cottage-yard, which had been the
                  favorite of Mr. Morris,—as it was awakened, it missed the regard of his kindly
                  eye, the touch of his gentle hand, or the sound of his familiar footstep beneath
                  its branches; so it pined and drooped, the eyes of its flowers closed again, and
                  the tree was dead, like him who had nurtured it.
               The orchard was now in all the glory of its vernal bloom,—the plum-trees, white
                  with the mass of snowy blossoms; the apple-tree, rosy with daintily mingled red
                  and white; the peach, blushing like the cheeks of a young girl: and all the air
                  was murmurous with the hum of bees, which had often lulled the heart of Zenaida
                  with their sweet music. The breezes which came in through the open windows brought
                  many of these flower-leaves, which were laden with sweet messages for Zenaida.
                  They whispered,—"We have been sent to call you forth to take your part in our
                  festival of joy. Linger not; the air is balmy, and beauty and gladness will attend
                  upon your footsteps." But she heard them not, and with a faint, fluttering sigh,
                  they fell at her feet, or were borne back to the outer world. Beauty and gladness,
                  and the brightness of the outer life were not now for her, still shrouded under
                  the pall of death. As she passed them without the loving salutations with which
                  she had been wont to greet them, the flowers raised their bright eyes full of
                  tears; and when some weeds, that had hitherto been excluded with scrupulous care,
                  made their appearance among them, they were in consternation, and wondered at the
                  change which had fallen upon their nurse and protectress. True, she selected some
                  of the most beautiful with which to adorn the last resting-place of her father,
                  which she tended with devotion so untiring, that if the spirit which had animated the dust beneath were
                  cognizant of things here, it must have felt pleasure in the place where its
                  enshrining casket had been hidden; for plants shed upon it the leaves of their
                  brightest flowers; the sound of the running water there fell most softly; the wind
                  sighed plaintively through the waving branches which hung above; there the sod was
                  unpressed by careless feet; and from that holy altar the prayers of his lovely,
                  lonely child ascended to the heaven, where, at God's right hand, they would meet
                  never to be disunited. There the blessing of God descended upon the mourner, and
                  revived and refreshed her drooping spirit, as the dews of heaven the fainting
                  flowers.
               Mrs. Cabell, by Zenaida's request, had written directly to inform Arthur of the
                  death of Mr. Morris, and from his lips Helen heard the sad tidings, shocking to
                  her—but falling less heavily upon her than upon her sister; for her husband's arm
                  supported her, his loved voice breathed words of comfort and consolation. Helen,
                  too, did not fully realize the loss sustained, as did Zenaida, who had watched the
                  gradual deepening of the shadows until the light of life was wholly eclipsed;
                  neither was she, though loving and kind, susceptible of the deep emotion which
                  shook in every fibre the sensitive spirit of Zenaida. She mourned, but she did not
                  refuse to be comforted. The glad light of her eye, the ringing joyousness of her
                  laughter, the bounding motion of her step were chastened and subdued; but a
                  thousand things distracted her attention, and she was not absorbed in the
                  indulgence of sad thoughts, which, for a time, threatened to overwhelm Zenaida in
                  her solitude.
               Helen, pitying the loneliness of her sister, wrote, urging her to leave the sad
                  associations of Willowbrook, to make her home with her. Arthur also seconded this
                  petition in a manner so kind as to call forth blessings on him from the heart he
                  touched so deeply.
               "I will come to you," she wrote in reply, "but not yet. I cannot leave this place,
                  hallowed by so many endearing memories,—these rooms in which I still hear my
                  father's voice and listen for his footstep. I am not afraid to be alone here. The
                  house is haunted, but by a spirit with loving eyes, and tender, pitying smile, who
                  leads me away from the contemplation of death and the grave, and all the sorrows
                  which disturb this fitful dream of life from which it has awakened, and points to
                  the true life beyond the tomb, the infinite glories of which, imagination, in its
                  wildest flight, cannot hope to soar unto.
               "This little place, my sister, is now partly yours; and far from you be the
                  thought of permitting it to become the property of strangers. Your affections,
                  transplanted from this soil into one more genial, have taken root, and twined
                  themselves around new objects; but this spot is dear to me above all other places
                  on earth; and here, under the protecting shadows of these familiar trees, would I
                  pass my days. You will oppose this fancy, will think that I cannot endure to
                  remain here long with none but servants; but it is not so, and will not be; for
                  the guardian spirits of our lost parents will hover around me, and ward off every
                  danger that may threaten. In communion with them my solitude will be reft of its
                  loneliness.
               "My heart beats with liveliest gratitude to you and my brother, and that 'God may
                  reward you both for your kindness
                  ness,' is the prayer of the sister who will ever cherish the deepest love for you.
                  My plans I will state more fully, when they are matured for execution."
               This letter being dispatched, Zenaida, roused from the partial torpor in which her
                  faculties had been merged. She would not be dependent on her brother, or indebted
                  to him for a home, while she was endowed with ability to render herself
                  independent.
               She felt, too, the necessity, for, some employment that would relieve her from the
                  weight of thought, which sometimes, notwithstanding her resignation, was too
                  painful to be borne. She therefore determined to take charge of a class of pupils,
                  if she could succeed in obtaining it through the influence of Mrs. Cabell and her
                  other friends. Mrs. Cabell, at first, tried to dissuade her from her purpose.
               "You," she said, pityingly, "are too fragile, too young and sensitive, to
                  encounter alone the storms of life. Why do you not go to your sister?"
               "The storms, dear lady," replied Zenaida, "will not beat so rudely upon me, or the
                  winds blow go bleakly in this sheltered haven, where my bark now rides; and I know
                  not what strength of endurance, what degree of courage may be developed to meet
                  any emergency that may arise. I cannot go to my sister, for I have, no claim upon
                  Arthur, and I could not, would not consent to live a pensioner upon the bounty
                  even of one so generous and noble as my brother."
               "I will do all that I can for you, my child," said Mrs. Cabell, "and fear not to
                  call upon me in any trials you may have to endure. Your resolution to be
                  independent is commendable, and I pray that you may succeed, and believe that you
                  will; for fortune favors the brave and you deserve a place in that rank."
               Zenaida was incited to this exertion of her powers by another motive, which she
                  did not explain to Mrs. Cabell. She wished to be the sole possessor of the quiet,
                  humble place she had so long called home, which, in the matter-of-fact
                  transactions of business, would have weighed lightly in the balance with gold, but
                  to her was more valuable than the treasury of the earth or deep. She could be
                  economical, and, in time, save enough to purchase the moiety of this small
                  estate.
               Her father had been little troubled by worldly ambition, or the love of gain. He
                  was studious, contemplative, simple in his tastes, and retiring in disposition. In
                  this secluded retreat he had determined to spend the last remaining days of his
                  life; and having food and raiment, he had been content. His protracted illness had
                  absorbed all the money he possessed, and the property left, when divided, would
                  have been a mere pittance.
               So the resolution of Zenaida was formed, and Mrs. Cabell assisted her to carry her
                  plans into execution. Through her instrumentality scholars were obtained, and by
                  her advocacy of her cause all objections were removed. Mrs. Bainbridge objected to
                  the proposed teacher on account of her youth.
               "My dear Antoinette," said Mrs. Cabell, "if she is young in years she is old in
                  discretion and knowledge. I assure you, and I know her well, that you may resign
                  Amy to her with implicit confidence, for her mind will be cultivated, her manners
                  refined, and her heart will not be neglected."
               
               Amy was wild with delight at the prospect of being with her friend, for whom her
                  childish attachment continued unabated; and when the morning arrived upon which a
                  new phase of life was to be entered by Zenaida, the bright child donned her
                  sun-bonnet, hunted up her little book, and, with hearts full of pleasure, danced
                  along the path to the Cottage, into which she came like a bright-plumed
                  singing-bird, bringing the light of heaven in her blue eyes, the melody of birds
                  and rippling waters in her clear laughter, the glory of golden sunlight on her
                  bright, curly head, and the untainted purity of snow-white fragrant flowers, in
                  her young, guileless, and affectionate heart.
               The heart of Zenaida, ever open to the glad influences of childhood such as this,
                  welcomed this little minister of joy; and much pleasure did she promise herself,
                  in writing lessons of wisdom and holiness upon the white tablets of this unstained
                  immortal soul.
               "Her task would be an easy one," she thought, "were all her pupils docile as Amy,
                  who drank the cup of varied knowledge eagerly, as the thirsting earth drinks up
                  the welcome rain."
               The little band of restless, bright-eyed, happy creatures, who now daily gathered
                  round her, presented, before Zenaida study new and interesting. So many minds, and
                  all differing, as their owners did in form and feature! so many hearts, in which
                  it was her privilege to sow good seed, and root out the weeds of evil, which
                  sometimes appeared even in this virgin soil! The lessons she had learned from
                  Nature she imparted to them; and thus loving and being loved, actively employed in
                  training these little human plants, that they might adorn the fair garden of God's
                  earth, instead of repining at the sad solitariness of her lot, she passed the
                  time, while days glided into weeks—spring into summer, with its beaming, intense
                  splendor; summer into autumn, crowned with ripened grains and luscious fruits;
                  autumn into winter, which brought vividly before her the last winter, her long
                  watch by the bed of sickness, and all those sorrows never to be forgotten. Thus
                  musing, her eyes, when a book was held before her by little hands, were often so
                  clouded by the mist of tears that the words were rendered illegible.
               During all these months, little Amy had been the chosen companion of Zenaida. She
                  walked with her in the forest shades; sat beneath the canopies formed by the dense
                  foliage of wild grape-vines; knelt with her by her father's grave, her young heart
                  subdued by the solemnity of her friend's face, and from her she learned to lisp
                  the prayers which fall so sweetly from the cherub lips of the little child.
               The sweetest flowers, the rosiest peaches, the brightest apples, the largest
                  bunches of grapes, and the loving kisses from her own balmy mouth, were the
                  offerings she made to her orphan instructress who could not have, loved the fair,
                  gentle child more if she had been her sister.
               The greatest pleasure Amy enjoyed was when she was permitted to spend Saturday at
                  the Cottage. She would trip, with flying feet, over the house—chirp to the
                  canary-bird—peep into the nests of the little wrens, which were half hidden among
                  the honeysuckles and roses round the windows—would feed the flock of little downy,
                  silken chickens with which "black mammy's" yard was swarmed—run races with Beppo
                  to the brook, into which he would plunge, scattering tering on all sides the fleet of ducks lazily
                  floating upon its surface then, back to the house, almost breathless, to tell the
                  wonders she had seen. Here she would sit upon a low seat, leaning in the lap of
                  Zenaida, watching her fingers as they plied the busy needle, or decorated with gay
                  ribbons a wondrous doll, with rolling eyes and flaxen curls, which Amy thought
                  beyond compare in point of beauty.
               When the evening came, she would gaze with hushed breath and parted lip upon the
                  clouds, at first baptized in a flood of crimson and golden radiance, gradually
                  melting into rosy pink and yellow so pale as to seem almost colorless, tracing in
                  their masses many forms with which her eye was familiar on earth; then as twilight
                  fell like a veil, rendering indistinct the landscape, she would nestle close to
                  the bosom of Zenaida, awed by the sweet stillness of the hour. As the stars same
                  forth, and she caught their twinkling radiance through the leafy branches of the
                  trees, many were the questions asked and answered concerning those distant worlds
                  of light.
               "They are so pretty, Cousin 'Naida!" said Amy. "Does God live in the stars?"
               "Yes, darling," she replied; "God is everywhere."
               The heart of little Amy, under these holy influences, received the impression of
                  good, which all after-discipline in the fashions and follies of the world would
                  fail to erase.
               Mrs. Bainbridge was not an unkind or careless mother; but she loved the world and
                  its vanities more than the souls of her children. She was more anxious that her
                  daughters should be admired for their fashionable accomplishments, than for
                  unpretending goodness and incorruptible excellence of moral character. Her aim in
                  raising them was to qualify them to adorn society here, not to prepare them to
                  shine as stars among the redeemed in heaven.
               Hamilton was the brightest examples of this system, among her children. He could
                  dance in a manner which rendered him most welcome at balls and parties; he could
                  sing and play upon the guitar most bewitchingly; his hands, unstained and
                  unhardened by labor even of the lightest description, were like a girl's, adorned
                  with sparkling diamonds, which be displayed to best advantage. Many of the young
                  ladies called him "a dear love," "a delightful creature;" but in all more manly
                  accomplishments, all knowledge most valuable, he was sadly deficient. Upon points
                  of etiquette and fashions of dress, he was an authority infallible, and of the
                  discussion of themes of this nature he never wearied; but religion, politics,
                  literature, science, and art, bored him to death. He rose late, voted the beauties
                  of a sunrise entirely fabulous, and, in dressing-gown and slippers, (the latter of
                  velvet embroidered in gold, the gift of some admiring juvenile feminine,) lounged
                  idly in an easy chair, puffed leisurely an odorous cigar, and watched, in a mirror
                  before him, the growth and graceful tendency of his mustache.
               Beatrice was not so inane as her brother. She had some knowledge, but no wisdom—no
                  tact in the application of it; therefore it profited her but little. The other
                  daughter, Alice, had none of the disagreeableness of Hamilton and Beatrice, and
                  was more beloved than either by her father, but not so high in the favor of her
                  mother. Amy, sweet Amy, was the brightest jewel in the parental crown—the pure pearl without flaw or blemish;
                  and, from her beauty, vivacity, and grace, Mrs. Bainbridge augured hopefully a
                  brilliant success in society, a grand moneyed alliance—never dreaming that her
                  plans could be thwarted, that her gorgeous castles, which she was prospectively
                  building, could be leveled in the dust of disappointment.
               They would leave Maplehurst this winter for L——; but the thought of leaving this
                  sweet, rural retirement, brought no sadness to any of the family, save Amy and Mr.
                  Bainbridge, senior, whose heart died within him at the thought of all the long
                  lines of figures he would have to look over—all the big bills and little bills,
                  which he would be called upon to settle, for this ensuing winter's dissipation and
                  extravagance; but his grief on this subject was silent, for he dared not give it
                  utterance in hearing of his wife or Beatrice, the dictum of these ladies being
                  law. The day appointed for their exodus finally arrived, and the family of
                  Bainbridge, the dutiful, was removed from beautiful Maplehurst, with its wooded
                  lawn, winding footpaths, silvery lakelet, and romantic dells, and transferred to
                  an elegant and spacious mansion in —— street.
               Zenaida now received another letter from Helen, renewing her former entreaty.
               "My sister," she wrote, "you will not again refuse to come to me, when I tell you
                  that a new light has dawned upon my life, shed from the day-star of my hopes—the
                  brightest pair of little eyes mine ever looked upon. My baby-boy! how shall I, in
                  the fullness of my heart, find words wherewith I may describe him, the crowning
                  drop in my cup of bliss? I call him 'Henry Morris,' for the father who was so dear
                  in life, whose memory is yet green in my soul—whose name will, I trust, be
                  perpetuated by my boy.
               "Now, sissy, can you have the heart to resist this great attraction, in addition
                  to the society of Arthur and myself? I think not. My little Henry is now two
                  months old, and is so good, that I know you will love him for his own sweet sake
                  as well as for mine, and for the name he bears. I shall be disappointed if you do
                  not accept this invitation."
               She could no longer resist, and resolved to go, though with the intention of
                  returning to her home when her visit was concluded. Her preparations
                  being made, she, at last confided the house and garden to mammy, the remainder of
                  the place to Uncle Harry, both of whom were sorely grieved at parting with their
                  "darling."
               She then visited every place of favorite resort, and at last knelt beside the
                  grave of that dear lost and unforgotten father. The flowers, "nipped in the bud by
                  the frost," were wet with her tears—the marble, which marked the grave and bore
                  the name so fondly cherished by both sisters, was pressed by her quivering lips—an
                  inaudible prayer was breathed in her heart, and, with slow, lingering steps and
                  backward glance, she turned from this hallowed spot, perhaps never to look upon it
                  again, unless in dreams.
               Under the protection of a gentleman from the neighboring town, she commenced her
                  journey, which was without any incident of interest. At first, every object along
                  the route was noted by her eyes, pleased with novelty; but as they drew near their
                  destination, the heart of Zenaida was busy with memories of the past, the happy
                  past, when the links in their home-chain of love were unsevered by the ruthless hand of death or absence, and that time
                  was contrasted painfully with the present—her father in heaven, her sister and
                  herself changed by the lapse of time, by cares and sorrows which had broken up the
                  thornless pathway of flowers they formerly had trod, and strewed it o'er with
                  thorns. But even as she thus thought, she reproached herself; for if she had had
                  some sorrows, she had also many joys, many blessings, for which she was not
                  ungrateful.
               At last she stood before her sister's door; in her agitation at the thought of
                  seeing her, casting only a hasty glance around upon the pretty yard, the pointed
                  arches, and irregular corners of the house. She inquired for Mrs. Bernard, without
                  announcing her own name; and, with beating heart and quickened pulse, awaited the
                  entrance of her sister.
               She came, and Zenaida beheld the same beautiful Helen that she so loved to look
                  upon, but more stately in her manner. She advanced gracefully to salute, as she
                  thought, some stranger or acquaintance, when the veil was thrown aside, revealing
                  the face of her sister. She sprang forward with a cry of joy, and clasped her
                  closely in her embrace; but as she felt the trembling of the form she held, the
                  thought of the father who stood beside them when they last embraced, now never to
                  be seen by her again, came over her, and the smiles were changed to tears.
               Soon with reviving brightness she led the way to her own room, and, with a look of
                  pride mingled with deepest love, drew aside the curtain, which concealed the
                  sleeping form of little Henry.
               "Here, sissy, is my baby. I must introduce you to him," she said, smiling; "for
                  your visit is made to him; all the entreaties of Arthur and myself having proved
                  unavailing, until we lured you hither by promising you a sight of this
                  baby-beauty. I know you will not think it a mother's partiality only that sees
                  beauty in that face."
               The boy, whose dark, glossy hair, clear complexion, and regular features were the
                  miniature of his mother, was sweetly sleeping; a bright smile sometimes curling
                  his rosy lips and dimpling his cheeks while these two sisters, with arms
                  intertwined, gazed upon him—the one with heart stirred to its inmost depths by all
                  the holy, self-sacrificing devotion of the mother's love; the other lost in
                  admiration of his beauty, almost holding her breath, lest, the sound of it might
                  dissolve the spell of blissful dreams which wrapped the little sleeper, or drive
                  away the guardian spirits who hovered over him, and soothed his slumbers with
                  whispered melodies.
               While they thus stood, the dark-fringed lids which veiled his soft, bright eyes,
                  were raised, disclosing their loveliness, and awakening fresh admiration in the
                  heart of Zenaida. These pretty eyes wandered at first, but finally settled upon
                  his mother's face, which he recognized with a smile, holding out his hands to her.
                  Helen raised him, tenderly, presented his soft lips to Zenaida for her first kiss,
                  and then sat down with this treasure clasped closely in her arms to listen to the
                  narration of all that had befallen Zenaida during the period of their separation.
                  This recital she often interrupted with tearful remonstrances.
               "Why did you stay at the Cottage, my little sister," she said, "all this long,
                  weary time, when my house and heart were open to receive you? You taught school
                  with the hope of making enough to
                  purchase my portion of our little property, did you? Poor child! Our father left
                  me protected from poverty and labor by the manly arm of my noble husband, and had
                  he made a will, would no doubt have left Willowbrook to you; and, with Arthur's
                  approbation, I will renounce all my claims upon it in your favor."
               "You are too kind, too generous," sobbed Zenaida.
               "Do you for one moment think," responded Helen, "that I or Arthur would receive
                  from you money earned by the weariness of your fragile frame, the dimming of your
                  sweet eyes, and the bowing of your fair head? Nay, my sister, you judged us
                  coldly, by a worldly standard, by which our deeds are not always measured."
               "Forgive me, Helen," said Zenaida, overcome by her kind vehemence.
               "Come, little sis," said Helen, cheerfully, "dry your eyes, and take Henry while I
                  change my dress, and prepare to receive Arthur, who will soon be here."
               "You cannot imagine," she continued, "how he has improved, how handsome he is, how
                  very, very kind!" her voice quivered with emotion. "But," she concluded, laughing,
                  and pointing to Harry, who reclined peacefully in the arms of his new-found aunt,
                  "that child has entirely eclipsed me in his regard, for he is Arthur's idol."
               "Brother Arthur," Zenaida answered, "was always sufficiently handsome, and if he
                  has improved so much, I shall be completely overwhelmed at the sight of so perfect
                  a model of manly grace and beauty. But I will make all due allowance for the
                  partial eyes with which you behold him, and shall expect to see him more dignified
                  in manner, more abundantly be-whiskered, but handsomer only in your eyes."
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               WHEN Arthur came, his welcome to Zenaida was most cordial and brother-like, and
                  she acknowledged that Helen was right when she said that he was improved, and well
                  might she be proud of him.
               His generous, kind heart, beamed forth in the joyous light of his laughing, dark
                  eyes; and the pleasant smile which often parted his lips, disclosed to view teeth
                  almost incredibly white. His manner was dignified, but not entirely divested of
                  the frank impetuosity of earlier years; his brow was unruffled, for he never
                  permitted the cares of business to darken the light of his happy home, where he
                  basked in the sunshine of love.
               There are many homes, where, upon entrance, a chill strikes the heart and benumbs
                  the warmest affections; but this home was not one of these. Its influence was
                  genial and grateful as the balmiest airs of fragrant spring, and under it the
                  frozen heart thawed and expanded.
               On this evening, Arthur was ensconced before the cheerful fire, at one time trying
                  to call forth a smile upon the face of little Henry, then making many kind
                  inquiries of Zenaida, concerning everything and everybody at the Cottage,
                  laughingly reminding Helen of their old trysting-places, the incidents of their
                  acquaintance, and courtship; delighted if he could succeed in mantling her cheek
                  with a rosy blush.
               "Helen," he said, "has never given up the pretty girlish habit of blushing, and I am glad she has not, for
                  we gentlemen all admire blushes very much. I think they are very becoming to
                  Helen; have always thought so since I first saw her at Cabell Manor."
               "How do you like our home?" he said, turning to Zenaida. "I am sorry that you see
                  it for the first time in winter; for now its aspect is not most inviting, and I do
                  not wish you to be drawing invidious comparisons between Willowbrook and this
                     dulce domum of mine."
               "I am not prepared to draw comparisons, or pass judgment on this 'dulce domum,'" she replied, "for I have not yet seen
                  it, I have been so engrossed with Harry, Helen, and yourself."
               "You are a wise girl," said Arthur; "for I flatter myself that we are much more
                  worthy of attention and observation than any pile of bricks and mortar.
                  By-the-way, Helen," he continued, as if a bright thought had struck him, "you and
                  I must enter into a conspiracy to prevent the return of our little sister to the
                  single-blessedness of life at Willowbrook. Let me see if I cannot, among all my
                  acquaintances, find one that will be able to captivate her fancy. There's Paul
                  Anderson; even you, Helen, allow him to be almost as good-looking as myself—and he
                  is a clever fellow. You shake your head at Paul! Well, I must think again. Frank
                  Churchill? What say you? Dissipated? Well, so he is, and I would not trust our
                  sister to him, talented as he undoubtedly is. There's Bruce Wilson," he continued,
                  raising his head, and relaxing into a smile; "I always feel amused when I think of
                  him, he is so comical; but he will not answer the present purpose. Helen, help me
                  out, for I cannot think of any one just now, though I know scores of young
                  men."
               "Now, brother," interposed Zenaida, laughing at his perplexity, "I protest against
                  your taxing your brain and Helen's with the effort to find one who will be able to
                  steal away my heart, perhaps, without giving me one in return; for I am content
                  with my lot, and were I to change, it might be for worse instead of better."
               "Fair skeptic," replied Arthur, "I have no fear that you will find it difficult to
                  win hearts in return for the one you have to give; and I intend to use my utmost
                  endeavors to prevent the odious epithet 'old maid,' from being attached to the
                  fair Zenaida Morris."
               "Your epithet, brother," she replied, "would be much more agreeable
                  to the ears of most ladies; but to me, there is no odium properly attached to the
                  term 'old maid,' which you speak with so scornful a curl of the lip. I am an
                  ardent admirer of the heroic element in human character, and, to my mind, there is
                  something of the sublimity of moral heroism in the self-abnegation of the life of
                  a reviled 'old maid,' devoting her time, her talents, to the service of the
                  ungrateful, who repay her kindness by reproaching her with her old-maidism.
                  Instead of being persons to be pointed at by the finger of scorn, there are many,
                  in the ranks of single women, of whom the world is not worthy."
               "There, stop, I beseech you!" exclaimed Arthur; "you really frighten me by your
                  eloquent advocacy of a class most truly obnoxious. I divide the class into two
                  genera—the voluntary old maid, and the one from necessity. The first amuse
                  themselves petting cats, dogs, birds, and other people's children; the latter derive their chief
                  pleasure from inflicting tortures, more ingenious than those of the Grand
                  Inquisition, upon these same animals."
               "Oh, brother!" said Zenaida, laughing; "you ought to be prosecuted for slander. I
                  believe I will spend the remainder of my days at Willowbrook alone, that I may
                  give you an example that will refute all this heresy of yours."
               "I have at last thought of one, who can change this resolution," he said,
                  triumphantly; "why could I not think of him at first?"
               "Who is it?" inquired Helen, while Zenaida listened attentively for the answer to
                  her query.
               "Allan Elliott," he replied.
               "Allan Elliott!" echoed, Zenaida; "that is a pretty, musical name; but what have
                  you to say in favor of him?"
               "I will say nothing," he replied, "for I cannot hope to do justice to his
                  incomparable attractions. You must judge for yourself; but I warn you to guard
                  your heart if you do not wish to lose it."
               "Forewarned, forearmed," she laughed; "never fear, brother Arthur."
               "Allan I do not know," said Helen; "I have seen him, and have heard him highly
                  commended by some of my friends."
               Here the conversation ended for the night; Zenaida retiring early on account of
                  her fatigue after traveling.
               "This," said Helen, opening a door and ushering her into a pretty room, where
                  every article of furniture reflected the dancing fire-light, "is your room, which
                  has been prepared for your reception, and has awaited your coming almost
                  despairingly, as I have done for many months."
               "You are very, very kind," murmured Zenaida, brushing the gathering moisture from
                  her eyes, that she might survey the various appointments of the room; "it is a
                  very nice room, much prettier than our old apartment at Willowbrook; but I think
                  it will take some time to make me love it as well; though I love it already,
                  because your dear hand has arranged it, and all for me."
               "Come, sis, don't think of anything too solemn to-night," said Helen; "whatever
                  you dream will certainly come to pass; and that Arthur's predictions may be
                  verified, you must dream of Allan Elliott."
               She imprinted a kiss, her good-night salutation, upon the brow of Zenaida, and, as
                  she closed the door, laughingly said, "Do not forget to dream according to
                  directions."
               Deeply grateful for the kindness with which she had been welcomed, and the care,
                  which had prepared everything for her comfort that she could wish, Zenaida bowed
                  her fair head in prayer, calling down the blessings of Heaven upon the loving
                  brother and sister with whom she had that day been united.
               Castle-building in imagination was one of her pastimes, and, that night, visions
                  of the future which might await her rose before her, and in her ears rang the name
                  of Allan Elliott. She sought to escape from the pursuing sound by falling asleep;
                  but, in dreams, spirit-voices still whispered the magic name. In the morning she
                  smiled at the haunting visions of the night; but when Helen asked "If she had
                  obeyed her instructions about dreaming?" she blushed so, that she was convinced
                  she had.
               Arthur left for the city immediately after breakfast, and Zenaida roamed over the house, yard, and garden,
                  admiring the simplicity and perfect neatness with which everything was arranged.
                  The day passed pleasantly. They were interrupted by no visitors, and had leisure
                  to talk of many things, which had been forgotten the previous day.
               Zenaida never wearied of the contemplation of the beautiful baby—in his peaceful
                  sleep, or waking smiles; and when Arthur returned at night, she was surprised, the
                  hours had slipped away so unconsciously.
               "Well, Zenaida," he began, while they were seated at supper, "I have to-day seen
                  all those young gentlemen of whom I spoke last night, except Allan Elliott, and it
                  is with deep regret that I communicate the intelligence gained concerning
                  him."
               "Is he going to be married?" she inquired; "you know 'the best-laid plans of mice
                  and men,' are apt to be frustrated by the intervention of some unforeseen
                  circumstance. I condole with you, brother, upon your disappointment."
               "Like every woman," said Arthur, smiling, "you have jumped at your conclusions,
                  which are founded upon a mere hypothesis. Allan is not about to join the ranks of
                  married men; but I have to tell you that he is absent from the city, and I could
                  not ascertain the time appointed for his return."
               "Is that all?" she said. "You opened the parley with a flourish of trumpets, that
                  would not have disgraced the incomparable Anthony Van Corlear; and I was certain
                  that you had some direful intelligence wherewith you might distress me."
               "Until his return," said Arthur, "I must tax my ingenuity nuity to keep you in
                  fine spirits. Perhaps I may find some coadjutor who will serve as Elliott's
                  substitute, though 'you must walk in maiden meditation, fancy-free,' until you see
                  him."
               "I am so sorry to cause you such trouble," said Zenaida, with assumed seriousness,
                  "that I will be compelled to release you by returning to Willowbrook."
               "I veto that proposition most decidedly," replied Arthur; "but have no fear that I
                  shall hear the repetition of that threat, after you have seen Allan."
               
               The ground being now covered with snow, many sleighs daily passed Hawthornden;
                  and, one evening, a dashing vehicle of this description, adorned with many bells,
                  the merry sound of which pealed forth clearly, on the frosty air, and drawn by a
                  pair of spirited black horses, was driven up to the gate, and from it alighted
                  Messrs. Paul Anderson and Bruce Wilson.
               They had learned from Arthur that Mrs. Bernard's sister, the beautiful Miss
                  Morris, was now with them, and, at the instigation of Bruce, they drove out that
                  they might behold and judge of this beauty. Both being well acquainted with Helen,
                  without hesitation they walked up the graveled path, knocked, and were admitted
                  into the parlor, where the glowing coal-fire contrasted pleasantly with the bleak
                  cold without.
               While they were waiting for the entrance of the ladies, Bruce leisurely surveyed
                  everything the apartment contained, and, turning to Paul, exclaimed—
               "By Jupiter, Saul, my boy! our friend Bernard is a lucky dog, with a snug home like this, and a wife
                  beautiful as the Houris of Mahomet's Paradise—worth half a dozen of the artificial
                  beauties of our metropolis, although she brought him no fortune but her own fair
                  self. If her sister is as charming as she, I shall be almost tempted to forswear,
                  for her sake, all the delights of a bachelor's life."
               "Take care, Bruce," said Paul, admonitorily, "or you will be haltered for life ere
                  you are aware; and then farewell to bachelor's clubs, champagne parties,
                  billiards, et id omne genus; for these angels,
                  when once they assume the guardianship of a man, are more strict than the
                  straitest-laced old uncle or guardian, or governor of any kind alive."
               "Well," replied Bruce, "I am perfectly resigned to my fate; and that, you know,
                  compels me to worship every pretty face I see; but, my dear fellow, subside into a
                  state of imperturbable quiescence, for I hear the light footsteps of Mrs. Bernard
                  approaching. If the beautiful sister be with her, prepare, for her benefit, your
                  most killing bow—so;" and, suiting the action to the word, he was bowing
                  gracefully to the door, when Helen opened it and entered.
               He was never confused, or at a loss for words. He saw the smile upon Helen's face,
                  and knew that it was called forth by her having caught him practicing bowing at a
                  mark; but he advanced to meet her, exclaiming—
               "Fairest and most gracious of ladies, behold your most obedient, humble servant.
                  Think not, I beseech you, that I was converting your house into a gymnasium, which
                  thought might be justified by my action just as you were entering. My friend Paul
                  here, is,you know, sadly deficient in all graceful accomplishments, and I was
                  giving him practical instruction, that he might greet you with a reverence worthy
                  of your fair ladyship."
               "No apology is necessary, Mr. Wilson," said Helen, laughing; "your reverence was
                  perfectly satisfactory to myself—more so than the explanation can be to Mr.
                  Anderson."
               With this remark,, she turned to greet Paul, or Saul, as Bruce usually called
                  him.
               Zenaida soon appeared; her deep-mourning dress making her fair face still more
                  fair by contrast. Her cheeks glowed with rosy freshness, her blue eyes sparkled,
                  and Bruce thought "she is very pretty, but not so brilliantly beautiful as Mrs.
                  B——."
               At first she was shy, as in olden days; but Bruce was not abashed by her reserve,
                  and determined to conquer it; so while Paul conversed with Helen, he told her
                  anecdotes; gave her an account of an upset in a snow-bank which he had given Paul
                  as they were coming out, when Paul thought he was killed; and in laughing at his
                  comicalities, her timidity soon vanished. His gayety was infectious, and they
                  chatted so merrily and amicably, that when they rose to go, Bruce was so pleased
                  with the "little soft-eyed beauty," as he afterwards denominated her, that he
                  could not repress this exclamation:—
               "Miss Morris, if our acquaintance were not of so very recent a date, I would ask
                  you to take a sleigh-ride with me while this snow lasts. To my ear, the
                  tintinnabulation of the sleigh-bells is the most exhilarating music in the world.
                  I would like you to enjoy this mimic chime of mine."
               
               "But you might upset me in a snow-drift, as you did Mr. Anderson," she replied,
                  archly; "and if that were the case, I fear the musical chime of your mimic bells
                  would be wasted upon an unappreciative listener."
               "Heaven forbid!" ejaculated Bruce, fervently; "I owed Paul that tumble in the
                  snow, for a practical joke he played upon me not long since; but, when I have the
                  pleasure of driving you, I will guide my horses with all the skill I can
                  command."
               "I believe you," she replied.
               "And will you 'show your faith by your works;' will you trust me?" he
                  inquired.
               "The only way to prove a person's trustworthiness is by reposing confidence in
                  him," she replied.
               "That is equivalent to a direct affirmative," said Bruce, joyfully.
               
               After they left Hawthornden, Bruce was in such raptures, that Paul could not gain
                  his attention in any way; but was constrained to listen with a show of patience to
                  his praises of Zenaida.
               "Saulus, my dear Fellow," he began, "I went to Hawthornden the happy possessor of
                  a heart I could call my own; and now, alas! I have none, it having surrendered at
                  discretion to that sweet, brown-haired, blue-eyed, bewitching little fairy. She
                  was at first shy as a wood-pigeon; but that only rendered her more charming."
               "For sweet pity's sake, Bruce," sighed Paul, "do not compel me, nolens volens, to listen to these rhapsodies; and have
                  mercy on Miss Morris. Do not overwhelm her, pretty as she is, with such a flood of
                  epithets; but economize your breath and words, or you will have none left
                  wherewith to address this little divinity whom you have so suddenly elevated upon
                  the altar of your most susceptible of all hearts."
               "Deuce take me!" replied Bruce, "if I don't think you had better practice what you
                  preach; for your speech is longer than mine. But I am glad that you are not
                  disposed to go into the seraphics, about 'la belle Morris;' for I am rid of a
                  dangerous rival without the trouble of shooting him, or unhorsing him; if you
                  decline to enter the lists to compete for this fair prize."
               "By-the-way, Bruce!" exclaimed Paul, "what has become of all the other fair
                  demoiselles to whom you have vowed eternal fidelity—Katy Lorrimer, Sue Brownley,
                  Irene Miller, and so on ad infinitum? Are they
                  all eclipsed by the superior radiance of this new light, that has just dawned upon
                  you?"
               "Katy is to be married soon," replied Bruce. "Sue I loved much, the Miller more;
                  but the Morris I love most— 
                     
                        'Oh! there's nothing half so sweet in life,
                        As Love's young dream,'"
                     
                   he sung; "you may take my word for it, callous-hearted creature that you are,
                  Paul."
               "Angels and ministers of grace defend you!" said Paul; "your heart is like
                  Althea's brand; or rather like the liver of Prometheus, devoured by this vulture
                  you denominate Love, but growing out again while its beak is still whetted upon
                  it. But here we are at last in the city, and most heartily do I congratulate Paul Anderson, Esq., on
                  being, for a short time, free from the rhapsodies of the love-lorn swain, Bruce
                  Wilson. I have an unpostponable engagement which compels me to say adieu."
               With a mock reverence Paul walked off, leaving Bruce to his meditations.
               "I have some engagements, too," he said, consulting his tablets. "'But what's this
                  dull town to me,' when the Morris is in the country?"
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               "WELL, Zenaida," said Arthur when he had received an account of the evening's
                  visit, "were you fascinated by the handsome face of Paul, or the comicalities of
                  Bruce?"
               "By neither," she replied; "I am obeying you, reserving my heart, and fortifying
                  it, in the mean while, for the attack upon it which you anticipate from the
                  skillful tactician, Mr. Elliott."
               "So," said Arthur, "Allan will find the citadel with portcullis down, sentinels on
                  the ramparts, every loop-hole bristling with formidable weapons for defence and
                  the occupant prepared for a long siege? Useless precautions, for he will carry the
                  fortress by assault?"
               "From your confident vaticinations, brother mine, I begin to fear that you are a
                  soothsayer, endowed with the faculty of foretelling events which are now concealed
                  in the arcana of the future. Helen," she called to her sister, "did you know you
                  had married a wizard? He is here prophesying with the assurance of the Delphian
                  Oracle!"
               "Well," replied Helen, "he is always the prophet of good, not of evil."
               Zenaida shook her head doubtingly.
               "I," said Arthur, "I tell you the truth; but you are like the Trojans, who refused
                  to listen to the prophesies of Cassandra."
               "Here, Zenaida," he said again, after a pause, "is a book I brought from town; I
                  had forgotten it; I wish you would take it and read it aloud."
               "I will do so with pleasure," she replied.
               
               Several days passed, and Zenaida had forgotten Bruce Wilson's expression of a
                  desire to take her sleighing, when, lo! his handsome sleigh and glossy black
                  horses arrived, and Bruce presented himself before Helen, who sat in the parlor.
                  Without circumlocution, he made known the object of his visit.
               "Come, sis," said Helen, with a merry twinkle in her eyes, as she entered the room
                  where Zenaida sat; "don your cloak, bonnet, and furs, and prepare for a
                  sleigh-ride with Bruce Wilson. He is, or appears to be, impatient to be off; so do
                  not keep him in suspense."
               "I hope he will not be the unintentional cause of a dislocation of my neck," said
                  Zenaida. "Are his horses very wild?" she continued, looking out of the window at
                  the beautiful creatures, which were tossing their heads so that Marcus, the black
                  boy, could scarcely hold them.
               "Wild as Arabs of the desert, and fleet and spirited as the heaven-born coursers of Achilles," replied Helen;
                  "but Bruce has them completely under his control, though they spurn the guidance
                  of others."
               The day was beautifully clear, the air keen and bracing, the sunlight reflected
                  joyously by the diamond-dust of the snow. Bruce was in fine spirits; Zenaida
                  admired the beauty, the graceful pride which arched the necks of the horses, and
                  lifted their feet as if they disdained the common earth. They danced merrily to
                  the gay tinking of the bells, and seemed as if they were trying to call forth
                  encomiums from the fair lady they carried.
               Bruce listened, with pleasure sparkling in his laughing, brown eyes, to the
                  praises, so well merited, bestowed on his pets, which delighted him almost as much
                  as they would have done had he been the subject of her commendations. He gazed
                  with admiration upon the face of his fair companion, so animated as to be nearly
                  divested of the mournful sweetness which usually characterized its expression.
               "Anderson would not laugh at my raptures could he see her now!" he mentally
                  exclaimed; "for the light, which beams upon me from the heaven of those blue eyes,
                  is sufficient to melt even his obdurate heart."
               "Miss Morris, he said, at parting, "you have placed me under everlasting
                  obligations, by so kindly consenting to risk your life with my wild self, and
                  wilder horses."
               "There was no risk," laughed Zenaida; "for my charioteer was more skillful than
                  Phaëton, and I knew we would keep the right course. It is you who have conferred
                  pleasure upon me, by giving me a ride so delightful."
               After his return to the city, Bruce met Paul Anderson, and saluted him
                  with—"Saulus, my boy, I am on the very pinnacle of bliss!"
               "What's the matter now?" said Paul.
               "I have this day enjoyed the felicity of sitting by the side of the beautiful Miss
                  Morris, during a sleigh-ride; and, upon honor, I declare that her voice is more
                  musical than the softest murmur of the wind over an Æolian harp—her eyes more blue
                  than the deep-blue vault of heaven, and dancing with the light of joy, as the
                  streamlet in the sunshine of spring—her cheeks like translucent pearl, through
                  which the color gleams with a rosy glow—her mouth like the newly-opened rose-bud,
                  with the dewy-freshness of morning still upon it—her breath more fragrant than the
                  south wind, which has passed over a bed of violets!"
               "Well!" whistled Paul, drawing a long breath; "the stock of simile and hyperbole
                  is, I hope, at last exhausted! Oh, what a dire misfortune it is for a man to be
                  the repository of the love-secrets of another! I am," he continued, rising and
                  drawing on his gloves, "going down street. Shall I call and consult your
                  physician? But it would be useless, for 'who can minister to the mind diseased?'
                  The only remedy for this Morris-mania, with which you are so terribly afflicted,
                  is in the possession of the young lady herself—'Similia
                     similibus curantur!' She has infused this sweet, destructive
                  poison—she must administer the antidote. Have you made a favorable impression on
                  her heart, think you?"
               "Don't know," replied Bruce, dubiously; "have been so busy falling in love myself,
                  that I have not stopped to consider whether she has followed my example. Will
                  watch her closely next time. Dog on it,
                  Paul!" he continued, after having relapsed into a silence of several minutes'
                  duration, "why did you, like an evil genius, dash from my lips the cup of bliss
                  from which I was quaffing ambrosial nectar of the gods? But, for vengeance' sake,
                  I will follow you as closely as the Old Man of the Sea did Sinbad the Sailor. You
                  are going to walk, so will I. Only wait till I have finished this cigar, the fumes
                  of which are more odorous than all the spices of Araby the blest, or the breezes
                  that blow from the cinnamon-groves o'er the island of Ceylon!"
               The cigar disposed of, he walked up to a large mirror, arranged the masses of his
                  luxuriant hair, smiled complacently at the reflected image; but he was not just
                  now in the humor to gaze upon this semblance of himself until, Narcissus-like, he
                  died for the sake of his own dear loveliness; so he turned away, remarking to
                  himself—"Mr. Wilson, you are quite a handsome individual, and I am afraid you work
                  a great deal of mischief with those wicked brown eyes of yours!"
               "Bruce," interrupted Paul, impatiently, "with your love and your vanity, you are
                  enough to try the patience of Job!"
               "Instead of scolding me," replied Bruce, "you ought to be deeply indebted to me
                  for practicing you in the Christian virtue of patience; but, come on."
               They sauntered leisurely along, and had not proceeded far, when Paul descried two
                  ladies approaching, one of whom he recognized as Miss Beatrice Bainbridge; the
                  other was Miss Lorrimer, the quondam ladye-love of Bruce.
               Paul was quite a favorite with Miss Bainbridge, who pronounced him "so
                  aristocratic;" then "that haughty look and slightly scornful curl of his lip, more
                  finely chiseled than the most exquisite piece of sculptures, were so becoming;"
                  and, as she passed, Beatrice cast upon him a look of tender reproach, for Paul's
                  visits to her had of late been, "like angel's visits, few and far between."
               Had the lady been aware that the "haughty look and scornful smile" were assumed in
                  honor of her own fair self, her admiration of their becomingness and beauty would
                  have suffered considerable diminution; but 
                     
                        "Where ignorance is bliss,
                        'Tis folly to be wise:"
                     
                   so she sailed on with unimpaired self-satisfaction, thinking that, by that
                  reproachful, well-timed glance from her bewildering eyes, she had brought back her
                  recreant knight to his former allegiance. She did not doubt that she had once led
                  him captive.
               "Who is she, Paul?" inquired Bruce, when the ladies were at some distance. "You
                  ought to feel proud of a loving look like that, cast from such a pair of liquid
                  Italian eyes as hers."
               "Plague take the woman!" muttered Paul. "She is so blinded by her vanity, that she
                  imagines I am in love with her, or, at least, that I was once. I used to amuse
                  myself with her absurdities; but they have long since lost the charm of novelty,
                  the only charm they ever possessed, and now she is utterly unendurable."
               "Hem!" ejaculated Bruce; "strong language, very. Think from it that you must have
                  some particular cause for your aversion to this most gracious princess. Perhaps
                     the cynicism of my friend has been
                  superinduced by his acquaintance with this fair authoress of his
                  'Rejected Addresses.' Who knows?"
               "Don't be absurd, Bruce!" said Paul, loftily.
               "I have never been able to account for his seeming indifference to the attractions
                  of beauty; but a supposed case, founded upon his rejection by this lady, makes his
                  indifference a natural consequent, no longer difficult to be accounted for,"
                  continued Bruce, soliloquizing audibly.
               "Bruce," said Paul, almost angrily, facing about, "enough of this nonsense, which
                  I would not tolerate for an instant from any one but you."
               "Thank you, for your kind consideration," replied Bruce. "Tolerance is another
                  virtue, for the practice of which you are indebted to me." Then looking up, he
                  exclaimed—"Why, Saulus, I verily believe you were suffering your angry passions to
                  rise, for the flush has not yet died out of your face!"
               "Nonsense! Your imagination is entirely too fertile," said Paul, a smile breaking
                  through as he spoke, and dispelling the clouds that, for a moment, had lowered
                  threateningly over his handsome face.
               "Ah!" said Bruce, "fair weather again. Now I renew a train of thought which was
                  broken by this little flurry of passion; for my friend Paul has his 'little
                  tempers,' like Parson Dale's wife. My old sweetheart, Katy Lorrimer, looked so
                  pretty just now, that I almost envied Harold Melville her fair hand. Were not her
                  cheeks rosy, though?"
               "Paint," said Paul.
               "I'll sue you for slander, libeler of the fair sex, that you are!" exclaimed
                  Bruce, brandishing his cane in demonstration of his warlike propensity; but Paul
                  smiled, as if he were perfectly justifiable in his assertion, and defied Bruce to
                  bring proof to controvert it. This he did not attempt, but resumed—
               "You will not deny that her glossy, raven curls are beautiful, will you?"
               "Her hair is naturally red," replied the imperturbable Paul; "but Art has lent its
                  assistance to Nature, and has, by its magic, transmuted the unsightly red into
                  raven black. She does not labor under the natural inability of the leopard in
                  regard to its spots."
               "Say no more an' ye love me!" entreated Bruce, with mock distress. "Harold
                  Melville, is welcome to her. My philosophy will not desert me under these trying
                  circumstances, 
                     
                        'For this is man's philosophy,
                        When woman is untrue,
                        The loss of one but teaches him
                        To make another do,'
                     
                   and the pedestal from which the image of Kate has been ruthlessly displaced
                  is already graced by the fair Zenaida Morris, who is more lovely than the visions
                  that haunted the dreams of Xeuxis, Protogenes, Phidias, Praxiteles, or Hiram
                  Powers!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               SEVERAL days later Arthur brought home tickets to a concert to be given at ——
                  Hall.
               "Helen," he said, "you and Zenaida must both go, as Madame —— is to sing. There
                  will also be some fine instrumental performances, and I know Zenaida will enjoy
                  them. You can take Harry, and leave him with our friend Mrs. Bankhead, if you are
                  afraid to trust him with Aunt Juno. Now, Zenaida," he continued, "prepare to hear
                  some news."
               "What is it?" she inquired, looking up from the book she was reading. "Have Bruce
                  Wilson's wild horses broken his neck, or is it something concerning our old
                  neighbors, the Bainbridges?"
               "You will have to guess again," he replied; "but I hardly expected that your first
                  inquiry would be for Bruce. Has the good-humored mad-cap made an impression on
                  your heart? If so, it will be useless for me to communicate my piece of
                  intelligence."
               "I assure you he has not," she answered. "But do not keep me longer in suspense,
                  or you will excite the curiosity which you gentlemen say appertains exclusively to
                  the feminine organization."
               "It does," replied Arthur, "and has been hereditary in you ever since the days of
                  Mother Eve."
               "That is a mere dogmatical assertion," responded Zenaida. "Now for the news from
                  your city which can have power to interest me, a stranger to its inhabitants."
               "Listen, then," commenced Arthur, with such an air of mystery that her attention
                  was thoroughly aroused. "Do you remember that exquisite little note which you
                  wrote, and sent to me by Marcus, asking me to favor you by bringing some articles,
                  like samples inclosed, wherewith you might finish a dress you were embroidering
                  for Harry?"
               Zenaida nodded assent.
               "Well," continued Arthur, "that little note, written with all the beautiful
                  accuracy and elegance characteristic of the penmanship of Miss Zenaida Morris,
                  who, in this accomplishment is surpassed by few, as I have before had occasion to
                  remark—"
               "For pity's sake, brother," interrupted Zenaida, "do not tantalize me so
                  unmercifully! What became of the note?"
               "That is just what I was about to tell you," he replied. "Where was I when you
                  interrupted me? Oh! I recollect. Well, as I said, that note was lying open on my
                  office-table, and,"—here he paused for a moment, glancing mischievously at the
                  face of Zenaida, who sat perfectly calm, as if she despaired of ever hearing the
                  conclusion of Arthur's story,—"as it was there, some one came in, and took a seat
                  by the table near the open note. His eye fell upon it immediately, and as if
                  fascinated by the beautiful regularity of the characters, he raised it up; but
                  just then catching my eye, as I looked at him, he blushed, and apologized, saying,
                  'I did not intend to read the contents, but was so attracted by the artistic
                  beauty of the penmanship, that I wished to examine the superscription more
                  closely.' 'Oh!' said I, 'you may
                  scrutinize the contents, if you please, as it contains no secrets.' He thanked me,
                  and, availing himself of the privilege granted, read it, apparently with delight.
                  'Zenaida Morris!' he said, musingly. 'That is an unfamiliar name. Who is she?' 'My
                  wife's sister,' I replied. 'If character can be estimated by the chirography, hers
                  must be faultless.' 'It is,' I responded. After many more queries and answers, he
                  left, having first expressed a desire to become acquainted with you; which desire
                  I hope you will gratify. Now, would you not like to know who he was?"
               "Certainly," replied Zenaida; "but I do not expect to ascertain that fact this
                  evening, as it pleases you to be more than usually mysterious and tantalizing; I
                  shall make no more entreaties."
               "It was Allan Elliott."
               "I am truly glad that he has at last made his appearance," said Zenaida, "for I
                  had begun to think he was a myth, the unsubstantial creation of your fertile
                  imagination, which is always conjuring up something, with which you endeavor to
                  disturb my equanimity."
               "He is a living, breathing, fascinating reality, and no phantom formed of 'the
                  stuff which dreams are made of,' as you will see ere long," replied Arthur.
               
               The next evening the concert was to be, and Helen and Zenaida went to spend the
                  afternoon with Mrs. Bankhead, who, having no children of her own, was delighted at
                  the thought of enjoying without interruption the society of sweet baby Harry. When
                  Helen saw him folded tenderly to the bosom of that mother, over whose offspring
                  the cold, relentless less grave had closed, she felt that she could leave him with
                  perfect security.
               Mrs. Bankhead welcomed Zenaida very kindly; for Arthur and Helen were favorites
                  with her, and being the sister of Helen would have been sufficient recommendation
                  to her, independent of the sweet modesty and engaging prettiness of the young girl
                  herself.
               Bruce Wilson had determined to go out to Hawthornden and offer his services as
                  escort to Zenaida; but he met Arthur, who informed him that the ladies were in the
                  city, at Mrs. Bankhead's. He then told Arthur "that he would call at his office,
                  and go with him to that lady's house, provided he might have the pleasure of going
                  with Miss Morris to the concert."
               "Do so," said Arthur. "Zenaida has no engagement, and will, no doubt, be pleased
                  to go with you."
               So it was arranged; and, at the appointed time, the two gentlemen reached Mrs.
                  Bankhead's.
               "Take a seat, Bruce," said Arthur. "We'll have to wait some time, I suppose; for
                  who ever knew a woman, to be ready at the right time?"
               "You will be agreeably disappointed this time," said Helen; "for we are both
                  ready, and have been waiting for you."
               "The biggest bell in town ought to be tolled, to notify the citizens of this
                  remarkable fact," said Arthur.
               After a walk of a few minutes they arrived at the Hall, secured their seats, which
                  were well chosen, and, for the first time, Zenaida looked upon an audience in the
                  city of ——. Some persons among the crowd were not unknown to her. Mrs. Ridgely, splendidly attired, her jewels
                  gleaming brilliantly in the gas-light, first attracted her notice. She looked
                  earnestly at her, hoping to see the expression of her face less haughty, the
                  scornful flashing of her eyes softened and subdued; but the old-remembered light,
                  shone in them more intense, more cold than formerly, and she moved with imperious
                  air, as though she were a queen among her subjects. She was not happy; but was too
                  proud to acknowledge that she was miserable.
               With all the fervor of which her selfish, worldly heart was capable, had she loved
                  Lawrence Ridgely, and when the unwelcome truth dawned upon her, that the broad
                  acres of Cabell Manor, and the gold with which she was so richly dowered, had been
                  the magnets of attraction for him, then, with that knowledge came misery. The
                  chains which bound her were not to be broken. They were not the soft, silken
                  bands, or the golden links of the chain of love, but the cranking iron ones of
                  stern, cold reality. But, unlike the deer which, when wounded, seeks the covert,
                  that it may hide its agony, she plunged into all the fashionable gayeties of the
                  city with redoubled zeal, pursuing the phantom of pleasure, which forever eluded
                  her grasp, with the energy of despair.
               She was not now attended with loving care by her husband; but sycophants whispered
                  in her ear their hollow flatteries, which echoed mournfully and mockingly through
                  the deserted chambers of her heart. While she sat there, apparently the gayest
                  among the gay throng, she knew that Ridgely was with a party at the hotel
                  drinking, playing cards, and dissipating all the money of which he could obtain
                  possession.
               Zenaida could not read the secret of her heart; but she saw that her gayety was
                  assumed, that the forced smile died witheringly upon her lip; and she pitied her,
                  whose life was passed in this vain show.
               
               Florida Bernard was also there, commanding as ever in her unassumed dignity and
                  lofty gracefulness of deportment; but Zenaida noticed that her eyes rested
                  frequently upon her brother with a yearning tenderness; and once she saw her brush
                  an obtrusive tear-drop from her eye. That brother was her only one, and he was
                  dear, most dear to the heart of Florida, who when divested of the mantle of pride
                  in which she had wrapped herself so closely since her brother's marriage, was a
                  loving, passionate-hearted woman.
               She had looked upon, and stigmatized Helen, as an interloper. She had robbed her
                  of her brother, had separated him from his family who almost worshiped him; and
                  the denunciations of Florida had been most bitter. But now she looked upon the
                  young wife in her beauty,—as she raised her eyes, full of love's unutterable
                  devotion to Arthur's face,—upon him as he gazed at her, a bright, particular star
                  in that splendid galaxy of beauty and youth, with fond pride, at the thought that
                  she was all his own; and the heart which she had hardened was softened in the
                  purifying fire of love to receive a better impression, under the influence of
                  which she determined to remove, all the obstacles,—the barriers which she had
                  resolved should prove indestructible,
                  which had been raised between herself and them, by her own volition.
               Perhaps had Florida expected to remain in L——, she would not have suffered these
                  better feelings to gain the ascendancy; but the gallant Col. Philip Ashley, who
                  was now beside her, was soon to claim her as his bride. As his wife, she must
                  leave all the familiar scenes, the pleasant associations among which she had
                  always lived; and unless she sought reconciliation with her brother before her
                  departure, an opportunity might never offer; for too well did she know that no
                  advances would come from him, whose feelings she had so outraged.
               The Bainbridges were there; Hamilton in attendance upon Irene Miller, whom Bruce
                  at once struck off the list of his especial favorites.
               "I have no respect for a girl who will suffer the attentions of that most
                  despicable coxcomb."
               Beatrice was bringing all the artillery of her charms, personal and intellectual,
                  to bear upon Frank Churchill; with whom her acquaintance was of most recent date.
                  He was more equally matched with her than Elliston Hunter, her country
                  esquire.
               Churchill was tall, with deep-black hair and eyes, and would have been exceedingly
                  handsome, had not the unnatural pallor of his face, the nervous tremulousness of
                  his hand, and a general recklessness of manner, borne irrefutable testimony in
                  proof of the charge preferred against him by Helen.
               His dress was elegant, striking the happy mean between the extremes of foppishness
                  and slovenliness; bearing evidence dence of his correct, refined taste. His
                  manners, when he was uninfluenced by wine, were highly polished, and wholly
                  unexceptionable.
               "Who is that gentleman?" inquired Zenaida.
               "Francis Churchill," replied Bruce.
               As she heard the name, the charge with which he stood indicted occurred to her,
                  and she sighed to think that it was correct; that the spirit inhabiting so noble a
                  temple should be gradually debased, until no vestige of its former glory
                  remained.
               As she turned from him, her attention was arrested by a gentleman who sat in the
                  box before them. He had been completely absorbed in the music; but now, in the
                  pause which had succeeded, he looked round, and as his eye fell upon Arthur, bowed
                  smilingly; Arthur returned his salutation, and whispered to Zenaida that Allan
                  Elliott was before her.
               He had teased her so untiringly about him, that when a few moments later Elliott's
                  glance met hers, a rosy blush suffused her face.
               "This," thought Elliott, "must be the sister of whom Bernard spoke; I am not
                  disappointed in her appearance, for her face is' the sweetest one I ever looked
                  upon, and that little, exquisitely moulded hand, a type of the highest order of
                  physical beauty,—which a philosopher would denominate a psychical hand,—is the one
                  which penned those fair lines."
               Here he averted his eyes, fearful that his prolonged observation might be noticed
                  by her; but many times during the
                  evening, that face proved an irresistible magnet of attraction to him.
               While Elliott was thus absorbed in contemplation of this sweet lily-of-the-vale,
                  whose graceful modesty and elegant simplicity were contrasted so finely with the
                  other human flowers blooming round her,—some flaunting in gay colors like the
                  poppy or hollyhock; some stately as the regal dahlia; others glowing like the
                  full-blown, blushing rose,—he was not unobserved. Many bright glances of curious
                  admiration fell upon him from black, brown, and blue eyes of various shades and
                  different degrees of beauty; but all unheeded by him. He was known to be wealthy;
                  it needed but a glance to tell that he was handsome; and report whispered that his
                  mental gifts and intellectual acquirements were far above the average of mankind.
                  But he shunned the crowd, and in the retirement of his own home devoted himself to
                  study,—to the perfecting of many arts and sciences in which he was proficient.
               He was rather above medium height; his hair dark-brown, soft and fine, waved above
                  a broad, white forehead; his eyes were unfathomable as the sea in their blue
                  depths; his mouth combined the firmness of manhood with a sweetness almost
                  feminine; his beard was brown like his hair, and silky in its softness.
               He was alone, and being a passionate lover of music, sat drinking in the flood of
                  melody; its exquisite effect marred by no word inopportunely spoken. He had sat
                  with his eyes fixed in the dreamy abstraction of thought, until he saw Zenaida;
                  and now he watched the emotions that played upon her face, aroused by the music,
                  with which its varied expressions were in perfect harmony. When it swelled high
                  with notes of triumph, her head was thrown back, a bright smile hovered around her
                  lip,—a glad light shone in her eyes; but when it changed and breathed a plaintive
                  sweetness, her head drooped, and a tear-drop glittered on her long lashes.
               This last piece—a peal of triumph for victory, succeeded by the mournful wail
                  above the dead—being over, the audience dispersed. 
                     
                        "Music, when soft voices die,
                        Vibrates in the memory."
                     
                   Thus it was with Elliott; and as the strains sounded again and again, ever
                  before him rose that face, the sweet pensiveness of which he had admired the more,
                  the more he gazed upon it.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               THE home of Elliott was situated upon —— street, far removed from the bustle and
                  confusion of the mercantile portion of the city. A whole square was inclosed in
                  the space which surrounded the house.
               The house itself was picturesque in appearance: a Gothic edifice, overgrown with
                  ivy, which Elliott had planted, giving it the character of an old ruin. The yard
                  was thickly set with grass, trees, and flowers of many brilliant dyes, forming a
                  bright oasis in the desert of brick and stone which surrounded it on every side; a gleam of
                  divine beauty amid the artificialities of the works of man.
               The mother of Elliott, a refined and gentle lady, inhabited with him this sweet
                  place, upon whose green-sward, under the overshadowing canopy of trees, fairies
                  might dance in the holy moonlight unmolested by the discordant din of human
                  revelry; this home, which the angels of the flowers and leaves had taken under
                  their special guardianship; which they decorated with richest verdure and
                  brightest colors.
               On the southern side of the house, there was a conservatory, where plants of every
                  clime unfurled their bright banners, emblazoned with gorgeous inscriptions in
                  characters of living light, and distilled the richest fragrance. Camelias, with
                  their deep-green leaves and wax-like petals of deepest crimson, rosy pink or snowy
                  whiteness; fuschias with graceful heads, overpowered and drooping with the weight
                  of their own exquisite loveliness; the abutillon, whose golden bells, streaked
                  with veins of fire like that which glows in the heart of a ruby, form the
                  drinking-cups of the flower-spirits; roses of every hue, twining the pillars in
                  loving embrace, their clusters of buds and blossoms hanging temptingly, and many
                  others,— 
                     
                        "Which flung from their bells a sweet peal anew
                        Of music so delicate, soft and intense,—
                        It was felt like an odor within the sense;"
                     
                   bloomed there; fit adornment for the home of the marble Flora, who reclined
                  gracefully, half hidden by their many twining stems. She looked like some fair
                  maiden who had fallen asleep, her senses steeped to forgetfulness in the charmed
                  waves of the sea of mingled odors which rolled there. The flowers guarded her
                  slumbers; the roses twined wreaths, which they laid upon her unconscious brow, and
                  cast a delicate flush upon her cheek, making it to wear the hue of life. And, as
                  the birds covered the Babes in the Wood, so these guardians dropped bright leaves
                  upon her, that no intrusive glance might invade her repose.
               The furniture of the house was in harmony with its outward aspect. Pictures in
                  antique frames adorned the walls. There were many portraits and landscapes: some
                  Old-World scenes,—the castled crags of the sunny Rhine; the entrancing scenes of
                  beautiful Italy,—others portraying the beauties of our own dear land. Many books
                  in many tongues were scattered around by Allan's liberal hand. One room, from
                  which a glass-door opened into the conservatory, was set apart for his especial
                  use. It contained a handsome library of ancient and modern authors; an easel and
                  other implements of the artist—a portfolio of drawings and paintings attesting his
                  skill; a piano, from which, in the deepening hush of twilight, he would draw forth
                  tones of ethereal beauty and sweetness. A door from this room opened into a
                  smaller one, which was fitted up with apparatus for making chemical and
                  philosophical experiments. To his books and these interesting experiments he
                  devoted much of his time; his lighter accomplishments being only resorted to when
                  his mind, after unnatural tension, required repose and relaxation. Often would he
                  sit with book in hand, his eye wandering far from its pages,—his mind busy with
                  some idea which a casual word had suggested. A world of imaginary beauty, upon which common mortals never
                  intruded, was open before him, and through its enchanted vales, lovely as
                  Thessalian Tempe—by the side of streams which flowed, like Pactolus, o'er sands of
                  gold—to the sound of dulcet music, like that of Apollo's lyre, which drew the
                  listening woods along and stopped the running waters, he moved, attended by beings
                  lovely as the Muses, the Graces, and Nymphs, who haunted the dreamy souls of poets
                  in olden time. These visions were so full of beauty that before them—the creations
                  of his own soul—he bowed in homage. All this wealth of learning and deep feeling
                  was hidden from the rude gaze of the curious multitude; for no toil, bodily or
                  mental, was of necessity imposed upon Allan Elliott, the favored child of fortune;
                  and so these great gifts, which might have added to the treasures of literature
                  and art, were cultivated only for his own gratification. Bright thoughts, that
                  illumined his mind with intense radiance, passed, like the summer lightning,
                  leaving no trace; or, if they were committed to paper, were locked up in his desk,
                  and jealously guarded from all intrusive eyes. Fame,—the hollow applause of the
                  multitude, fleeting as the life of the bright-winged ephemeris, vanishing like the
                  rainbow after the storm, a mocking, empty sound,—what was it to him? He felt that
                  he could sound the deep, illimitable abysms of his own soul; that on the bright
                  wing of imaginative, poetic thought, he could soar far above the heights attained,
                  with slow and painful steps, by others; and, knowing his own power, he cared not
                  that it should be recognized by others.
               He loved his mother with love unspeakable; and she deemed him a paragon of all
                  excellence—her brave, her beautiful, her nobly-gifted son, in whom no faults were
                  discernable, by her love-blinded eyes. When he read to her, his voice was sweeter
                  to her ear than the Angel Israfel's; when he painted a picture, not Raphael,
                  Michael Angelo, Titian, Rubens, or Claude Lorraine could surpass it in her partial
                  judgment; and the tones drawn from his piano were more heavenly than the music of
                  the spheres. She considered not, that for these talents, wasted or misapplied, her
                  idol would be finally called upon to render an account; that the soul, so keenly
                  alive to every perception of harmony and beauty in the material, visible world,
                  and the bright dream-land through which he wandered, was blind to the glories of
                  that Being, by whose infinite power and wisdom this beautiful world was created,
                  by whose beneficent love it is sustained.
               His mind, so clear on other subjects, was here lost in a labyrinthine maze of
                  conjectures and doubts. That immortality, which is the sustaining hope of the
                  Christian,—that eternal progression toward perfection to which he looks forward
                  with delight so deep,—were veiled from his eyes, which saw not the glory revealed,
                  being blinded by the veil of dark clouds, and mists of doubt in which the
                  unbelieving have enveloped all questions, pertinent to this theme of absorbing
                  interest and vital importance. He could not believe that his soul, with its high
                  aspirations, its yearnings after immortality, its capacities for joy or woe, too
                  great to be tested or satisfied in the short course of human life, would perish
                  utterly—would be annihilated, blotted out from the book of existence, together
                  with the mortal tenement in which it
                  was confined; but this mystery his philosophy could not fathom.
               The Metempsychosis of Pythagoras presented no pleasing prospect to his mind; for
                  it would be a degradation too deep to be contemplated with calmness, could he
                  believe that the soul of man, when separated from the body, might, by any
                  possibility, inhabit the form of some lower order of animate creation. Neither did
                  the theory of more modern philosophers please him; that the spirit but laid aside
                  one mortal vestment, to clothe itself with another; that it was condemned to tread
                  forever the dull round of a never-ending, earthly existence, tortured by
                  indistinct memories of past experiences; vaguely conscious that it had been, and
                  had seen, without knowing where, or what.
               The Elysian Fields of the poets, peopled by the shades of departed warriors and
                  statesmen, were naught but an unsubstantial dream; Plato's reasonings might
                  conclusively prove his immortality; but he could not reveal the true destiny of
                  man. Other philosophers might, during life, apparently substantiate many pretty
                  theories, might come near the truth itself; but, in death, there was a destroying
                  doubt, a perplexing "if these things be so."
               The simple sublimity of the philosophy of the inspired Word was passed by,
                  unregarded. While his spirit was perishing, instead of quenching his burning,
                  thirst from the pure fountain of Divine wisdom he drank from the muddy pools of
                  poor, erring humanity. No angels sang for him "Peace on earth;" no Saviour
                  agonized for him in lonely sorrow, or hung bleeding on the cross, nor opened for
                  him the dark portals of the tomb, showing that the grave is but the vestibule of
                  Eternity, the antechamber to the presence of Jehovah. He looked, upon the sects
                  calling themselves Christians—and they who preached the theory of peace, practiced
                  the precepts of war—persecuting each other even unto death; they, who professed to
                  follow but one leader, were divided into innumerable, opposing factions; they, who
                  acknowledged the one grand centre, the Sun of Righteousness, around which all
                  professed to revolve, had all a centre of their own, of which they were the
                  obedient satellites. Where he looked for unity there was division; where he
                  expected peace there was strife; where he sought for love, the charity which
                  suffereth long, and is kind, which envieth not, which seeketh the good of another,
                  and not its own, there he found envy, malice, and all uncharitableness; and seeing
                  no way in which all these discordant elements might be harmoniously combined, he
                  turned sorrowfully from the contemplation of these things, believing not that the
                  God, by whose Omnipotent fiat the innumerable worlds had been spoken into
                  existence, could also educe order out of this spiritual chaos. But of these
                  thoughts, these hopes and fears and doubts, he said nothing; he sought no
                  counselor wiser than himself; and thus remained in darkness. For him the sun
                  shone, and he rejoiced in his beams, which give glorious light and life to the
                  earth; but he gave not God the praise; for him the rush of the storm, the glare of
                  the lightning, the roll of the thunder, possessed an indescribable fascination;
                  but in them the voice of God was not audible to his ear. For him the birds sang,
                  and "their profuse strains of unpremeditated art," their gushing, soul-thrilling
                  heart-melodies fell upon him, sweet as the poet's song, or the words of love from maiden lips,—soft as the
                  breeze, the last faint sigh of the dying day, or, the half-remembered strains of
                  heavenly music, which haunted the soul in its antenatal dreams; but his tribute of
                  joyful praise and thanksgiving went not up, a sweet incense before the throne of
                  the Almighty, with their matin anthems. For him the flowers bloomed, shedding
                  their grateful odors round his daily path; but written in them the name of God was
                  invisible to his eyes; their floral bells, as they swung and "tolled their
                  perfume, on the passing air," rung for him no "call to prayer." He enjoyed; but
                  the measure of his joy was not full.
               Such was Allan Elliott, who turned his lips from the rose-crowned goblet of the
                  pleasures of the world before it was scarcely tasted, conscious that there was a
                  thirst within his soul which it had no power to allay; but refusing to test the
                  healing efficacy of the unpolluted waters of the river of life, which, glittering
                  in the clear crystal goblets of truth, were presented to him by angel hands.
               
                  
                     Human heart! forever pining
                     For love and joy,
                     A sun forever shining,
                     A bliss without alloy,
                  
                  
                     A life that knows no dying,
                     A friendship without pain,
                     A heart that's free from sighing,
                     Pure, guileless, without stain;
                  
                  
                     In heaven alone the friend is
                     Who never will betray,
                     In heaven alone the love is
                     That never will decay;
                  
                  
                     In heaven alone the heart is
                     That is not filled with sighs,
                     And there alone the life is
                     The life that never dies.
                  
                  
                     At God's right hand are pleasures—
                     Pure, free for evermore;
                     In his keeping there are treasures,
                     A rich and boundless store.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               THE remaining weeks of winter passed away; and as the soft airs, the harbingers,
                  of approaching spring, began to fan her brow, the Earth laid aside her mantle of
                  kingly ermine, which she had donned to protect her from the piercing wintry
                  blasts.
               Hawthornden was now enlivened by a visit from Alice Bainbridge, accompanied by
                  little Amy. Alice remained only a few hours; but Amy clung to Zenaida, and begged
                  so earnestly to be permitted to stay with her, that Alice consented; Zenaida
                  having promised that she should be sent home as soon as she wished to go. The
                  sweet child was very dear to her, and she loved to feel her soft arms round her
                  neck, her dewy kisses upon her cheek, and to see her beauteous head, with its
                  wealth of golden curls, pillowed upon her breast.
               Amy, too, had quite fallen in love with baby Harry, and, interpenetrated with
                  delight, her childish form would dilate
                  when Helen would trust him with her. She would sit upon the floor that she might
                  hold him mote conveniently—would talk to him, cooing softly as a dove,—every smile
                  upon his baby-face reflected radiantly from her own, every manifestation of his
                  fondness for her met with extravagant expressions of pleasure. When he fell asleep
                  in her arms, she would watch the drooping of his white eyelids, the gradual
                  eclipse of the dark, shining orbs they covered; and when his tiny hand clasped
                  hers, she would not stir, fearful that she might disturb him.
               Her light, dancing step and cheery voice, chirping snatches of song, waked the
                  echoes of Hawthornden; and when in a room, she would, like a humming-bird, dart
                  from one object of interest to another, infusing some of her own light-heartedness
                  into all who beheld her.
               One evening, after she had been several days with Zenaida, Arthur brought a
                  message from Mrs. Bainbridge commanding the immediate return of the little truant.
                  Amy was distressed beyond measure at parting with Zenaida and Harry, and many
                  times renewed the declaration "I will come again when the flowers bloom. Aunt Juno
                  has promised me a little chicken, and Marcus is going to find me a bird's-nest
                  full of little blue eggs."
               "I will send for you," said Zenaida, "when the flowers bloom, and you shall have
                  some nice, strawberries and cherries."
               "You are so good!" cried the delighted Amy, clapping her hands joyously, in
                  anticipation of this delicious feast. "I love you!" she continued, clasping her
                  arms round Zenaida's naida's neck, all her tears being dried as the thought of
                  another visit took possession of her fancy.
               Arthur took charge of her, and delivered her safely to her mother.
               
               A few days after Arthur proposed to Helen to go to the Cathedral.
               "You have been, Helen, but Zenaida has never heard the music, or witnessed the
                  ceremonies observed there."
               "Oh, brother!" exclaimed Zenaida, "it will give me so much pleasure to go. I have
                  always cherished the desire, and thoughts that I would propose going; but now you
                  have anticipated my wish."
               "I thought it would please you," he said, with a gratified smile.
               The Sabbath came, and at an early hour, the congregation assembled. Zenaida gazed
                  with interest upon the stately building, with its pictured decorations, its
                  vaulted roof, its images and wax-lights; and, had it been the twilight hour, the
                  dusk gloom relieved only by the tapers' glow, as they twinkled, star-like around
                  the altar, she could have imagined herself in some storied pile of the Old World,
                  the echoing aisles of which she had trodden in fancy, surrounded by kings and
                  queens, knights, lords, and fair ladies, sweeping along in a shadowy
                  procession.
               They had not long been seated, when a procession, not of shadows, but of fair
                  young girls, entered, and paced slowly up the aisle. They were in the first flush
                  of youthful beauty, apparently about the same age, and were subjects for the rite
                  of confirmation. All were dressed in white, the garb of innocence and purity—of the redeemed in heaven, who
                  have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb. Veils of the same snowy
                  whiteness fell around them, and were confined by wreaths of white flowers—the
                  bridal adornments in which they were to be wedded to the church.
               They took their appointed places; and, upon their fair young heads, bowed before
                  the altar, fell the light of heaven through the stained windows, like a golden
                  glory, encircling many brows with a halo like that around the heads of the saints.
                  Upon others it fell redly, as if they were bathed in blood.
               The rite administered, the organ pealed forth its solemn music,—now rising like
                  the lark, as it would soar to the very gates of heaven, now dying to a low murmur,
                  almost inaudible, like the soft sighing of the west wind.
               Zenaida was encompassed by a sea of harmony, and her soul rose and fell, like a
                  boat upon the ocean, with the undulating motion of the waves. The scenes around
                  her were woven in with many poetic associations, and while the services proceeded,
                  she heard in imagination the song of the monks of Melrose ringing in her ear— 
                     
                        "Dies iræ, dies illa,
                        Solvet sæclum in favilla;"
                     
                   and she was still unconsciously repeating the words of this most beautiful,
                  impressive hymn, when the final benediction was pronounced, and, with a long, deep
                  sigh, she awoke from the spell which had bound her like enchantment.
               "Well, Zenaida," said Arthur, "were your expectations realized?"
               "Yes," she replied; "I have enjoyed it very much. I never heard music before, for
                  there is none comparable to the organ."
               "Oh!" exclaimed a pretty girl, who just then passed them, "I am so glad it is
                  over; I always think of serpents, and all sorts of evil things, while I am
                  here!"
               "Why did you come, then?" asked her companion.
               "Why, because I knew everybody would be here, and I look so well in my new
                  dress."
               "How strange," said Zenaida, "that the impressions of different people should be
                  so widely different in regard to the same thing! But the light of heaven is varied
                  according to the medium through which it is seen. It shines through some human
                  hearts in rainbow-hues, like those which fall from those stained windows, while
                  other hearts are so hopelessly opaque, that it cannot penetrate at all. No visions
                  of 'serpents' disturbed me, and if there were any lurking in the Elysian Fields
                  through which I roved, they were coiled beneath concealing roses."
               
               Mrs. Bankhead joined them as they left the church.
               "Now, my dear friends," she said, "I shall not permit you to leave the city until
                  after dinner, at least. You must go with me. I am delighted that I have
                  encountered you so unexpectedly. There will be no one with me but Mrs. Elliott, my
                  dear, kind friend, who has promised to spend the evening with me, through pure
                  compassion for my loneliness. You are acquainted with her, Helen?"
               "But slightly," replied Helen. "I am not entirely unacquainted with her by
                  reputation, and, from what I have
                  heard, I know that she must be a most kind and loving woman."
               "Your tribute of respect is just," said Mrs. Bankhead, "and I rejoice that I may
                  be instrumental in bringing into closer communion two friends whom I value as
                  highly as I do yourself and Mrs. Elliott."
               "Zenaida," said Arthur, in a voice inaudible to any ear but hers, "the fates are
                  propitious. Conciliate mamma, and you will then sail in a sea free from shoals,
                  reefs, and quicksands."
               "Brother," she replied, laughing, "you would have been enough to wear out the
                  patient endurance of Penelope herself, if you had been among her suitors, for you
                  are the most persevering creature I ever saw!"
               
               After dinner, they were all seated in Mrs. Bankhead's elegant parlor, when Mrs.
                  Elliott arrived. The conversation was, for some time, general, but at last Mrs.
                  Elliott left Mrs. Bankhead and Helen and sat down by Zenaida.
               "You have not been long a resident of our county, Miss Morris?" she said, by way
                  of preface.
               "I have been with my sister but a few weeks," she replied.
               "What impression has our city and its society produced upon you? A favorable one,
                  I hope," she continued.
               "I have formed some very pleasant acquaintances," responded Zenaida; "and the city
                  has been presented to me in an engaging aspect; but I have, as yet, looked only
                  upon the bright side of the picture. I give the preference to the country above
                  the city; for there we have no contrasts so painful as the city presents, with its
                  extremes of wealth and poverty; its hovels and princely palaces; its great
                  virtues, and correspondingly great vices."
               "True, my dear young lady," replied Mrs. Elliott; "but the city must offer many
                  attractions to one of your years, in its various assemblies, its galleries of art,
                  and spectacles of many kinds. Is it not so?"
               "The scenes presented by the country, with its green fields and leafy woods; its
                  sunsets and their 'gorgeous ministers;' its moonlight, flooding all things with a
                  silvery radiance, giving earth the 
                     appearence
                     appearance
                   of an enchanted land; its mountains and valleys; its hills, dales,
                  winding streams, and impenetrable recesses, afford a spectacle, unrivaled for
                  sublimity and beauty, by all that the city contributes for the amusement and
                  edification of its denizens."
               "Nay," said Mrs. Elliott, smiling at her earnestness; "does not the same sun shine
                  upon us, gilding our palaces, until they glitter, like Aladdin's, in his beams?
                  Does not the moon shed upon us the same silvery radiance?"
               "The sun, moon, and stars," assented Zenaida, "are undoubtedly the same; but the
                  view is limited by the surrounding walls, which hem one in on every side, and you
                  see their glory through the thick veil of an impure atmosphere, which dims their
                  clear radiance."
               "You should see my home," said Mrs. Elliott. "It is a country-place, taken up and
                  transplanted in the city; or, at least, such is its aspect; but the city has grown
                  around it, and fresh-painted, pretentious edifices are visible on all sides, while
                  it is nestled among trees and vines, interknit, and clasping their many-twining
                  stems so closely about it, that the
                  wails are hardly discernible. Then, too, it is a perfect thicket of flowers—a
                  wilderness of sweets."
               "Perhaps, then," said Zenaida, with an arch look and bright smile, "it would be
                  better for me not to look upon it, for, thereby, I might be tempted to break the
                  commandment, which enjoins upon us not to covet the possessions of another."
               Mrs. Elliott laughed. "I would not be afraid to trust you," she said, "and I hope
                  soon to show you all its beauties. You are fond of flowers I know. An affirmative
                  answer is wholly superfluous, for the expression your face assumes at the mention
                  of them, assures me of the fact. Moreover, I am so fond of them myself, that I
                  discern by intuition when any one sympathizes with me. I am correct, am I
                  not?"
               "Words cannot express my love for them," replied Zenaida.
               They conversed for some time longer, and Mrs. Elliott was charmed by the modest
                  sweetness and rare intelligence of this young girl, in whose eyes, as she looked
                  into their dreamy depths, she saw something which brought her son vividly before
                  her.
               When she bade Zenaida farewell, it was with the expressed hope that they might
                  meet often.
               "I have not many friends," she said, "and will be most happy to include you and
                  your sister among them."
               
               "Well, sis," said Arthur, as they were homeward bound, "how did you like mamma?
                  You appeared to get along famously together. Do you like her so well that you will
                  fall in love with Allan for the sake of becoming her daughter?"
               Zenaida laughed merrily, and replied that "mamma was perfectly charming."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               "CHURCHILL, my good fellow," said Bruce Wilson, peeping in at Frank's door, "come,
                  put up Blackstone, or Coke upon Littleton, or whatever volume of stupid, legal
                  science that is that you are poring over. Don't you want to take a ride? I went
                  round to Anderson's rooms, but he would not consent to go with me. If you refuse,
                  I will have to get out a writ of 'have his carcass' against him, and I am afraid
                  then I should be compelled to return it with the inscription, 'non est inventus,'
                  for he does not want to go."
               "I," replied Frank, "would have felt much more highly honored if I had not been
                  made a mere secondary consideration with you."
               "Oh!" said Bruce, "you know that Saul and I are almost as loving as Damon and
                  Pythias, or Orestes and Pylades, and as inseparable as the Siamese Twins, and
                  nothing was more natural than that I should think of my 'alter ego' first. But,"
                  he exclaimed, picking up the book Frank had dropped upon his entrance, "it seems
                  that I have, unintentionally, brought a false accusation against you; for this is
                  no dry law-document, but 'The Newcomes.' You might have learned a lesson from the
                  Rev. Honeyman to slip your novel out of
                  slight, and be studiously perusing something more substantial when any one
                  entered."
               "Never mind the book," replied Frank, "or my legal studies either. I have more
                  knowledge in my cranium now than litigants will give me an opportunity to display;
                  and, thinking it useless to encumber the storehouse of memory with any more
                  rubbish of the same sort, I have turned my attention to Belles-Lettres. I would
                  not have been a mere drone in this busy hive of humanity; but there are so many
                  working-bees to sip the honey from the flowers, alias clients, that bloom in these
                  prim, cultivated parterres, that none remain for me."
               "'Nil mortalibus arduum est,'" said Bruce, "and 'nil sine magno vita labore dedit
                  mortalibus,' are two wise saws, which ought to be engraven indelibly upon your
                  memory. You would find them of great service, of almost incalculable benefit, when
                  you were despondent, as your last words would show."
               "Thank you for your gratuitous advice, my most degenerate scion of the royal tree
                  of Scotia," replied Frank, ironically. "Bruce, you ought to be a preacher; you are
                  such an excellent sign-board; know so well how to point the road to others, and
                  never go it yourself."
               "Do not, I entreat you, be so sarcastic, mon
                     cher," said Bruce. "You will suffuse my delicate cheek with the rosy
                  blush of shame. But, speaking of blushes reminds me of the drive I proposed. Have
                  you ever been to Hawthornden, the country-seat of Arthur Bernard? Yes? Well, all
                  right; for that is the goal of my hopes this evening. If you are at leisure, have
                  no important case to examine, I will be most happy to have your company."
               "What is the attraction there?" inquired Frank.
               "As Mr. Mantalini would say," responded Bruce, "there is there 'the demdest, most
                  bewitching little captivator,' you ever beheld, in the person of Mrs. Bernard's
                  sister."
               "What!" said Frank; "the one upon whom you were dancing attendance so assiduously
                  at Madame's concert the other evening?"
               "Her individual self," replied Bruce; "the personification of very delightful
                  attribute; the sweetest, prettiest, most intelligent, fascinating—Alas! my
                  vocabulary does not contain words sufficiently superlative to express her
                  excellence."
               "What salary does she give you to act in the capacity of trumpeter, mon cher monsieur?" queried Churchill.
               "She will repay me in smiles, a currency that is above par in my exchange,"
                  replied the good-humored Bruce.
               "Well," said Frank, "I am yours to command. Are the beautiful blacks in harness? I
                  shall be all impatience until their winged feet are bearing us to this enchanted
                  castle, with its beautiful princess."
               "Here are the blacks," said Bruce; "and this Hibernian tiger, whom I improvised
                  for the occasion, no doubt thinks his office no sinecure. Paddy, me boy," he
                  continued, "an' would ye na like to hould these same illigant critters
                  foriver?"
               "Divil a bit," replied Pat, with a grin; "for be the howly mither of Moses, niver
                  a bit of the skin would they lave upon me hands wi' the tossin' of their
                  heads."
               
               "Arrah, Pat!" said Bruce; "faith an' here's a bit of fairy-money, which, I'll bet
                  you a brass button without a shank, will soon find its way to the sheban-shop; for
                  an' ye are like your race, your patron, Saint Paddy, has suckled you with whisky,
                  joy. Where did you come from, Pat?"
               "From Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, your worship," replied Pat.
               Bruce tossed the coin to Paddy, who caught it with great dexterity.
               "Good luck till yer honor," was his parting benediction. "May the howly Virgin,
                  and the Lord Almighty God Jasus bless ye."
               "That hearty blessing," said Bruce, laughing, "is worth half a dollar, is it not,
                  Churchill?"
               "From his mouth blessings and curses both flow freely; the sweet and bitter water
                  from the same fountain," said Frank. "How long is it," he continued, "since this
                  bright, particular star first appeared among your planets?"
               "Sax weeks," replied Bruce, "as Paddy always answers, when asked how long he has
                  been in America."
               
               "Bruce," resumed Churchill, after a pause,—during which he had been attentively
                  regarding the beautiful horses before him,—"the scales of our blind Goddess
                  Justitia, are most unevenly balanced; for while you dash along the highway of life
                  in this splendid style, I am compelled by Necessity, a most stern lawgiver, to
                  make the same journey on foot; and a weary way do I sometimes find it. Smooth and
                  regular as this level turnpike to you, it is a rugged, precipitous hill, covered
                  with brambles, to me. This problem of life, the unequal distribution of wealth, is
                  one which I have never been able to solve."
               
                  
                     
                        Qui fit, Mæcenas, ut nemo, quam sibi sortem
                        Sen ratio dederit, sen fors objecerit, illa
                        Contentus vivat, laudat diverse sequentes!"
                     
                   said Bruce, seriously. "Churchill, if I have wealth, you have talent which
                  might acquire wealth, and crown your lofty brow with the civic oak-wreath. If you
                  would rouse the abilities dormant within you, you might occupy a niche in the
                  temple of fame; while I, among the thousands, gazed upon you with admiration,
                  unable to follow where you would lead. I expect to live to see you, at least, a
                  member of Congress, perhaps a foreign minister,—the Hon. Francis Evelyn
                  Churchill,—quite a high-sounding name, with which to fill the speaking-trump of
                  fame. But, when all these honors are heaped upon your head, when you are rewarded
                  by the approbation of brave men and the smiles of fair women, forget not the
                  insignificant Bruce Wilson, who, viewed from your sublime altitude, will diminish
                  to the proportions of a Lilliputian. Eheu! I have delivered quite an oration. Who
                  knows but I might make a stump-speech myself?
               "I had never expected to learn wisdom from the lips of a rattle-brained creature
                  like yourself, Bruce," said Frank; "but, for once, you have given utterance to
                  that which affects me more than all the proverbs of Solomon. You may rest assured
                  that I shall not forget you, if the honors which you see in prospective for me should be like
                  'Pelion on Ossa' piled."
               "I will overlook the rather equivocal nature of your left-handed compliment, in
                  consideration of the happy effect my speech has had upon you. As to your assurance
                  that you will not forget me, you may be perfectly sincere; but 'honores mutant
                  mores,' and I will not calculate upon the continuance of your regard. I believe I
                  will write out my oration from which, in the mouth of a fool, you are so kind as
                  to say you have learned wisdom; and have it published along with those of Henry
                  Clay, Demosthenes, Cicero, and Daniel Webster. I wrote a poem once, Churchill," he
                  said, turning to Frank.
               "Why didn't you publish it?" asked Frank.
               "You know Byron says, that 
                     
                        'When the sons of song descend to trade,
                        Their bays are sear,—their former laurels fade,'
                     
                   and there was not a single extra leaf in my crown (which was placed upon my
                  head by my young lady-admirers, to whose albums I contributed over the signature
                  of Claude St. Clair,) which I could afford to spare; so I preferred to let it
                  'waste its sweetness on the desert air,' being well aware that I should demand a
                  full equivalent in hard cash from my publishers, as I was not at that time in the
                  mood to enrich the literature of the land gratuitously. Having spent the last cent
                  of my quarter's allowance, I had recourse to my quill and paper, and commenced
                  ransacking my brain for poetic thoughts and figures just to while away the time,
                  being 'deterred by impecuniosity,' from other more agreeable pastimes."
               "I am exceedingly interested in your experiences of a literary life," said Frank;
                  "but here we are at Hawthornden."
               
                  
                     
                        "If there's anything nice in this creation,
                        'Tis a pretty little wife and a big plantation,"
                     
                   sang Bruce, as he jumped out. "Arthur Bernard has the nice little wife, and
                  will, one of these days, have the other necessary ingredient in the cup of
                  happiness."
               "Here, Julius Cæsar, Cneius Pompey, Marcus Aurelius, Antonius, or whatever may be
                  your euphonious cognomen," he said, apostrophizing Marcus, who just then appeared,
                  "take these exquisite specimens of the genus
                     equus, and accommodate them with a luxurious resting-place."
               "Sir," said Marcus, grinning and scratching his head with an air of perplexity, "I
                  doesn't know what dat dictionary talk means. Please to 'spress yourself ober
                  agin."
               "Well, then," said Bruce, "take these horses and put them in the stable; for I am
                  going to stay to supper."
               "I knows what dat means," said Marcus, displaying his ivory, and the whites of his
                  eyes, which, Bruce observed, "closely resembled the albuminous portion of a
                  hard-boiled egg."
               
               "I wonder who that can be!" exclaimed Helen, as the tinkle of the door-bell
                  announced visitors. "Give Harry to me, Joanna," she said to the black nurse, "and
                  go open the door. Zenaida," she continued, as the girl departed, "I hope it is some of your admirers; for I am just now
                  so busy, that I would not like to be interrupted."
               "Whoever it may be, he will have to make himself vastly agreeable to compensate
                  for the loss of pleasure I sustain by his arrival," said Zenaida, as she rose and
                  laid aside her book.
               
               "Miss Morris," said Bruce, "allow me to present to you my friend, Mr.
                  Churchill."
               Zenaida returned Frank's graceful salutation, and Bruce resumed,—
               "Behold," said he, "fairest of all ladies, one who is willing to prostrate himself
                  before your feet and kiss the tips of your rosy fingers."
               "Take him at his word Miss Morris," said Frank. "If you would not enjoy the
                  spectacle I would."
               "You think I am not in earnest?" said Bruce; "I will prove it." So saying, he
                  kneeled before Zenaida, and raising his eyes imploringly said,—"Gracious princess!
                  vouchsafe, I beseech thee, to grant me the privilege of saluting your fair
                  hand."
               "Rise, Mr. Wilson," said Zenaida, imperatively; "I do not admire such scenes;" and
                  she glanced at the mirthful countenance of Churchill.
               "I have offended thee, fair arbitress of my fate," he said, with a sigh—though
                  subdued laughter was gleaming in his eye. "Oh!" he continued, "do not look upon me
                  with those cruel eyes. Their glance in anger I cannot bear."
               "Mr. Wilson," said Zenaida, turning to Frank, "must have been amusing himself with
                  private theatricals since I last saw him. He ought to have notified me that he had
                  under rehearsal this scene, that I might have been prepared to act my part."
               "You mistake," said Bruce, rising and elevating himself proudly; "I am not acting
                  an assumed part. I have been at school with nature, and did but give expression to
                  the emotions of my soul, and you have turned these feelings into tratvestie."
               "O enigma, more obscure than the riddle of the sphynx!" ejaculated Zenaida; "how
                  shall I ever find the solution of thy character?"
               "The labyrinth of my mind," replied Bruce, "is more intricate in its mazy windings
                  than the far-famed habitation of the Cretan Minotaur; but you, fairest Ariadne!
                  ought to be able to furnish the clew."
               "I confess my inability to do so at present," she answered.
               "You ought to have heard his conversation, as we came out this evening, Miss
                  Morris," said Churchill; "it would have increased your respect for him as it did
                  mine. He was quite eloquent, quite reasonable, except that he confessed he had
                  once written a poem."
               "I protest against this breach of confidence," exclaimed Bruce.
               "You should not object," said Zenaida, "to a repetition of conversation so highly
                  creditable to yourself. I am sure I shall be much gratified if you will permit the
                  indulgence of my curiosity, which has been, excited by the allusions of Mr.
                  Churchill."
               "You plead in vain," replied Bruce, "as I did, when a suppliant but a short time
                  since. Miss Morris," he continued
                  tinued;, "if a superior power were to grant you the privilege to elect between
                  talents of a high order as your endowment in life—or wealth, which would you
                  prefer?"
               "Why do you ask me this question now so seriously?" said Zenaida. "Who could
                  hesitate? I will not deny, that the power of wealth is almost illimitable; and a
                  man may make of his wealth, if properly used, wings upon which he can fly to
                  heaven; but what can be compared to the treasures of the mind, which are above
                  price? Endowed with talents more valuable than the talents of gold and silver, a
                  man may reign the undisputed monarch over the minds and hearts of his fellow-men;
                  may make for himself a name, which will be remembered with honor, when the merely
                  wealthy has passed away, forgotten like the dream of the night. But you have not
                  told me why you asked for my opinion."
               "You have decided as I knew you would," replied Bruce, with a significant glance
                  toward Churchill, who had listened with deepest attention to her words. "I wished
                  you to be the umpire between myself and my friend, as we disagreed upon this
                  point. Churchill was the advocate of wealth."
               "You advocated it merely for the sake of argument, I am sure," said Zenaida,
                  appealing to Frank. "Mr. Wilson slanders you when he says that you would be
                  willing to exchange your birthright, your glorious heritage, for sordid wealth,
                  does he not?"
               "I might have followed the example of Esau, this morning," replied Frank, "before
                  the subject was discussed with so much eloquence and feeling; but now I could not
                  be induced duced to part with any of my mental endowments, since you have called
                  them a glorious heritage."
               Thus they conversed, and the moments flew by almost imperceptibly, until Arthur
                  came. He insisted that they should remain until after supper. Frank at first
                  objected; but Bruce accepted the invitation without hesitancy, and Frank was
                  secretly pleased, for he hoped that Arthur would monopolize Bruce, and leave him,
                  to entertain or be entertained by Zenaida.
               Joanna, in the mean while, had paid a visit to Aunt Juno's dominions, and
                  returning, had informed Helen that "them two young men was gwine to stay to
                  supper, 'cause they done told Marc. so."
               "That being the case," said Helen, "Aunt Juno and I must prepare for them."
               
               "Bruce," said Arthur, when they were assembled in the parlor after supper, "have
                  you no anecdotes to tell, no sermons to preach, no songs to sing? I wish you had
                  brought your violin."
               "Oh!" said Bruce, with assumed simplicity, "I do not play the violin, I play the
                  fiddle!"
               "That," said Arthur, "is a distinction without a difference."
               "No, it is not," persisted Bruce. "Paganini and Ole Bull were violinists. They
                  were scientific performers, while I am not."
               "Give us a backwoods' sermon, then," said' Arthur, "as the fiddle is
                  non-comeatable."
               "Miss Morris," objected Bruce, "this evening called me a private theatrical performer, and if I were to
                  yield to your solicitations and suffer myself to be prevailed upon to sing a comic
                  song, or preach a comic sermon, she would place me still lower in the scale of
                  society, and denominate me a clown."
               "I will be answerable for no diminution of Zenaida's favor," said Arthur.
                  "Moreover, she is now so much occupied in listening to Churchill's eloquence, that
                  she will not know what is the subject of our conversation. Bruce, tell me about
                  that eloquent backwoods' orator who cut the moon in two for epaulettes, buttoned
                  his coat with stars of the first magnitude, and wore the sun for a crown."
               "I heard some orations last summer," said Bruce, "that capped the climax of the
                  sublimely ridiculous; but, I really cannot deliver them to-night. I will call some
                  time at your office, and enliven your solitude with some of them."
               "Well," sighed Arthur, "I must submit; for 
                     
                        When you will, you will, you may depend on't,
                        And when you won't, you won't, so there's an end on't.'"
                     
                  
               
               Arthur found Bruce a less lively companion than he had ever known him to be; for
                  Bruce was envying Frank, who sat by Zenaida, deeply attentive to every word that
                  fell from her lips. Frank was unusually brilliant; for he felt that he would be
                  appreciated by the fair girl beside him, and he roused himself from his partial
                  lethargy. As Zenaida looked upon his dark eye, flashing with intelligence—upon his
                  noble form, a model of manly grace; as she listened to the great, thoughts to
                  which he gave utterance, her heart was sad within her; for she thought of the vice
                  to which it was too evident he was a slave, and, most earnestly, did she wish that
                  she had power to pluck from his hand, the poisoned cup from which he quaffed death
                  and destruction—to release his lofty spirit from this vile bondage.
               
               "Frank," said Bruce, as he jumped into the buggy, "we will have a dark ride
                  to-night. It is black as a stack of black cats."
               It was dark outwardly; but a new light was dawning in Churchill's mind—the first,
                  faint, rosy flush preceding the full glory of the perfect day.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               "ALLAN," said Mrs. Elliott, as she entered the room where he sat, "I wish you
                  would lay aside your books and take a ride with me this beautiful evening."
               "Certainly, mother," he replied, looking up, smilingly; "your wish is law. In what
                  direction are you going?"
               "A short distance in the country, to visit Mrs. Bernard and her sister, who is now
                  staying with her."
               "This sister,—have you ever seen her, mother?" he inquired with interest.
               "Yes, I met with her not long since, at Mrs. Bankhead's. We had quite a long
                  conversation, and I was much pleased with her. There is a look in her eye that
                  reminds me of you," she said, as she smoothed back his hair; and gazed with fond
                  pride into the depths of those loving, spiritual eyes.
               
               "The same I saw at the concert," said Allan to himself. "Are you ready,
                  mother?"
               "I will be in a few minutes," she replied. "I must gather a bunch of fresh buds
                  and flowers, as an offering to this sweet, fair girl, whose eyes sparkle, whose
                  color fluctuates, whose breath comes quick when the name of a flower is
                  mentioned."
               "You must resign this to me," said Allan. "I will arrange them, and they must be
                  my letter of recommendation, my passport to the favor of this fair lady, with whom
                  you have already ingratiated yourself."
               "I resign most cheerfully," said Mrs. Elliott; "for I know they will evidence more
                  exquisite taste if arranged by your hand."
               "It is well that I am flattery-proof," replied Allan, "or you would turn my head,
                  dear mother."
               The evening was a pleasant one, a warm one in early spring. The roadside was
                  bordered with fresh, tender grass of brightest green, the orchards around the
                  pretty cottages were white and pin, with their myriads of fragrant blossoms. The
                  early flowers were blooming brightly at Hawthornden, and the windows were all
                  opened to admit the balmy breath, and bright, sunshiny smile of spring. Zenaida
                  sat by one of them, her head bowed upon her hand, herself sunk in profound
                  meditation. She thought of her country-home, which she pictured as it now appeared
                  in all the lovely garniture of spring—she thought of her father's grave, which for
                  months had been untended by her loving hand—she saw the sunlight slanting upon it,
                  green as if there had been no death—she heard the soft sighing of the pendulous
                  willows, as they were swayed by the gentle air, the twittering of the little
                  birds, as they built their nests, conversing in loving words. These memories had
                  been so strong upon her, that a letter to Mrs. Cabell, called forth by them, was
                  lying open in her lap, in which she besought that lady to see her "black mammy,"
                  to charge her not to let the weeds grow upon that sacred grave.
               She had left mammy in the care of Mr. Thornley, and knew that she would not want
                  for anything; but this holiest place might be neglected, and the thought was too
                  painful to be borne. Hearing the sound of wheels, she looked up, and seeing a
                  splendid carriage stop before the gate, withdrew from the window; but not before
                  she had been seen, and recognized by the occupants of the carriage. She saw Allan,
                  as he tenderly assisted his mother to alight—she noted the reverential attention
                  with which he listened to her remarks, as they walked up the path to the door.
               "I have always a respect for the young man," she mused, "who reverences his
                  mother, and from the grace with which he attends her, and the confidence with
                  which she looks for these attentions, it may easily be seen that they are
                  habitual."
               She was glad that Arthur was in the city, that Helen was absent on a visit to a
                  neighbor; for she had heard so much of Allan Elliott from them, that she might
                  have been embarrassed had she met him for the first time in their presence. She
                  now came gracefully forward to welcome Mrs. Elliott, and, by her, was presented to
                  her son.
               Allan had delivered his flowers to his mother, requesting her to present them to
                  Miss Morris, and the lady now handed them to Zenaida.
               
               "Allan selected and arranged them," she said; "and they must be his passport to
                  your favorable regard."
               Zenaida raised her eyes, full of eloquent feeling, and that look, and the bright
                  smile, with which she received his offering, assured Allan that it would be duly
                  appreciated.
               Mrs. Elliott inquired for Helen, and was informed that she was absent. She praised
                  the beauty of the place; said "she would like to see it a few weeks later;" asked
                  Zenaida "if she did not like it as well as her more distant country home?"
               "I can never love any other place as I do Willowbrook," she replied, with a sigh;
                  her soft eyes suffused with tears; "for there is my father's grave, by which I
                  have been, in spirit, all this bright evening."
               "Pardon me, Miss Morris," said Mrs. Elliott, kindly, "if I have unwittingly
                  recalled painful associations."
               "The associations are sad, but not painful," replied Zenaida. "I would not have
                  mentioned this sorrow of my life, but I had, just before your arrival, been
                  indulging in a reverie of which my old home formed the principal theme."
               "Miss Morris," said she the musical voice of Allan, "have you adopted this as your
                  permanent home, or do you think of returning to Willowbrook?"
               "I came here, expecting to return after my visit was concluded; but brother Arthur
                  and Helen say that I shall not go back to my sylvan paradise, to pine away, in its
                  unbroken solitudes." She smiled and blushed as she said this, for she thought of
                  the means suggested by Arthur to prevent her return.
               They conversed upon many themes, prolonging their visit beyond the time allotted
                  to a fashionable call. Allan did not say much; but not a word that fell from the
                  rosy lips in the melodious accents of Zenaida's voice escaped him. The loveliness
                  and exquisite grace of her material form delighted him. Her wealth of hair, brown
                  in the shade, but gleaming goldenly in the sunshine, which rested lovingly upon
                  it—her sweet face, in which he could discern no fault—-had round, polished arms,
                  beautifully shaped hands, and rosy-tipped fingers, formed a model of beauty which
                  a sculptor might have loved to copy; but the soul which beamed from her love-lit
                  eyes enchanted him still more. Her thoughts were all pure and beautiful—her
                  well-chosen words tinged with poetic fervor, and each one touched a chord in
                  Allan's soul which had not vibrated before to the breath of living lips.
               "Miss Morris," he said softly, as they were about to depart, his mother's
                  attention being diverted from them, "I have listened with deepest delight to the
                  conversation of my mother and yourself; but I trust that the next time I see you
                  she may not be present to establish a monopoly, as she has done this evening. May
                  I hope that when you look upon these flowers," pointing to those he had brought,
                  "that you will bestow one thought on him who selected them, that they might be a
                  fit offering at so fair a shrine."
               It was well that Arthur was not near, to see the bright flush which now dyed her
                  cheek.
               
               "Well, Allan, said his mother, when they were again seated in the carriage, "was
                  it not better to ride with me this pleasant evening, to spend a few hours in
                  society so delightful, than to sit at home absorbed in the tragic fortunes of the house of Agamemnon, king of
                  kings, or picturing to yourself the beauty of Grecian Helen, or the agonies of
                  Prometheus? Now, what do you think of Miss Morris? Is she not charming?"
               "She," replied Allan, abstractedly, "is an unwritten poem, an unnoted strain of
                  dulcet music."
               "She is a sweet girl," continued Mrs. Elliott. "I have not met with one for many
                  years whom I admired so much. I shall regret it sincerely if she returns to her
                  home; for I consider her quite an acquisitions to our limited circle of
                  friends."
               Allan made no reply, being seemingly buried in a profound reverie.
               "This sweet flower," he mused, "nursed by the kindly influences of Nature, watered
                  by the gentle dews of heaven, and warmed into blushing beauty by the soft sunlight
                  and balmy air, possesses all its freshness, and fragrance, unexhaled by the false
                  glare of society, so called. No vanity lurks in that placid soul, which reflects
                  all images of beauty, as the calm, clear lake reflects the deep blue of heaven,
                  the bright emerald of the waving trees, the silvery radiance of the white moon,
                  and the golden-eyed stars. How would I rejoice could I transplant this lovely
                  blossom into the garden of my affections, that it might shed its beauty and
                  fragrance upon my life; or, to use my other metaphor, behold my image mirrored
                  lovingly in the clear depths of this pure soul! As too much handling by careless
                  hands tarnishes the fresh, bright beauty of the butterfly's wings, so does society
                  despoil its habitué. The sense of delicate
                  modesty which causes the eye to droop, the cheek to flush beneath the bold gaze of
                  the public, is blunted; the eye, if it grows, burns not with the holy light of
                  pure, deep feeling, but with the false fire of excitement and ratified vanity. How
                  different this butterfly with soft-tinted wings, flitting from flower to flower,
                  inhaling nourishment from sources whence others draw poison, undisturbed by
                  vanity, unallured by the desire of exciting admiration and making conquests!—As a
                  white-winged bird which has just bathed in some clear, sequestered fountain, in
                  rising again into its superior atmosphere, gleams brightly in the sunlight,
                  scattering profuse drops of the pure water, which glitter gem-like, so the soul of
                  this fair girl, which has laved its bright plumage in the unpolluted fountain of
                  holy purity, soars aloft, its unsullied whiteness shining in the light of truth,
                  thoughts pure as the white radiance of unstained innocence, bright as the
                  diamond-light which radiates from the diadems of kings, being scattered liberally
                  around her, alone unconscious of their intrinsic value."
               "Allan," said Mrs. Elliott, rousing him from this train of thought, "what are you
                  dreaming of? Your thoughts must be pleasant, for a look of sweet contentedness
                  beams from your eyes."
               "I will be candid, mother," replied Allan, smiling. "I hope the subject of my
                  meditations may be fortunate enough to meet your approbation. I was thinking of
                  Miss Morris, trying to find something to which I might liken her."
               "I can furnish you with a simile, without stopping to think twice," replied Mrs.
                  Elliott; "but doubtless it has occurred to you. I am sure the lily-of-the-valley
                  has often attracted you by its unpretending grace and modesty, and as this
                  pensive, delicate flower, in its quiet seclusion, fills the circumambient air with soft perfumes, so this young
                  Zenaida has around her an atmosphere of sweet thoughts and kind feeling, which
                  unconsciously pervades and entrances the hearts of all who come within its
                  influence."
               "I must see her again," said Allan; "she has haunted me since I saw her at a
                  concert some weeks since. When I pick up a book, her blue eyes and sunny ringlets
                  come before me, hiding the letters from my sight—those eyes so irresistible with
                  their look of appealing tenderness, and gentle melancholy. When I take up my
                  pencil, no ideal of the beautiful is present before me; but this living type of
                  beauty—this impersonation of the excellent in woman. When I seek to draw forth
                  melodies in which my soul bathes as in a flood of golden radiance, her soft voice
                  will now mingle with the strain—a voice so musically sweet, that I would follow,
                  did it lead, as Asia and Panthea followed the spirit-voices which led them to the
                  presence of Demogorgon."
               "Allan," said his mother, "you are either already in love, or will be soon,
                  irretrievably, with this little fay, who has bewitched us both. I, my son, am not,
                  and will not be jealous of your love for her. I know that your heart cannot always
                  be satisfied with the beautiful of its own creation, or with your love for me. I
                  would not, could not resign my place in your heart, without murmuring, to every
                  one; but I believe this fair child to be more deserving of the homage of your
                  lofty spirit than any other that I know."
               "Mother," replied Allan, deeply affected by her generous self-sacrifice in thus
                  resigning the first place in his heart to another, "no other love shall ever come
                  between me and thee; no other shall ever have power to monopolize the portion of
                  my love which has been thine, and ever shall be."
               "You are sincere, my son," she replied; "and I thank you; but this other love
                  will, be like Aaron's rod, it will swallow up all others."
               
               "Zenaida," said Helen, as she entered the darkening room where her sister sat,
                  musing, "has any one been kind enough to step in and relieve your loneliness? I
                  wish you had gone with me; for I have had a pleasant time—much more so than you,
                  sitting here, dreaming dreams and seeing visions, in your old childish way."
               "Waste not your sympathy on me," replied Zenaida, "but reserve it for some one who
                  stands more in need of it than I do. I have seen a vision of surpassing beauty, so
                  real that I conversed with, and obtained answers from the persons, besides
                  receiving this token from one of the visitants. Is not this beautiful?" she said,
                  holding up her flowers before Helen.
               "That token proves that you are not bewitched and dreaming" said Helen, gayly;
                  "but it also proves that you have had company. Was it Bruce, or Churchill?"
               "Neither," replied Zenaida. "Mrs. Elliott, or mamma, as Arthur calls her, has been
                  here; she regretted much that you were absent."
               "Was she alone?" inquired Helen.
               "No," she replied; "Mr. Allan was with her, and I have, at last, been honored with
                  an introduction to him, of whom I have heard so much; of whom, from Arthur's
                  remarks, I had been led to entertain a dread, almost equal to that with which the inhabitant of a besieged
                  castle looks upon the able general of the besieging force."
               "Well," questioned Helen, "have all your fears been dissipated by a 'blink o' his
                  bonny een,' a word from his eloquent lips?"
               "There is nothing very formidable—very alarming about him," replied Zenaida, as
                  with a light step, she bounded up the stairs to her own room, where Helen heard
                  her singing, softly, an old ballad that breathed of love.
               
               "So," said Arthur, when she came down to supper, "you have held a parley with the
                  redoubtable Elliott. Has the fortress capitulated at discretion, or hung out the
                  signal of surrender? But, to drop the metaphorical, and speak in plain, prosaic
                  language, what did you think of this young man?"
               "My first impression is favorable," she answered; "but I will suspend final
                  judgment upon his merits, until I am better acquainted with his innumerable
                  attractions and accomplishments."
               
               She bore her flowers to her room that night; she placed them in the window that
                  the night air and dew might preserve their beauty; she bent above them, the soft
                  moonlight raining upon her a shower of pure light, the night-breeze lifting the
                  loose waves of bright hair from her white brow, and even as she gazed, tiny voices
                  seemed to whisper from their fragrant hearts to hers, "Think of me as I have
                  thought of you." Their mission was well fulfilled, and she did think of him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               SINCE the evening spent at Hawthornden, a change had come upon Churchill, which
                  was evident to the most casual observer.
               The words of Bruce Wilson had made an impression on him, which was deepened by his
                  conversation with Zenaida. Her purity, her incorruptible truthfulness, her views
                  of life, ennobling and inspiring, often recurred to him, and were contrasted
                  painfully with his own heart, murmuring at the dispensations, the arrangements of
                  an All-wise Providence—untrue to the highest, holiest principles, and aspirations
                  of his soul. His desecration of talents, which he knew to be of no mean order, his
                  listless apathy, his sinful self-indulgence, his wasted youth, all rose before
                  him, and he was condemned at the bar of his own conscience. He blushed for his
                  manhood, shamed by the superior worth and truth of this delicate girl, who, weak
                  woman though she was, he doubted not, would bear, with the sublime heroism of a
                  martyr, every trial that might be allotted to her in life, while he sat, with
                  folded hands, and spirit overcome, at the very outset, by difficulties which, to a
                  brave heart, would have been mere trifles.
               When he thought of Zenaida he was overwhelmed by a sense of his own unworthiness,
                  for he knew that she must regard him either with scorn or pity, and either was not
                  to be endured by his proud, self-tortured spirit. He had often been spell-bound by the beauty of woman; but he
                  believed that "the ladies," as a class, were heartless creatures, using their many
                  charms to attract the admiration and homage of men, merely to feed the flame of
                  vanity, which gratified itself at the expense of the noblest, most generous
                  feelings of the human heart; revelling in tortures inflicted upon victims,
                  watching with intense and smiling interest the writhings of agony; but no such
                  accusation could his heart bring against Zenaida. She was kind, because her heart
                  was gentle, and overflowing with love and sympathy for suffering human beings, her
                  common brothers and sisters, and as a gentle angel did she minister where she saw
                  that her ministrations were most needed.
               To Frank she was a bright star, which beaconed to him, a storm-tossed mariner on
                  life's boisterous ocean, from the undimmed heaven of her superior nature. His good
                  angel had not deserted him; for the principles of truth within him were not dead
                  but sleeping, and now that they were beginning to awake, this gentle ministrant
                  spirit, whose eyes had been often wet with tears for him, lifted its head and
                  smiled again, glad in the light of dawning hope.
               
               "Zenaida," said Helen, "there is a note from Mrs. Bankhead. She is coming to see
                  us to-morrow, and wishes you to be prepared to accompany her home to spend some
                  days with her."
               Zenaida took the note, and, after reading it, glanced out through the open door at
                  the cheerful prospect.
               "Mrs. Bankhead is very kind," she said to herself, "and I must go with her; but I
                  would rather be in the country now, to watch the gradual unfolding of leaves and
                  buds; the joyful resurrection of nature from the death-like sleep of winter."
               "Will you go?" said Helen.
               "Yes," she replied; "though I cannot possibly be persuaded to remain long."
               
               When Mrs. Bankhead came, she found her prepared to accompany her home.
               "It is kind in you, my dear," she said, "to take the light of your young, rosy
                  life, and sweet, sunny smiles into my house, which is as thickly strewn with dead
                  hopes as the forest-floors with the fallen leaves of autumn. The only flowers that
                  bloom there are the perennial immortelles, gathered from graves where the grass
                  grows green above young heads once as bright, above hearts once as fresh, as
                  yours. They have been silent many years; but their spirit-forms still wander up
                  and down through the chambers of my heart, where they used to dwell, waking its
                  echoes like the wind that passes through the deserted castle, with a hollow,
                  sepulchral sound."
               
                  
                     
                        "'The wild rose may spring from a desolate rock,
                        And shed, o'er its barrenness, sweetest perfume;
                        And the oak that has felt the lightning's shock,
                        May stand, and the ivy around it will bloom.'
                     
                   So it is with the human heart, is it not, dear lady," said Zenaida,
                  soothingly.
               "Yes," she sighed; "they twine outwardly; but the heart within is dead and
                  withered. But I must not cast the shadow dow of my old griefs upon your sunny head and heart; I will be gay with you,
                  while you are with me."
               
               As they were walking on the street, the first day of her sojourn in the city, they
                  met Mrs. Elliott.
               "My dear Miss Morris," she exclaimed, "when did you come to town?"
               "This morning," replied Zenaida.
               "She has come to spend some days with me," said Mrs. Bankhead. "I intend to try to
                  render this visit so agreeable that she will be willing to come again."
               "I will render you every assistance, my dear Sarah," said Mrs. Elliott. "I shall
                  expect you to see me while you are in the city," she continued, turning to
                  Zenaida. "I will not take any excuse, Sarah," addressing, Mrs. Bankhead; "I shall
                  hold you accountable if she does not come."
               "We will come, with pleasure," replied Mrs. B., and Zenaida smilingly
                  assented.
               
               "Allan," said his mother, when he came home, "Miss Morris is in the city, spending
                  a few days with Mrs. Bankhead. I met them on the street this evening, and Sarah
                  promised to bring her to see me while she is with her."
               "The most agreeable piece of news I have heard to-day," replied Allan. "I have all
                  day long been busy with rent-rolls, adding up dull lines of figures, and this
                  intelligence comes across my mind as the soft cool breeze over the brow burning
                  with fever, or as the murmuring of the bubbling fountain upon the ear of the
                  traveler, parched with thirst in the arid plains of the desert."
               The next morning Frank Churchill, passing the office of Arthur, and seeing him
                  apparently disengaged, entered. In the course of a desultory conversation, he
                  ascertained that Zenaida was in the city, and forthwith resolved to call upon her
                  that evening.
               Allan Elliott had also formed the same resolution; and the evening found them both
                  at Mrs. Bankhead's.
               "Zenaida," said that lady, when the gentlemen were announced, "you will have need
                  of all your most bewitching smiles and brilliant conversation, if, unassisted, you
                  entertain both Frank Churchill and Allan Elliott."
               "I will try skirmishing with the light horse and artillery first," she replied,
                  laughing; "and if I am beaten in that kind of an engagement, I will bring up my
                  reserve."
               
               They discussed many themes; and, at last, Frank raised a book from the table by
                  which he was sitting.
               "This is not one of my old friend's books," said he; "she does not read Shelley.
                  Ah! it is yours, I see, Miss Morris. Is he a favorite of yours?"
               "Yes," she replied; "I have for him a deep, compassionate admiration."
               "Why do you regard him with pity?" said Frank; "his genius was of high order, and
                  is now acknowledged and appreciated by all lovers of the ideal beautiful. He
                  possesses a refinement of feeling, remarkable even in a poet; and the sweet
                  measures of many favorite authors seem harsh, when compared with his dulcet
                  strains."
               "I admire his poetry—some-of it at least—as much as you; but there is a note of
                  discord, an untuned string in his
                  heart-harp. His soul was a chaos of beautiful thought, exquisite feeling, from
                  which a world of unimagined glory might have sprung, if the spirit of God had but
                  brooded o'er its depths."
               "Why is it," said Frank, after a pause, "that so many of the most brilliant
                  geniuses the world has ever produced were the most unhappy of men? Like the
                  spider, which, out of its own resources, weaves a glittering web of burnished
                  silver that gleams in the sunlight, they have woven from their own minds tissues
                  of bright, imperishable thoughts; inwrapped in which they dazzle the
                  understandings of their fellows with radiancy almost intolerable. But still
                  dazzling as they may appear, high as they may soar before our admiring eyes,
                  heights of unattainable glory shine far, far above, and many, with weary wing,
                  seek again the level of the common earth above which they at first hung aloft
                  disdainfully. They were continually seeking something necessary to happiness,
                  which always eluded their grasp."
               "Why is this so?" said Allan. "This is what you wish to know? Many of them were
                  unhappy, because their souls, attuned to softest harmonies, were shocked by the
                  rude din of less susceptible spirits; because their hearts, interpenetrated with
                  love and all deep emotions, like delicate instruments, ready to vibrate
                  harmoniously beneath the gentle hand of love, were crushed and tortured into
                  discord by the rude touch of careless hands. The mere man of intellect suffers not
                  thus. He towers above the level of ordinary humanity, as the lofty snow-capped
                  mountain, in its glacial magnificence, towers above the valleys at its base,—cold
                  and brilliant, awakening admiration, but appealing not to the softer emotions of
                  the heart. Genius is elevated far above the level; but, like the mountain of less
                  sublime altitude, covered with luxuriant verdure which testifies of the genial
                  nature of the soil, it loves to be reflected in the heart of woman, as the
                  mountain is reflected in the clear depths of the lake which nestles lovingly at
                  its foot."
               "Miss Morris," said Frank, "what do you think is the cause of this great unrest in
                  the souls of these most gifted sons of earth?"
               "My explanation is a most simple one," she replied. "Genius is the inspiration of
                  God, who endows these bright souls, these great, nobly gifted human hearts, with
                  lofty feelings, of which He is Himself the fountain. This unsatisfied longing,
                  this ever-upward tendency, is the striving of the soul to reach its original
                  source. They would soar to the Infinite, but are shackled by the frailties and
                  passions of the finite; and the captives groan and chafe under this galling
                  bondage. Like the doves that were sent forth from the ark, are these bright souls.
                  They search over the wastes of the ocean of life for the olive-branch of peace,
                  hope, and joy. Those who find it, return joyfully to the ark, the bosom of their
                  Creator; those who do not, go mourning all their days, a prey to this unrest."
               "But," said Frank, "many of those of whom we speak, believe not in the existence
                  of this God, who endows them with the exquisite perceptions and intuitions of
                  genius; who sends them forth from the ark of his love upon the ocean of life."
               "True," said Zenaida, "they refuse to render homage to God to whom it is due; yet,
                  by the constitution of their minds and
                  hearts, there is upon them the necessity of worshiping; and the incense, which
                  should be offered up gratefully to the Maker, is burned before idols of their own
                  imaginings—the embodiments of their own abstract thoughts. They worship the
                  beautiful, yet deny the source of all beauty."
               Allan said nothing more; but diverted the conversation into another channel. He
                  would not risk the favor of Zenaida by expressing his true sentiments.
               "Miss Morris," he said, opening the piano, "will you not give us some music? I
                  know your singing-voice must be sweet as Nourmahal's, when she had worn the
                  enchanted coronal of flowers; for your voice in conversation is most musical."
               "I would play for you with pleasure, Mr. Elliott," she said, blushing painfully at
                  her deficiency, and sighing to think that she was unable to contribute to his
                  gratification; "but, fortunately for your patience, I cannot play, though I love
                  music with a passion not far from idolatry."
               Elliott saw that she was in earnest; that the thoughts or emotions he had called
                  forth were painful, and he did not renew his solicitations.
               "My mother," he said, at parting, "bade me urge upon your consideration the speedy
                  payment of a visit which she anticipates with much pleasure, as I do," he
                  concluded, in an inaudible voice.
               "Mrs. Bankhead," she replied, "has promised to go with me. Your mother's
                  description of her home has fascinated me so, that I shall be unable to resist the
                  temptations she presented, independent of her own society; for she promised mised
                  to show me her flowers, pictures, and many other pretty things."
               
               "I," said Frank sadly, to himself, as he walked away, "have no such treasures to
                  open for her delighted inspection; but I will earn a name, which she shall not
                  blush to write among her friends, or die in the attempt."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               "HERE, Zenaida," said Mrs. Bankhead, handing her a card, "is an invitation to join
                  a small party at Mrs. Elliott's to-night. She thinks it will be more pleasant for
                  you to be there with a party of young people, than with an old lady like herself;
                  at least that is what she says in her note to me."
               "She is very kind," said Zenaida, "to pay so much attention to an insignificant
                  stranger like myself."
               "You are too modest, my dear, in your estimate of yourself," said Mrs. Bankhead.
                  "It is very evident that Mrs. Elliott does not think you an insignificant
                  personage; and she is a good judge."
               
               "Halloo, Churchill!" exclaimed the pleasant voice of Bruce Wilson, who, with Paul
                  Anderson, was promenading leisurely along the street. Frank looked up as he was
                  thus accosted, and seeing who it was, joined them, saying,—
               "What now, Bruce?"
               
               "I was just about to ask what is the matter with you," replied Bruce, "that you
                  walk along in so brown a study, not recognizing an old friend until spoken to.
                  Come, constitute me your father-confessor, and I will grant you absolution, if
                  anything is weighing too heavily upon your tender conscience."
               "I was thinking," said Frank, evasively.
               "That is a self-evident proposition," replied Bruce; "and, unlike the propositions
                  of Midshipman Easy's respected father and friends, admits of no dispute. It was
                  upon the subject of your profound meditations that I wished to be
                  enlightened."
               "I cannot gratify that curiosity at present, how laudable soever it may be," said
                  Frank, decisively; "my thoughts would fail to interest you."
               "Had they not some reference to la belle Morris?" persisted Bruce.
               "Bruce, my good fellow," interrupted Paul, "don't be so pertinacious. Churchill
                  does not intend to tell you, so it is useless to persecute him with so many
                  questions."
               "Thank you, for reminding me that I was going too far," replied Bruce; "but
                  curiosity is the besetting sin of myself,—and many other human beings, ever since
                  Eve ate the apple, to find out how many seeds there were inside of it."
               "By-the-way," said Frank, "are you going to Elliott's impromptu party to-night?
                  You ought to go, Bruce, for it is given in honor of her whom you call 'la belle
                  Morris.'"
               "Certainly, I am going," replied Bruce. "The whole combined constabulary force of
                  this delectable city could not prevent me from going; for, if there are no rivals
                  in the field, Elliott will establish an undisputed claim to the attentions of Miss
                  Morris."
               "You had better be upon your guard," said Paul; "for if you out-general Elliott
                  you will have to get up early in the morning. He is just the kind of man to please
                  most ladies, independent of his money and that exquisite place of his,—to be the
                  mistress of which is sufficient temptation to any of the mercenary fair ones."
               "I believe you wrong Miss Morris," said Frank, hastily, "when you accuse her of
                  being capable of acting from an unworthy motives. There are many that do act thus;
                  but—"
               "She is not,' E pluribus unum,' one of 'em," said Bruce. "I do not wish to quarrel
                  with Elliott, for he is a good fellow, generous as a prince, bestowing largely of
                  his superabundance to feed the hungry, and clothe those who are exposed to the
                  inclemency of the seasons without the protection of garments."
               "Does that recommend him to you?" queried Paul, with an incredulous smile. "You
                  are a 'rara avis,' Bruce, when a man is about to rob you of your Palladium, the
                  sacred image enshrined in the temple of your heart, to think of consoling yourself
                  with the reflection that he is good to the poor,—ergo, that he is more worthy of
                  her than you could hope to be!"
               "I have not resigned all hopes yet," replied Bruce. "If he is really pleased with
                  her, I must appoint a committee of ways and means to decide what desperate act I
                  must have recourse to, to prevent his success. I suppose I will have to pick a
                  quarrel with him; challenge him to fight a duel; suffer myself to be slightly killed, that I may
                  effectually excite the commiseration of this charmante
                     femme."
               "Bruce," said Paul, "don't you want something to drink? You must be thirsty after
                  talking so much. If so, come along, you and Churchill, and I'll treat you."
               "I am ready, and willin' as Barkis," replied Bruce; "but I do not want anything
                  stronger than lager."
               "A wonderful change has come over the spirit of your dream since yesterday," said
                  Paul. "What is the matter?"
               "I'm a gittin' good," whimpered Bruce, "as the little boy said when his mother
                  gave him a whipping, and locked him up in a closet, from which the beautiful light
                  of day was wholly excluded."
               "Come, Frank," said Paul, "what will you have?"
               "Excuse me, if you please," said Frank, coloring deeply. "I do not wish to drink
                  anything."
               "Well," whistled Bruce, "'there are more things in heaven and earth, than are
                  dreamed of in my philosophy;' but I will never be astonished at any phenomenon
                  again, since Francis Churchill has refused to drink, will not take even a glass of
                  lager. I have not been as much surprised since the days when my father used to
                  tell me (and I believed it) that I would find a pot full of gold, if I would dig
                  at the exact point where the rainbow touched the earth."
               "Reserve your raillery for some more opportune season, Bruce," said Frank,
                  sternly, as the flush died out of his face. "I am not jesting. I am determined not
                  to drink any more. I have done it too long already," he said, bitterly.
               "Joined the Sons," queried Bruce, "or given a pledge to la
                     belle?"
               "I would like to get angry with you, Bruce," said Frank, "if I could. I would like
                  to knock you down for your impertinence, but I believe you are a good fellow, and
                  I will not punish you for these errors, which are the result of
                  thoughtlessness."
               "'Twould not be worth the trouble to knock him down," said Paul. "He is not an
                  accountable being, and must not be held amenable to the laws that govern common
                  mortals. There's a screw loose somewhere in his head, and, entre nous, he is not right here," and Paul touched his
                  forehead.
               "Deeply indebted for your kindness in exempting me from all the penalties attached
                  to my misdeeds. As I am granted all the privileges of the ancient jesters, I must
                  don my livery, and cry, with the meditative Jacques, 'Motley's the only wear.'
                  But, mon cher Frank, you did not answer my
                  questions just now, and I will repeat them, as I can do so with impunity."
               "Well, then, if you must know," replied Frank, "I have neither joined the Sons nor
                  given a pledge to Miss Morris; but I have registered a vow in my own soul, and it
                  shall be as sacred and inviolable as if the pledge had been signed in presence of
                  a multitude."
               "Congratulate you; and that you may hold out faithful unto the end, is the prayer
                  of brother Bruce Wilson."
               "Incorrigible boy!" said Frank.
               "Who told you to call me a boy?" said Bruce, with assumed indignation. "Is not my
                  coat-tail as long as yours? Haven't I as handsome whiskers as you? Can I not
                  consume as many Havanas as you? Can I not sit through as long a sermon as you
                  without falling asleep? Boy, indeed!"
                  he continued, with an accent indicative of the most supreme contempt; "next thing,
                  I suppose, you will be advising me to return to my anxious maternal relative, who
                  may be ignorant that I am out."
               "Good morning, Bruce Rex," said Frank; "I will beat a precipitate retreat, before
                  you grow dangerous."
               "I'll placard him, as they did David Copperfield when he was sent to school, if he
                  does not subside to a more reasonable temperature," said Paul; "for his very beard
                  is curling with ire, like Hassan's."
               "Don't be absurd, Paul!" said Bruce, imitating a tone and manner closely allied to
                  Paul's on similar occasions. "Good-by, Churchill," he continued; "the best of
                  friends must part; but 'when shall we three meet again?' To-night, at
                  Elliott's?"
               "I do not know that I shall go," replied Frank. "I'll see about it."
               
               The evening came, the guests assembled at Mrs. Elliott's, the few who were honored
                  with invitations congratulating themselves upon their good fortune; for rarely did
                  the "Fairy Bower" resound with mortal revelry. The young ladies decked themselves
                  with more than usual care, and summoned their brightest looks and sweetest smiles,
                  with which they hoped to make an impression upon the hitherto insensible heart of
                  Allan Elliott; but his eyes saw only one sweet face; his ear was attentive but to
                  the music of one voice, the breath of which passed over his heart-strings, drawing
                  forth Æolian harmonies.
               "Miss Morris," he said, after some time had elapsed, "will you allow me to show
                  you something which I think very beautiful?"
               Zenaida gave a smiling assent.
               "Come with me, then," he continued.
               The doors were all thrown open, the rooms brilliantly lighted; but Allan passed
                  through them into the conservatory, where the flowers gleamed softly in the still
                  moonlight. Some had closed their bright eyes in sleep; but others hung lovingly
                  above the still form of the beautiful Flora, like guardian-spirits, unwearied in
                  their watchful love.
               Zenaida gazed with delight upon the scene, and its beauty bringing vividly before
                  her the description in the Epipsychidion—the words fell from her lips by an
                  irresistible impulse,— 
                     
                        "The ivy and the wild-vine interknit
                        The volumes of their many twining stems;
                        Parasite flowers illumine, with dewy gems,
                        The lampless hall; and when they fade, the sky
                        Gleams through the thick woof of their tracery
                        With moonlight patches, or star-atoms keen,
                        Or fragments of the day's intense serene,
                        Working mosaic on the Parian floors."
                     
                  
               
               "Ah!" said Allan, a bright smile of pleasure illuming his face, "that beautiful
                  quotation is most appropriate;" and, in the spirit of this poem, he continued the
                  quotation,— 
                     
                        "This isle and house are mine, and I have vow'd
                        Thee to be lady of its solitude."
                     
                   Then, seeing the blush that mantled Zenaida's cheek, he exclaimed, "Pardon
                  me, Miss Morris. I was too abrupt!"
               
               "Certainly," she replied, smiling. "I will pardon this ebullition of your
                  enthusiasm; for the spirit of enchantment broods over this scene, and no one,
                  within its charmed circle, ought to be held responsible for his words. It is the
                  garden of Armida; and that," she said, hinting to the statue, "is the faint image
                  of the lovely enchantress; the bright creation of the poet's dream."
               "And I,' said Allan, struck by a sudden thought, "I am Rinaldo, bound by rosy
                  chains, and thralled by the seductive, overpowering, sweetness of this place; and,
                  like him, wasting my noblest powers in a seclusion, which is not the otium cum dignitate to which I ought to aspire in
                  later years, after the battle of life has been fought and won. Miss Morris, I
                  thank you, as Rinaldo did his friends, for bringing the bright mirror of truth,
                  and showing me to myself in a true light."
               "Nay," replied Zenaida, "I am entirely innocent of such intention. I, as you say,
                  'thralled by the sweetness of the place,' merely made a comparison, and from this
                  suggestion you have deduced a personal application, of which I thought not."
               "Thought is electric," said Allan; "and a casual word or idea often vibrates
                  through the mind as the shock of a galvanic battery through the body. But, Miss
                  Morris," be continued, as several ladies and gentlemen invaded their retreat, "we
                  are no longer alone, and for me the spell of the place is broken."
               He turned to retrace his steps to the rooms where the company had been assembled,
                  and at the door, encountered Bruce, who looked quite disconsolate. Having saluted
                  the pair, whom any one else would have permitted to pass without interruption,
                  Bruce exclaimed,—
               "My dear Elliott! excuse me for interrupting you; but I must tell you, that I am
                  opposed to your monopoly of Miss Morris, the bright star, which has been eclipsed
                  all the evening by your interposition. I wish, Elliott," he continued, "you could
                  be persuaded to give us some music. I have heard many rumors of your proficiency
                  as a performer, but have never had an opportunity of deciding whether these rumors
                  are correct."
               "Ah, Bruce!" said Elliott, with an arch smile, "you are but an indifferent
                  diplomat. Your strategies are too apparent. You must excuse me from exhibiting,
                  for the amusement of the crowd, my skill in an accomplishment which, no doubt, is
                  much overrated by rumor, which I cultivate solely for my own gratification."
               He drew himself up proudly, and would have passed without further parley; but
                  Bruce exclaimed,—
               "I think that very selfish in you, Elliott, to waste all this sweetness on the
                  unappreciative air."
               "I am the best judge of my own actions," he replied. "Will you permit Miss Morris
                  to pass, Mr. Wilson? She is, doubtless, heartily weary of this most unprofitable
                  and uninteresting discussion."
               "On the contrary, I am much interested," she said; for her kind, gentle heart was
                  pained by the vexation so apparent in Bruce's generally unclouded face. As she
                  moved on with Elliott, she bowed, and her kindly smile instantly dispelled the
                  gloom which threatened to overshadow Bruce.
               "Well," soliloquized he, as he watched their receding, forms, "he has not yet secured all her smiles to
                  himself, and I will yet compensate myself for this night's disappointment."
               "So, Bruce, my dear fellow," said Paul Anderson, coming forth from a shadowed
                  nook, from which he had witnessed the discomfiture of Bruce, "I must condole with
                  you. The eagle has flown away with your dove, and you, unfortunate that you are,
                  are here gazing after them in their flight, as if some powerful genie had bound
                  you to the spot by a spell of magic-poor fellow!"
               "Well," replied Bruce, "''tis true, and pity 'tis, 'tis true,' My case does look
                  rather desperate. In the horoscope of my nativity there was, at this crisis, a
                  conjunction of unpropitious planets; but 'while there is life there is hope;' and,
                  you know, I am by nature as elastic as if I were composed of India-rubber. If I
                  fall, I always rebound."
               "A disposition truly enviable," said Paul; "upon the possession of which I
                  congratulate you most sincerely; for it is my private opinion, publicly expressed,
                  that you will need all the consolations it can afford you in this emergency."
               "Come," said Bruce, "let us go and spy out the beauties of this land of the blest,
                  over which my beautiful inamorata may, one day, reign supreme. It is a realm, the
                  sceptre of which ought to be swayed by a fairy like her. When she is queen here, I
                  will be one of her courtiers."
               "Bruce!" exclaimed Paul, "I believe that you belong to a class denominated
                  Salamanders by Steele and Addison; for you go unscathed through fires which
                  consume many wiser men than you. The flame of love plays around your heart
                  innocuous as the lambent flame around the brow of Ascanius, the grandson of
                  Anchises."
               "Better that than, moth-like, to singe my wings in every flame," responded Bruce,
                  sententiously.
               Paul continued, as if trying to solve a problem: "He is either so shallow, that he
                  is incapable of any deep emotion; or so deep, that, like the unfathomable sea, the
                  winds of passion have no power to stir but the outward surface of his nature; the
                  inmost depths remaining calm."
               "Now you have hit the right nail on the head, Saulus, my boy," said Bruce,
                  approvingly. "You have portrayed my character with a pencil dipped in the spray
                  from the deep fountain of Truth, who, we are told, lives at the bottom of a well;
                  and, according to my notion, displays queer taste in the selection of a
                  habitation."
               "By the thirty thousand deities of Rome!" said Paul, "I swear that you are—"
               "Hold!" ejaculated Bruce, with a prolonged whistle; "I've heard many oaths; but
                  that's the most 'hifalutin' one that ever fell upon 'the tin-pan of my
                  auriculars,' as either Mrs. Partington or Mother Goose says—I forget which."
               "Is Churchill here?" asked Paul; "I have not seen him."
               "No," replied Bruce; "he has refused to grace the halls of his rival with his
                  lofty presence. He does not practice 'love's divine self-abnegation,' as I do. But
                  he had as well 'hang his harp on the willows,' that it may sigh forth mournful
                  numbers, in concert with my own."
               
               "Yes, said Paul; "he is poor; and if he were to address this fair one, she would
                  certainly ask,— 
                     
                        'Will the love that you're so rich in,
                        Make a fire in the kitchen;
                        Or the god of Love turn the spit?'"
                     
                  
               
               "I wish Frank had heard you then," replied Bruce; "he would have knocked you down
                  without any compunctious after-visitations of conscience; for your assertion is an
                  unmitigated slander."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               THE next morning, a bouquet of beautiful flowers, with the compliments of Allan
                  Elliott, was handed to Zenaida.
               The red rose, blushing with its declaration of love; the geranium, declaring his
                  preference; the myrtle, which whispered of "love in absence," and many others of
                  similar signification, were blended in one beautifully harmonious combination,
                  appealing to the heart of Zenaida.
               "In the East they do tell their loves in flowers;" and Allan had chosen this
                  Eastern medium of communication.
               "What an exquisite bouquet!" exclaimed Mrs. Bankhead, as she took it from the hand
                  of Zenaida. "Allan," she continued, "is a beau worth having—as he has so many
                  pretty things at his disposal!"
               "There," she said, "is a ring at the door. Who can it be?"
               The servant brought up a card, inscribed Bruce Wilson, G. L.;" and said, as he
                  gave it to his mistress,—"Please marm, Mr. Wilson wishes to see Miss Morris."
               "What in the world does that wild boy mean by these initial letters, G. L., after
                  his name?"
               "They stand for 'gentleman of leisure,' I suppose," said Zenaida, laughing; "I
                  never heard that he had any kind of occupation."
               "That is it," replied Mrs. Bankhead. "Well, Zenaida, you have completely bewitched
                  our young gentlemen,—the gay, the grave, the studious, and the one of leisure.
                  What art do you possess?"
               "I have no art," she replied, earnestly.
               "Or, if you have, you have also the ars celare
                     artem. Do not stop to refute this insinuation," said the lady. "I was
                  jesting; for know that you are perfectly sincere, conscientious, even in the
                  practice of the little feminine arts and wiles of coquetry."
               
               "Miss Morris," said Bruce, in a subdued tone, with an assumed look of patient
                  resignation and endurance that would have done credit to an Indian votary beneath
                  the wheels of the car of Juggernaut, "I come this morning to appeal to you,
                  against yourself, for the manner in which you treated me last night; me, your
                  devoted slave and humble admirer."
               "For mercy's sake, Mr. Wilson!" exclaimed Zenaida, "tell me what I have done, and
                  do not, I beseech you, look at me so like, the 'Knight of the Rueful Countenance;'
                  I was not aware that I had done the things which I ought not to have done, or left undone the things which I
                  ought to have done; but, if you will convince me that I have injured you in any
                  way, I will make all due reparation."
               "In the first place," said Bruce, "the first charge which I find against you in my
                  bill of indictment is, that you have caused me a most grievous disappointment. I
                  went to Mrs. Elliott's solely for the sake of seeing you; and I caught only an
                  occasional glimpse of you as you walked or talked with Elliott. I felt very much
                  as Adam and Eve did, after their abrupt exodus from Eden, when they peeped through
                  the bars of the gate or the cracks of the fence, at the angels promenading in
                  their old pleasure-grounds, and I should have been buried inextricably in the
                  'Slough of Despond,' had it not been for a look, you cast graciously upon me, as
                  you passed, as a charitable person throws a bone to a hungry specimen of the
                     genus canis."
               "Nonsense, Mr. Wilson!" replied Zenaida, laughing; "but, as you think the evidence
                  sufficiently strong, despite its circumstantial nature, to convict me, what
                  judgment do you wish me to pronounce upon myself?"
               "Of course," said Bruce, "you plead guilty to having preferred the society of
                  Elliott to that of myself; and the court decides that you shall ride with Bruce
                  Wilson, and thereby 'pour some of the healing balm of consolation' upon his heart,
                  wounded by your cruelty. Has the prisoner at the bar anything to say, wherefore
                  this sentence should not be carried into execution?"
               "No," replied Zenaida; "this most merciful sentence of the honorable judiciary
                  tribunal meets with my approbation. When is it to be executed?"
               "Without delay," responded Bruce; "I wish that you ride on horseback, an' it
                  pleases you."
               "I prefer that mode to any other," said she; "but my riding-dress is at
                  Hawthornden; I did not expect that it would be called into requisition during my
                  short sojourn in the city."
               "I will send for it," said Bruce. "It will take but a few minutes to get it."
               He immediately went to find a messenger, and most opportunely met one of the
                  family servants on the street.
               "Here, Pluto, you infernal scamp,—that isn't saying bad words; it's just the
                  meaning of your name,—" he said, "I want you to go out into the country a couple
                  of miles. Take this note and give it to Mrs. Bernard, and be back again in three
                  shakes of a sheep's tail. Do you hear?"
               "Yes, I hears, Massa Bruce," replied Pluto; "but ole Marse, if he catch me, will
                  give dis nigger such a lickin' that dis hide won't hold shucks."
               "Never mind that," said Bruce.
               "But I does mind," persisted Pluto, "an' so would you, Massa Bruce."
               "I'll tell father I sent you," said Bruce, "so go along. You know he never whipped
                  you in his life, you fit inhabitant for the Castle of Indolence."
               His objections being finally removed, Pluto took his departure, and, after an hour
                  and a half had elapsed, which seemed a century to the impatient Bruce, he returned
                  with the hat and riding dress of Zenaida.
               Bruce was now compelled to defer his ride until after dinner; but he sent the
                  dress to Zenaida, and informed her that
                  he would call for her at four o'clock. The appointed hour found him at Mrs.
                  Bankhead's, and when Zenaida came down equipped for riding, Bruce thought he had
                  never seen her look so well.
               "You ought always to wear that costume," he said, gallantly; "it is so becoming. I
                  cannot endure to see a lady ride in a bonnet of any description; for these
                  exquisite little bouquets, which, in common parlance, are dignified with the
                  appellation of 'dress-bonnets,' are eternally slipping off, and a long bonnet
                  hides the face too much."
               "What a beautiful horse you have for me!" exclaimed Zenaida. "It is very wild, I
                  suppose."
               "Fleet as the wild horse which bore Mazeppa across the desert, or the winged
                  steeds that draw the chariots of the hours," replied Bruce; "but docile and gentle
                  as a lamb."
               He assisted her to mount, and vaulting lightly into his own saddle, they were soon
                  in motion. Bruce saw that Zenaida was an elegant and graceful equestrienne, and so
                  directed his course by Elliott's, that he might arouse that gentleman's jealousy,
                  and retaliate upon him for the advantage he had gained over him on the preceding
                  evening; but Elliott was not visible. They soon left the city behind them, and
                  Zenaida became much interested in the observation of the country through which
                  they passed, which she had not seen before.
               
               "Mr. Wilson," she said, "what is the name of this noble animal? I always address
                  my horse as if it were a sentient being, and I must know its name."
               "That one," replied Bruce, "is named Dare-devil, after the celebrated quadruped
                  appertaining to the renowned Brom Bones."
               "And yours?" questioned Zenaida.
               "Mine," he answered, "is called Don Bobtail Fandango, after a mythical personage I
                  read about somewhere. You will perceive that this euphonious appellative is most
                  appropriate, from the fact that a portion of his caudal appendage has been
                  amputated."
               "But," said Zenaida, "that name is inconveniently lengthy."
               "It is easily abbreviated," replied Bruce, demurely. "His familiar cognomen is
                  'Robert Narrative.'"
               "That," she said, stealing a curious look at the oddity beside her, "is a most
                  uncommon name."
               "Therefore it pleases my fancy," he replied. "I do not like anything that is
                  common. I admire you much more, with your name, than I would if it were Polly, or
                  Kitty, or Susy, or Peggy. I do not like any flowers but exotics rich and rare,
                  unless they were culled by your fair hands. That would give a value in my eyes to
                  sunflowers and hollyhocks, but it would be wholly extrinsic. You have not the
                  power, like Rex Midas, to transmute everything into gold; but you possess the
                  power to render even the most worthless things to me more valuable than all the
                  gold of California."
               "I would test your sincerity, if I could," replied Zenaida; "but now that it would
                  be found wanting."
               "I'll swear—" began Bruce.
               "Swear not," she interrupted, "'neither by the heaven, for it is God's throne; nor
                  by the earth, for it is His footstool.'"
               
               "Well, then, I will affirm that I but spoke the truth," he said.
               "To how many ladies have you made this same affirmation," inquired Zenaida,
                  gayly.
               "To not more than fifty," replied conscientious Bruce.
               "I admire your candor, though it speaks but little in favor of your constancy,"
                  she said, laughingly.
               "I never before have found the cynosure of my eyes, the load-star of my destiny;
                  but now my heart shall be true to thee as the needle to the pole, and 
                     
                        'Thou shalt still be adored, as this moment thou art,
                        Let thy loveliness fade as it will;
                        And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart
                        Shall entwine itself verdantly still.'"
                     
                  
               
               "That is a very pretty theory," replied Zenaida; "but it is not often reduced to
                  practices I can refute the words of one poet with those of another:— 
                     
                        'What is a poet's love?
                        To write a girl a sonnet;
                        To get a ring, or some such thing,
                        And versify upon it.'
                     
                   This is fact, while yours is fiction."
               "Oh, fair skeptic!" said Bruce; "you will yet find out, that truth may be stranger
                  than fiction."
               
               She returned from her ride with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes, and, when she
                  entered the room Mrs. Bankhead exclaimed—
               "Why, my dear, you are positively radiant. A ride on horseback is certainly the
                  most excellent cosmetic that ever was invented, and I shall hereafter recommend it
                  as a beautifier of the complexion to all my young lady friends."
               "A ride is delightful," replied Zenaida, "especially when one has for a companion
                  a person so tragi-comic as Bruce Wilson. I never know when he is serious."
               "He does not know himself," said Mrs. Bankhead; "but I think, my dear, you had
                  better stay some time with me. You appear to enjoy yourself very much; and, I
                  assure you, I will be unfeignedly glad to have your company."
               "I cannot stay longer at present," replied Zenaida. "Arthur will call for me
                  to-morrow; but you must come out to Hawthornden to stay some time with us, to eat
                  strawberries, and enjoy the unfolding beauties of this sweet season."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               MAY, robed in rich garments of emerald, embroidered thickly with the gold and
                  white jessamine stars, mingled with roses looped in glowing festoons, crowned with
                  a diadem of translucent rain-drops, quivering with intense light, as if a living
                  spirit of bright parti-colored flame were imprisoned in each clear-sphered orb,
                  tripped o'er the land. Sweet sounds, soft as angel whispers, floated round her, as
                  the music of the delicate Ariel round the shipwrecked upon Prospero's enchanted
                  island, and from her fragrant breath the air was redolent with sweet-odors.
               
               Many times had Zenaida seen and conversed with Allan Elliott, and, almost
                  insensibly, his beautiful thoughts, his refined sentiments, had wrought a spell of
                  fascination over her. He sympathized with her in her love of the beautiful; he
                  encouraged her in the expression of sweet thoughts and feelings, which, almost
                  unknown to her, lurked in the secret hiding places of her soul. The most delicate,
                  etherealized thought or fancy might be communicated to him without the
                  apprehension of being misunderstood, through want of sensibility on his part. He
                  read to her favorite books, bringing to view undiscovered beauties in their
                  familiar pages, illuminated by the clear light of his sympathetic genius, his
                  penetrating mind,—as the sun discovers even the most minute points in the
                  landscape, obscured by mists before his rising. The written thoughts, which had
                  been hidden from all eyes, as the bright gems in the unfathomed abysses of ocean,
                  were brought forth for her inspection, and of those which were yet to be written,
                  she was made the muse, the inspiration. Her face grew into proportions so
                  beautiful beneath his pencil, that with the inanimate image, Pygmalion-like, he
                  fell in love until he looked again upon the original, which transcended every
                  effort of his art.
               Now, in the afternoon of this May-day, they sit together under the shadow of the
                  wide-spreading hawthorns, from which the place was named. The trees are covered
                  with delicate white blossoms, thrown over them like a bridal veil of costly lace
                  of exquisite texture, hanging in graceful folds almost to the ground, and forming
                  an odorous canopy above the heads of the pair who sat beneath. The turf, the
                  golden-brown hair of Zenaida, and her black dress were sprinkled thickly with the
                  falling flowers which rained down in a shower of fragrance from the overhanging
                  branches, waving in the freshening breeze, the avant-courier of a storm. The massy
                  clouds, like huge black ships, swept across the blue deep of heaven, freighted
                  with blessings or destruction, the occasional flash and boom of the signal guns
                  announcing the combat about to begin.
               Zenaida watched the gradual approach of these belligerent squadrons, the darkening
                  of the earth from which the sunshine and blue sky were shut out by the
                  interposition of their black hulks; but at length, turning to Allan, whose eyes
                  were upon her, she said,—
               "I love the storm in its sublimity and awe-inspiring grandeur; but, from the
                  appearance of these clouds, I think this one will be unusually severe. Come into
                  the house, and from its shelter we may look forth upon this elemental strife.
                  See!" she continued, "the sky grows more dark, the wind more fierce."
               As she spoke, a flash of lightning, a blaze of intolerable radiancy, blinded her
                  eyes, and they hastened into the house.
               Zenaida's prophecy proved to be correct. The rain poured in torrents; the winds
                  raged violently, like the torrent which has derived fresh impetus from the rains
                  of spring, bearing down, with resistless force, opposing objects. Boughs, which
                  refused to bend, were broken, and many a lordly tree was bowed to the earth, its
                  coronal of fresh green leaves soiled with the stains of miry clay. Those that were
                  left, seeing them fall, tossed their branching arms wildly, and shrieked forth in
                  uncontrollable agony, quivering visibly to their heart's core.
               
               Zenaida stood near the window, and Allan was by her side.
               "Miss Morris," he said, at last, "what can have roused the anger of the cruel
                  Juno? The winds are loosed from the cave of Æolus, blowing from every direction,
                  as they did when the fleet of the pious Æneas was spattered upon the Tyrrhenian
                  Sea. But," he continued, seeing the earnest thoughtfulness of her face, "you are
                  not thinking of Juno, or the cave of Æolus, or the misfortunes of the future
                  founder of the Latin race."
               "No," she replied; "I was thinking of the storm described in the book of
                  Job,—listening for the voice of God in the thundering of lightning, feeling the
                  breath of his mouth in this gale, which bends old trees like reeds before its
                  might."
               "For once," said Allan, "I must say that I do not, and cannot sympathize with you,
                  for no such voice is audible to my ear; and call me skeptic if you will, but, I
                  must confess, that I believe that it never existed, never was heard, save by
                  persons of highly excitable, keenly imaginative minds, constituted like your own.
                  As the cave of Æolus, the anger of the Goddess, were the offspring of the poet's
                  fertile fancy, so it is simply reasonable to suppose that this voice of the
                  Creative Deity, for which you are so intently listening, emanated from the same
                  inexhaustible source. There were poets among the Hebrews as well as among the
                  Greeks and Latins, and we must make allowance for their poetic license, of which
                  they, doubtless, availed themselves, to its fullest extent."
               "You do not believe, then," said Zenaida, sorrowfully, recoiling coiling as if
                  smitten by the thunder-bolt, "that this 'still, small voice' was ever audible to
                  mortal ears; that this Almighty Power is the Pilot who guides the storm-clouds,
                  which, in obedience to His commands, have covered the blue of heaven with a veil
                  of thick darkness, pouring out this refreshing flood upon the earth?"
               "No," replied Allan, "I do not believe it. These clouds are directed by the
                  immutable laws of Nature; they are formed by exhalations from the earth and sea,
                  and are above us now, piloted by the winds. It has been warm to-day, the heated
                  air ascended, the winds, from other points, rushed in to fill the vacuum, and the
                  clouds were borne along with them. When I speak non-poetically, I account for the
                  phenomenon we now witness, in this plain way."
               "Nature and God, in my vocabulary," said Zenaida, sadly, are synonymous terms, and
                  these immutable laws of which you speak are the dicta of Omnipotence. You study
                  effects, but are blind to the cause of these effects. How can there be laws
                  without a lawgiver—a law-maker? Why do the winds, the waves, the clouds, obey,
                  unless they recognize a Power which has created them, and has the right to command
                  their services?"
               "Take care, most beautiful of theologians," said Allan; do not wade in the deep
                  waters; do not corrugate the smooth whiteness of that unruffled brow with the
                  wrinkles of abstract thought; do not compress so firmly those rosy lips, which
                  were made for smiles and the expression of sweet thoughts."
               "Ah!" she replied, "I see that you wish to waive the discussion of this subject;
                  but I am not so easily to be diverted.
                  Oh! Mr. Elliott," she said, with quivering lip and tearful eye, "it is sad, most
                  sad, to think that to you, to whom all other books, the works of frail, human
                  beings like ourselves, are so familiar, this Divine book, the source from which
                  all true wisdom flows, should still be a sealed volume, the Divine character of
                  which is, by you, unrecognized."
               "I am not so ignorant of its contents as you suppose," replied Allan. "I have read
                  the whole, and have been thrilled with admiration at the elevated sentiments and
                  deep poetic fervor of the prophets."
               "But it was only with admiration for the beauty of diction and sublimity of
                  imagery that you read, not with love and reverence for the Being whom it displays,
                  in condescending mercy and long-suffering kindness; who raises us from the depths
                  of despairing degradation, and places us upon the pinnacles of supreme happiness.
                  Alas! for your spiritual eyes are blinded by the thick veil of unbelief, so that
                  you cannot discern the truth in its beautiful proportions."
               "I would give all that I possess," said Allan, "could I place, upon the promises
                  of this Book, the firm reliance of many, or yield credence to its miracles, to the
                  history of Him whom you hail the Saviour of the world. But, no; I retract. I do
                  not wish to fetter my free spirit by any chains; I will not surrender myself to
                  the dominion of this superstition; I will not be the vassal, or swear allegiance
                  to any spiritual authority."
               "That which you call bondage, is true liberty," replied Zenaida; "and, instead of
                  chains, forged by the Beneficent Power, to fetter the wings of the spirit, He
                  furnishes you with wings, borne up by which you may soar far beyond all bounds
                  conceived by the finite wind of man; wings which would lift you higher than you
                  may ever hope to soar upon your Dædal pinions, the fabrication of your own daring
                  imagination."
               "It may be even so, as you say," replied Allan, gazing admiringly into her
                  soul-lit eyes, and face glowing with holy enthusiasm; "but I lack faith."
               "Look!" said Zenaida, pointing to the scene spread out before them. "Can you
                  behold this display of love and power unmoved? Can you yet refuse to bow in homage
                  before Him, who dyes the earth and sky with this deep glory?"
               The clouds had poured out their treasures, and were now piled in huge, black
                  masses athwart the east. "Sublime rested the heavens above the earth; a rainbow
                  arched itself, like the ring of eternity, upon the dark back-ground of cloud. The
                  storm, with broken wings, passed with a weary thundering beneath the colored
                  Eden-gate of the east, and the evening sun gazed after it through its tears; and
                  its glances rested on the triumphal arch of Nature."
               The whole earth and sky were bathed in a flood of golden light, diffusing over all
                  things a soft radiance, giving them a look of etherealized, unearthly beauty. The
                  pools of water, pellucid gems dropped from the coronal of the angel of the storm,
                  gleamed like burnished gold; the fresh foliage of the tall trees reflected the
                  same radiance caught from the glory of the sky, the reality of which surpassed
                  imagination and defied description. Tall pillars of cloud of ebon blackness,
                  crowned with wreaths of diamond-light, were beside others, mantled in purple of such rich depth of tinting,
                  that the regal hues of earth paled in comparison. Others were clad in robes of
                  fiery crimson, bordered with fleecy ermine whiteness and fringes of gleaming
                  silver, while others wore the soft, rosy flush of morning's earliest dawn.
               "Behold!" said Zenaida, softly, "that glorious arch of promise! Oh that it
                  recalled to thee the covenant of God! that it could speak to thy heart of His
                  faithfulness and truth!"
               "I find," replied Allan, "that you are skilled in this language of Nature, of
                  which, it seems, I am most lamentably ignorant; so whenever I need an interpreter
                  I shall call upon you."
               "You are jesting still, but I am earnest," she said, raising her eyes appealingly
                  to his.
               
               As the sun sank, some lines of cloud collected as if they would hide his light;
                  but the burning eye glanced through to take a loving, lingering look upon the
                  beautiful earth, like the eye of the prisoner through the iron bars of his grated
                  window. With his departure, the bright magic hues faded from the earth and sky.
                  The clouds dispersed, and the deep, smiling blue of heaven was again seen,
                  unstained, save by a few light particles of snowy-white vapor.
               A deep, holy calm succeeded the wild commotion of the evening; and soon the moon
                  walked forth majestically, casting looks of wondering admiration upon the Earth,
                  who had emerged with brightened loveliness from her bath of sparkling water.
               Allan still lingered, and his voice, attuned to sweetest harmony, spoke of his
                  love. The words, which would have awakened once a glad answering echo in the heart
                  of Zenaida, now passed over its chords, not indeed mute, but vibrating with a wail
                  of mournful sadness, like the strings of the wind-swept harp.
               "Can I," she said, in self-communion, "a creature, count upon the enduring love of
                  this nobly-gifted being, by whom his Creator's claims are unacknowledged? He holds
                  himself amenable to no higher law than the impulses of his own heart. I will, God
                  helping me, use my influence over him for the good of his own soul. I will
                  endeavor to undermine the foundations of this castle of unbelief in which he has
                  intrenched himself, fondly believing that his fortress is impregnable. Poor Allan!
                  God grant that thou mayest not be cut off in the glory of thy youthful beauty,
                  while thy heart is still insensible to His love!"
               That night her pillow was wet with tears, and many prayers were breathed for him
                  who prayed not for himself.
               She dreamed that she stood with an expectant throng, who waited the appearing of
                  the Son of Man. He came amid the glory of his spiritual brightness, surrounded by
                  tens of thousands of angels, who hymned his praises. She was by Allan's side, her
                  hand clasped in his; but, as she gazed, she was raised above the dissolving earth,
                  and borne away, away from him, whom her soul loved. Quivering with intense
                  emotion, she awoke; but this dream haunted her; she knew that it was not without a
                  deep signification, and she shuddered as she thought.
               The rose of love, which she had gathered in the garden of life, was not without
                  its sharp thorn.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               A FEW days passed, and Zenaida sat again beneath the hawthorn-tree; but Allan was
                  not there. She had been reading a book, presented by him; and its margins,
                  penciled by his hand, spoke eloquently to her; but the book had now fallen from
                  her hand: her eyes were fixed in pensive abstraction.
               The bees murmured softly in the flower-laden branches above; but she listened not
                  to the hum of their cheerful conversation. A little bright-eyed bird perched above
                  her, chirping some sweet, clear notes; failing to gain her attention, he turned
                  his pretty head first on one side, then on the other, regarding her curiously—then
                  he broke off a little bloomy twig, and, taking good aim, dropped it in her lap;
                  but she did not look up.
               She was thinking deeply and sadly. She loved Elliott; but not with the reverential
                  love of which she had dreamed. His mental superiority, his exquisite taste and
                  deep feeling, commanded her admiration and appealed irresistibly to her sympathy.
                  His mind was a rich mine, and she delighted to explore its depths, to bring to
                  light its hidden treasures,—the flashing diamonds of wit,—the soft, bright pearls
                  of poesy,—the glowing rubies of loving and tender thoughts. She would have taken
                  the thorns from his pathway, and twined them into a coronal of her own white brow,
                  that he might enjoy the fragrance and beauty of life without its piercing
                  griefs.
               But her love was mingled with pity; for she saw him, who was in many things her
                  superior, bound with the chains of spiritual darkness, while her own soul reveled
                  in the clear light of unveiled truth. He was blinded by the mists of earth, while
                  she soared far above their chilling influence, basking in the warmth of the sun
                  from which her soul drew light and life, as the flowers from the sun of the
                  material universe.
               While she sat thus, she heard not the roll of wheels, and noticed not the stately
                  equipage which drew up, proudly, before the gate. She was roused by hearing her
                  name called.
               "Miss 'Naida," said Joanna, for it was she; "Miss Helen say, 'will you please fur
                  to come into de parlor?'"
               "Who is there?" asked Zenaida.
               "Miss Florida," replied Joanna; "Marse Arthur's sister; an' if you never seed her,
                  I'll tell you, she is the beautifullest lady, you ever laid your two eyes on; but
                  she's made hersef mighty scace since we bin livin' here."
               "I have seen her often, Jo," said Zenaida; "and you are correct in saying that she
                  is very beautiful."
               "I wonder," she continued, soliloquizingly, as she walked toward the house, "what
                  has brought her here? Can it be that she, the impersonation of stately pride, has
                  unbent from her frigid hauteur sufficiently to be willing to acknowledge as her
                  sister her brother's wife, my own good, beautiful Helen, whom any family might be
                  proud to claim as a member of its circle?"
               
               She quickened her step as these thoughts rose in her mind. As she entered the room
                  where Helen and her new-found sister sat, Florida rose to meet her with her former
                  graceful dignity and kindness.
               "You have not forgotten Florida Bernard, Miss Morris," she said, "the companion of
                  so many rides and rambles in the days that are gone?"
               "That would be impossible," replied Zenaida. "Time, since those days, has laid his
                  hand so softly upon your brow, that I cannot perceive the slightest change in your
                  appearance."
               "I cannot say the same," said Florida; "for these years that have flown and are
                  numbered with the past, have transformed you, whom I remember as a timid child,
                  into a graceful young lady. Your eyes," she continued, as Zenaida looked up, "are
                  unchanged; wistful as ever."
               Long had been the struggle in the proud, high heart of Florida Bernard, ere she
                  could prevail upon herself to pay this visit. She liked Helen, and knew that the
                  happiness of Arthur was safe in her keeping; and many blessings of late had she
                  secretly called down upon hear beloved brother and his chosen wife; but, she had
                  opposed him at first, and she did not like to yield,—to confess that her
                  prejudices had been unfounded, that the better feelings of her heart had slept
                  during so long a time. Since the evening of the concert, each day she had said,—"I
                  will go to my brother;" and each sun since then had set upon that promise
                  unfulfilled.
               Her heart had yearned toward her little nephew Harry; and often did she sit
                  picturing his sweet face, his pretty baby wiles, and inarticulate speech. Upon
                  this day this little image had haunted her so perseveringly,—had appeal so
                  irresistibly to her love, that she determined to seek her brother,—to beg pardon
                  for her past unkindness; to beseech him and Helen to forget it; to admit her into
                  the charmed circle of their love.
               Helen had been deeply wounded by the unkind treatment she had experienced from her
                  husband's family; but she forgot all the bitterness of her former feelings when
                  she saw the stately pride of Florida humbled before her; when she felt upon her
                  brow her kiss, a holy peace-offering and token of reconciliation. Her heart
                  swelled with all a mother's pride when she brought her darling Harry, and placed
                  him in the arms of his unknown aunt.
               Harry gazed inquiringly at her with his bright, black eyes, and smiling, showed
                  one pearly tooth, and the pretty dimples in his soft, rosy cheek. Florida looked
                  long and earnestly upon him; and, raising her eyes to those of Helen, said,—
               "Sister, you have cause to be proud of this boy: he is the most beautiful creature
                  I ever saw. There is a look of such bright intelligence in his eyes, so like your
                  own. My brother's child! my Arthur in miniature," she said, softly; "may holy
                  angels guard thee; may the richest blessings of Heaven be showered upon thee from
                  the bounteous hand of the Giver of all good; may thy parents, thou little gem,
                  polish thee so, that when the Saviour comes to gather up his jewels, thou mayest
                  be found worthy a place in the resplendent crown which shall adorn his glorified
                  head! Helen," she said, "I cannot stay with you till Arthur comes; but tell him that I have at last obtained
                  the victory over my stubborn spirit. Tell him that the heart of his sister has
                  been his, through all these long, weary months of separation, as it is now his—and
                  yours," she continued, taking the hand of Helen within her own, and bestowing upon
                  her a kiss of affection.
               "Forgive me, my sister," said Helen, with broken voice and tearful eyes, "that I
                  ever came between you and Arthur. I knew not of your opposition to our union until
                  it was consummated; and bitterly did I regret that, unwittingly, I had severed a
                  loving family."
               "Say no more upon this subject forever, my dear Helen. I," she said, "would have
                  brought my parents with me; but, when I left home, I did not know that I had
                  summoned courage enough to carry me through this dreaded ordeal, the reality of
                  which I have found much more agreeable than the anticipation. You have a generous,
                  noble heart, my sister, to forgive so freely, so fully, all the slights, the
                  reproaches cast upon you by my own erring self. God and your pure conscience will
                  reward you."
               With another lingering look at Harry—another murmured "God bless you!" she
                  departed; leaving behind in the breast of Helen pleasure without alloy.
               "Arthur will be so delighted!" she said, again and again, as she looked anxiously
                  for his coming.
               "Why, Helen, my dear wife!" exclaimed his cheery voice, as she met him at the
                  gate, "what has happened? You look bright as a new sixpence, or as Hebe, the
                  goddess of perpetual youth. Where's Harry," he said, not pausing for a reply to
                  his first question, "and our little sister? Is she under the hawthorn trees
                  dreaming of Elliott, or reading those everlasting books?"
               Zenaida heard these last words; and, rising from the door-step where she sat with
                  little Harry, went forward to meet Arthur.
               "Here I am," she said, "amusing myself with this incomparable Harry,—neither
                  dreaming of Elliott nor reading."
               "How long since you last thought of him?" asked Arthur, playfully.
               "I never gratify idle curiosity," she answered. "But, here, take Harry, and listen
                  to what Helen has to tell you. I am delighted that she has some agreeable news to
                  communicate, for it will give me a brief respite."
               She walked away, the sadness, which had weighed upon her, lightened by the joy
                  that had beamed upon her sister's pathway; and Arthur again appealed to Helen to
                  know what had occurred.
               She told him all.
               "All's well that ends well," he said, when she concluded. "I knew they would come
                  straight at last, and I am delighted, my dear wife, as much for your sake as my
                  own."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               "BRUCE," said Paul Anderson, as they were walking leisurely, as usual, along the
                  street, "have you seen Churchill lately? I never saw so perceptible a change in
                  any one in so short a time."
               
               "He has ceased to imbibe 'the rosy,'" replied Bruce; "and, you know, Horace says,— 
                     
                        Invidus, iracundus, iners, vinosus, amator,
                        Nemo adeo ferus est—ut non mitescere possit,
                        Si modo culturæ patientem commodet aurem.'"
                     
                  
               
               "Translate," said Paul, imperatively; "I don't believe you can do it."
               "I'll give you a free translation," responded Bruce. "No drunkard is so far gone,
                  but that he may be improved, if he will stop drinking."
               "By Apollo and the muses!" ejaculated Paul, "that is a free translation with a
                  vengeance. I would like some more specimens of the same sort."
               "O! ainimæ dimidium meæ," replied Bruce; "most
                  probably you would; but I do not display my erudition upon all occasions. It will
                  be some time before you see another flash so brilliant as that."
               "From your quotation," said Paul, "I may indulge the hope that there is some
                  chance for amendment in you and myself. I come under the head of one
                  classification, the 'iners;' you under two, the 'lazy' I and the 'lover.' But," he
                  continued, "look yonder at that contemptible Ridgely, coming this way! I fear he
                  is beyond the hope, the possibility of redemption. I would, if it were not too
                  much trouble, walk around three squares to avoid meeting him. I wonder how long it
                  will be before he squanders all of his wife's property? Fool that she is to let
                  him touch it!"
               "He does not always lose at cards," said Bruce. "Many are the unsophisticated
                  pigeons that have been plucked by his veteran hand. I have heard that his wife was
                  deeply in love, with him when they were married; but suppose her love has all
                  evaporated, for never see her now unless attended by that Leslie Barclay, her
                  devoted cavalier. Oh, most noble Agamemnon!" he continued, with a mock bow to
                  Ridgely, as he passed, "I would advise you to keep your eye upon your Clytemnestra
                  and her Ægisthus, or they may form a conspiracy against that worthless life of
                  yours. I would, if I were in your lady's place, lay violent hands upon it, if I
                  could engage the assistance of an able coadjutor like Barclay."
               "Paul," said Bruce, after a silence of several minutes, "let's go down
                  Broadway."
               "I prefer to walk here," replied Paul, decisively, resisting Bruce's efforts to
                  draw him to the other street.
               "Saulus," said Bruce at last, "do you see that donkey yonder, backed up so
                  stubbornly against the curbstone? You are just like it; and if it, like the
                  ever-memorable 'critter' that carried Balaam, were to be endowed with the power of
                  utterance at the present time, it would speak to this effect, 
                     
                        'Come one, come all—this rock shall fly
                        From its firm base as soon as I!'"
                     
                  
               
               "Bruce," said Paul, "I wish you would get married, then you would not torment me
                  so unmercifully."
               "I would," replied Brace; "but I am afraid I might be like a man I read about the
                  other day."
               "How was that?" queried Paul.
               "He said," responded Bruce, "that when he was first married, his wife, he thought, was so sweet that he
                  was always wishing to eat her; 'and now,' with a deep sigh, after some years had
                  elapsed 'I am sorry I didn't.'"
               "I shall take warning by his examples," said Paul, "and eat mine up during the
                  honey-moon. 'Twill save much trouble, no doubt."
               "Talking of a wife, my dear Pylades," remarked Bruce, "why do you not endeavor to
                  conciliate your quondam ladye-love, the fascinating Beatrice? From all that I can
                  ascertain she must combine, in a degree truly surprising, the attractions of Venus
                  and Psyche—the beauty of the person, and the mind, or soul. Your heart must be as
                  impregnable as the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein, if it can resist the allied forces
                  of two most formidable powers."
               "I am completely insensible," replied Paul. "Her arrows glance off from me
                  harmless as the darts from the adamantine armor of Mars. I will introduce you to
                  her, if you wish it."
               "I accept your proposition," said Bruce; "but I am still the sworn champion of 'la
                  belle Morris,' and, armed with the ægis of this faithful love, I will fearlessly
                  encounter this potent adversary. If that will not be sufficient guaranty of my
                  invulnerableness, my security, I will borrow the 'talaria' and the tongue of the
                  eloquent Mercury, the patron of all equivocators, who has often rendered most
                  valuable assistance to me in many an emergency, as he ought to do; for I am one of
                  his most ardent admirers and faithful followers."
               "She is very fond of poetry, Bruce," said Paul, leading the conversation back to
                  Beatrice. "Before you go to see her, you must rub the rust off, and burnish up all
                  your weapons of this nature."
               "Verbum sapienti," replied Bruce, "I shall earn
                  the reputation, and win the title of the 'Mad Rhymer.' But I need no study of this
                  part beforehand. I have rehearsed too often. When shall we go?"
               "Now—that is, this evening, if it suits you," said Paul.
               
               "My friend, Mr. Wilson," said Paul aside to the delighted Beatrice, after the
                  ceremony of introduction had been performed, "is a devoted admirer of the ladies,
                  and is a sort of monomaniac on the subject of 'love,' upon which he converses most
                  eloquently."
               Beatrice took the hint as he intended, and, after some casual commonplace remarks
                  drew the discourse into this channel.
               "Mr. Wilson," she said, softly, "I have heard that you are devotedly fond of
                  ladies' society, and it is but reasonable to suppose that you have felt the sweet,
                  bewildering influence of love—the favorite theme of poets—the most blissful,
                  heavenly feeling to which the human heart can yield?"
               "Your inference," replied Bruce, gravely, "is perfectly correct, and does credit
                  to your discrimination. I have loved madly, passionately, devotedly; have
                  experienced the truth of the assertion that 'Love is a seventh heaven in a glance,
                  an eternity in a moment, a whirlwind in a sigh!'—A tempest in a tea-pot, an
                  unmitigated humbug," parenthetically to himself.
               "Ah!" sighed Beatrice, "how delightful, yet how painful!"
               "Yes," responded Bruce, quickly, with a sigh, "the counterpart of her own,—
                  
                     
                        "'To love, it is a painful thrill,
                        But not to love more painful still;
                        But oh! it is the worst of pain
                        To love and not be loved again.'"
                     
                  
               
               "You have anticipated me, Mr. Wilson," said Beatrice; "have given expression to my
                  thought; but I hope I may not infer, from that long-drawn sigh, that you have felt
                  the pangs of unrequited affection."
               "Oh!" said Bruce, with a tragic air, that nearly destroyed the equilibrium of
                  Paul, who, with assumed gravity, was an amused spectator of this scene,— 
                     
                        "'Who that feels what love is here,
                        All its falsehood, all its pain,
                        Would, for even Elysium's sphere,
                        Risk the fatal dream again?'
                     
                   But," he continued, "I, unfortunate that I am, am no sooner loosed from the
                  spells of one enchantress, than I am bound by the irresistible fascinations of
                  another, more potent than Circe."
               "Surely," murmured Beatrice, softly, "all are not so cruel, so insensible to your
                  love. Such devotion, such charming susceptibility, must eventually recommend
                  itself favorably to the consideration of some equally sensitive heart." Here she
                  cast upon Bruce a look which said plainly as words could have done, that "her
                  heart was thus sensitive."
               Bruce was not unobservant of this tender glance, and he immediately returned it,
                  exclaiming,— 
                     
                        "'Tell me not of Houris' eyes;
                        Far from me their dangerous glory,
                        If those looks that light the skies,
                        Wound like those that burn below.'"
                     
                  
               
               "Miss Bainbridge," interrupted Paul, at this crisis, "will you be so kind as to
                  favor us with some music?"
               Bruce seconded the motion, saying,— 
                     
                        "'I pant for the music which is divine,—
                        My heart in its thirst is a dying flower;
                        Pour forth the sound like enchanted wine,
                        Loosen the notes in a silver shower;
                        Like an herbless plain for the gentle rain,
                        I gasp, I faint, till they wake again.'"
                     
                  
               
               Beatrice, after many objections, commenced the prelude, and, after a few bars,
                  paused as if irresolute. Bruce 
                     immemediately
                     immediately
                   cried,— 
                     
                        "'Let me drink of the spirit of that sweet sound;
                        More, oh, more! I am thirsting yet!'"
                     
                  
               
               Beatrice yielded gracefully to this solicitation, and commenced playing. Paul took
                  this occasion to scribble upon a piece of paper, which he slipped unobserved into
                  Bruce's hand,—"In your disgust at this performance, don't forget your rôle."
               Bruce nodded intelligently; then leaned over, and turned the leaves of the
                  music-book with the greatest assiduity, hanging, apparently entranced, upon the
                  sound of Beatrice's voice. When she concluded her song, he roused, as if from a
                  reverie of bliss, sighing forth the words,— 
                     
                        "'My soul is an enchanted boat,
                        Which like a sleeping swan doth float
                        Upon the silver waves of thy sweet singing;'"
                     
                   And, as Beatrice rose to leave the piano, he waved her back, saying,— 
                     
                        "'Oh! once again, divine enchantress, roll
                        The golden tide of music o'er my soul!'"
                     
                  
               
               
               She sang again; and again did Bruce, calling to his aid the poet's words, instill
                  the sweet poison of his flattery into her willing ear.
               "While you sing," he sighed,— 
                     
                        "'I sail on, away, afar,
                        Without a course, without a star,
                        But by the instinct of sweet music driven;
                        Till, through Elysian garden islets,
                        By thee, most beautiful of pilots,
                        Where never mortal pinnace glided,
                        The boat of my desire is guided:
                        Realms, where the air we breathe is love.'"
                     
                  
               
               As soon as he concluded, Paul moved an adjournment, and they left Beatrice
                  completely entranced by the poetical compliments of the eloquent and elegant Mr.
                  Wilson. Elliston Hunter's wish was granted. She had met with one who foiled her
                  with her own weapons, by whom she was entirely eclipsed.
               
               "Paul, my dear fellow," said Bruce, when they were again on the street, "may his
                  Satanic Majesty—hero of nursery-maids, terror of evil-doers, who is mythically
                  represented with horns and cloven hoofs—catch me, if I don't believe that girl
                  thought I was really charmed! Music! oh, ye gods and little fishes! it would have
                  thrown St. Cecilia into strong convulsions. 
                     
                        'I had rather hear a brazen canstick turned,
                        Or a dry wheel grate on its axle,'
                     
                   than be compelled to listen to its like again."
               "Bruce, Bruce!" said Paul, reprovingly; "how will you ever get absolution for all
                  the falsehoods you utter?"
               "Oh, Sathanos!" replied Bruce; "it becomes thee well to reprove sin."
               "Poor girl!" said Paul; "she will never again listen, with complacency, to the
                  common-place adulation of her admirers. You have insured her unhappiness, unless
                  you determine to follow up the suit, and take her for better or worse."
               "'Twould be for worse, I haven't a doubt," replied Bruce; "and I am not disposed
                  to offer up myself a sacrifice upon the altar hymeneal."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               "ZENAIDA," said Arthur, "what do you think I have for you? Something which has
                  excited my curiosity so, for several hours, that I could hardly resist the impulse
                  to examine its contents."
               "What is it?" she inquired, calmly.
               "Nay," said he; "if you are so indifferent, I think I will keep it for my own
                  edification."
               "You do so delight to envelope your communications in mystery," she said. "But,
                  whatever you have, give it to me, and let me see if it is worthy to excite your
                  curiosity."
               "I verily believe it is a love-letter," said Arthur, drawing forth a neatly
                  enveloped note. "One of your devoted ones gave it to me for you."
               Zenaida took it, and, hastily breaking the seal, read:—
               "Mr. Churchill will be deeply indebted to Miss Morris if she will kindly permit him to accompany her to the
                  Floral Exhibition to-morrow night."
               "'Tis a love-letter is it not?" inquired the persevering Arthur.
               "You raised my expectations so high," said Zenaida, "that I am quite disappointed.
                  Here, you may read it, if you wish."
               Arthur glanced over the note, and, as he gave it back to her, he said,—"Well, if
                  it is not a love-letter, it is the opening prelude to a strain which will sound in
                  your ear to-morrow night."
               "Must I go?" she asked.
               "Certes," replied Arthur. "Frank is a good fellow, and if you refused to go you
                  would wound his feelings, which I do not wish you to do. By-the-way, Bruce Wilson
                  was telling me that Frank has given up the use and abuse of all intoxicating
                  liquors, which intelligence rejoiced me exceedingly. Have you extracted a pledge
                  from him to this effect, Zenaida? If you have, you may feel proud of your work;
                  for it will be the temporal salvation of Frank, who was, by far, too noble a man
                  to be permitted to fall a victim to this destroyer."
               "No, brother," replied Zenaida; "I have had no instrumentality in the work of his
                  reclamation; but you have given me sincere pleasure. I felt an interest in Mr.
                  Churchill the first time I ever saw him, which has been increased during the
                  progress of our acquaintance. He is talented; and now his talent may shine forth
                  in unclouded splendor, and, like the city that is set upon a hill, not be
                  hidden."
               "What would Allan say to this expression of interest in another, and that other
                  one who may prove no despicable rival?" queried Arthur.
               "Mr. Elliott," she replied, sadly, "has no right to object to the expression of my
                  interest in Mr. Churchill, or any one else."
               "I thought he had," said Arthur, provokingly glancing, with a twinkle of mischief
                  in his eye, at the face of Zenaida, which glowed with a rosy flush at the mention
                  of Allan's name.
               
               As Helen and Arthur were to be of the party, she consented to go with Frank,
                  though her heart recoiled from the gayety by which she would be surrounded; but
                  she strove to conquer her sadness, though she did not affect a gayety she did not
                  feel, and conversed pleasantly with Churchill, with whom she was soon circling the
                  ball, in Company with many other promenaders.
               The room was brilliantly lighted, the pillars wreathed with evergreens and
                  garlanded with flowers, which were scattered around in gorgeous profusion. Plants
                  of many kinds, of luxuriant growth and bloom; temples and altars; cool, mossy
                  grots, were there, from the roofs of which hung their lamps—bright flame-colored
                  blossoms. In the midst, a fountain threw up its jet of burnished, silvery waters,
                  reflecting the light of the innumerable gas-burners.
               Zenaida gazed upon this scene, and turning to Frank, exclaimed—"We might easily
                  imagine that we were in pagan Rome; that this festival was held in honor of the
                  Goddess Flora; that for her these mossy shrines were built, and to her these
                  votive offerings were made!"
               
               "Perhaps the inscription over this little temple," said Frank, "may inform us to
                  whose worship it is dedicated. See these letters, ingeniously formed with little
                  white berries. 'Tis a verse from Horace Smith,— 
                     
                        'Were I, O God! in churchless lands remaining,
                        Far from all voice of teachers and divines,
                        My soul would find, in flowers of thy ordaining,
                        Priests, sermons, shrines.'"
                     
                  
               
               "No thought of the pagan goddess," said Zenaida, "in the heart of the one who
                  framed that inscription with such loving care. The sentiment, embodied in those
                  lines, is beautifully adapted to the work: a temple of living, fragrant flowers;
                  an offering of flowers upon the miniature shrine; a band of floral priests,
                  ministering around the altar, dedicated to the God who created them."
               "It is the embodiment of a beautiful thought, an exquisite feeling; and this
                  conception could only have emanated from a poet-soul; this work could only have
                  been executed by artistic fingers, which have sought thus to portray, with
                  flowers, the images of loveliness which haunt the soul, as the painter delineates
                  upon his canvas, the poet in his verse, or the musician in his soul-thrilling
                  harmonies. This light from the inner-life is but a faint shadow of the glory
                  unrevealed," said Frank.
               They passed on.
               "Miss Morris," said Frank, after a pause, "I am on the eve of my departure from
                  this city; and this evening may be the last one I shall ever spend with you."
               "Where are you going, and what has caused this sudden determination, this
                  unlooked-for announcement?" questioned Zenaida, with much surprise in her
                  tone.
               "I have deliberated long and earnestly upon the subject," he replied; "and it is
                  my conviction that it will be for my good to leave this place, where I have been
                  worse than useless. I have no ties which ought to bind me here. In a new place I
                  may forget my past wasted years, or remember them only as a warning. Fool that I
                  have been!" he continued, bitterly. "I have been here a gleaner in this old field,
                  in which others are established by the right of priority, while in other
                  localities fields are rich with golden harvests, inviting the reaper. Fame,
                  ambition, love, call upon me in trumpet-tones not to be disregarded. The chains of
                  despondency and sloth, which have bound me, are broken; the book of my life, with
                  its past records, is sealed; and, upon the unsullied page of the new volume before
                  me, I must write deeds of renown, words of living light and truth, which shall
                  penetrate and dissolve the dark clouds of ignorance that envelope men's minds. I
                  must win a name and high position among my fellow-men, or die in the attempt. But,
                  pardon me, Miss Morris, I have been thoughtlessly intruding all this egotism upon
                  you, forgetting, in the absorbing interest which the theme possesses for myself,
                  that it cannot be of the slightest moment to you."
               "You do me great injustice," she replied, reproachfully. "You know that my
                  sympathies are always ready when my friends make any demand upon them."
               "You are not then wholly indifferent to my future fate?" said Frank, eagerly, and
                  with a brightened countenance. "You will not refuse me a place among your friends?
                     I will be happy in my voluntary
                  banishment, if I may be encouraged to believe that a kindly thought of me will
                  sometimes cross you when I am far away."
               "I will bid you 'God speed,'" she answered. "I doubt not that the day will come,
                  and that ere long, when I will be proud to say, 'the distinguished Mr. Churchill
                  once honored me with his friendship.' Nay, do not look sad," she said, looking up,
                  "or I shall be compelled to try to persuade you to remain, and then, if I should
                  succeed, what would become of all prospective honors, which the future holds in
                  reservation for you? All would vanish like the delicate tracery of the frost-work
                  in the morning sunshine; or rather, would be obscured as the sunlight by the
                  sombre cloud."
               "I could not resist your pleadings," he replied; "so spare your eloquence. Your
                  kindly sympathy has cheered me inexpressibly. I would call down the blessing of
                  Heaven upon you; but they will shower voluntarily upon one so good and gentle,
                  without my imprecation."
               
               "Who is that with Churchill?" inquired a young man, who stood by Hamilton
                  Bainbridge, observing and commenting critically upon each new face that engaged
                  his attention. "She is a new star in our city galaxy; but although she is among
                  our belles, she does not appear to be of the same nature. What an etherealized
                  expression! she looks as if she had just descended from a purer region,—as if her
                  brow were still fanned by angel's wings, and her heart were still attuned to their
                  delicious harmonies! Who is she, Bainbridge?"
               "What a deuthed long speech!" drawled the lisping voice of the elegant Hamilton.
                  "I would have been bored to death, if I had not been looking at that pretty girl
                  yonder, instead of listening to you. That little creathure, over whom you grow tho
                  eloquent, is a Mith Morrith, a 'nobody,' from the country, where we spent the
                  lasth summer."
               Having exerted himself sufficiently to give utterance to this piece of
                  information, Hamilton relapsed into silence, throwing himself into the most
                  graceful attitude by the pillar upon which he leaned.
               "What do you mean by a 'nobody?'" persisted the young man. "If you know anything
                  of this beautiful young lady, I would like to hear it. I am sure that even your
                  malice could not invent anything to her disadvantage."
               "Don't bother me about her," said Hamilton. "I have neither time nor inclinathion
                  to talk about her."
               "You boast of your residence in France," said the youth, mentally apostrophizing
                  the unconscious Hamilton; "but I wish to Heaven you had studied the principles of
                  common politeness, in which the inhabitants of that country are said to excel.
                  You," he said, with an indignant glance, which was thrown away upon the exquisite,
                  "you talk of being 'bored;' but, may I be hung as high as Haman, if you are not
                  the most insufferable simpleton, the most unmitigated dullard, I ever saw in the
                  whole course of my terrestrial pilgrimage! You are not worth the rope it would
                  take to hang you, or the powder and shot which would be requisite to blow out—I
                  was going to say your brains; but I beg pardon for insinuating that an article so
                  common was in your possession."
               Happily in ignorance of the opprobrious epithets mentally tally applied to him, Bainbridge stood unruffled
                  amid the storm which raged in his companion's breast, adjusting his eye-glass,
                  curling his mustache, and tenderly placing back the flowing ringlet which had
                  fallen over his face; while so engaged, wondering if that 'pretty girl' was
                  noticing the lustre of his magnificent diamonds.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXX.
               HELEN was sitting in the hall, which was open to admit the breeze, laden with many
                  sweet-odors stolen from the adjacent gardens and meadows, when she was startled by
                  a footstep. Looking up, she saw Allan Elliott standing in the door.
               "This door stands so invitingly open," he said, with a graceful bow and smile,
                  "that I cannot think an intruder, like myself, unwelcome. But you are alone. Where
                  is Miss Morris?"
               "Her pet, little Amy Bainbridge, has been with us to-day," replied Helen; "and
                  Zenaida, though not so cheerful as usual, yielded to the solicitations of the
                  sweet child, and with her has been roaming through the fields and woods, hunting
                  straggling wild-flowers, and chasing butterflies. Amy has, doubtless, succeeded in
                  dissipating her thoughtfulness; for her sunny cheerfulness and youthful glee are
                  irresistibly contagious."
               "Where are they now?" said Allan, impatiently.
               "In the rose-bower, in the corner of the yard, I believe," replied Helen, rising.
                  "I will send for them."
               "No, do not!" said Allan; "I will go in search of them myself. You know," he
                  continued, archly, "I am no stranger to that beautiful retreat."
               Helen laughed, as he passed through the back door, bounded lightly down the steps,
                  and stole softly across the yard.
               Zenaida sat upon the little rustic bench, and above her the vines were so thickly
                  interwined, that the sunlight, at noon, could only penetrate in stray beams.
               Amy was asleep, with her bright head pillowed in the lap of her friend; her hat,
                  half-filled with strawberries, leaves, and flowers, lying on the grass before
                  them. Her cheeks were so richly colored, that the blushing roses on the arbor
                  peeped in at her suspiciously, as if they thought the bright tint stolen from
                  themselves. Her lips were parted, disclosing her white teeth; and over all her
                  sweet face there breathed repose, as if the "Goddess of Peace had taken the
                  poppy-garland of sleep" and placed it upon her fair young head.
               Zenaida leaned over her, rapt in contemplation of her innocent, unconscious grace
                  and loveliness, wondering if the sweet calm of this life before her were to be
                  disturbed by the storms of angry passions, or that smooth brow furrowed by the
                  plowshare of care and sorrow. Her fingers twined lovingly the glossy, golden
                  ringlets of the little sleeper, and the mesmeric influence of her gentle touch
                  deepened her repose.
               "May the spirit of Love keep watch and ward over thee, little Amy!" she murmured;, "and may the one love
                  which thy heart, like mine, shall know, descend upon thee softly as the summer
                  dew, awakening new beauties in thy pure soul,—not fall with the
                  scathing power of the lightning, withering thy young hopes! My heart was once free
                  as thine; but now,"—she paused, with a sigh, and, raising her drooping head, saw
                  before her the object which then engrossed her thoughts. She blushed deeply, and
                  paled again as quickly, as Allan entered and took the seat before her.
               "Why," he asked, "did you look up just then to discover me? I was lost in
                  admiration of this, the loveliest tableau I ever looked upon. If I had had
                  materials, I would have sketched you and this little cherub. But," he added, "I
                  could not have done justice to her while you were hanging over her."
               "In looking at me," replied Zenaida, "while this image of almost perfect beauty
                  was before you, you displayed a deficiency of taste of which I should never have
                  dreamed of accusing you, had you not betrayed yourself by this rash avowal."
               The sound of their voices, disturbing the before unbroken quiet, awoke Amy.
               "Amy," said Zenaida, stooping to imprint a kiss upon her tempting brow, "you have
                  had a sweet sleep."
               "Did you hold me all the time?" she asked, as she half unclosed her bright eyes
                  and shut them up again. "Why didn't you lay me down on the soft grass? The red
                  rose-leaves would have fallen down and covered me up, and the humming-birds and
                  bees would have sung me to sleep. Oh!" she said, as she sat up, her eyes falling
                  upon Elliott; "Cousin 'Naida, who is that? Did he come while I was asleep?"
               "Yes," replied Allan; "did you not know, pretty one, that I had taken all your
                  strawberries?"
               "No you haven't," said Amy, triumphantly picking up her hat; "for here they all
                  are. Cousin 'Naida, is it right for a big man like that to tell a story?"
               Allan laughed gayly.
               "I am going to give some of my berries to baby," cried Amy, as she darted beneath
                  the arching vines, and across the yard.
               She was gone, and Allan, throwing off the restraint which he had felt in her
                  presence, began,—
               "Zenaida, I have sought you this evening that I may hear my sentence from your
                  lips. I have told you that I love you; but it needed not words to assure you of
                  this, which every action has declared, since I have known you. Will you doom me to
                  roam alone through the desert, which this life will be without you, or will you
                  make each joy more deep, by sharing it with me? I have breathed to you vows which
                  my lips have never spoken to another, and the happiness or misery of my life hang
                  upon your answer."
               She sat still, silent; but her whole frame quivered with a deep emotion, which she
                  vainly endeavored to conceal from the loving eyes of Allan.
               "Zenaida," he cried impetuously, falling upon his knees before her, "you are not
                  indifferent to my love. Were your lips to frame a denial, your paleness, your
                  uncontrollable agitation would contradict your words."
               "Rise, Mr. Elliott," she said, gazing upon him with tearful ful eyes, and sad, said heart; "kneel not to me, a
                  creature like yourself, but reserve that adoration for the Almighty, to whom it is
                  due. I would not wound your heart unnecessarily," she continued, tremulously as he
                  rose silently and took the seat beside her; "God knows I would not. I am not
                  insensible to the rich offering, your noble heart, with all its untold wealth of
                  love, which you have laid before me for my acceptance."
               "You are, you will be mine, then!" said Allan, joyously, raising his bowed head
                  and clasping her hand, which he covered with kisses.
               "No," she replied, the tears running over in her blue eyes. "No. You, Allan, have
                  raised the barrier which divides us, and to me it is insurmountable. You have
                  refused to acknowledge the existence, to swear allegiance to the great and good
                  God, to whom I belong, body, soul, and spirit; my prayers, my tears, my arguments
                  have all been unavailing to soften the obduracy of your heart! I might marry you,
                  fondly hoping that I might eventually convince you of your errors; but I have no
                  right to believe that, as your wife, I could influence you more than I can now.
                  God has issued a mandate which I must obey, even though in the struggle my poor
                  heart should break. It is—'Be ye not unequally yoked together with
                  unbelievers.'"
               "And do you," broke forth Allan, indignantly, "wish me to believe that you, loving
                  me as you confess you do, will sacrifice, for this consideration, the happiness of
                  both our lives—that you, free in all things else, will servilely obey this
                  mandate, the authority of which I consider questionable at best—that you, a woman,
                  the necessity of whose nature it is to love, will count as worthless, as nothing,
                  the treasure of love with which I would endow you? Oh, Zenaida! Zenaida! for sweet
                  mercy's sake, do not thus wantonly blast the happiness of us both!"
               "Allan," she replied, weeping, "reproach me not, and entreat me not so
                  passionately. My own heart, fortified as I thought it to stand this trying ordeal,
                  rebels and pleads for you, for itself; but I must, not listen, for it cannot, must
                  not be as you wish."
               "Then you love me not," said Allan, bitterly; "and your tears, your sighs, are but
                  counterfeit presentments by which you hope to lure me on, and wound me yet more
                  deeply. You, whom I believed to be more pure than the unfallen snow-flake—more
                  true than truth's own self, the embodiment of my ideal of loveliness, I now see in
                  another light; a syren sweetly calling me to destruction—a Scylla, upon whose
                  hidden, treacherous rocks the bark, freighted with all my hopes of happiness, has
                  been wrecked—a false heart, triumphing in the pain it has cruelly inflicted upon
                  another, which reposed unbounded confidence in its truth and worth!"
               "Oh, Allan!" sobbed Zenaida, "that I should have lived to hear these words from
                  your lips, which have always been musical with the soft murmurs of love! But," she
                  said, erecting her slight form, which had bowed like a pensile flower before the
                  storm of grief, "your own heart shall yet justify me—your own soul cease to
                  condemn me for the sentence of separation I pass upon you and myself."
               "Zenaida," replied Allan, in a tone so mournful that it haunted her reproachingly
                  for many days, "you have broken my
                  heart; you have quenched the light of happiness that shone upon my life until it
                  seemed too glorious to be real; and over the sky, bright with the deceptive,
                  mocking radiance of hope, your hand has drawn the black curtain of despair, on
                  which is inscribed the curse, our separation. You will yet repent, when it shall
                  be too late; you will sigh for the love which you now reject, which would have
                  sheltered you from all the ills of life, and made your crown one of thornless
                  roses."
               "Go," she said, faintly; "your words are torture beyond that which I am able to
                  bear. Oh, Allan! Allan! do not hate me; for, as God is my witness, I have but
                  obeyed the dictates of my conscience!"
               She closed her eyes, and a pallor so deadly overspread her face, that Allan
                  thought she was dying; and, in his alarm for her, forgot his own angry grief,
                  reproaching himself for having caused her suffering. But hers was only a momentary
                  faintness, which soon passed; and as he saw the light returning to her eyes, and
                  heard the deep sigh heaved from her sick heart, he took the little pair of
                  scissors which hung suspended from her girdle, and severing one of her waving
                  tresses, hid it in his bosom and disappeared.
               "He is gone!" sobbed poor Zenaida, as she caught the faint echo of his retreating
                  steps; "he is gone forever! No more will his voice of love whisper in my ear, or
                  his beautiful eyes look into the depths and read the secrets of my heart. O God!"
                  she cried, sinking upon the ground, bowing her head upon the bench where they so
                  lately sat together, "O thou most merciful Father! grant me strength to bear with
                  meekness this, the great trial of my life!"
               "Mr. Elliott," called out the sweet voice of Helen, which grated harshly and
                  discordantly upon the wrung and suffering heart of Allan, "will you not stay and
                  take tea with us? Arthur will be delighted to see you."
               "Excuse me, Mrs. Bernard," he replied hastily, averting his face, that she might
                  not see therein the conflict of his soul, "I must return immediately. Good
                  evening."
               "A strange and sudden change has come over him, who an hour ago spoke so blithely,
                  and bounded so gayly down these steps!" said Helen, musingly, as she gazed after
                  him. "What can have caused it? Surely he and Zenaida have had no misunderstanding;
                  and if she loves him not better than life, there is no truth in woman's eyes."
               She walked toward the arbor as she spoke, but Zenaida was not surprised in the
                  depth of her abandonment to grief; for hearing an approaching step, she wiped the
                  tears from her eyes, and though she trembled visibly, was apparently engaged,
                  when, Helen entered, in training the vines over the lattice.
               "Why, sis," exclaimed Helen, "what in the world have you done to Mr. Elliott? He
                  glided by me like a ghost, just now, hardly deigning to respond to my parting
                  salutation."
               "Do you hold me responsible for Mr. Elliott's varying moods?" inquired Zenaida,
                  with a vain effort to appear composed and indifferent.
               "You evade my question," said Helen; "but I will not try to force your
                  confidence."
               She turned away, more than ever at a loss to account for what she had seen—the dejection, the despondent
                  gloom of Elliott, the agitation of her sister.
               "The heart may break, yet brokenly live on," sighed Zenaida, as she sank again
                  upon the bench of the arbor; "and mine, tortured as it is, and as it must be, must
                  hide its anguish from all eyes. This secret, which is Elliott's as well as mine,
                  must remain inviolate."
               Thus she nerved her sick and fainting spirit to meet the kindly glances of
                  affectionate curiosity from Helen, the light jests of the gay-hearted Arthur. She
                  knew not the proud, uncomplaining endurance, the deep resignation and unfaltering
                  courage of her heart; but these hitherto untried resources were developed for her
                  aid in this trying emergency.
               When called to supper, though her head throbbed painfully, keeping time with the
                  rapid pulsations of her heart, she obeyed the summons, paler than usual, but so
                  still that, in a spirit less lofty, more earthly than her own, this absence of all
                  visible emotion might have been mistaken for the calmness of despair. She had
                  heard the "still, small voice" whispering to her heart in its agony, "The trials
                  and sufferings of this life, which are but for a moment, work for us a far more
                  exceeding and eternal weight of glory;" and beneath the influence of this holy
                  voice, her soul grew calm as the waves of Galilee, which, tossing in wildest
                  commotion, had sunk into silence, awed by the words of power—-"Peace, be
                  still!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               "ALL things work together for good to them that love God." This truth was a firm
                  anchor to the soul of Zenaida, which loosed not its hold; but Allan was driven
                  over the wild sea of stormy passions without pilot, chart, or compass, at the
                  mercy of the winds and waves. Poor fellow! No light from the open portals of
                  eternity fell upon the dark clouds which overshadowed him;—Hope wove no bright
                  rainbow above the storm. He had staked his happiness upon one cast of the die, and
                  had lost. For him the future was a dreary waste, from the contemplation of which
                  his soul shrank shudderingly, appalled at the flitting spectres of dead hopes and
                  past happiness which peopled it, and mocked him with their delusions. His former
                  pastimes had lost their charm. He had fondly believed that he had found the
                  philosopher's stone in his love, which had thrown an illusive, golden glory over
                  all things; that he had mingled the elements which combine to form the elixir of
                  life; but when he raised the chalice to quaff its life-giving contents, they had
                  turned to poison on his lips.
               When he essayed to paint, hoping to distract his thoughts, which were maddening in
                  their intensity, the face of Zenaida still rose before him, assuming the aspect of
                  the lovely Medusa, in gazing upon which his life was turned to a monumental stone,
                  entombing a living spirit. If he had recourse to his piano, the music he had
                  formerly loved came not to his memory;
                  but the chords wailed beneath his touch as if the spirit of music were sighing
                  forth the dirge above his own dead heart. Dead! Ah! would that it had been dead,
                  utterly devoid of feeling; but, though mortally wounded, it possessed vitality
                  sufficient to feel continually the keenest pangs of death.
               Many and bitter were the accusations brought against Zenaida, in this angry,
                  suffering heart. He called her false, heartless; but ever as these words rose to
                  his lips, her face, pale as he had last seen it; her eyes, heavy with the weight
                  of unshed tears; her words, "Do not hate me, Allan!" spoken in a low,
                  heart-rending tone, rose before him, witnesses bearing irrefutable testimony to
                  her truth, her depth of feeling. Angrily did he wave away this image, which
                  appealed to his love, conjuring up in its stead the beautiful Gorgon, to whom he
                  had likened her.
               The associations of his home were now unendurable. If he entered the conservatory
                  he could see Zenaida, with the moonlight falling round her, a veil of silvery
                  radiance; could hear her soft, sweet voice, which the echo of the place delighted
                  to repeat ever in his ear; while with each picture that adorned the walls was
                  connected some expression of her admiration, which his memory, faithfully
                  retentive of her every word, had treasured up.
               He resolved to go away; to roam a weary wanderer through the unsympathizing world,
                  as many had done before him, vainly seeking relief in change. He would not go
                  forth in search of beauty, for the Real, ruthless iconoclast, had shivered into a
                  thousand atoms the Ideal which he had enshrined in his heart of hearts; and that,
                  which he had hoped would stand the test of time, the beautiful altar upon which he
                  had sworn to keep the sacred fires forever burning, he saw a hopeless ruin at his
                  feet.
               The burning sun of no equatorial clime could be fiercer than the flame which
                  consumed him; nor did he hope to find one cold enough to chill this fever in his
                  brain. His haggard look, his sad unrest, could not escape his mother's watchful
                  eyes; and when he told her he was going far away, she sacrificed her own feelings
                  for what she deemed his good. No murmur escaped her lips as she thought of the
                  loneliness which would fall upon her when he was gone; when she would pass through
                  the familiar rooms, looking in vain for his loved form, listening in vain for the
                  strains of melody which he was wont to awaken.
               He left that home, than which he had once thought the earth contained no fairer
                  dwelling-place. Absorbed in his own sorrows, he left that mother from whom, he had
                  once sworn, no other love should ever have power to separate him, and, like
                  Orestes, pursued by Furies, wandered o'er the earth.
               The balmy breezes, deep-blue sky, and Elysian beauty of Italy; the vine-clad hills
                  of sunny France; the picturesque Rhine, "like Bacchus, crowned and drunken,
                  reeling to the sea;" the quiet, homelike loveliness of England, now charmed him
                  not. In the landscape his eye saw not the tree around which the vine clung
                  tenderly, like the tendrils of love around the heart; but the one, scathed by the
                  fiery lightning, riven by the dread thunder-bolt, a scarred and blackened monument
                  of avenging wrath, standing out in bold relief against a background of surrounding
                  luxuriance.
               
               In the almost inaccessible fastnesses of the mountains, crags barren and bleak,
                  the supporting pillars of the temple of Desolation, his soul found gloomy
                  companionship. In the tract over which the tornado had swept, with fury relentless
                  as that of Tisiphone, prostrating forests which had withstood the violence of
                  ages, leaving behind ruin and dismay, he saw the similitude of his own life.
               He gazed into the crater of the volcano, with its waves of liquid flame, rolling
                  and seething, boiling and bubbling like the Lake of Avernus, destroying with their
                  deadly heat every green and living thing, and in it he saw typified the internal
                  agitation of his own soul.
               But the strings of the heart, like the chords of some delicately attuned
                  instrument, cannot always endure this unnatural tension. They must either relax or
                  break. The sufferings of the mind were communicated to the sympathizing body, and
                  Allan Elliott—the idolized son, over whom his mother's eye had watched with
                  unwearying devotion—was ill in a foreign land. No hand was there, with the
                  assiduity of love, to bathe his brow, burning with fever; no eye which would fill
                  with tears in sympathy for his suffering; no ear which would listen, with painful
                  interest, to the incoherent ravings of his speech.
               Long was his soul balanced between life and death; long did the dark shadows hang
                  around him, threatening to extinguish the spark upon the altar of his life, which
                  burned flickeringly and low. Kindness he experienced from strangers, who were
                  touched with pity to see one so young, so beautiful in the glory of his early
                  manhood, hovering so near the entrance to the Dark Valley. His gold procured him
                  attention, but not such as his mother would have given, or that gentle being whose
                  name was oftenest on his lips, whose shadowy presence never left him.
               At length the fever subsided, the crisis was past, and the physician decided that
                  he would recover.
               In the long, weary hours of convalescence, gentle, kindly thoughts of home came,
                  bright-winged angel ministrants, to soothe his tired spirit, and, like a weary
                  child, he was lulled to repose by the lullabies of love which they whispered to
                  his heart. He hailed the sun with joy, for in his course he had smiled upon his
                  home; had kissed the tear-drops from his mother's cheek; had glanced brightly upon
                  the golden-gleaming head of the one beloved; and the west wind, as it came softly
                  in at his window, breathing messages of love from the far-off home, was also
                  gladly welcomed.
               Every memento which he possessed became now more precious in his eyes than the
                  diamonds of Golconda, the pearls of Ceylon. The lock of hair, which he had stolen
                  in that last interview, was now, as it lay protectingly against his heart, the
                  shield which had turned the death-dart. Among these tokens of love was a beautiful
                  little Bible, the gift of Zenaida, in which she had written, "Read, obey, and
                  live." He had preserved it because it was her gift; and even in the wildest
                  paroxysms of despair he could not prevail upon himself to cast it away.
               Now, when his heart was softened in the fires of illness, most bitterly did he
                  reproach himself for his unkind thoughts of her; and one day, impelled by an
                  irresistible longing, he opened this sacred volume which she had given him,
                  accompanied by many prayers. The words, which had before fallen powerless, or glanced off like arrows from
                  an impenetrable coat of mail, now pierced his heart—divested its buckler of
                  unbelief. The sweet truths and promises fell with grateful, refreshing power and
                  musical softness upon his heart, like the shower upon the parched earth; and
                  bright flowers of hope and love sprang into life, making glad the garden of his
                  soul.
               He read, not critically, not skeptically, not as one poet reads the glowing verse
                  of another, as he had before done; but the words were addressed to him; for him
                  the bright angels ascended to heaven, bearing his prayers, and again descended,
                  bringing glad tidings from on high. He followed the footsteps of the Christ in His
                  earthly pilgrimage; he sat with Mary at His feet, and hung upon His words as upon
                  a sentence of life or death; the stood by the Mother at the cross, and kneeled,
                  weeping at the empty sepulchre; he was with the disciples on the Mount, and with
                  them watched His form ascending, until it was lost from sight in the rosy clouds
                  and blue ether of the heaven.
               Not in one day was this change wrought. The pleading tones of Zenaida's voice
                  sounded in his ear as he read; her exalted example of self-sacrifice, by which he
                  now saw that she had reduced her religious theories to practice, and given
                  indisputable evidence of her entire submission to the Divine will, was presented
                  before him in the clear light of truth; and he, at last, acknowledged that she had
                  acted nobly, and was worthy of a martyr's crown.
               As his prejudices were gradually removed before this new light, like the wintry
                  snow which disappears before the beams of the warm sun of spring, God, the being
                  whose very existence he had impiously denied, was revealed to him in the awful
                  majesty of His power, the omnipotence of His will; and fear took possession of his
                  soul. His justice demanded the punishment of the transgressor; and he considered
                  not, in his terror, the atoning sacrifice of mercy. In this emergency he clung to
                  his Bible, as the drowning mariner to the floating spar which keeps off imminent
                  death—and finally the storm subsided; the billows ceased to roll; the black clouds
                  parted, and upon his soul shone the effulgent glory of the Sun of Love, the mildly
                  beaming lustre of the Star of Bethlehem. Dear to his heart did that Saviour
                  become, who for him had agonized in the Garden of Gethsemane, had borne his sins
                  upon the fatal tree. His soul, like the weary dove, had now found its refuge, and
                  folded its wings in peace; the polluted waters of sin gliding off and leaving no
                  stain, as the turbid drops from the snowy-plumed messenger of Noah.
               With these new hopes, thoughts, and feelings, came the yearning for his native
                  land; the desire to look again upon her, whose desecrated image was once more
                  raised to its former pedestal in his heart. No longer would he lead the life of
                  his former inglorious ease; for his talent must not be returned without interest
                  to the Giver. The humblest man who was useful, who employed his gifts for the
                  exaltation of humanity, the benefit of his fellow-men, was now, in his estimation,
                  worthy of higher honor than he, who, endowed with genius, wealth, and blessings
                  innumerable, shut himself up in his Castle of Indolence; the world being neither
                  wiser nor better that he had lived in it.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               BUT to return to the land to which the eyes of Allan are directed with wistful,
                  longing gaze.
               Slowly for Zenaida flew the leaden-winged hours, after that evening upon which she
                  had last seen Allan. She spoke not of her sorrow; but, the watchful eye of Helen
                  saw the rose-tint fade from her cheek, the love-light from her eye, the elasticity
                  from her step; and as Allan came no more, her suspicions became certainties that
                  some unfortunate word, some act of the one, misinterpreted by the other, had
                  separated two loving hearts which ought to have been one.
               She sat one evening, on the door-steps holding a book in her hand that she might
                  screen herself from the scrutinizing glance of Arthur, which was now and then cast
                  upon her; but her heart was not with her, and her eyes were fixed upon the road by
                  which Allan had been wont to come. As they found not what they sought, her head
                  drooped low until it sunk upon her hand, and the unbidden tears swam in her
                  eyes.
               Arthur deliberately seated himself on the next lower step, and, looking up,
                  exclaimed,—
               "What, sis! tears in the bright eyes? What is the hidden spring from whence they
                  flow? You are the most contradictory creature in the world! your words and actions
                  are at daggers' points. When Elliott asked you if you love him, your lips answered
                  no, while every look, every action bore witness that you did. I think it was
                  positively shameful for you to treat a fine fellow like Allan so cruelly. Not
                  every girl would have thrown carelessly aside a heart like his—or a fortune
                  either. Why, sis!" he continued, "he would have crowned your brow with diamonds,
                  or wreathed your sunny locks with pearls; he would have installed you queen over
                  his realms of untold thought, as well as his 'Fairy Bower,' where Titania's self
                  might love to reign. He would have made you his Muse, and your name might have
                  been handed down to remote ages, graven on the world's heart in letters of living
                  light, like Tasso's Leonora, Dante's Beatrice, or the Laura of Petrarch. What were
                  you thinking of when you refused a fate so enviable?"
               Zenaida made no reply; but rising hastily, entered the house, that he might not
                  witness the torture his words inflicted.
               "The high-tragedy airs of these young folks," mused Arthur, "are entirely above
                  the limited range of my comprehension. It pleases mademoiselle, my little sister,
                  to envelope the courtship of Elliott in a mystery as profound as that which
                  involved the Eleusinia of the Ancients. Helen," he said, appealing to his wife,
                  "do you know why Zenaida rejected Elliott? I am perfectly convinced that she has
                  done so; and I can neither account for it myself, nor get a satisfactory
                  explanation from her."
               "No," replied Helen, sadly. "I do not know; I wish I did; for if there is any
                  misunderstanding between them, it might be removed by the friendly mediation of
                  one of us. I have not urged Zenaida to make me her confidante, as she seems disinclined to do so of her own will. Do
                  not tease her again, my dear Arthur; for though she makes an effort to appear
                  cheerful, she is very, very sad. Sometimes, when I go into her room suddenly, I
                  find her with her sewing lying idly in her lap, her eyes fixed as if some
                  spirit-form were before her, or with that absorbed, introverted look they used to
                  wear when she was a child; but when she sees me, she will resume her employment
                  with a smile cold as the moonlight upon snow, or will converse in a tone the
                  cheerfulness of which is too evidently assumed."
               
               A few days after this, Zenaida announced her intention of returning immediately to
                  Willowbrook; and vain were all the arguments with which Helen and Arthur sought to
                  oppose her determination.
               "I have been here too long already," she said; "the voice of duty calls upon me to
                  return again to the old home of my childhood. I have neglected black mammy and
                  Uncle Harry too long, and my conscience reproaches me."
               "And is the voice of duty ever to drown the voice of love in your heart?" asked
                  Helen. "You can be more happy here with us. Why should you go away? Has not even
                  the infant beauty of Harry power to chain you to this place? I had hoped that we
                  could find some power potent enough to detain you with us; but, alas I it is not
                  so."
               "Harry is very dear to me," she replied; "and I have been most happy while with
                  you."
               "Make my adieux to all my kind friends," she said, at parting. "You, my sister and
                  brother, have been most kind to me, and God and your own consciences will reward
                  you. I shall never forget the many pleasant days I have spent at Hawthornden."
               As she said this, she cast a last look upon the hawthorn-trees, the rose-arbor,
                  and many other places that were associated with Allan.
               "This will not be your last visit?" said Helen, inquiringly; vainly striving to
                  smile through her tears.
               "I hope not," replied Zenaida. "I shall not be able to live long without Harry—he
                  is so bright, so beautiful, so good."
               
               She was gone; and ere long the old familiar scenes around Willowbrook greeted her
                  once more. The Cottage, in all the glory of its summer beauty, smiled a joyous
                  welcome; and when she entered the gate, mammy, aroused by the bark of glad
                  recognition from Beppo, came forth to see who the intruder might be.
               Zenaida, feeling herself clasped in her kindly arms, was grateful for even the
                  love of this faithful heart, which threw a ray of light upon her life, and strewed
                  the homely flowers of humble affection along her pathway.
               The good old black woman gazed with delight upon this child, "her darling, who had
                  once more come back to her black mammy."
               "But bless you, honey!" she cried, looking closely in her face; "you is bin sick
                  along o' that ole town, an' them upstart city folks. What they bin doin' to you,
                  chile?"
               "I have not been sick, dear mammy," she replied; "and I have enjoyed my visit very
                  much; but I am so glad to get back here again, to see your dear old face beaming
                     with pleasure, your eyes swimming in
                  tears of joy, and know that it is all for me."
               "Bless God, chile!" said mammy, "ef I aint glad to see you, I should like to know
                  who I would be glad to see on the top of this yarth?"
               "Well, mammy," said Zenaida, "when I have rested awhile, you must come in, and I
                  will tell you about our Helen and the baby, the prettiest baby that ever was
                  seen."
               "Bless God!" again said mammy, fervently; "but I would like to see him; but come,
                  honey, and see how nice I is bin keepin' house since you bin gone. Everything is
                  clean as a new pin; an' ole Harry, he's done kep' down all the weeds in the
                  garden, and thar you will find all the flowers jist like you had 'em when you was
                  here."
               Zenaida thanked her for taking so much trouble to please her; and praised
                  everything, much to the gratification of mammy.
               "Tell Uncle Harry and Milton to bring in my trunks, if you please, mammy," she
                  said, "and I will see if I cannot find something pretty in them for you all."
               Mammy's old eyes danced with delight, as visions of bright-colored gowns and gay
                  turbans rose before her, and she hastened to execute this commission.
               "Here, ole man!" she exclaimed, as she made an abrupt entry into the kitchen,
                  giving Harry a rousing shake, which effectually dispelled the dreams of his
                  afternoon nap; "Miss 'Naida's come, and she say you an' Milton must fetch her
                  trunks in."
               Harry rose slowly from his seat, and, elevating his bent form, crossing his hands
                  upon his breast, and swinging himself self back and forth, pendulum-fashion,
                  uttered, in a deep sepulchral voice,—
               "The Lord ha' mercy! Miss 'Naida come! Bless the Lord!"
               "Now, ole man," said mammy, energetically, "don't stan' there a swingin' yerself
                  all day, but come along."
               Uncle Harry submissively followed his better-half, and soon placed the trunks
                  before Zenaida.
               "Why, Uncle Harry," she said, extending her hand, "how do you do?"
               "Sort o' poorly, bless God, mistis!" responded the old man, meekly, as he
                  retreated several steps, and swung himself against the wall; "but I'll feel better
                  now, mistis, since I'se lived to see you come home. I'se lived wid de Morrises all
                  my life, an' when they was all gone, I didn't know what was gwine to 'come of ole
                  Harry."
               He swung himself again as he said this, and again mammy reprimanded him.
               "Ole man," she said, "can't you stan' still?"
               "Don't scold him," said Zenaida. "Uncle Harry," she continued, "what kind of a
                  present would you rather have?"
               "Bless God, mistis!" replied Harry; "I'd rather have a long knife, motter o'
                  fact!"
               "Ole man," again interrupted mammy, "ef I was in your place, I wouldn't say
                  'motter o' fact' no more. Don't you see Miss 'Naida's larfin at you now?"
               "No, I am not, Uncle Harry," said Zenaida; "and here is what you wished for, a
                  long knife, and many other things besides."
               
               The old man bent reverently to receive them, and then walked forth, muttering as
                  he went, "Bless God! She's a good child; a real Morris, motter o' fact!" much to
                  the indignation of mammy, who followed him.
               
               Zenaida, having dismissed her tried and faithful servitors, hastened along the
                  path which led to her father's grave—a path her feet had kept smooth while she was
                  at home, and from which, during her absence, mammy had cut every weed, with the
                  zeal of a religious devotee. The flowers blooming upon this consecrated spot
                  needed the gentle hand of Zenaida to train them, but still showed that they had
                  not been neglected; and, in the fullness of her grateful heart, Zenaida called
                  down blessings upon the heads of her devoted servants.
               "In this quiet nook," thought she, "the remaining years of my life will be passed;
                  a lot different indeed from the one which, a few short days ago, was offered for
                  my acceptance. How striking and painful the contrast between the life of the loved
                  and loving wife of Allan Elliott, which would have been full of happiness, and the
                  monotonous existence of the old maid of Willowbrook, into which I will soon
                  subside! But I must not indulge in vain repinings. I can still be useful; and
                  here, on this altar, this holy shrine, my own dear father's grave, will I offer up
                  prayers for him for whom I would willingly die, that he might be saved. I have
                  faith in the goodness of his heart, and I will hope that he may yet be all that
                  even my heart could wish. I have seen him turn aside his foot that he might not
                  crush the worm which crawled beneath him; and one thus gentle cannot trample
                  ruthlessly upon his own immortal soul. We may never be united; may never meet
                  again in this world; but I would willingly forego this transient pleasure, great
                  though it be, could I but hope to see him, in the great day of eternity, upon the
                  right hand of God, his brow bound with the wreath of the victor, who has triumphed
                  over the leagued enemies of his soul, and his loved voice, tuned to the praise of
                  God and the Lamb, mingling with the anthems of the redeemed."
               
               Many sad, waking, thoughts were hers; many tearful dreams; but she strove to
                  forget them, to interest herself in the employments which had formerly given her
                  delight. She visited her old haunts by wood and stream; she stood upon the hill to
                  watch the rising of the sun, the gradual dispersion of the mists which shrouded
                  the valleys, or at evening caught his parting beams; she gathered her little
                  pupils once more around her, and warmed her chilled heart in the fires of their
                  loving eyes. Her name was coupled with blessings by many, who had been soothed in
                  suffering by her gentle ministrations and ever-ready sympathy.
               Active as she was in the discharge of the humble duties of a lowly station, in the
                  offices of charity, often would the thought of what might have been, sink her
                  heart despondingly but not long did she suffer these thoughts to hold the
                  ascendancy; and those who saw her cheerful amid her little band, dispensing the
                  rich stores of knowledge with liberal hand, sweet smile, and winning words, or
                  seated in her accustomed place in the quiet church, her pure face irradiated with
                  the holy inner-light,—a bright reflection from the light on high,—dreamed not of the contest which had
                  been decided, of the victory which that uncomplaining heart had won over itself.
                  Thus the "rainbow-winged steeds," which bear the cars of the bright or sad-eyed
                  hours, which pause not in their rapid course for human joy or woe, passed on. She
                  heard that Allan had left his home to roam a heart-weary wanderer in foreign
                  climes, and sorely did she grieve for the sufferings his proud, untutored heart
                  endured.
               When the winds howled fearfully around her sheltered cot, her prayers ascended for
                  the preservation of him, who might then be exposed to the perils of the
                  treacherous deep; but no tidings reached her after he was gone; no murmured voice
                  of the far-off sea came to assure her of his safety; and, even while she prayed,
                  she knew not but that his bright head was pillowed upon the sands of the
                  fathomless deep, his ear deaf to the sound of its eternal roar, his eyes
                  insensible to the beauties of the coral temples, with their lamps of pearl. Yet
                  her faith failed not.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               ZENAIDA was sitting in the portico one evening, when she saw the "ole man," Uncle
                  Harry, come through the gate and walk leisurely up to her.
               "Mistis," he said, taking off his hat, which he deposited carefully on the step,
                  then crossing his hands upon his breast, and bowing profoundly, "I'se got some
                  letters fur you from the post-office, bless the Lord!"
               "Oh, thank you, Uncle Harry!" she cried, eagerly. "Where are they?"
               "I'se got 'em in my coat-pockit, mistis," responded Harry. "I was 'fraid I'd lose
                  'em, an' so I pinned 'em in," he said, apologetically, as he nervously worked to
                  pull the pins out, sorely trying the patience of Zenaida. "Here they is, motter o'
                  fact!" he said, triumphantly, as he placed them in her hand.
               "I am much obliged to you, Uncle Harry. It was very kind in you to think of
                  calling for my letters without being told."
               "Bless the Lord, mistis!" exclaimed Uncle Harry, fervently, swinging himself after
                  his usual fashion; "I'd be a brute beast, ef I wasn't willin' to do anythink I
                  could for you,—a real Morris, motter o' fact!" With which emphatic declaration, he
                  walked away, muttering as he went,—"Yes, bless the Lord! my young mistis is the
                  sweetest, prettiest-spoken thing I ever seed, motter o' fact! Its 'Uncle Harry,
                  please do this,' an' 'thank'ee, Uncle Harry;' fur, bless God, she thinks black
                  folks has souls an' feelins, as well as white ones! Jist like the Morrises; an' I
                  would be willin' to lay down this blessid minit an' have my head chopped clean off
                  with a meat-ax, if it would please her, motter o' fact! Bless the Lord!" he
                  concluded, with a deep groan and a long-drawn sigh.
               
               Zenaida, unconscious of Uncle Harry's complimentary soliloquy, was soon deeply
                  absorbed in the letters. They were from Helen, Arthur, and kind Mrs. Bankhead; but
                  a paper, which she had at first overlooked, bore a postmark mark with which she was not familiar. She opened
                  it, and a marked paragraph arrested her attention. It was a eulogy upon a speech
                  which had been delivered by an adopted citizen of the place, the talented Francis
                  Churchill.
               "His reputation is established," thus it ran, "as one of the most profound legal
                  scholars,—one of the most brilliant, and incontrovertibly argumentative orators of
                  the bar. He adorns the driest and dullest of themes with the most glowing imagery,
                  the most brilliant flowers of rhetoric, the most graceful and irresistibly
                  touching pathos,—with gems from the mines of ancient and modern lore. This young
                  man, gifted with these abilities, may confidently aspire to the highest position
                  to which he can possibly be elevated by his appreciative fellow-citizens. In our
                  political firmament he will shine, not with the fiery, ephemeral light of the
                  comet, but with the steady, radiance of a star of the first magnitude."
               This beginning of the verification of her prophecies, filled Zenaida with delight.
                  "The star of Churchill's destiny is in the ascendant," she said. "Who can tell how
                  high it will rise, ere it reaches its culminating point? His motto is 'Excelsior,'
                  and no height will be inaccessible to his soaring ambition. This laudation is the
                  first faint note from the trump of Fame,—the prelude to a blast that shall echo
                  his name through many lands."
               
               At intervals she received these papers, each succeeding one striking a higher note
                  in the diapason of praise.
               Frank had located in one of those cities of the West, the growth of which is
                  almost fabulous; where palaces spring up as if their owners were possessed of the
                  magic lamp of Aladdin, and could command the services of genii; where the
                  undulating sea of prairie grass and flowers is remorselessly arched with bridges
                  of brick, which bide forever its glowing, emerald depths; where the sacred
                  solitudes of Nature, which had before echoed the sweet notes of wild birds, or the
                  occasional sound of the ax of some ruthless Vandal, who, without compunction,
                  felled those lofty-headed forest-kings which had reigned supreme until his advent,
                  are now disturbed by the shrill, discordant scream of the steam-whistle.
               Here he found a field for his labors, and was soon recognized as a leader, a
                  master-spirit, upon whose lips most eloquent the people hung entranced; whose word
                  was soon indisputable authority; at whom wise men of business pointed their finger
                  as he passed, saying confidently,—"A rising man; one with whom it will be well to
                  be on good terms."
               Each effort that he made, each success that crowned that effort, but incited him
                  to still greater exertion.
               "Zenaida," was the thought of his heart, "has laid the foundation-stone of my fame
                  and prosperity, and upon it will I, Deo volente,
                  build a superstructure, in viewing which, its proportions may dazzle even her
                  eyes, which, like the soaring eagle's, can gaze upon the most splendid and lofty
                  objects. And, when I have accomplished my work, when I have achieved my fame, I
                  will lay my honors at her feet, and offer them humbly to her acceptance."
               Thus he walked beneath the bow of Hope, which spanned his life with its radiant
                  hues; his eyes ever intent upon the
                  dream-castle which his imagination had reared in the future, decking it gorgeously
                  with brilliant light and illusive splendors; ignorant, fond dreamer, that the
                  heart of his bright guardian-angel had been offered up upon a shrine perhaps less
                  lofty than his own. Dream on while thou mayest, ere these hues of glory fade from
                  thy sky, leaving it dull and drear, with no gleam of light to relieve its dark,
                  leaden sombreness! Thy bark now glides peacefully in a tranquil, current, in the
                  clear, mirror-like surface of which are reflected the blushing roses of love which
                  fringe its banks,—the clear, deep-blue of heaven,—the holy, constant stars; soft
                  airs from Elysian fields fan thy brow, lulling thy heart to reveries of bliss; but
                  soon a change will come, and the winds will rave madly round; the boiling waves
                  threaten to engulf thee. Above thee, in the high temple of Fame, thine eyes see
                  not the form of that abstract, inanimate divinity; but Zenaida Morris stands
                  there, beckoning thee onward and upward with her fair hand, encouraging with
                  smiling lips and love-lit eyes. Will thy exalted position be truly valued, when,
                  arrived at the summit, thou dost find the living, loving heart no longer there;
                  when thou dost realize, that in grasping at a substance, thou hast clasped a
                  shadow? God help thee then, stricken heart!
               Woman, when her heart is wounded, flies at once to the good Physician; but man,
                  proud, haughty being that he is, denies that he is wounded, even while the barbed
                  arrow is sticking in his side. He permits not the gentle balm to be poured with
                  healing efficacy, preferring the pain of a lacerated and bleeding heart to the
                  acknowledgment of the truth, that he is not invulnerable, and has been
                  overcome.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               THE intercourse between Helen and Arthur's family, since their reconciliation, had
                  been pleasant, and Helen was now valued according to her worth.
               She was sitting in her pleasant parlor one evening, thinking over the past,—her
                  own happiness, her husband's unfailing love,—contrasting her lot with the
                  loneliness of her sweet, young sister; and, while she thought, her heart was
                  filled with overflowing emotion, and a tear fell upon the face of little Harry,
                  whose arms were clasped around her neck. As he looked up, with wonder in his
                  bright, laughing eyes, she kissed it off, murmuring, in a broken voice,—"What have
                  I done, that God should be thus good to me, unworthy as I am of so many
                  blessings?"
               "Why, Helen!" cried the gay voice of Arthur, "I have stolen a march upon you, and
                  I do not feel as if I were at home unless you meet me at the door. What is the
                  matter?" he continued, raising her head, and detecting the tears which were
                  swimming in her eyes. "Why, Helen! from what quarter blew this passing cloud, the
                  drops from which are yet trembling on your drooping lashes?"
               "It matters not," replied Helen, "as my tears are more of joy than sorrow."
               "I am glad to hear that," said Arthur, as he stooped to raise Harry, imprinting a
                  kiss upon her brow.
               
               "There is something for you, wife!" he exclaimed, as he tossed a letter into her
                  outstretched hand.
               "A letter from Zenaida?" she asked.
               "No, said Arthur; "look at it."
               The envelope contained the cards of Miss Bernard and Col. Philip Ashley, with the
                  compliments of Mr. and Mrs. Bernard for Thursday evening.
               "Who is Col. Ashley, your brother that is to be?" queried Helen. "He is not a
                  resident of our city."
               "No, he is from Carolina," replied Arthur, "and is almost an entire stranger to
                  me. Florida thought that I had chosen a partner to please myself, without
                  consulting her and I received no intimation of her regard for this gentleman,
                  until I was notified of her approaching marriage. My judgment of him would be
                  favorable, were I influenced by his appearance; for he is most gallant in his
                  bearing, distingué in his manner. Then, too, he
                  is a son of the chivalrous South—one who would lead a forlorn hope; who would walk
                  to the cannon's mouth with unbleached cheek and unfailing eye; who would, for
                  liberty's sake, offer up his life with the devotion of a Hampden or a
                  Kosciusko."
               "Florida will leave our city, when she marries, then?" said Helen.
               "Yes," replied Arthur; "a woman who marries a soldier has no abiding habitation,
                  but must vow, as Ruth to Naomi. 'Where thou goest, I will go.'"
               
               It is the evening of the bridal, and the large mansion of Mr. Bernard is brilliant
                  with light, and its halls resound with festive music. The arts of the most
                  skillful modistes had been called into
                  requisition for this occasion, and no expense was spared, by fair ladies, to
                  render themselves yet more dazzlingly beautiful; each one striving to excel her
                  neighbor in the costliness of her attire, and the rich profusion of jewels,
                  forgetful of the assertion of the poet, that "Beauty needs not the foreign aid of
                  adornment," or remembering it only to say, with curling lips, that "The poet was
                  mistaken."
               Amid the brilliant throng the fair bride stood, the cynosure of all eyes. She was
                  attired with faultless taste, with elegant simplicity, such as ever characterized
                  her adornment, and leaned proudly upon the arm of Ashley, as if glorying in
                  acknowledging before the world her dependence upon him, her woman's faith in his
                  nobleness and truth.
               "Paul," said the familiar voice of Bruce Wilson, "why do we linger in the drear
                  confines of bachelordom, while other men secure companions through life such as
                  that queenly beauty, than whom Semiramis, Zenobia, or Marie Antoinette could not
                  have been more stately?"
               "Look around upon this waving sea of jewels and plumes," replied Paul, "and see if
                  the prospect is not enough to terrify a man unless he were the owner of the purse
                  of Fortunatus or had a fairy godmother! I could never endure the inanities of a
                  silly woman, the bluestockingism of a learned one, the extravagant follies of a
                  fashionable, or the pietism and asceticism of a devotee, ergo—"
               "I will never be called upon to sing your epithalamium," said Bruce. "The torch of
                  Hymen will never flame for you!"
               "A delightful prospect, in good sooth!" replied Paul; "and for this vaticination I thank thee, most
                  agreeable of oracles!"
               "Oh, most cynical of bachelors!" said Bruce. "I verily believe that some of these
                  fair divinities have rejected your offerings, and for you it is most unfortunate;
                  for if the propensity for railing 'grows with your growth,' or rather with your
                  years, I shall expect, ere long, to hear that you have built a tub, 'à la
                  Diogenes,' seated in which you may, at leisure, abuse 'all the world and the rest
                  of mankind!'"
               "As I am at present without any aim in existence," said Paul, "you had better
                  equip me with a lamp, and start me out in search of an honest man, or a woman that
                  is not mercenary; objects which, when found, would create in me astonishment and
                  excitement intense as that which would have possessed your favorite Diogenes, had
                     his search been successful. It is my opinion that I should be
                  heartily weary ere I could assume the 'Eureka' expression of countenance which is
                  in vogue among feminine limners of heroes at present."
               "Mon cher, replied Bruce, "you bring a wrongful
                  accusation against me, when you call Diogenes my favorite philosopher. I am a true
                  disciple of Democritus, and think it better to laugh than to cry, even when some
                  more fortunate swain steals and appropriates the heart of my ladye-love."
               "By-the-by!" said Paul, "what has become of Miss Morris? Was she spirited away by
                  some magician? Elliott did not secure the prize before he left; of course, because
                  he did not think it worth the trouble; for no arguments would be potent enough to
                  convince me that she could be so foolish as to reject the proffer of his hand and
                  fortune."
               "For awhile," sighed Bruce, "she shone upon me 'with all the lambent purity of
                  planetary light;' but my star beams no longer visible above the line of my
                  horizon, and the only way in which I can contemplate its lustre is through the
                  telescope of faith."
               "A most unsatisfactory medium," said Paul. "Where is she?"
               "She returned from whence she came," replied Bruce, "and is now 'wasting her
                  sweetness upon the desert air' of a country neighborhood, while my heart is
                  desolate as the dwelling of Morna."
               "Poor fellow!" said Paul; "I pity you!"
               "You need not," replied Bruce; "for I think 
                     
                        ''Twere a shame, when flowers around us rise,
                        To make light, of the rest of the rose is not there;
                        And the world is so full of resplendent eyes,
                        'Twere a pity to limit one's love to a pair.'
                     
                   And so I, 
                     
                        'When far from the lips that I love,
                        Have but to market love to the lips that are near.'"
                     
                  
               
               "Oh, most incorrigible disciple of Tom Moore!" ejaculated Paul; "like a bee or a
                  butterfly you sip the honey of smiles and sweet words from the nectareous lips of
                  these flowers that adorn the parterres of life, until I wonder that you sicken not
                  with the sweets upon which you feed."
               "I get a quantum sufficiency of vinegar for my salad of life from you," replied
                  Bruce. "I wish I had some moral alkali, of which I might administer you a dose,
                  that would mitigate the biting acidity of your composition. The apple-tree tree of life bears some fine fruit; but
                  you are of the genus crab-apple, and are fit only to be shaken from the
                  boughs."
               "What would you have me do, Bruce?" inquired Paul, smiling. "Join the dance of
                  fools in this great farcical drama of life?"
               "All are not fools who dance and make merry," replied Bruce; "but I would rather
                  be gay with those whom you, in your superior wisdom, denominate fools, than drink
                  the wine of life mingled with the gall of your satirical bitterness. I agree with
                  Horace, seize the pleasures of the passing day: 'Quid sit
                     futurum eras, fuge quærere.' But I am weary of this moralizing, of
                  standing, Lara-like, looking on at the flying feet of the dancers, and, unlike
                  him, I am not too lofty to stoop to join in the gay pastime. Come, Paul, for once
                  in your life follow my good example, and select a partner from these scores of
                  pretty faces."
               "Excuse me," said Paul, "I like eating better than dancing, and a glass of the
                  senior Bernard's champagne is more alluring than the smiles of Venus and the
                  Graces."
               
               "Here, Bruce," called out Arthur, as he left Paul and was crossing the room in
                  search of a partner, "what is the reason that you are wandering about here, like
                  an unlaid ghost; you, the most gallant, ladies' man in the city? I am afraid you
                  are retrograding."
               "Oh!" replied Bruce, "I am just now going up and down like the 'roaring lion,
                  seeking whom I may devour;' or, like a bird of prey, am hovering over this fair
                  assembly, uncertain whom I shall bear off for my partner in the next sett."
               "Yonder is Miss Athanasia Morrisson," said Arthur; "I am sure 'she is all your
                  fancy painted her.'"
               "She is," replied Bruce, emphatically, "and a little more, too. She is as unwieldy
                  as a hippopotamus. I would as soon undertake to bear the burden of Atlas, as to
                  sustain the ponderous immensity of Miss Athanasia in a waltz or schottische, and
                  she could never be 'persuaded by the wealth of Attalus' to dance a simple dance.
                  But," he continued, "I verily believe I will take her to supper, just for the
                  pleasure of seeing her devour lobster-salad, oysters, and confections, ad libitum; though to wait upon her will be as onerous
                  a task as Major Pendennis imposed upon himself when he undertook to feed the
                  Begum, Lady Clavering."
               "Bruce," said Arthur, laughing, "you ought to be gibbeted for talking thus
                  disrespectfully about one of the belles!"
               "The half is not told," replied Bruce; "I'll bet you a horse she can drink more
                  champagne than I can, and I speak from experimental experience, (as the old
                  preacher said,) when I declare that I am no despicable hand at the business."
               "For shame, Bruce, thus to slander a fair lady!" said Arthur.
               "She is fair 'over ze left,'" replied Bruce; "fair as Candace, Queen of Ethiop, or
                  Cleopatra of Egypt, or Pocahontas, Princess of the wild-wood; but this assertion
                  which I have made is no slander. It is a truth which, if 'crushed to earth, will
                  rise again,' elastic as an India-rubber ball!"
               "Then truth is stranger than fiction!" responded Arthur.
               
               "That," said, Bruce, "is an aphorism, of the verity, of which every one must be
                  convinced, as it has been most industriously promulgated in all ages; but it is
                  constantly repeated, as if it were a recent discovery, to be ranked with plows
                  that work without hands or horses, or the steam machine into which a man put a
                  live calf on one side, and from which he drew a pair of boots on the other!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               "HAVE you heard the news?" said Paul, as he met Bruce on the street.
               "No," he replied; "I have not been circulating very extensively this morning, and
                  have heard nothing. Anything remarkable?"
               "Only the blowing out of the brains of that good-for-nothing gambler, Ridgely,"
                  replied Paul, with a curl of the lip.
               "Ah!" said Bruce. "When and how did that occur?"
               "The man that committed the act, instead of being prosecuted, ought to be honored
                  with a vote of thanks from the citizens generally, for ridding the place of a
                  nuisance," continued Paul. "It is the old story over again. A young man, whom
                  Ridgely had cheated at cards, inflamed with wine and the desire for vengeance,
                  threatened his life. Ridgely very coolly pocketed his winnings, and laughed,
                  scornfully, when warned by some gentleman present to beware of his adversary. His
                  conduct, and the remark which the young man overheard, that 'he was not afraid of
                  that fool,' exasperated him so that he drew a pistol, and, before aug of the
                  by-standers could interfere, presented it at Ridgely, and fired."
               "Was be killed instantly?" inquired Bruce.
               "The ball was aimed at his heart," replied Paul; "but Ridgely dodged, and it
                  entered his head, shattering the skull and perforating the brain. He was dead
                  before the intelligence could reach his wife, and the first intimation she had of
                  the affair was when his body was carried home."
               "She was at Bernard's last night," said Bruce, "and bore herself as regally as
                  ever, little dreaming of the calamity about to befall her, the disgrace about to
                  be entailed upon the name she bears."
               "No doubt," replied Paul, "she looks upon this as a merciful dispensation, and is
                  delighted to get rid of him, even at the expense of this shock to her feelings.
                  She must feel it, for, however selfish and callous-hearted she may be, she is
                  still human, and must have some lingering spark of sensibility."
               "I suppose," said Bruce, "she will retire to the country until her wounded spirit
                  is healed."
               "Rather," replied Paul, "until the affair has ceased to be the common talk of the
                  town. She will then rise, like the phœnix, from the ashes of this humiliation, to
                  shine again in society; for her vanity is as insatiable as the grave, and she
                  cannot long endure the solitariness of a country life. As far as her name is
                  concerned, she will release herself from the odium attached to it, by changing it
                  as soon as she can find a 'Barkis' who is willing to bestow his own upon her. She will be at the springs next summer;
                  in Washington next winter, fishing for some minnow of a Congressman, by most
                  people dignified with the title of whale."
               "Paul, Paul!" replied Bruce, "you have no faith in the better nature of humanity.
                  I hope you do not judge others by your own heart!"
               
               When Annie looked upon the cold, inanimate form of Ridgely, from which the spirit
                  had been dislodged by the bloody hand of the murderer, the pride of her nature was
                  for a time forgotten, and the old love, which she had felt, which had been so
                  lightly valued, returned again, overwhelming her heart with a flood of tenderness
                  and deep compassion. She thought of him then, not as he had manifested himself
                  since their marriage, as the unloving husband, the cold, the cruel; she thought
                  not how her love had been scorned, until, to all observers, she repaid him with
                  scorn more bitter than his own, while her heart secretly bled from the wounds he
                  had so wantonly inflicted; but she thought of the time when his whispered
                  flatteries had fallen sweet as honey-dew upon her heart; when he had bowed in
                  homage (how could she know it was feigned?) before her, a gay, imperious beauty;
                  when, before the altar, in the sight of Heaven, he had vowed to protect and
                  cherish her, and she (fond fool that she was!) had relied upon his truth with
                  confidence not to be shaken, save by himself.
               While these old memories swept over her, she was softened, and her eyes were
                  blinded by fast-falling tears; but, ere long, the counter-current set in, and the
                  tears flowed no longer from her eyes. She thought now of her wrongs, of her
                  sufferings, which she had not merited at his hand; of the indignities which had
                  been heaped upon her by him; of the indifference she had been compelled to assume
                  to hide her anguish from the rude gaze of the vulgar,—the mantle of snow with
                  which she concealed the raging volcano within; and then she looked again upon the
                  dead, and her heart whispered that she was avenged. She was freed now from chains
                  which had galled, was released from the bondage which was growing every day more
                  insupportable, from which she would long since have called upon the law to
                  liberate her, had not the publicity of a trial, the odium attached to it, the
                  curiosity of the scandal-loving world been more unendurable to her, even in
                  imagination, than a death by the slow torture which she felt.
               Death, more mighty than the law, had come to her relief, and set his seal, not to
                  be violated, upon her bill of divorcement.
               Ridgely had been cruel to her, and cruelly had his punishment been meted out by
                  the hand of the murderer. Why should she weep for him, when she knew that had she
                  died, he would not have shed one tear?
               Though the dead man had been unloved by all, yet his remains were followed by many
                  to their last resting-place; none of whom mourned that the thread of his life had
                  been so remorselessly severed. No sufferer, whom his hand had relieved, watered
                  his grave with the tear of grateful affection; no orphan, whom his charity had
                  nourished, refused to be comforted for the loss of a kind benefactor. The mourners
                  turned away, regretting not that they would meet him no more in their daily walks;
                  for his presence had diffused fused no
                  joy; no hand was pressed by him in love's fellowship; but his brow had been dark
                  with the scowl of hate, his lip curled in defiant scorn, and, like Ishmael of old,
                  his hand was against every man, and every man's hand against him.
               His grave was one of many in that beautiful city of the dead. Above it the pride
                  of his wife reared a stately marble; above it the grass grew green, as the verdure
                  of love had never done from his living heart, and around it bloomed bright flowers
                  and evergreens, speaking mockingly of undying affection, of enduring
                  remembrance.
               He was dead, and no voice of love or pity whispered, "He sleeps the sleep of the
                  righteous."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               ANOTHER year had passed, "bearing its wishes, hopes, and fears," since Allan left
                  his native land. Who can tell how long it seemed to his mother, who, for some
                  months, had heard no tidings of her son?
               She wandered restlessly through the house, where everything remained as Allan had
                  left it; where his books, arranged by his hands, were faithfully returned to their
                  places. The mark was yet in the page of one where he had last read; his chair
                  still stood, as when he had last risen from it, impatiently pushing it back from
                  the study-table.
               When the flowers he loved bloomed luxuriantly, she would whisper to her anxious
                  heart, "Allan must be coming, and they have arrayed themselves to give him
                  welcome;" but, day by day, as the hours flew, and he came not, hope grew less
                  strong within her.
               "He must be ill," she would say, sick with sad forebodings, "or he would have
                  written to me, his poor mother;" and then her fancy would portray him ill and
                  suffering, with no one to soothe, no one to comfort; or she would start fearfully
                  from perturbed dreams, in which she had seen him, pale with the ghastly pallor of
                  the dead; his loved form dressed for burial by careless, stranger hands; his grave
                  neglected, perhaps violated. Sometimes she would see him struggling with the
                  stormy waves of ocean, at one moment lifted high upon the summit of the
                  white-crested wave, the next sinking far down out of sight, while her heart
                  alternated between hope and despair.
               
               As soon as strength had begun to return to the wasted form of Allan, when his
                  blood, free from the consuming heat of fever, beat once more with calm and regular
                  pulsations, no caution of his physicians, no fear of relapse, no desire to visit
                  countries which he had not yet seen, was powerful enough to restrain him, and he
                  prepared to follow with his steps where his heart had long gone before.
               His mother's anxiety on his behalf would, he knew, be very great, and he would
                  have written to allay it, "But," he said, "I will be with her as soon as my
                  letter, and her surprise will be so joyful, so grateful to my heart after its long
                  fasting from all the dainty food of love!"
               The letters which he received from home had been few, though many had been written
                  by the loving hand of her who sat there awaiting his coming, sick with hope
                  deferred.
               
               He had heard nothing of Zenaida, and once he almost tortured himself into the
                  belief that she had forgotten the love which she had professed for him, had
                  consoled herself with the devotion of another; and that when he, with true heart
                  and unfailing faith, presented himself before her, he would hear from her lips the
                  knell of his hopes, "she had bestowed her hand upon another." But this thought he
                  rejected as unworthy both of himself and her, and, as he watched the gorgeous
                  beauty of the ocean-sunset, or gazed upon the depths beneath, in which the moon
                  and stars were lovingly reflected, his soul, impressed by the grandeur of the one,
                  the still loveliness of the other, longed for her, that he might pour out to her
                  attentive ear the new thoughts, the feelings, which oppressed him, with a joy so
                  intense that it was nearly allied to pain.
               The rapid course of the stately ship was all too slow for his impatience, and he
                  wished for the wings of the wind, the speed of the lightning, that he might
                  annihilate the distance intervening between them.
               At last his eye, eagerly expectant, can discern the blue, dim outline of the
                  shore, which seems to approach nearer and more near, until, at last, the harbor is
                  spread out before him, with its forests of masts; the pier is touched, and the
                  streets of the metropolis of the New World are trodden by his hurrying feet. Not
                  long did he linger, for no place could afford him rest while his eye and heart
                  were intently fixed upon his own home, the goal of his desires, to which he
                  pressed forward without consciousness of fatigue.
               Mrs. Elliott sat alone, her thoughts occupied with the absent one. The trees waved
                  their leafy boughs joyously in the sunlight; the birds hopped from limb to limb,
                  caroling their gay songs; the flowers nodded their bright heads in salutation of
                  the passing breeze. All Nature was rejoicing in light, life, and beauty; and the
                  heart of the sorrowful mother found no sympathy in its sorrow.
               The flowers and birds reveled in the light, which was their life; but the light
                  which gave life to the heart of Mrs. Elliott, the beam of Allan's eye, the joyance
                  of Allan's smile, fell not upon her. So her eyes, which look reproachfully upon
                  these things which he had loved and tended, because they could still be bright and
                  glad though he was not there to see them, were dimmed with tears.
               Thus absorbed, she noted not the footfall behind her—saw not the intruder, who was
                  gazing with sympathetic sadness upon the bright drops which rolled unheeded down
                  her face, and fell silently upon her hands, clasped in deep dejection.
               "Mother!" said a musical, well-remembered voice, so close to her that she started
                  with affright; and, as she turned, Allan stood before her, so pale, so thin, so
                  ethereal in his beauty, that, seen through the blinding mist of tears, he seemed a
                  spirit from the unseen world who had come to confirm her worst fears. But the arms
                  which clasped her in a close embrace—the voice which called upon her by all the
                  old, endearing names she had so pined to hear—the lips which pressed fond kisses
                  upon hers—the eyes, eloquent with love's divine language, which gazed into her
                  own, were not those of a spirit; and
                  under the influence of these caresses she soon revived from the sorrow which had
                  oppressed her.
               When she was more composed, he told her all that had befallen him—the love which,
                  when rejected, had turned into a madness that had driven him from his home and
                  her—the grief, the long agony of his mind, the blessed light which had dawned upon
                  him—his awakened hopes, and his great joy at finding himself once more at home.
                  And her heart was glad when she saw him before her; when she smoothed, with
                  lingering, loving touch, the masses of his soft, brown hair; when she gazed once
                  more into the depths of his dear eyes, and saw that the look of anguish and
                  despair was gone, that love again asserted its dominion.
               For days after his return he was weary and faint; but the air of home, the old
                  familiar room, the mute welcome of all his beloved, inanimate friends, and, above
                  all, the happiness of his mother, soon revived him; and it was known in the city
                  circles that the accomplished Elliott had returned—his heart true to his native
                  place as the needle to the pole.
               
               "Ah!" said one fair belle to another as they met, "do you know that Allan Elliott
                  has returned?"
               "Yes," replied the lady addressed; "but I do not feel much interest in him. I have
                  long since given him up as a desperate case. He either has no heart, or it has
                  been fortified against all, the assaults of the ladies by a dip in the Stygian
                  wave, or is protected by a buckler of 'oak and triple brass.'"
               "'Tis a pity," said the first lady, "that some of the girls should be compelled to
                  draw blanks, when there is such a capital prize as he in the lottery of
                  Cupid!"
               "This little blind deity works plenty of mischief," responded the other. "He has
                  aimed at Mr. Elliott with a leaden arrow, while the ones pointed at us are golden,
                  and do not fail to wound."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               "PAUL," said Bruce Wilson, "I want you to go home with me this evening."
               "To procure an introduction to your sister, who, I hear, has just returned from
                  school?" inquired Paul.
               "Yes," replied Bruce; "I have told her so much about you, that she is half dead
                  with curiosity to see you."
               "If that be the case," said Paul, "I think I had better stay away, as I do not
                  wish to cause her a severe disappointment."
               "You do not really believe that she would be disappointed, if you had been
                  represented to her as a paragon of all excellence—as beautiful as Apollo or
                  Adonis, as learned as Bacon or Newton, as eloquent as Clay, and as accomplished as
                  Sir Philip Sidney or the Chevalier Bayard? You are fishing for compliments; but I
                  will not burn incense on the altar of your vanity, neither will I allow you to
                  refuse to accompany me home. Maude is much like me, and you are so devoted an
                  admirer of my fascinating self, that you cannot fail to like her."
               
               "Being like you is not a very favorable recommendation; I consider it rather an
                  equivocal compliment to your fair sister," said Paul; "but I will go with
                  you."
               
               A conversation, which had previously taken place between Bruce and his sister,
                  gave rise to the one just mentioned.
               Miss Maude Wilson had just returned from a fashionable boarding-school, where,
                  according to a custom prevalent among young ladies, her old-fashioned, homely
                  name, Matilda, given in honor of a good old grandmother, had been metamorphosed
                  into Maude, which the young lady declared to be more fashionable, and not so
                  odious as the name she had borne at home. With this appellation Bruce honored her
                  when he wished to conciliate her, or render himself peculiarly agreeable; but at
                  other times he would outrage her feelings by calling her "Tilda" or "Tilly," "Mat"
                  or "Matilda." His letters to her, while she was at school, which bore either of
                  these "horrid superscriptions," were thrown indignantly aside by Miss Maude, until
                  her curiosity to see what brother Bruce had to say would conquer her anger.
               
               "Brother Bruce," said Maude, as they sat together a few days after her arrival, "I
                  am tired to death of that stupid old school, where I was not allowed to have any
                  beaux."
               "Haven't a doubt of it, Tilda," said Bruce, demurely, interrupting her. "Always
                  heard an open confession was good for the soul, and am glad you appear to wish to
                  give yours the benefit to be derived from it."
               "Bruce," said Maude, indignantly, "don't be so odious; keeping up a running
                  commentary upon everything that I say, and calling me by that horrid name."
               "Don't fret, sissy," replied Bruce; "but shake hands and make friends, bury the
                  tomahawk and smoke the calumet!"
               "Brother Bruce," exclaimed Maude, loftily, "I would not be so absurdly
                  ridiculous."
               "Family failing!" sighed Bruce; "and people that live in glass houses hadn't ought
                  to throw stones. But, Maude, go on, and tell me about the school, where you wanted
                  to have beaux and couldn't."
               "I don't believe I'll say another word," said Maude, pouting her red lips. "You
                  shock me monstrously, brother Bruce, talking in that horrid style. 'Hadn't ought
                  to!'" curling her lip in ineffable disdain; "much good going to college has done
                  you! But," she continued, brightening up, "are there any nice beaux in town whom
                  it would pay to captivate?"
               "Some delightful ones," replied Bruce; "but, like the grapes in the fable, I fear
                  they hang too high for you."
               "What an insult!" cried the outraged Maude. "Do you mean to say, sir, that I do
                  not possess sufficient power to attract them? Look at me," she continued, standing
                  before him, erecting her petite figure to its greatest height, "and retract that
                  speech, which, you must know, has no foundation in truth, or be beneath the ban of
                  my displeasure!"
               "To live beneath your dire displeasure, with your wrath hanging over me like the
                  sword of Damocles, would be an unenviable fate; but," said Bruce, surveying her
                  deliberately, "this is a case of conscience, and I cannot retract, or if I was
                  forced to do so, like Galileo, in the same breath with my recantation I should
                  renew my first assertion."
               "Well," replied Maude, "to prove that this assertion is false, introduce me to the most intractable, the
                  most incorrigible, confirmed, odious old bachelor of your acquaintance, and I'll
                  bet you a new coat against a handsome dress that I will, as Mr. Weller says,
                  'circumwent' him in double-quick time. You do not believe it?"
               "I must confess that I am somewhat incredulous," said Bruce; "and I defy you to
                  lead captive, with all your arts, my particular friend, Paul Anderson, who is
                  proof against the machinations of old, experienced manœuverers, and would but
                  laugh if he knew that his conquest was confidently calculated upon by a tyro like
                  yourself. I am afraid the contest between you would be too unequal to be
                  interesting to a looker-on."
               "I am dying to encounter this gentleman," replied Maude. "You must present him to
                  me, brother Bruce."
               "I may as well spare myself the trouble," said Bruce, with a sparkle of delight in
                  his eye, as he saw how sorely he vexed his sister. "Do you want to know what he
                  would call you?"
               "Yes," replied Maude, quickly; "what is it?"
               "A nursery miss, who smacks of bread and butter," said Bruce.
               "I'll have my revenge for this," cried Maude, with contracted brow and flashing
                  eyes. "Nursery miss, indeed!"
               "'Let not your angry passions rise,' Matilda," said Bruce, provokingly; "you
                  certainly have not had time in the few days past to forget that wise nursery
                  rhyme, and the good, pious lesson it inculcates."
               "Bruce," exclaimed Maude, vehemently, "you are not to be endured, you odious
                  creature! I'll tell mother, if you don't let me alone," she continued, with tears
                  in her eyes.
               "Don't cry, Tilda," said Bruce, coaxingly, patting her on the head. "It will spoil
                  its little eyes, and then what will become of the designs upon my unsuspecting
                  friend? But I have worried you enough for one time, so I will go down town. I
                  suppose I must find Paul, and bring him home with me, by way of a
                  peace-offering."
               "I am so glad you are gone," said Maude, as he closed the door. "Bruce," she
                  soliloquized, "has the power to irritate me, and he does not fail to use it; but
                  he, I verily believe, is proud of me, and I will love him dearly, if he will help
                  me to catch this Paul, who is worth fishing for."
               
               Miss Maude was a pretty, willful, petulant, spoiled child, who would not endure
                  contradiction from any one. Her parents indulged her in every whim, and, for the
                  slight portion of goodness which remained uncorrupted in her heart, they deserved
                  but little credit.
               Bruce was inclined to be fond of her; but she was so irascible, that he could not
                  resist the temptation to provoke her on many occasions, which he could do easily
                  by assuming a patronizing air,—by talking to her as if she were still a child.
               Maude was unlike Bruce in appearance, as well as in disposition. Her hair and eyes
                  were black, her complexion not fair; her cheeks rosy as a ripe peach.
               On this evening, having forgotten the provocations of Bruce, she was unusually
                  gay, and dressed herself carefully, looking very pretty when her toilet was
                  completed.
               
               "I am confident," she said, "that brother Bruce will come home accompanied by Paul
                  Anderson, and I will look my prettiest; for I know that a great deal depends upon
                  a favorable first impression."
               
               "Mr. Anderson is quite an elegant gentleman," she said, to herself, after he had
                  taken his departure. "I wonder if he is really as horridly insensible as brother
                  Bruce says he is? In trying to fascinate him, I will have to keep guard over my
                  own heart, if a little gipsy, like myself, may be supposed to possess an article
                  so unfashionable. A heart is very inconvenient to one who is determined to be a
                  belle, as I will be, brother Bruce to the contrary notwithstanding. I can, or
                  ought to please," she continued, standing before her mirror, and contemplating her
                  face and form, which, in her partial eyes, appeared very charming. "I was quite
                  amiable to-night, as I did not wish to frighten this 'gentilhomme' by a display of any of my perversities; but if, when I
                  once get him safely in my toils, I do not lead him a merry dance, my name is not
                  Maude Wilson!"
               
               "What impression do you think I made upon your friend, brother Bruce?" inquired
                  Maude, a few days after.
               "Do my ears deceive me?" said Bruce, with a tragic recoil, and an accent of
                  intense astonishment; "or do they convey correctly the words of my sister Matilda?
                  Do you flatter yourself that you could make any impression upon the heart of the
                  fastidious Paul? I can assure you, little one, that your words and actions glided
                  off from the smooth, polished surface of his heart, as the tears from the cheeks
                  of the marbleized Niobe. Impression, indeed!" he said, with a contemptuous
                  whistle. "Why, Tilly, your presumptuous vanity surpasses all bounds—as it even
                  exceeds my own."
               "Brother Bruce!" cried the exasperated Matilda, "I'll tell father, if you continue
                  to render yourself so disagreeable."
               "I would, if I were you," replied Bruce; "and papa will recompense his little
                  darling with a stick of sugar-candy, or a paper of bon-bons."
               "Bruce," said his mother, entering at this moment, "are you teasing Matilda again?
                  I wish you could find some other amusement."
               "I was trying her temper, mother," he replied. "I wished to see what kind of metal
                  she was made of."
               "I hope your experiments have resulted satisfactorily," observed Maude.
               "Certainly," replied Bruce; "Sheffield cutlery is not to be mentioned on the same
                  day with you. You are as high-tempered as a Damascus razor, or the cabalistic
                  sword of Solomon."
               "Never mind him, Matilda," said the lady, turning to Maude. "Come, go down town
                  with me, and I will get you something pretty."
               "Just as I said, Matilda!" remarked Bruce, nodding to her as she left the room; "I
                  knew mamma would sing the nursery-lullaby;,—'Hush 'ee by, and don't you cry.'"
               Maude was too much delighted at the prospect of the beautiful ornaments that
                  dazzled her fancy, called before it by
                  her mother's indefinite promise, to stop to reply to Bruce. She ran off to get her
                  bonnet, and as she joined her mother at the door exclaimed,—"What in the world has
                  brother Bruce done for amusement since I have been away? His days must have been
                  as dreary as a November fog in London!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVIII.
               ZENAIDA, in her quiet solitude, had learned from Helen that Allan had returned;
                  but no word, no token came from him, to assure her that she was still
                  remembered.
               "It is hard," she thought, "to be thus forgotten, or to be remembered only in
                  bitterness; to be cast out as unworthy from the heart where I once occupied the
                  first place. Oh, Allan, my parting prayer was unheeded by you!"
               Under the clouds of the Present, how glorious seemed the Past, surrounded by its
                  bright halo of love! The breath from its odorous bowers swept over her heart,
                  which wailed like a wind-tossed willow, and she sighed in her sadness,— 
                     
                        "Sweet memory! in thy haunted gallery let me roam;
                        My heart is sad, mine eyes o'erflow with tears;
                        Thou 'st treasured up bright thoughts of the loved one,
                        The bloom, the freshness of departed years,
                        And I would fain recall those vanished hours,
                        Gilt with a glory all too bright for earth,
                        When Hope wreathed for me a sweet crown of flowers,
                        And sorrow checked not the glad voice of mirth.
                     
                     
                        "Days of the Past! a perfume round them lingers,
                        Like the rich fragrance in the rose's heart;
                        Oh, Grief! why wouldst thou, with remorseless fingers,
                        Crush love's sweet blooms, till their bright life depart?
                        Why shouldst thou with thy gaunt, grim, spectre form,
                        Usurp a place at love's sweet feast of roses?
                        Why shouldst thou plant upon my brow thy thorn;
                        Why banish from my heart its soft reposes?
                     
                     
                        "Be still, my heart! The purple grape is blushing,
                        And tempting hangs upon its parent vine;
                        A hand has plucked that grape, and from it, rushing,
                        The tide of life pours out in fragrant wine.
                        Like it, the soul with beauty bright was flushing,
                        Seeming with more than mortal light to shine;
                        So from its grief-wrung depths should now be gushing
                        A flood of love less earthly, more divine."
                     
                  
               
               "So when care and sorrow penetrated her heart, she filled the openings made by
                  them with the pearls of great price—religion and true philosophy; as when the
                  worms bore holes through the mother-of-pearl in the shell of the oyster, it fills
                  them with the true pearl."
               Thus she would become rich in the treasures of the soul, however poor and
                  despicable in the eyes of a prosperity-worshiping world she might appear.
               She schooled her heart to submission, and though the lonely future before her, at
                  a glance, appalled even her true, brave heart, yet she resolved to look steadily
                  upon it, hoping that it would lose its terror as she became familiarized with its
                  aspect; and even though it should not, she could look above, beyond this life, to
                  the reward of the faithful in heaven. She was thankful that Allan had been
                     preserved served, that he had
                  returned to comfort the heart; of his mother, though she might never see him,
                  might never hear again that voice, the musical tones of which yet vibrated in her
                  memory.
               
               Oppressed with these conflicting thoughts, one bright, beautiful morning, a
                  Sabbath in June, she directed her steps to the church, her mind insensibly soothed
                  by the holy stillness which brooded over the earth. It seemed that the sun shone
                  more softly than on other days, and the faint breeze scarcely rippled the surface
                  of the water, or stirred the leaves of the trees. Thin, fleecy clouds floated
                  dreamily in the air, white banners of peace, hung out from the battlements of
                  heaven by the hand of the risen Lord, as tokens to his followers on earth of his
                  watchful, unfailing love.
               The church windows were open, and the light came in, subdued by the thick shadows
                  of the trees, through the branches of which could be seen the deep-blue sky of
                  heaven, the rich green fields of earth, which were blended into harmonious
                  pictures,—the only ones that adorned the modest walls of this lowly house of
                  God,—for which the window casements served as frames. The leaves of the trees
                  rustled softly, as if giving utterance to the messages of Divine love which were
                  borne upon the breeze; and, as this breeze entered, and filled the place where
                  they sat, it came not with the "sound of the rushing mighty wind," but with a
                  breath soft as music's faintest sigh. Zenaida felt the spirit-breath upon her
                  cheek, and, as it fluttered the leaves of her Bible, her eye fell upon the words
                  of the Saviour, "Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy-laden, and I will
                  give you rest;" and she smiled as if she heard a voice from heaven appealing
                  directly to her.
               The voice of the good pastor fell gently upon the ear, quivering with deep emotion
                  as it dwelt upon the wonders of God's love; and the hearts of those who heard him
                  were attuned in harmony with the sweet quietude of Nature.
               After service, kindly greetings were exchanged, and harsh voices sounded more
                  sweetly, such was the benign influence of the holy day.
               
               "Somebody done come while you bin gone, honey!" said mammy, mysteriously, as she
                  met Zenaida at the gate. "I telled him you done gone to church, an' he say 'he
                  would wait till you come,' an' thar he, is in the house, as good as his word."
               "Who is it, mammy?" inquired Zenaida.
               "I dunno," replied mammy; "but he's' mighty han'some, I tell you, honey; it does
                  my ole eyes good to look at him."
               "Who can it be?" said Zenaida, as she walked quickly up to the door. "Can it be
                  Allan?" and, at this thought, her heart almost stopped beating. "No," she
                  continued, reasoning with herself; "it cannot be Allan, and I am foolish to
                  indulge such fancies." She paused a moment at the door to collect and compose her
                  thoughts; to recover from the agitation into which she had been thrown by the mere
                  supposition that it might be Allan, before entering the presence of one who might
                  be a stranger to her.
               Her step, as she entered, roused the gentleman, who was sitting in her accustomed
                  seat by the window, holding a book in
                  his hand, upon which his eyes had not rested. He now turned, and she saw before
                  her—Allan. As she recognized him, a tumult of conflicting emotions raged so in her
                  heart that, without speaking, she sank upon the nearest seat for support.
               "Has he come," she thought, "to besiege me again with protestations of his
                  love—with keen reproaches—again to be repulsed, again to agonize my heart?"
               He rose, and came toward her; but her head was averted, her eyes blinded by tears,
                  so that she could not see the joy, the hope, that beamed from his face
                  radiantly.
               "Zenaida," he said, softly, with reproachful tone, "is it thus you welcome me,
                  with averted head and downcast eye; with no look of affection; no word of
                  kindness? Has one year had power to eradicate all loving remembrance of me from
                  your heart, which once was mine?"
               Still was she silent; for, had she spoken, her voice must have betrayed her
                  emotion.
               "Zenaida," he said again, taking her cold hand in his, "I love you still, and come
                  again to plead before you the cause of this love, which is too true, too deep, to
                  be treated with indifference,—which the suffering of the past year has burned
                  ineffaceably into my heart, long since repenting of the words of anger with which
                  it parted from you."
               "Oh, Allan!" she cried, withdrawing her hand, and covering her face, that she
                  might hide its anguish from his penetrating glance; "Allan, why do you thus mock
                  me? It cannot be that you have forgotten our former sorrow; it cannot be that you,
                  who were always so gentle, have pleasure in thus reviving the memory of that
                  grief. I was not actuated by caprice; and, knowing no cause that can have power to
                  change my resolve, I still abide by the determination formerly expressed. Leave
                  me; in mercy, leave me!"
               "I will not leave you," he replied, "until you have heard me. I came not wantonly
                  to injure your loving heart; for I know now that you decided against me in
                  obedience to the dictates of your pure conscience. I now appeal from that
                  decision, because the barrier which separated us has been removed, and I thank
                  Him, who is now the object of my reverential homage and worship, that I can with
                  truth give utterance to this assertion. Think not that I have been influenced to
                  make this declaration in the hope that by this means I might win you. You know
                  that whatever else I may have been, I was always sincere, always above resorting
                  to strategy or subterfuge above a base condescension, even if I could thereby gain
                  you, a treasure above all price. Before God, our Father, as I expect to render an
                  account in the great and final day, I declare to you that I have, by the mercy of
                  God, by the sweet influence of the Holy Spirit of love, been turned from darkness
                  into light; that I have vowed allegiance to God as my Creator, to Christ as my
                  Saviour; that I have opened the temple of my heart to the entrance of the
                  Comforter, and that, for this faith, I am willing to lay down my life, and would
                  account it the highest honor, if God would permit me to wear the martyr's crown,
                  for Christ's sake."
               He spoke rapidly, and with such solemn earnestness, such feeling, that Zenaida was
                  convinced his words were truth; and to God, who had made her the instrument of his
                  salvation, did her full heart pour out its joy and gratitude. The transition from the depths of distress to the
                  summit of hope and love was so sudden, the shock of joyful surprise so great, that
                  for some time she could only weep in silence. The flood-gates of the heart were
                  opened, and the long pent-up tide gushed forth.
               "Allan," she said, at last, drying her eyes, and looking up with the smile of
                  new-found happiness brightening her sweet face; "Allan, forgive this weakness. The
                  joy which your words infuse into my heart is deep, too deep for utterance. The
                  shock of this unexpected happiness is so great, that you must allow me time to
                  recover; I feel like the blind man suddenly restored to sight, and am bewildered
                  by the dazzling radiance which shines upon my long-desolate pathway; not desolate,
                  either, for God has been with me; but destitute of your great love, for which I
                  have thirsted, as the traveler in the desert for the fountain of pure waters."
               "Bless you for these words, which complete my happiness," replied Allan; "which
                  make you mine. I need your truth, your unfaltering faith, your love, to strengthen
                  the new-formed resolves of my soul. I need your bright example, which speaks more
                  forcibly than a host of unpracticed precepts, to sustain me in the new path which
                  has been opened for my wandering footsteps. I need the light unfading, unclouded,
                  of your love to illumine my soul, when the darkness of by-gone days threatens to
                  overshadow it again. You are willing to make the journey of life with me, and it
                  shall be my study to repay your devotion."
               "God is most merciful," said Zenaida, softly. "He has forgiven the repinings of my
                  sorrow-stricken heart, and has crowned my life with love."
               When Allan returned to the city it was with joyful heart, for Zenaida had promised
                  to give her hand to him, who had long possessed her heart. He called to see Helen,
                  and his happiness, which was betrayed in every word, tone, and look, taken in
                  connection with his visit to Willowbrook, convinced her, beyond possibility of
                  doubt, that a reconciliation with Zenaida had taken place. This being communicated
                  to Arthur, he sat down forthwith to "indite an epistle," as he said, "to ascertain
                  the truth."
               "Come, sis," he began, "tell us all about it. Is Allan to be my brother, or
                  Churchill? I feel a great interest in Frank; and, if I were a maiden, with two
                  such lovers, I would wish for two hearts, that I might bestow one on each; for I
                  should be puzzled to decide in preference of either, where the scale of merit is
                  so equally balanced. If you prefer Allan, I shall be compelled to say that you
                  have chosen well; but Frank's wife may possibly preside at the White House one of
                  these days, and I would feel quite elevated if I could claim the Lady-President as
                  my sister. So, you see, I am between the two horns of the dilemma."
               
               "What does Arthur mean? He assumes that Frank is an avowed lover of mine, while
                  the truth is, he has never spoken a word of love to me. He is only one of my
                  esteemed friends," said Zenaida, as she mused over Arthur's letter.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIX.
               FRANCIS CHURCHILL, the orator, the son whom his native State was now proud to
                  acknowledge, had returned on a visit, and every one was anxious that he should
                  speak, that they might judge if reports concerning his talents were true. He
                  yielded gracefully to the solicitations of his friends in L——, and proudly plumed
                  himself for his loftiest flight. The effect was electric, and the fame of him,
                  which went abroad, was such that in every town through which he passed, as he went
                  to visit his mother in the interior of the State, he was waited upon by committees
                  requesting him to speak, to untie the Gordian knot of politics; and he accepted
                  the task, severing it with the keen, bright sword of his wisdom, to the
                  satisfaction of all. If he soared so high in his flights of fancy that his
                  audience could not comprehend, he was regarded with still greater admiration, and
                  his progress through the country was one continued triumph. In every single-handed
                  contest with the champions of opposing parties, he was declared the victor, and
                  many were the adversaries who fell beneath the broad-sword of his argument, the
                  keen rapier of his satire, or the diamond-pointed arrows of his wit. The people,
                  willing to exalt their favorite, would have borne the vanquished before him, or
                  have lashed them to the chariot of his triumph; but he was too generous to boast
                  over a fallen foe, to exult in the downfall of an enemy.
               "My dear Zenaida," said Mrs. Cabell, as she entered the Cottage, "I have called to
                  see if you will go with me to-morrow to hear this famous Mr. Churchill speak. He
                  is to be in our town, and I confess I feel a great desire to hear him. I am not in
                  the habit of attending such meetings; but the gallant gentlemen of Montrose are so
                  unselfish that they have determined to admit the ladies, as participants, to this
                  feast of reason. I think this very commendable, for we ought not to be excluded;
                  but gentlemen generally are somewhat like the Chinese: they would shut us out from
                  all knowledge, except that which appertains to the domestic economy of our own
                  households, and the Bible, which teaches us to be meek and obedient to their own
                  lordly selves. For my part, I love to listen to an eloquent speaker, let his
                  subject be what it may—religion, politics, literature, science, or art; yet there
                  is not the slightest danger that I would ever wish to usurp the station which, of
                  right, belongs to man, or to take the reins of the government chariot in my own
                  hands; for I should guide the fiery coursers about as felicitously as Phaëton did
                  the coursers of the sun. But, excuse my long tongue: it is like a clock, and, when
                  once wound up, is obliged to keep on until it runs down. Will you go?"
               "With pleasure," replied Zenaida. "I, too, am exceedingly anxious to hear this
                  celebrated orator, of whom report speaks so highly."
               "I must caution you, my dear," said Mrs. Cabell, "against him. I understand that
                  he is a man of remarkably fine appearance, and is also quite young; so do not fall
                  in love with him until you ascertain the state of his affections."
               
               Zenaida smiled, and promised to obey.
               "I have persuaded Annie to go with us," continued the old lady. "Poor Annie! It is
                  so dull for her at the Manor, with none but Mary and myself. She led so gay a life
                  while she was in town."
               
               The next day proved auspicious; and, after a pleasant ride, the ladies, arrived at
                  the place which had been extemporaneously prepared for the speaker, whom all
                  delighted to honor. A crowd had already assembled when the stately equipage from
                  the Manor was driven up to the grove, adjoining the town, where the rude stand and
                  rough seats had been arranged. It was a magnificent ball, with its stately
                  pillars, the aged trees of the forest, crowned with their capitals of green
                  leaves; its vaulted roof the blue of heaven, its floor the emerald grass. Here and
                  there a stray gleam of sunshine, a golden arrow from the day-god's quiver, darted
                  through the canopy of leaves; and, as Churchill advanced and uncovered his head, a
                  bright ray fell upon him, surrounding his lofty brow with a halo of glory.
               Zenaida saw, and thought herself unseen. She noted with delight the improvements
                  that were manifest since she had last seen him. His head was proudly erect—his eye
                  flashed with the almost intolerable blaze of intellectual splendor—his step was
                  firm and elastic, and over the whole man was shed a stately dignity, a lofty
                  consciousness of his own power.
               His appearance was greeted by prolonged shouts of applause; but when he, with a
                  graceful wave of his hand, commanded silence, not a murmur was audible.
               "My dear," said Mrs. Cabell to Zenaida, after she had looked upon Frank for some
                  moments in silence, "my caution to you was superfluous. There is before us a form
                  'upon which every god has set his seal, to give the world assurances of a
                  man.'"
               The multitude became the creatures of his will who were swayed by the breath of
                  his power, and in the face of each one, as in a book, could be read the passing
                  emotions which were called forth by his words. Like a skillful musician, he
                  touched with cunning hand the strings of their hearts, and, at his pleasure, the
                  notes of varying passions were sounded. All hung upon his words as if entranced;
                  and when he ceased, silence fell upon their hearts, broken at first by a low
                  murmur of applause, gradually swelling in volume, until the air was rent with one
                  prolonged acclaim.
               Frank bowed his acknowledgments, and descended from the platform ere he had stood.
                  The people pressed round him, and would have shaken his hand until he was weary,
                  in token of their great admiration, but he signified his desire to pass on, and
                  the crowd divided, leaving a clear passage through. He walked straight to the seat
                  occupied by Mrs. Cabell, Annie, and Zenaida; for his eye, attracted by the
                  instinctive magnetism of love, had fallen upon her in its first wandering over the
                  sea of faces below him. Zenaida saw that he was coming and greeted him with a
                  beaming smile.
               "A pleasure most unexpected, yet most welcome, Miss Morris," he said, as he
                  extended his hand, and grasped hers cordially. "I was not aware that I was in your
                  vicinity, until my eye, in roving over this wilderness of strange faces, lighted joyfully upon one bright
                  flower, with whose beauty it was familiar."
               "The hour of which I prophesied has come," she replied; "and my weak plaudit 'well
                  done!' is drowned amid the acclaim of multitudes. Most heartily do I rejoice in
                  your triumph, of which I have been a delighted witness; in which, honored as I am
                  by you, I am also a participant."
               "Praise from you," said Frank, in a low tone, "is dearer to me than the shouts of
                  the multitude, and it rewards me for all my toil."
               "Your speech," said Zenaida, blushing at his words, "gave me great pleasure; and
                  when the last tone of your voice vibrated on my ear, I awoke as from a dream too
                  delightful to be real. Yours is a noble talent, and most nobly have you applied
                  it, realizing all my expectations."
               "I did not think I could speak to-day, until I saw your expectant face," replied
                  Frank. "Then I roused myself, fearful that you might be disappointed. But," he
                  continued "I am so delighted to meet with you here, that I cannot consent to part
                  hastily from you."
               Zenaida then presented him to Mrs. Cabell and Annie. Mrs. Cabell expressed her
                  pleasure at being favored with an introduction to one of whom she had heard so
                  much, and even the haughty Annie looked favorably upon the hero of the day.
               "My dear," said Mrs. Cabell to Zenaida, "you did not tell me that Mr. Churchill
                  was an old friend; and in coming here to-day I thought that you, like myself, were
                  actuated by a desire to hear a speech from one with whom you were acquainted
                  merely by report."
               "No, Mrs. Cabell," replied Zenaida, with an arch look at Frank; "but I did not
                  wish to boast of my acquaintance precipitately, for this hero might not have
                  deigned to cast a look of recognition upon my insignificant self, and then you
                  would have thought my boast without foundation."
               Frank looked at her reproachfully; but Mrs. Cabell waited not for the words which
                  Zenaida saw were hovering on his lips.
               "Mr. Churchill," said she, "Miss Morris is at present under my protection. She
                  will return with me, to-day, to Cabell Manor, where I will be happy to entertain,
                  as my guest, yourself. There are some other friends here whom I must take home
                  with me," she continued, as she prepared to seek them; "and you must consider
                  yourself bound to accept my invitation."
               "I am only too happy to do so," replied Frank."
               
               A happy party assembled that evening, in the hospitable halls of Cabell Manor.
                  Mrs. Cabell, more than usually stately and kind; Annie, unbending from her frigid
                  hauteur, in vain endeavor to enlist the attention of Frank; Zenaida, happy in her
                  love, and triumphing in the success of her friend, more radiant than Frank had
                  ever seen her; and Frank himself, gazing with joy upon her beaming face, or
                  listening to the music of her silvery laughter.
               "My dear," said Mrs. Cabell, taking her aside, "my warning came too late, as this
                  young hero had already seen and conquered before to-day. I must congratulate you
                  on your choice, though I am half angry because you told me nothing of him
                  before."
               
               "Nonsense, dear Mrs. Cabell," replied Zenaida. "Frank is my adopted brother. I
                  have watched his upward ascent from the time that he placed his foot upon the
                  first round of Fame's ladder, and it is but natural that I should rejoice in the
                  height to which he has already attained; that I should be glad to see him—to see
                  him as he is," she continued, raising her head proudly; "to know that he is worthy
                  the esteem and confidence of all men."
               "Poor fellow!" sighed Mrs. Cabell, as Zenaida left her, "if he is only a brother
                  to her, I pity him; for if that lofty heart of his throbs not with more than a
                  brother's love for her, I am not skilled in reading these mysteries."
            
            
               CHAPTER XL.
               THE next morning, Zenaida rose early, thinking that she would return home before
                  the heat became too oppressive. As she went through the hall, she met Mrs.
                  Cabell.
               "Where are you going so early?"' inquired that lady.
               "I must be at home this morning," replied Zenaida; "and the walk will be so
                  pleasant while the air is fresh and cool."
               "What!" exclaimed Mrs. Cabell. "Do you suppose I will permit you to break up our
                  pleasant party thus? I will do no such thing. If you have anything to direct at
                  home, as a great favor, I will allow you to go, but upon condition that you return
                  again. Ah!" she said, as Frank appeared, "here is, Mr. Churchill. I will order
                  horses for you, and will allow him the privilege of escorting you, if he will
                  promise to bring you back again to spend the day with me. This arrangement will
                  doubtless, be perfectly satisfactory."
               "To me it will be," replied Frank, with a graceful bow. "Where are you going?" he
                  asked, when Mrs. Cabell had left him alone with Zenaida.
               "I am going home," she replied, "but Mrs. Cabell insists that I must return."
               "That dear, old lady," said Frank, "appears to have an intuitive perception of
                  that which is most agreeable to me, and I am much indebted to her for proposing
                  this morning ride."
               "I am glad that her proposition meets with your approbation," replied Zenaida;
                  "otherwise I should dislike to have you impressed thus summarily into my service.
                  Mrs. Cabell left you no choice; but commanded you to accompany me, nolens volens."
               "I would deserve the bastinado," replied Frank, "did I refuse to render cheerfully
                  this slight service to any lady; and I know of no demand that you could make with
                  which I would be unwilling to comply."
               "Zenaida!" called out Mrs. Cabell; "come, child, the horses are ready, and here is
                  a riding-dress. Annie's hat will just suit you," she continued, holding it in her
                  hand, straightening the ribbons and feathers, preparatory to placing it on
                  Zenaida's head.
               "Mrs. Ridgely's beautiful hat is too fine for me," laughed Zenaida, drawing back
                  as she spoke.
               "That is a mistake," replied Mrs. Cabell; "and I will convince you that it is, if
                  you will allow me to tie it on for you.
                  I can establish the fact upon the incontrovertible evidence of Mr. Churchill, that
                  this is the most becoming thing you ever wore upon your bonnie brown head," she
                  continued as she adjusted the hat, and looked admiringly upon the pretty face
                  beneath it; which blushed at her praises, and the undisguised admiration of
                  Frank.
               "I am like the jack-daw, shining in borrowed plumage," said Zenaida, as she tossed
                  back the long, black plumes, fastened by a crescent of diamonds, which flashed
                  with rainbow-colors in the sunlight.
               "If any one but yourself had made that remark, I should have thrown down my
                  gauntlet to challenge him or her to single combat," said Frank, as he assisted
                  here to mount. "There is nothing that is worn that would not derive additional
                  lustre and beauty from being worn by you: no diamonds are brighter than your eyes,
                  no pearls whiter than your teeth, no rubies more glowingly brilliant than your red
                  lips, no alabaster whiter than your fair hand."
               "Are you not afraid you will make me vain, by indulging in this strain of
                  extravagant compliment?" asked Zenaida.
               "You are proof against flattery yourself, and you think that it cannot have an
                  injurious effect upon me."
               
               "What a handsome couple they would make!" said Mrs. Cabell, as she looked after
                  them; "I always thought that sweet child would make a figure in the world; and she
                  will, as the wife of that splendid Churchill. If she had no light of her own, the
                  reflection of his glory would make her radiant."
               
               "What in the world!" said Mrs. Ridgely, as she looked through her window at the
                  pair, "did possess mother to deck that presumptuous little Morris out in my
                  finery, that she might appear to greater advantage in the eyes of that man, whom I
                  am determined, to captivate? Mother thinks he is pleased with, her; but the idea
                  is superlatively ridiculous. I never could account for the partiality with which
                  she looks upon that insipid, fair-faced child. I never could see anything worthy
                  of admiration in her, and I shall hate her more cordially than I ever did, if she
                  carries off a prize at which I grasp in vain."
               
               "What a beautiful place!" said Frank, as he gazed upon the broad expanse of the
                  Manor lands, laughing in the glad light of the early summer morn. The dew was not
                  yet exhaled, and a light veil of vapor hung over the more distant landscape, soon
                  to be dissipated by the noontide heat. The birds sang gayly; the branches of the
                  trees nodded in the breeze, which raised the soft tresses of Zenaida's hair, and
                  brought a bright glow into her cheek.
               Frank's eye soon turned from the landscape to contemplate her, who, to him, was
                  lovelier than all this wealth of inanimate beauty.
               "Is the love-light in her eye," thought he, "beaming for me? Does that soft blush
                  mantle her cheek, because I am near? Oh! coward heart, why shouldst thou dread to
                  ask the question, the answer to which may make me the proudest among men,—the
                  possessor of the priceless jewel, the pure love of a true woman's heart?"
               "That," said Zenaida, breaking the spell of silence which had bound them, as they
                  gained the summit of the hill, "is my
                  home," pointing to the Cottage. "It is a modest, quiet place; sacred to my heart
                  as the shrine of Mecca to the disciple of Mahomet; for under those weeping-willows
                  is my father's grave. This hill," she continued, "is my high tower, from which,
                  for years, I have looked forth upon the tender beauty of spring, the luxuriant
                  richness of summer, the mournful glory of autumn, and the chill desolation of
                  winter."
               Frank spoke not until they reached the gate; then, as they walked to the door, he
                  said,—
               "Happy would I be, could I hold a place in your heart, Zenaida, which is so rich
                  in love, that it bestows treasures, for which men languish, upon inanimate
                  things!"
               "And do you not hold a place there?" she said, looking up with her clear, truthful
                  eyes. "Have I not watched your career with deep interest? Have I not rejoiced in
                  your success, and triumphed in your triumph?"
               "Zenaida!" exclaimed Frank, as he led her to a seat in the porch, "you must listen
                  to the words which my heart has been struggling to speak since I first saw you. It
                  is you who have been the cause of my success. It was you who kindled into a flame
                  the dormant fire of ambition, which slumbered in my soul; you who awakened the
                  noblest impulses of my nature; who, by your confidence in my ability, incited me
                  to the exertions I have made. By your purity and truth, by the excellence of your
                  own noble character, by the practice of precepts which, by many, are inculcated,
                  without example, you reproved me more effectually than untold words could have
                  done. For you I have toiled, and the reward which I placed before myself was your
                  approbation tion. The trophies I have won; the wreath of Fame which crowns my
                  brow, are yours. My heart you have kept since I first knew you. The 'God speed
                  you,' which your dear lips and sweet voice uttered that night, so long ago, has
                  been my talisman; has preserved me and made me what I am. Unworthy as I am of so
                  rich a boon, can you,—-will you give your heart, your happiness into my
                  keeping?"
               "Unhappy that I am!" said Zenaida, in a voice of deep distress. "Why, why has all
                  this hoarded wealth of love been bestowed upon me, who have none but a sister's
                  affection to give in return? Frank! this heart of yours is noble and true, and I
                  would not willingly have wounded it for the world! Your love is a possession of
                  which any might be proud; for which the gifted, the beautiful, the noble, might
                  pine. Why have you lavished it on me, who have no heart to give in return?"
               While she spoke, Frank had bowed his head upon his hands. Her words were the
                  death-knell of his hopes, and each one dissolved a spell which had bound him for
                  years.
               "Then," said he, "while I have been toiling to reach the goal, another has been
                  before me and secured the prize, and my labor is in vain. I am like the tree in
                  all the glory of its summer, struck by the scathing lightning; or, like the earth,
                  from which the gentle dews and rain are withheld, parched by drouth, until every
                  green and living thing that adorned it is withered, and, the dry, dead leaves
                  rustle mournfully in the breeze. The summer of my heart is gone, and love's
                  flowers are 'pale for the falsehood of the flattering hours!'"
               "Frank," said Zenaida, appealingly, "do not speak in this despairing tone. I would rather have suffered many
                  pangs than to have inflicted one on your kind, generous, noble heart. I love you
                  as dearly as though you were my own brother, and it grieves me beyond my powers of
                  utterance to see you thus, and know that I am the unhappy cause."
               "Reproach not yourself, Zenaida," he said, sadly, looking up, and seeing her
                  tearful eyes fixed with tender pity upon him; "you are blameless. It is I who, in
                  the blindness, the infatuation of my heart, dared to hope, to believe, that such a
                  blessing as your love was to crown my life. You never, by word or deed, have
                  compromised your truth; you never raised me by flattering lures, by deceptive
                  promises, to the height of happiness, that you might watch with pleasure my fall
                  into the deep darkness of life, without the radiance of your smile. I have
                  deceived myself."
               "Bless you for those words!" replied Zenaida. "They assure me that I have not
                  fallen in your esteem, that I may still call you my friend, my brother."
               "Call me not by that name now," said Frank; "I cannot bear it; it is so cold, in
                  comparison to the one I hoped to hear from your lips, that it pierces me like cold
                  steel. Zenaida," he continued, rising, "it is useless to prolong this
                  conversation; it is painful to us both. It will be a difficult task for me to
                  drill my proud heart to look upon the happy lot of another, who is blest with your
                  love, without envy, without hatred; but for your dear sake this hard lesson shall
                  be learned. His hand has dashed the cup of happiness from my lips, and placed in
                  its stead one of mingled wormwood and gall. My heart is henceforth like the Dead
                  Sea apples: it may appear fair without, but is full of the bitter ashes, from the
                  funeral pyre of Hope, within. But forgiveness is the noblest revenge, and though I
                  may be miserable myself, I do not wish that you, or any one whom you love, should
                  share this misery. I would not wish it, even if, by so doing, I could call down
                  suffering, equal to my own, upon him who occupies the place I coveted in your
                  heart."
               He held out his hand, in token of amity, as he ceased speaking. She caught it in
                  both of hers, and her tears fell fast upon it.
               "Frank, Frank!" she cried, "little did I think, when we started forth so gayly
                  this morning, that the hearts of both of us would now be full of grief; that the
                  brightness of this beautiful day would now be clouded by sorrow! When I hailed the
                  conquering hero so joyfully but yesterday, little did I dream that we met with
                  smiles to part with tears!"
               "Zenaida," said Frank, pitying her distress, "will you return with me to the
                  Manor?"
               "I cannot," she replied; "my head aches, and my heart too, and I must be alone; I
                  cannot bear the affectionate scrutiny of Mrs. Cabell, or the cold gaze of Mrs.
                  Ridgely."
               "Then I must go alone," he replied. "Alone!" he repeated bitterly, "as I must
                  henceforth be through life. I cannot linger here. Give me, ere I go, some slight
                  token, some memorial of our past friendship."
               She rose, and gathering some bright flowers and evergreens, tied them together
                  with a tress of her own bright hair. The dew was gone from them, but her tears
                  fell upon them like dew.
               "Frank," she said, placing them in his hand, "the flowers will wither, and they
                  are emblems of your love; but the arborvitæ is a symbol of our friendship, which
                  is immortal."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLI.
               WHEN Frank looked back from the top of the hill upon the vine-wreathed cottage,
                  with its bright flowers and trees, he felt as if he were leaving Paradise behind
                  him to go forth into the weary world, which, in a few hours, had been converted
                  from a blooming garden of delight into a sterile, barren waste.
               Zenaida sat where he had left her, her head drooped upon her hand, her tearful
                  eyes fixed upon his retreating form; and when he paused, and turned round, she
                  waved a last farewell.
               Frank saw, and returned the signal.
               "The flutter of that signal," he sighed, "is the last gleam of the snowy pinions
                  of the angel Hope, who has ascended into heaven, leaving me to wander in a world
                  of darkness and despair. Woe is me! The fountain of love, which gleamed goldenly
                  in the sunlight of life, which murmured musically, filling my soul with soft
                  melodies, is dry at its source, and I am desolate. In vain will I look for the
                  golden light; in vain will I listen for the soft melody of the gently-falling
                  waters; in vain will I thirst for a draught from the living stream."
               
               "What have you done with my Zenaida dove, Mr. Churchill?" inquired Mrs. Cabell.
                  "Did she refuse to obey my command?"
               "Yes," replied Frank; "she complained of headache, and begs that you will excuse
                  her. I too must bid you farewell, as I have some business which demands my
                  immediate attention."
               "I am truly sorry that all my plans are so completely disarranged. I had hoped
                  that our neighborhood might present some attraction sufficiently powerful to
                  induce you to prolong your stay with us," said Mrs. Cabell.
               "I am the slave of circumstances," replied Frank, "and must go where duty calls,
                  not remain where inclination prompts. I shall often revert with pleasure to the
                  evening spent beneath your hospitable roof."
               "What could have transpired between those young folks?" mused the kind old lady,
                  after he was gone. "It cannot be that he has proposed to Zenaida and been refused,
                  for she has too much sense to reject a lover who possesses so many enviable
                  qualities of head and heart."
               
               "What has befallen Churchill?" was the inquiry of friends and admirers. "He looks
                  pale and care worn; the fire in his eye burns with a subdued light; his head is
                  less proudly erect, and his step has lost its elasticity."
               These queries brought no satisfactory answer, and, ere long, they ceased; for
                  Frank, though sadly changed, devoted himself to his legal and political avocations
                  with more than his former zeal. Above the ruins of the altar upon which he had
                  sacrificed to woman, was now reared one dedicated to his country. The flame which
                  burned thereon was pure, for the offerings laid upon that shrine were his talents,
                  his time, his life itself. All private ambition, all desire for personal aggrandizement, was merged in a lofty
                  patriotism, in unselfish zeal for the welfare of his country, which was now his
                  love, the object of an absorbing passion. His noble eagle-spirit had been deeply
                  wounded, but not mortally, and, hiding its wound, again soared loftily before the
                  admiring gaze of millions.
               Many a fair lady sighed for him; many would have given all they possessed in
                  exchange for his love; but no smile had power to charm him, no voice fell softly
                  upon his inattentive ear. He turned coldly, and with a sick heart, from the
                  adulations and caresses of society, scorning to be esteemed the lion of the
                     salons, the pet of the drawing-room. It was
                  only in public that he would deign to unveil the glowing brilliancy of his
                  thoughts, to enlighten the darkness of others with the splendid light of his
                  intellect.
               After his most successful efforts, he would turn wearily from the plaudits of his
                  friends, which, now that they were no longer the prelude to the praise of her whom
                  he loved, fell coldly and mockingly on his ear. No sweet voice welcomed him as he
                  entered his rooms, which he would not call by the sacred name of "home;" no eye of
                  love beamed more brightly at his coming; no loving hand smoothed back the heavy
                  locks from his weary brow, lulling the aching head to repose with its gentle
                  magnetism.
               Hour after hour he paced the floor. "This crowd," he said bitterly, "offers up the
                  incense of its flattery upon my shrine to-day, and, if I were gone, to-morrow
                  another idol would be substituted. The preacher was right when he said 'all is
                  vanity.' I exert myself; it is for the passing amusement of this crowd, fickle, as
                  the Romans of old, continually desirous of new things; I come to this, my
                  retirement, and an irresistible force impels me, weary, to this monotonous motion.
                  If I leave no tracks behind upon the sands of time, I will leave them here, upon
                  this floor, as Bonnivard did upon the dungeon floor of Castle Chillon. Ixion, upon
                  his ever-revolving wheel; Sisyphus, rolling his ponderous stone; the Danaides, at
                  their unceasing toil,—must have felt as I do." He paused for a moment, and raised
                  a book from the table.
               "Jean Paul!" he said; "this used to be one of Zenaida's favorite books. I wonder
                  if the quaint philosopher can minister consolation to my restless spirit?"
               He opened the book, and his eye rested upon the passage,—
               "Thou art much too insignificant, thou every-day life, for the inconsolableness of
                  an immortal, thou tattered, misshapen, wholesale existence! Upon this sphere,
                  rounded with the ashes of thousands of years, amid the storms of earth, made up of
                  vapors, it is a disgrace, that the sigh should only be dissipated together with
                  the bosom that gives it birth, and that the tear should not perish except with the
                  eye whence it flows."
               He continued to read, and some passages seemed as if addressed to him.
               "We are all like the Adam of the epic, and look upon our first night as the last
                  day, and the setting of the sun as the setting of the world. We grieve for our
                  friends as if there were no better future yonder, and for ourselves
                  as if there were no better here; for all our passions are, by birth,
                  atheists and unbelievers."
               
               "If the hidden Infinite One, who is encompassed by gleaming abysses without
                  bounds, and who, himself, creates those bounds, were now to reveal himself in his
                  distribution of the suns, the lofty spirits, the little human hearts, and our
                  days, and some tears therein, wouldst thou rise up out of thy dust and
                  say,—Almighty, be other than Thou art?"
               "God forbid!" ejaculated Frank; "but my heart condemns me. I have been wishing,
                  vain mortal that I am, that I could arrange this distribution differently. I would
                  have appropriated one of these little human hearts which belonged to another; but
                  God has ordered it otherwise, and I must submit to his will. May He forgive the
                  sinful murmuring of my heart, and endow me with fortitude to bear my lot."
               With these thoughts, these prayers, came peace to the troubled spirit. A calm fell
                  upon him, which was not the calm of despair, but the tranquillity of
                  resignation.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLII.
               SOME time had elapsed since Miss Maude Wilson had laid siege to the fortified
                  citadel of Paul Anderson's heart, and she had nor yet forced him to
                  capitulate.
               Paul called her a child, a coquette, a troublesome little gipsy; denied angrily
                  that she had power to influence him; but, at the same time, obeyed her commands,
                  however ridiculous he might deem them.
               He is now sitting in the parlor, waiting the coming of Maude, with whom he has
                  promised to make some visits.
               "I verily believe that little quintessence of vanity would take twice as much time
                  as necessary to make her toilet, just for the sake of keeping me waiting! I would
                  not tolerate her for a moment, if it were not for the sake of my friendship for
                  Bruce; and if she does not make her appearance soon I will plead some other
                  engagement and leave," muttered Paul; but, hearing the light, quick step of Maude,
                  he smoothed his ruffled brow, and rose to meet her with a smile.
               "I am sorry I kept you waiting," she cried, almost out of breath; "but my new
                  dress was so pretty, that I could not help admiring it, and I was absorbed in the
                  contemplation of it, thinking how pretty I would look when I put it on, when I
                  heard your ring at the door. Now, isn't it charming?" she inquired, with sparkling
                  eyes.
               "What a child!" was Paul's mental comment; but, he added aloud, "it is so far
                  excelled by the brilliancy of your eyes, the beauty of your face, that I would not
                  have noticed it, if you had not directed my attention to it."
               "Oh!" exclaimed Maude, clapping her hands with delight, "what a beautiful
                  compliment. The girls all say that you are a cross old bachelor, always finding
                  fault; but I don't believe it; for if you were, you could not pay such pretty
                  compliments."
               Paul bit his lip and frowned.
               "I am much indebted for your good opinion, expressed in terms so flattering," he
                  said, with curling lip. "So I am
                  considered cross, a perfect Ogre, by these youthful demoiselles?"
               "Yes," replied Maude; "and I am almost tempted to retract what I said in your
                  praise, when I see that unamiable flash of your eye, that contraction of your
                  brow, that scornful curl of your lip. You must be mild as a May morning, gentle as
                  a lamb, or I will not be your champion when the girls abuse you and call you
                  names."
               "You talk as if I were a child, to be influenced by your capricious whims; to be
                  dictated to according to your pleasure," said Paul, drawing himself up
                  loftily.
               "I did not call you 'child,'" responded Maude, with a merry laugh; "but if you
                  think me deficient in the respect due to your superior years and wisdom, I will be
                  more reverential in future. Come, my venerable friend, it is time to depart!"
               She tripped down and stood on the pavement, waiting for his more dignified and
                  deliberate motion.
               "I did not know," she said, with a roguish smile, "that you were really getting
                  old; but I am convinced of the fact since I saw you come down those steps. Is not
                  the raven blackness of your hair already sprinkled with the frost of age?"
               Paul was half angry, half amused.
               "I do not hold you responsible for anything you may choose to say, as I do not
                  consider you an accountable being," he said.
               "Thank you!" said Maude; "I am under many obligations for this dispensation of
                  grace, this unsolicited grant of indulgence. Here, Mr. Anderson," she continued,
                  "we must turn down this street. I am going to see ma chère
                     amie Beatrice."
               "Then you must excuse me from further attendance upon your ladyship," replied
                  Paul, halting abruptly; "for I have an insuperable objection to entering the
                  presence of that lady."
               "You must go!" said Maude, positively. "I will not dismiss you from your
                  attendance upon me, nor will I accept any excuse."
               "You will be compelled to do so," replied Paul, "or else turn your footsteps in
                  some other direction."
               "I am going to the Bainbridges," said Maude, firmly. "If you will not go, I will
                  go by myself; but I will tell all the girls what a gallant gentleman you are; how
                  attentive to a lady's requests. Lord Chesterfield and Count d'Orsay might have
                  taken lessons in politeness from you, 
                     dicovering
                     discovering
                   in your code many articles not included in their own. Good morning!"
                  With this ironical remark, Miss Maude walked on, turning neither to the right nor
                  the left.
               "Confound her perversity!" said Paul. "I would leave her to the full, undisturbed
                  enjoyment of her solitary walk, which, I know, she does not like; but if her
                  report of this conversation is circulated among these scandal-mongering 'girls,'
                  the ball, in rolling, will increase in magnitude, until it will be currently
                  believed that I have been guilty of some flagrant dereliction from the rules of
                  propriety, and I shall find myself tabooed by our society. I would rather be shot
                  at than to follow her; but, of the two evils, I judge this to be the least."
               "Miss Wilson!" he called, quickening his steps and coming ing up with Maude, who had walked lingeringly, as
                  if expecting him.
               "Is it possible!" she exclaimed, with feigned surprise, "that you have
                  reconsidered your rash refusal, and have determined to 'humor my capricious
                  whims?' I am surprised that a gentleman of your age and dignity, should be so
                  fickle,—you, who say of woman, that she is changeful 
                     
                        'As the shade,
                        By the light, quivering aspen made!'
                     
                   You have registered a vow that you would not go to see Beatrice with me. How
                  will you reconcile it with your tender conscience, if you violate the sanctity of
                  this vow?"
               "Rail on!" said Paul; "I have made up my mind to patient endurance; have called to
                  my aid all the fortitude, the resignation, of which I am possessed, knowing that I
                  shall need every resource of this nature during this visit."
               "If that be the case," replied Maude, "there will not be the least sport in trying
                  to irritate you. I have just been trying to ascertain whether you are
                  good-natured, and I vastly prefer that you should get angry; for I like a person
                  to show some spirit—not be meek as Moses!"
               "You think that without contradiction, there is no argument," said Paul; "that
                  without the piquant spice of angry words, the sauce of conversation would be very
                  insipid?"
               "Yes," she replied, with suddenly assumed indifference and abstraction.
               "Mr. Anderson," she exclaimed, after a pause, "who is that gentleman walking
                  before us? I have been looking attentively tentively at him, and he turned round
                  just now, displaying a handsome face, the loveliest whiskers, and oh, such a
                  mustache! I never saw anything half so bewitching, except Beatrice's beautiful
                  brother."
               "You must be easily bewitched," said Paul, sarcastically, "if that specimen of the
                  tailor's and hairdresser's art has power to charm."
               "To whom do you apply that disrespectful appellation?" asked Maude. "Mr.
                  Bainbridge, or that handsome young gentleman before us?"
               "The remark I made is equally applicable to either," replied Paul.
               Maude saw that her praise of this unknown youth was disagreeable to Paul; so she
                  smothered the indignation which had been aroused by his allusion to Mr.
                  Bainbridge, and continued,—
               "I do wish I was acquainted with that elegant youth before us. By his distingué air, I know he must be a habitué of our best society; and I know he would be a
                  most delightful partner in the dance, he walks so gracefully. Who can he be? I
                  will give a description of him to Beatrice, and she can tell me who he is, for she
                  knows everybody that is worth knowing."
               "Do you really wish to know who he is?" inquired Paul.
               "Of course I do," replied Maude, decidedly.
               "He is a habitual hanger-on at one of the gambling saloons down town; one of the
                  most notoriously worthless characters in the city."
               "I don't believe a word of it!" cried Maude. "You have told me this, because I
                  fancied him, and no one of you gentlemen tlemen can bear to hear the praises of another. I believe he is somebody in
                  disguise,—a prince, or a count, or at least the son of one of our most
                  aristocratic families."
               "You can believe what you please," replied Paul; "it is very certain that if he is
                     anybody, he is so in disguise; for his nobility is not apparent.
                  As a friend, I advise you to beware of him."
               "La!" exclaimed Maude, in a conciliatory tone, "I was not in earnest. The young
                  man is perfectly odious."
               "What a shocking want of sincerity there is about this young girl!" mused Paul.
                  "If she 'lays the flattering unction to her soul' that I am fascinated by her
                  charms, she is most woefully mistaken. I would not marry her if she were the only
                  woman in the world, with the wealth of the Indies for her dower. Bruce slandered
                  himself when he said she was like him. She has his perverseness without his sense,
                  his self-will without his wit. Were I to marry her, the 'Taming of the Shrew'
                  should be my text-book; but, from her, and any other like her, may the good Lord
                  deliver me!"
               
               "So, sis," said Bruce, triumphantly, after many days had passed without the
                  customary visit from Paul, "I was right, after all, and have won my coat, for you
                  have failed to ensnare my friend, with all your arts."
               "He was not worth the trouble," replied Maude; "I have other beaux, one of whom I
                  would not give for half a dozen like that conceited, horrid old bachelor, Paul
                  Anderson."
               "Sour grapes!" observed Bruce, laconically.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLIII.
               "ARTHUR," said Helen, "I have received a letter from Zenaida, in which she informs
                  me that she is engaged to Allan Elliott; that she wishes me to come to
                  Willowbrook, to assist her in making preparations for her marriage, which is to be
                  consummated in the latter part of September. I must go; but how will you get along
                  without me? This will be the first time that I have left you since our
                  marriage."
               "You trouble yourself too much about me, my dear Helen," replied Arthur. "I will
                  miss you very much, for you have spoiled me sadly; but I will do the best I can
                  without you. So," he continued, with a smile, "I was a true prophet, after all,
                  and Allan is to be our brother! I am half sorry, though I like Allan, that Zenaida
                  should have preferred him to Churchill, who is a glorious fellow; an idol before
                  whom any woman might feel proud to bow herself in homage. His lips must have been
                  anointed with the honey of persuasive eloquence; for he enchants even his
                  opponents. How could any woman, endowed with power to appreciate his worth, his
                  giant intellect, resist the pleading tones of that voice, sweet as the musical
                  peal of silver bells?"
               "But, Arthur," interposed Helen, "you forget that Allan had won Zenaida's heart
                  before the 'glorious Churchill' had emerged from his chrysalis state; before he
                  had unfolded his splendid
                  rainbow-tinted wings, or given the world assurance of his genius."
               "True," replied Arthur; "I am a real lawyer. I can plead both for and against,
                  with equal eloquence. I used to advocate Allan's cause so warmly, that if the
                  truth were known, I expect it would be seen that he owes the first favorable
                  impression of himself upon Zenaida's mind to me. You must give my compliments to
                  Mrs. Elliott that is to be, and ask what she has done with all her arguments in
                  favor of old-maidism. These weapons of hers must be rusty from long disuse. I
                  believe I will go to Willowbrook with you. Tell her to furbish them up, and I will
                  give her an opportunity to fight a last battle as the champion of those whose
                  ranks she is about to desert."
               "If you go merely to amuse yourself at her expense," said Helen, "I can answer for
                  Zenaida that she would prefer that you remain at home."
               "Well, I will be down to the wedding," replied Arthur, "and will have a chance to
                  gratify my propensity for teasing; will call up a few blushes, by reminding her,
                  in Allan's presence, of her declarations in favor of a life of
                  single-blessedness."
               
               The wedding-day arrived, and the party, consisting of Mrs. Cabell and Mary,
                  Arthur, Helen, Mrs. Elliott, and all the country friends and neighbors of Zenaida,
                  assembled in the old Grove Church. Mr. Thornley reluctantly performed the ceremony
                  which would bind Zenaida to another, and remove her from her country home and
                  friends. Many were the prayers for her happiness; many the blessings invoked upon
                  her and Allan, who had won his way at once to the kind hearts of these good
                  people.
               "My child," said good Mr. Thornley, with trembling voice, and tearful eye, "may
                  the blessing of God, whom you love, rest upon you; may the holy dove of peace
                  brood over your dwelling I shall be undone without you. It is as if Mr. Elliott
                  had cut off my right hand; for in all my plans you have rendered me invaluable
                  assistance; and in my hours of despondency you have inspired me with hope, as much
                  by your example as by your precepts. Mr. Elliott," he continued, turning to Allan,
                  "I surrender to you the pet lamb of my fold; one that I have watched over for
                  years with the tenderest solicitude of love; for her dying father, who was most
                  dear to me, commended her to my care. She was the bright flower of my garden, and
                  daily, as I beheld the unfolding of her beautiful goodness, my heart was drawn
                  more closely to her; and now your hand has plucked my blossom, to bear it to
                  another soil. I charge you, as you hope for happiness, to watch over my lamb, to
                  preserve the bloom of my flower unfaded. A good wife is the crowning blessing of
                  God's merciful love, and if this sweet child be not one, I am not skilled to read
                  the heart of the woman and the Christian."
               "I have vowed, in the sight of God, to love and cherish her," replied Allan, "and
                  will keep my vow, God helping me!"
               "I believe you," said Mr. Thornley; "and that belief inspires me with the only joy
                  I can feel, at parting with my child, my docile, loving pupil."
               
               "So," said Bruce as he met Paul, "Allan Elliott has verified your predictions, by
                  carrying off, as his prize in life's lottery, the fair Miss Morris! 
                     
                        'Go, let me weep; there's bliss in tears,
                        When he who sheds them inly feels,
                     
                   as I do now. 
                     
                        'Had I never loved sae blindly,
                        Had I never loved sae kindly,
                        Had we never met and parted,
                        I had ne'er been broken hearted.'
                     
                   And, as it is, I am, afraid that if I was to die, and the coroner held an
                  'inkwhich' over me, the verdict returned would not be 'died of a broken heart.' I
                  fear there would not be sufficient evidence to justify this conclusion. I was as,
                  much in love with 'la belle' as I ever expect to be with any one, but I wisely
                  refrained from giving full expression to that love, as I knew she would not return
                  it. But my dream is dispelled, and I shall no more 
                     
                        'Look for light in woman's eyes,
                        Nor sun my heart in woman's smile.'"
                     
                  
               
               "That being the case," said Paul, "you will lend me your assistance in keeping my
                  Bachelor's Hall, which I am about to establish."
               "I would offer no objections, if I thought that I, a bachelor, would be visited by
                  reveries as blissful and beautiful as some of Ik Marvel's; but I am skeptical on
                  this point, and feel inclined to sing my old song:—
                     
                        Bachelor's Hall! what a quare lookin' place it is
                        Kape me from sich all the days of me life;
                        Sure, but I think, what a burnin' disgrace it is
                        Niver at all to be gittin' a wife!'"
                     
                  
               
               "What, then, do you intend to do?" queried Paul.
               "I never expect to set the world on fire, à la Phaëton," replied Bruce; "neither
                  do I expect to be able ever to exclaim with Horace, 
                     Exegi monumentum perennius ære;'
                   nor to strike the stars with my sublime head covered with the poet's
                  laurel."
               "What then?" said Paul.
               "I dinna ken," sighed Bruce, "unless I follow the illustrious example of the
                  Emperor Domitian—get a bodkin, and amuse myself killing flies."
               "A most noble and amusing occupation!" said Paul. "By-the-way, Bruce," he
                  continued, "this wedding of Elliott's is not the only one. Tell me something of
                  this runaway match of your sister's."
               "I would prefer to keep silent upon a subject so disagreeable," replied Bruce. "I
                  feel mad enough to bite a tenpenny-nail in two, whenever I think that Hamilton
                  Bainbridge, the most detestable fop in the city, has the right to call me brother.
                  But he had better never attempt to exercise this right, for if he does, I will
                  transfer him from this world to the next with such marvellous celerity, that he
                  will never know what hurt him."
               "Moderate your wrath, my dear fellow," said Paul. "It is really terrible."
               "'Tis enough to make me angry," replied Bruce, "to think that my sister should have proved such a
                  consummate little simpleton. She met with this Hamilton when she went to see his
                  sisters; and I believe that Beatrice is at the bottom of the whole plot. Maude,
                  foolish child, conceived a great affection for that most superlative young lady,
                  and she made that affecting subservient to her own purposes."
               "The connection between the families will be complete," remarked Paul, "if you can
                  be persuaded to address the fair and charming Beatrice. You would not then be
                  reduced to the dire necessity of killing flies for pastime, for she would amuse
                  you."
               "The bare idea is nearly sufficient to drive my tottering reason from her throne,"
                  replied Bruce. "A proposition to this effect is an insult to a man who has
                  worshiped the beautiful Morris, who is the moral antipodes of Beatrice Bainbridge.
                  But I am most happy to inform you, that this young lady, in whose fate you take so
                  lively an interest, is soon to leave our city. She has had a beau for some time,
                  an old widower from the South, who has a big cotton plantation and six children.
                  Beatrice has been baiting him with honeyed smiles and sweet words, and finally
                  succeeded in trapping him. She says, 'It will be so delightful a labor of love for
                  me to tend these beauteous cherubs, to take the place of the dear, departed,
                  sainted mother in their young hearts; to watch the gradual development of their
                  minds; to instil into them a love of the beautiful, that they may understand and
                  appreciate me, whom my adored, beloved and loving Antonio has elected to fill the
                  void in his affectionate heart.' She talks thus now; but, I am willing to wager
                  any amount, that she will be the most unendurable of all stepmothers mothers, for
                  she is selfish to her heart's core, and will marry her 'beloved Antonio' for his
                  money alone."
               "I am truly sorry for you, Bruce, my poor boy!" said Paul. "All your ladye-loves
                  are leaving you. Of how little compassion must their hearts be possessed, that
                  they thus cruelly desert you!"
               "Come, Saulus," replied Bruce, "enough said. Let's go to the hotel, and have a
                  'number' one dinner, with plenty of wine, in which we may drown our sorrows, and
                  drinks the health and happiness of Mr. and Mrs. Allan Elliott."
               "Also of the fair Beatrice and her Antonio," suggested Paul. "Your magnanimity is
                  quite overpowering, Bruce. I should never dream of toasting a triumphant
                  rival."
               "Your generosity never did compare favorably with mine," replied Bruce,
                  complacently; "and you never will learn to apply philosophy to life, as I do. I
                  will quote for your benefit some lines I scribbled off the other day, while in a
                  contemplative mood, superinduced by the news of Miss Morris's marriage,— 
                     
                        As the parched earth, after the rain,
                        Doth bloom forth in flowers again,
                        So man's heart, its freshness blighted
                        By many vows and troths he's plighted,
                        Revives again, and vernal blooms
                        Of new loves brighten o'er the tombs
                        Of dead affections.
                        Then plant love's rose amid the mosses,
                        And waste no time in mourning losses;
                        This summer-day, that we call life,
                        Though 'tis with many pleasures rife;
                        
                        Though all its hours are bright and sunny,
                        And we have friends and lots of money,
                        Alas! it hurries to its close,
                        Ere we are ready for repose.
                        The twilight dusk comes on apace,
                        Without e'en saying, "By your grace;"
                        The shadows deepen fast and thick,
                        They darken o'er our hearts so quick,
                        Ah! who will blame us if, while day
                        And sunshine last, we make our hay?
                        For lo! the night's so dark and murk,
                        In it 'tis written "None can work."'
                     
                   That's the end," he continued,— 
                     
                        "And now, may I be called a sinner,
                        If I don't go and get my dinner!"
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XLIV.
               "ALLAN," said Zenaida, one day, when little Amy was with her in her new home, more
                  playful, more beautiful than ever, "I wish you would paint Amy's portrait for me;
                  I am sure you will be delighted to have so beautiful a model for study, and I
                  would prize a likeness of her very highly, for she is very dear to me."
               "I will try," replied Allan; but you must not expect a chef-d'œuvre, for I have not touched my pencil for months."
               Zenaida obtained the consent of Amy's mother, and the child herself was overjoyed
                  at the prospect of being with her friend, in that beautiful house, during the
                  sittings.
               Days passed, and the picture grew life-like beneath the touch of Allan's pencil.
                  The fair golden head was wreathed with snow-white flowers, emblematic of her
                  purity, her innocent sweetness; the blue of her dress shone through garlands of
                  white blossoms like the azure sky through fleecy clouds; and her beautiful eyes,
                  full of tender pity, were bent upon the form of a dead bird, which she clasped in
                  her hand. She wanted only the wings to make her the representation of some angel,
                  who had lighted for a brief moment upon earth, who had learned the first lesson of
                  grief and death from the poor, lifeless bird.
               "It is very beautiful, very touching!" said Zenaida, when it was finished; and the
                  pleased expression of her face, the tear-dimmed eyes with which she looked upon
                  it, thanked Allan, and testified to the merit of his work, more eloquently than
                  words could have done.
               
               The winter was gone, the spring had come again; but with the reviving life of
                  Nature the rosy health faded from the check of little Amy—the bright, soft light
                  in her clear, blue eyes grew dim.
               Zenaida watched anxiously by her. "Can it be," said her sad heart, that little Amy
                  can die; she who has been the incarnation of light, and hope, and joy? Can her
                  pulse, which bounds with the full tide of youth, be stilled, while the sluggish
                  stream of age still flows on? Must her breath, fragrant as June roses, be stopped;
                  her eye, azure as the deep-blue sky, glad as the sunny light upon the sparkling
                  waterfall, be hidden from my sight by the heavy turf and the coffin lid? Must
                  'decay's effacing fingers' sweep the
                  lines on this sweet face, where beauty will linger even after the breath of life
                  is fled? Alas! 
                     
                        'The flower that blooms to-day,
                        To-morrow dies;
                        All that we wish to stay—
                        Tempts, and then flies!'"
                     
                  
               
               At first Amy knew her, and hailed her coming with smile so faint, so unlike her
                  former beaming one, that the tears, unhidden, filled the eyes of her sorrowful
                  friend. Then the fever-fire burned stronger, and the blood bounded with fearful
                  rapidity through her blue veins, which were plainly visible through the clear
                  skin. In her unconsciousness of things and persons round her, she roamed once more
                  the fields and woods of her country-home, chased the bright butterflies, and
                  called often upon Zenaida, who stood weeping by her, to listen to the sweet little
                  bird, to gather some bright flower which grew above her reach, to watch the little
                  silver-fish, as they gleamed, like a flash of light, through the clear water.
               The fever left her, and, with returning consciousness, she begged her mother to
                  take her to Maplehurst. "It will be so pretty now!" she said; and her languid eye
                  grew brighter at the thought of all its beauties.
               "I will get well, mother, if I can go there, and run about to gather flowers and
                  hunt birds' nests, as I used to do; and Cousin 'Naida says she will come too."
               Her mother, thinking that she would soon be well, yielded to her entreaties; and
                  the heart of the sweet child was gladdened again by the sight of her home. For
                  some days after they reached Maplehurst, Amy was better; but the brightness was
                  only the transient gleam of the joy which illumined her heart at the sight of the
                  fresh, green fields, and all the familiar scenes she had treasured so fondly in
                  her childish, affectionate breast.
               "Come, Amy," said her mother, "you are in the country now, you must cheer up and
                  get well."
               "I will try, mamma," she replied. "You were so good to bring me here, and by the
                  time I am well, Cousin 'Naida will come to the Cottage. I will be so glad!" she
                  said, with a bright smile.
               But the arrow of the relentless Archer had pierced the heart of little Amy; this
                  hope-inspiring flash of returning light died out, and to the experienced eye it
                  was but too evident that this sweet human flower would soon cease to exhale its
                  rich perfume upon the air of earth; that pure and spotless, without a soiling
                  taint of sin, or corroding grief, it would be placed by the hand of the
                  death-angel among the immortal flowers, that bloom upon the banks of the river of
                  eternal life.
               "Mamma," she said one day, "put my bed by the window where I can see the blue sky,
                  and the pretty clouds, and the trees. I want you to send to the Cottage," she
                  continued, "to get me some flowers; there are so many in the garden there. I want
                  some roses and white lilies. Such sweet ones grow on the grave in the corner."
               "I will send, Amy," replied her mother; "but the flowers that bloom at Willowbrook
                  are not prettier than those that grow in other places."
               When they were brought and placed upon her bed, Amy greeted them as if they had been old friends, who
                  could return her affection. She kissed them fondly; for with that old garden and
                  its floral inhabitants were connected some of the brightest and most pleasant
                  recollections of her innocent and happy life. As she raised the flowers, the
                  bright dew-drops fell upon her like tears. She smiled faintly, and said, "They are
                  crying because Amy is sick." She clasped them tightly, and fell asleep thus, her
                  thin, little hands as pale as the lilies.
               "Alice," said Mrs. Bainbridge, "I wish you would see how Amy is. I left her asleep
                  some time ago; but she must be awake now. Take these drops, and give her
                  some."
               Alice obeyed, and going to the couch of the little sleeper, found her lying as her
                  mother left her, with the flowers in her hands, her eyes closed, and a smile of
                  sweet content upon her half-open, rosy mouth, from which not even death had yet
                  power to steal the color, which had glowed so warmly there.
               "How still she is!" said Alice, with hushed breath. "Amy," she called softly; but
                  the eyes upon, which the seal had been set, opened not. She laid her hand upon
                  that of the beautiful sleeper, but drew back with blanched cheek, appalled and
                  shuddering, as life ever doth, when brought in contact with unexpected death. The
                  blood, which had bounded so joyously, was at rest in the veins of little Amy; the
                  little hand held closely in death the flowers in which her sweet life had
                  delighted; the snowy lids, like white clouds, shut out forever the sparkling
                  heaven of her blue eyes; the lips, from which had gushed a tide of melody, welled
                  from the depths of her glad heart, were mute; and to the voice of love, to which
                  she had ever been keenly sensitive, the little ear was deaf.
               "Amy, Amy!" sobbed Alice, as she knelt and kissed passionately the cold, white
                  brow, sweet mouth, and still hands, "light of my life, joy of my heart, music of
                  my soul, canst thou be dead—deaf to the voice of my agony? Woe, woe, for the
                  darkness that has fallen upon my soul! Would to God I could have died for thee, my
                  beautiful, my beloved! for thy beauty was all too glorious for the grave, and this
                  life has not many like thee, to come like a smile of God to illumine the midnight
                  blackness of its woe! O Death! thou dost come upon thy foray through our
                  earth-gardens, and our brightest treasures are culled for an offering to thy King.
                  My sister, my sister! I cannot yield thee up!"
               Was the worldly pride, the vain-glory of that mother rebuked, as she gazed upon
                  this fair altar, upon which the fire of life had been extinguished; as she looked
                  upon this exquisitely moulded form, which she had thought to deck in all the
                  trappings of wealth; upon this heavenly face, which she had fondly hoped would
                  beam with transcendent glory upon the world, awakening the admiration of all who
                  beheld her? How vain, how frivolous seemed now her hopes, her ambition! How awful
                  the sacrifice she would have made in offering up this pure heart, this young life,
                  this guileless, immortal soul upon the altar of Mammon, the god of her world!
                  Stricken with grief and awe, she gazed upon her child, who lay like a fair statue
                  of sleep garlanded with roses; but it was a sleep from which no cry of anguish, no
                  voice of love could awaken her, until the final day.
               Oh, pure soul! pure and holy as thou ever wast in life! the sod of earth may hide thy beloved form from our
                  longing eyes; but the voice we loved is gone, from the choirs of earth, to mingle
                  its clear notes with those of angel-minstrels around the great white Throne; the
                  bright-winged bird, which, for a brief season, made glad the groves here, is now
                  flitting, a spotless dove, among the golden-fruited trees of the heavenly plains;
                  and no death, no pain, no anguish, no sin, no undying remorse can ever disturb the
                  serene airs of that holy place with the rustling of their dusk pinions. A ring of
                  love is gone from the treasures of our hearts; but it adds one more link to the
                  chain that binds us to the skies.
               The holy Christ has said, "Suffer little children to come unto me, for of such is
                  the kingdom of heaven;" and He held thy hand, timid, shrinking one, as thou didst
                  pass through the dark valley, and His voice of tender love whispered reassuringly
                  to thy heart, appalled by the deep darkness, "Fear not, for my hand guides
                  thee!"
               In the lone, quiet churchyard, in the protecting shadow of the house of God, where
                  the willows hung their branches, from which the tears of night rained down upon
                  the little grave, was Amy cradled softly for her long sleep. Hold her gently in
                  thy bosom, nursing mother Earth! Let no rude hand disturb her deep repose; and
                  when thy Lord doth come, and thou dost shine in all the glory of thy renovated
                  beauty, more radiant than in the first dawn of thy creation, this, thy lovely
                  child, shall awake from her slumbers, to glad thy heart, with her sweet smile!
               As the clods fell with a dull, dead sound upon the coffin-lid, the clouds
                  gathered, as if the angels were about to weep that Death, the destroyer, should
                  have power over that sweet child, the holy purity and guileless innocence of whom
                  claimed kindred with their own celestial natures; but as the thought came to them
                  that by death she would be ushered in among their own bright throng, the clouds
                  parted, and the light, which fell goldenly upon the new-made grave, was the
                  reflection of the smile with which they welcomed the glorified spirit. A gush of
                  liquid melody fell on the charmed ear. Was it the far-off notes of some wild-bird,
                  or the first strains awakened by the fingers of the new angel, from the
                  sounding-strings of her harp of gold?
               Peace to thee, sweet Amy! Thou art hid from our waking eyes; but in dreams of the
                  night thou wilt soar above us, thy face radiant with the glory of the invisible;
                  thou wilt stoop to whisper words of love and hope to our hearts, world-weary
                  without thee. When the soft airs of spring awaken from sleep the dewy eyes of the
                  flowers above thy grave, when the sweet notes of the Sabbath-hymn float through
                  the open-windows of the church above thy lowly bed, when the voices of those who
                  come to gaze upon thy resting-place are low, and broken with emotion, wilt thou
                  not hover near that they may tell thee thou art not forgotten; that in the
                  memories of loving, heart-broken ones thy sweet looks, thy gentle smiles and words
                  of love are treasured with more than a miser's fondness for his gold?
               Could love, could gold or gems have paid thy ransom, Amy! thou wouldst not have
                  slumbered so coldly pale in this sheltered nook of the old churchyard. Friends
                  would have detained thee, little one, to bless their eyes with thy beauty, to
                  cheer their hearts with thy glad smiles and the sunny ripple of thy
                  music-laughter, until, perchance, the
                  purity of thy soul had been sullied by sin's polluting breath, or thy heart broken
                  by a weight of care and sorrow too heavy to be borne; thy golden head bowed and
                  covered with the ashes of grief. Now, no earth-cloud shall ever dim thy glory, no
                  storm of passion ever disturb the blissful heavenly calm of thy soul, forever
                  blest. Should we not say, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be
                  the name of the Lord"?
               
                  
                     This life is like the rainbow bright—
                     Brief glory on a clouded sky;
                     Its brilliance being born of light,
                     When light departs, 'tis left to die. 
                     But there's a bow shines all the while,
                     And spans the skies of Paradise,
                     A tear-arch painted by the smile
                     Of Him who wipes Earth's weeping eyes.
                  
                  
                     The griefs of earth the spent cloud are,
                     Dark, sullen back-ground, upon which,
                     In bold relief, the arch most fair
                     Stands out in hues divinely rich.
                     There, as we, gaze upon its glow,
                     The sacred promise is renewed,—
                     "Grief shall no more our souls o'erflow,
                     But be eternally subdued."
                  
                  
                     This life is like the dew-drop small,
                     That sparkles in some rosy bower;
                     The air but stirs—we see it fall,
                     Lost in the morn's first blushing hour!
                     Not lost—the sun exhales its breath,
                     Before the twilight hush of even;
                     So the pure soul, set free by death,
                     Soars up on angel-wings to heaven.
                  
                  
                     This life is like the silver sound
                     Of music on a moonlit wave,
                     Whose echoes softly float around,
                     And die in some sequestered cave.
                     But as those sounds, along the shore,
                     Some poet-soul may haunt forever,
                     So this sweet life, its music o'er,
                     Though brief, may be forgotten never.
                  
                  
                     This life is like the sunset's glow,
                     That burns along the western sky,
                     Whose gold and crimson splendors show
                     A glory, dazzling to the eye:
                     It fades—it dies, and dusky Night
                     Hangs out her pall with trembling sigh,
                     While tears, wept for the dying light,
                     Like dew-drops gem each floweret's eye.
                  
                  
                     As from the gloom, o'er all the earth,
                     The stars gaze down with myriad eyes,
                     Bright, golden orbs, which by their birth,
                     Illume the bowers of Paradise,
                     So from stern, Death's deep, sombre gloom,
                     The immortal soul, divinely pure—
                     Glows with imperishable bloom,
                     Shines with a light that shall endure,—
                  
                  
                     When the old earth, from shore to shore,
                     Shakes at the Archangel's trumpet-call,
                     When he proclaims—"Time is no more,"
                     And wakes the dead, both great and small;
                     When the sick Sun, as light doth fail,
                     Shall leave his radiant throne on high;
                     When moon and stars in death grow pale,
                     And fade forever from the sky.
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLV.
               "BRUCE," said Paul, one day, when the summer sun shone with fervid heat, "this
                  city is intolerable. Look at these long streets, in which no living thing can move
                  with comfort beneath the scorching rays of this burning sun. Suppose we change our
                  quarters?"
               "Oh!" sighed Bruce, "'for a lodge in some vast wilderness, some boundless
                  continuity of shade!' But where shall we go? Not to the Springs; for there we will
                  still be within the confines of fashion's domains; will still be required to
                  dress, dance, flirt; and all this will, of course, entail upon us greater exertion
                  than is at present compatible with my feelings. Where shall we seek a refuge from
                  the oppression of this inexorable tyrant?"
               "I agree with you," replied Paul; "we must seek the shade, literally and
                  figuratively. Suppose we get a tent, take a supply of provisions, and a servant,
                  and camp out for some time in some forest far from the haunts of men, where, like
                  Tityrus, we may recline under the leafy canopy of the spreading beech."
               "Teaching the woods to resound with the name of your Amaryllis?" inquired
                  Bruce.
               "No," said Paul.
               "I like the plan," said Bruce; "I will love to 'hunt my quarry in the wild,' like
                  the 'lovely, pale O'Connor's child,' I will go."
               "Going to Saratoga, Newport, Cape May, or the White Hills?" inquired a young
                  friend, whom Bruce met.
               "To none of them," replied Bruce. "I would rather be in Bedlam. Anderson and I are
                  going on an Exploring Expedition."
               "In what direction?"
               "It matters not," replied Bruce; "we are going to look for a cool place, though we
                  will not venture to try the inhospitable regions of the frozen North."
               "Many of the fair ladies at the Springs will no doubt regret that the light of two
                  luminaries, so brilliant as you and Paul, should be hidden under a bushel."
               "Can't help it," said Bruce.
               
               "This is the place for us, Paul!" exclaimed Bruce, as they came to a secluded,
                  quiet spot, after several days' travel.
               A high hill sloped gently down to a narrow, level plain, through which ran a broad
                  stream, in which the overhanging trees dipped their long branches; a soft breeze
                  stirred them with gentle motion, waving the pendulous boughs gracefully, as if
                  inviting the strangers to repose beneath their shade; the grass was freshly green,
                  and near the edge, in the water, Bruce found some faint, sweet-scented
                  water-lilies. The gnarled roots of several trees formed pleasant seats, and, where
                  they extended out into the stream, the water flowed through them with a gurgling
                  sound, which fell pleasantly upon the ear like the drowsy hum of bees.
               "We'll pitch our tent in this camp-ground for a few days," said Bruce. "This is
                  the very place of all others for you,
                  Paul. A true disciple of Izaak Walton, you can sit here and indulge your passion
                  for angling to satiety. If you have no use for the fish after you catch them, you
                  can throw them back into the water. I will stroll around to see if I can find some
                  bower, or cave canopied by the tasteful hand of Nature, where I may wile away some
                  dreamy hours."
               "Were you successful in your search?" inquired Paul, when Bruce returned.
               "Yes," he replied; "I have found a cave— 
                     
                        'All overgrown with trailing, odorous plants,
                        Which curtain out the day; with leaves and flowers,
                        And paved with veined-emerald; and a fountain
                        Leaps in the midst; with an awakening sound.
                        From its curved roof the mountain's frozen tears,
                        Like snow, or silver, or long diamond spires,
                        Hang downward, raining forth a doubtful light:
                        And there is heard the ever-moving air,
                        Whispering without from tree to tree; and birds,
                        And bees; and all around are mossy seats,
                        And the rough walls are clothed with long, soft grass.'"
                     
                  
               
               "A most wonderful place, verily," said Paul; "it must be the haunt of Pan,
                  Silvanus, and the wood nymphs. Keep a look-out, Bruce, and you will catch them at
                  their rites or revels."
               I must be careful," replied Bruce, "how I profane with my unhallowed eye their
                  sacred rites, or I may share the fate of Pentheus. I will beware of the Mœnads of
                  this 'dun Cadmean forest.' I am glad that I did not leave all my books behind.
                  There is nothing here to disturb us, but the whistling of birds, or the occasional
                  leap of a silver-trout trout. I can lie here and read Tasso, fancying myself in
                  the enchanted forest, where the myrtle, struck by Tancred's sword, oozed forth
                  blood and wailed in the voice of the dying Clorinda, where, at the blow of
                  Rinaldo's, the tree divided, and forth from it leaped the fair Armida. By Jupiter!
                  I wish this pretty story were not all a myth; for, if such wonders were real, I
                  would strike a blow upon yon tall, graceful tree, hoping that the semblance of my
                  enchantress, the loved and lost Zenaida, might issue therefrom."
               "You say there is naught here to disturb us," said Paul, "but birds and fishes.
                  You forget the musical hum of the mosquito."
               "A mere trifle," replied Bruce; "we can swing our hammocks from these trees, and
                  build fires beneath us, as travelers do in South America, if they prove
                  troublesome."
               "More pleasant in theory than it will be in practice," said Paul. "Ay, now I am in
                  Arden! the more fool I: when I was at home I was in a better place; but travelers
                  must be content."
               "This place will improve upon acquaintance," observed Bruce. "I believe if warm
                  weather would last, I would be willing to forsake the haunts of civilization, the
                  crowded mart, the jostling throng of busy money-makers, and live here in the
                  wild-wood." With this he 
                     sung
                     sang
                  ,— 
                     
                        "'Under the greenwood tree,
                        Who loves to lie with me,
                        And tune his merry note
                        Unto the sweet bird's throat;
                        Come hither, come hither, come hither,
                        Here shall he see no enemy,
                        Save winter and rough weather.'
                     
                  
                   Here we will dwell, like Orlando in
                  Arden, or like Robin Hood in the green glades of Sherwood."
               "Minus your Rosalind, and your maid Marian," said Paul.
               "Saulus Paulus!" sighed Bruce, "you are like the ill-boding crow from the hollow
                  oak, forever croaking, and reminding me of some deficiency."
               
               In this pleasant place they located; and here might Paul be seen lounging on the
                  bank, his angling-rod stuck in the sod to save him the trouble of holding it.
                  Bruce reclined on the grass, reading sometimes; sometimes listening to the soft
                  sounds that disturbed the quiet solitude; then again he would sit by Paul,
                  throwing pebbles into the stream, that he might watch the gradually widening
                  circles, or tossing out sticks that he might send his dog to recover them.
               "Bruce," said Paul, "are you not ashamed of being amused with that child's
                  sport?"
               "I am following a royal example," replied Bruce; "this child's sport amused his
                  Majesty Charles II."
               "Well," said Paul, "it scares all the fish, if it amuses you."
               "I am not without other resources," replied Bruce, drawing forth his volume of
                  poetry, and seeking again his recumbent position.
               He read awhile, then dreamily followed with his eyes the bright birds, as they
                  flitted among the branches overhead, or gazed at the patches of blue sky and the
                  floating clouds, which were visible through the network of leaves. His reverie had
                  deepened until sleep was stealing over his senses, when he was roused by the voice
                  of Paul.
               "Bruce," said he, "I wish you would go and look at my hook; I believe there is a
                  fish biting; but I feel so deliciously lazy, that not even the expectation of
                  catching a nice fish, can tempt me to get up."
               "Then," replied Bruce, "the fish may run away with your pole, as the cat did with
                  the pudding-bag string. I thought you were an amateur angler; but I find that you
                  are too indolent even for this most indolent of all amusements."
               They subsided again into quiet, but at length Bruce raised himself,
                  exclaiming—
               "It is growing late, and, I want my supper. I wonder where Pluto is? If he is in
                  hearing distance I will rouse him," and he blew a shrill blast upon a silver
                  whistle, which was the signal for Pluto to make his appearance.
               "Here I is, Mass' Bruce," said Pluto. "I would comed before, but I is bin
                  specially entertained."
               "What in the world have you found to amuse you in this wild place?" asked
                  Bruce.
               "I is bin circumambulatin' round here, Mass' Bruce," replied Pluto, "an' I
                  diskivered an ole campin'-ground, where they used to have woods meetin's, an'
                  seein' it minded me o' some I used to go to afore I went to town to live."
               "Tell us some of your adventures, Pluto," said Bruce.
               "Well," replied Pluto, "you know, Mass' Bruce, that ole massa bought me from de
                  backwoods, an' it was afore I was his carriage-driver that I used to go to these
                  meetin's. The cullerd folks used to have 'em well as the white ones; an' all the
                  people, fur miles an' miles, used to go to 'em. An' I tell you, they was sich
                  crowds, as you, wid yer town-raisin', never seed the like on."
               
               "Were there many pretty girls, Pluto?" said Bruce, inquiringly.
               "Lots on 'em," replied Pluto, with a grin. "Gals like you never seed in town; but
                  these here regular backwoods critters as is bin fed on corn-bread an' hominy, an'
                  pork an' beans. Tell you, Mass' Bruce, they could ride the wildest hosses you ever
                  seed, withouten saddle or bridle."
               "Decidedly novel and interesting; specimens of the genus
                     fœmina," said Bruce, parenthetically; "should like to see some of
                  them. What else could they do, Pluto?"
               
                  
                     
                        "'They could knit, an' they could sow,
                        They could reap, an' they could mow.'
                     
                   as de ole song says," replied Pluto.
               "One of these ladies would be a profitable investment in the line matrimonial. She
                  would be useful as well as ornamental, and that is a great desideratum," observed
                  Bruce. "But go on, Pluto, and tell me what they used to do at these meetings."
               "In de fust place, they preached," said Pluto.
               "Mirabile dictu!," ejaculated Bruce.
               "Then," continued Pluto, "they prayed and sing'd. One night I was 'tendin' a
                  cullerd meetin' an' de niggers cried an' hollered, an' then one preacher talked,
                  an' another say 'amen,' an' then they all groaned, as if they had bin doin'
                  somethink wicked, an' my mammy got happy, an' she thought she would shout, but she
                  had on a new coat an' a fine bonnit, an' she wur 'fraid she'd spile 'em. At last
                  she couldn't hold out no longer, an' she pulled off her bonnit an' shawl, an'
                  rolled up her sleeves, an' then she took her new coat an' tucked it up clean round
                  her waist, an' pinned it tight; then she pitched in, an' she enjyed hersef
                  mightily. When she got through, says I, 'mammy,' says I, 'fur what did you tuck up
                  your coat so?' 'Is you a born fool,' said mammy, 'to think I was gwine to spile my
                  Sunday coat?'"
               "I never knew what made you so shrewd, Pluto," said Bruce; "it must have been
                  because your mammy was so smart."
               "Jist so, Mass' Bruce," replied Pluto. "But I is jist thought of somethink as I
                  seed once at one o' these meetin's, an' I'll tell you an' Mass' Paul, ef I can
                  stop laughin'. One day I was standin' out on the edge of the meetin' an' I seed
                  the most 'markable ole individeral I ever did see in all my born days. Instid o'
                  prayin' as he oughter a bin doin' he was tradin' hosses, an' he got one at last,
                  but he was 'fraid to ride him, 'cause he didn't know how. Last he comes to me, an'
                  says, 'Uncle, help me to git on this 'ere hoss.' 'Yes, sir,' says I, 'in course.'
                  Then I helps him up, an' he says, 'Uncle, I'm 'feard I'll fall off.' 'No danger,
                  sir,' says I, 'eff you only hold tight.' With that he was kind o' pacified, an'
                  off he rides a little piece, a stickin' his feet clean through the stirrups, an'
                  holdin' tight by the hoss's mane, sort o' standin' up ridin.' 'Rectly he comes
                  back, awful skeart, an' says he, 'Uncle, I'll fall off; here, take this 'ere piece
                  of rope, an' tie my feet together.' 'What!' says I, mighty 'stonished; 'tie 'em
                  onderneath?' 'Yes,' said he. 'You blessid ole simpleton,' thinks I to myself; but
                  I says nothin', thinkin' I'd like might' well to see the 'clusion of that ride. So
                  I tied his feet tight, so they couldn't come ontied; then, says I, pattin' the
                  hoss, 'go it boots!' and the critter started off an' went a kitin' down a lane, I runnin' to see the
                  fun. lHe screetcht orful, an' I larfed 'till I liked to died. Arter awhile, he
                  couldn't stop no other way, so he ketched hold on the top rail of the fence to
                  stop the boss, an' the critter kept a runnin', an' nearly pulled the feet off the
                  ole feller afore I could git to him. 'Twas better than airy circus I ever seed,
                  Mass' Bruce," said Pluto, laughing, until the tears stood in his eyes.
               "That would have been as well worth seeing as the famous ride of John Gilpin,"
                  said Bruce. "I wish we could find some such persons here now, as this one. I
                  wonder if there are any such in this terra
                     incognita."
               "If you is speakin' to me, Mass' Bruce," observed Pluto, "I doesn't know any think
                  about that dictionary talk. When I speak to you, I 'spress myself so as you kin
                  understan', an' I thinks you might 'ford to do the same."
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVI.
               THE next morning Bruce awoke earlier than usual, and climbed to the nearest
                  hill-top to enjoy the sunrise and the awakening of Nature.
               It was the Sabbath, and, as he sat, his soul was penetrated by the sweet and holy
                  influences of the scene before him.
               "I," soliloquized Bruce, "with my indolent habits, lose a great deal. This
                  sunrise, on this quiet Sabbath morning, is gloriously beautiful. What a splendid
                  picture could I make, were I an artist, from the scene now before me. Those
                  distant tant hill-tops, just touched with the glory of the sun's first beams; the
                  silver cloud of vapor, exhaled from this river, rising slowly, undulating like
                  waves of light foam, as the soft breeze stirs it; this valley below, still in
                  shadow; and then the clouds, white, and tinged with a rosy glow, like the tips of
                  the fingers of Aurora, or Mrs. Allan Elliott, or like pearly shells with veins of
                  crimson fire, and soft, rose-colored lining. Those high hill-tops glow with light,
                  while the valley lies darkling, as the lofty souls of some mortals are flooded
                  with radiance, while others are lost in the mists of ignorance and superstition.
                  But I am growing positively serious, and that would be a new phase in the
                  character of Bruce Wilson."
               
               After lingering for some days longer here, Paul and Bruce took up their line of
                  march, wandering according to the direction of their own fancies.
               "We are approaching civilization," said Bruce, one evening. "This country is
                  beautiful and fertile, through which we are now passing. Look there, Paul, at that
                  pretty church, half-hidden among the trees; I am going into that yard. Stop,
                  Pluto."
               He opened the little gate, and was soon attracted by the shady beauty of the
                  corner devoted to the dead.
               "Perhaps the inscriptions on these tombstones may enlighten us as to our present
                  locality," said Bruce. "This little grave, with its beautiful monument—let me see
                  whose it is;" he stooped and read,— 
                     "AMY BAINBRIDGE."
                  
               
               "Why, Paul!" he cried, "we are in the vicinity of the Bainbridge's country residence, and that is not far
                  from Willowbrook, the former home of Mrs. Allan Elliott. Auspicious fates have
                  guided our footsteps; I am no longer weary, and I will not rest until my eyes have
                  looked upon the spot where my enchantress used to live."
               They proceeded along the grassy lane which had so often been trodden by the
                  straying footsteps of Zenaida and Amy; and as they turned into the path by the
                  burn-side, a gentleman and lady were seen approaching from the opposite
                  direction.
               "As I live!" exclaimed Bruce, "that is Allan and his wife."
               He quickened his pace, and soon reached them.
               "Bruce Wilson and Paul Anderson!" cried Allan, and Zenaida welcomed her old
                  friends with smiles. "I never was more astonished in my life," continued Allan.
                  "What breeze has blown you hither? I am delighted to see you both!"
               "Not more than I am to see you and Mrs. Elliott," replied Bruce.
               "I heard," remarked Zenaida, "that you were absent from the city; but I did not
                  know that you were traveling in this direction."
               "You must go home with us," said Allan. "You will find yourselves among quite a
                  party of city friends. Arthur and Helen are here; the Bainbridges at Maplehurst,
                  and my mother is also with us. Then, Bruce, there is a very fascinating young
                  lady, Miss Mary Worthington, at Cabell Manor."
               "You hold out so many inducements for us to remain, that you will not be able to
                  get rid of us even when weary of our society," replied Bruce. "But you must
                  recommend this young lady to Paul; for I have forsworn love with all its blissful
                  pain."
               "That is a most astonishing declaration!" laughed Allan; "one that I never
                  expected to hear from your lips, Bruce."
               "One that I never expected to utter," replied Bruce; "but Time, the magician,
                  plays strange and fantastic tricks with the sentiments of the wisest of us."
               "Where have you been, Bruce?" inquired Allan; "you appear to be equipped for a
                  long journey."
               "Paul and I have been rusticating," replied Bruce. "Weary of the monotonous
                  pleasures, the tiresome conventionalities of fashionable life, we have, in
                  primitive style, been living in the woods."
               "Yonder are Helen and Arthur, Mrs. Cabell and Mary," said Zenaida. "They are
                  coming to the Cottage. Arthur will be joyfully surprised at seeing you," she
                  continued, turning to Bruce.
               The parties met; and after many friendly greetings, many exclamations of surprise,
                  entered the Cottage, where all were soon engaged in lively conversation. Bruce, as
                  usual, was the life of the company. Mrs. Cabell was particularly pleased with his
                  lively sallies,—his amusing anecdotes; and Bruce exerted his utmost powers to
                  render himself agreeable to her, whom he pronounced "the most delightful old lady
                  he ever beheld."
               "Mrs. Ridgely's mother!" he said. "I think that lady might have followed the
                  example of this, her illustrious predecessor, without detriment to her
                  charms."
               
               Paul was commended to Mary by Allan; and Arthur said;—
               "Cousin May, I will make you a handsome wedding-present, a service of silver, if
                  you will convert Paul Anderson from the errors of his old bachelor creed. He
                  pretends to despise the 'artifices' of womankind; but you are not a person to be
                  contemned, when you arrive at any fixed determination."
               "I will use all my eloquence," replied Mary, laughingly, as she glanced at Paul;
                  "and I will remember your promise, Cousin Arthur."
               
               Paul was at once interested by her vivacity, her fine sense, her gay, laughing,
                  good humor, and listened, with interest greater than he had before felt or
                  manifested, to her remarks.
               "Why, Saulus," exclaimed Bruce, when they were alone, "I verily believe you are
                  pleased with that Miss Mary! Now, my dear Othello, there is here no rival in the
                  field; you can relate to her your adventures, the rough treatment you have
                  experienced at the hands of other ladies, and this Desdemona may be induced to
                  love you for the trials you have passed through; and you can love her, that she
                  does 'pity them!' She is not a 'silly woman,' that is evident; she is not a
                  'learned one' I presume; she is not 'extravagantly fashionable,' that's palpable;
                  she is not 'austerely religious,' I should imagine; ergo, from these premises, I
                  deduce the conclusion, that she is the soul which came into the world (according
                  to a popular fallacy) to be the companion of the hitherto desolate soul of Paulus
                  Anderson!"
               "An' this lady, upon acquaintance, should please me," said Paul, "think you I
                  would care for a satire or an epigram?"
               "Bravo, Benedick!" exclaimed Bruce; "that is one important step gained, and I
                  shall yet, contrary to my former anticipations, live to salute thee as 'Benedick,
                  the married man!'"
               "Where is Mrs. Ridgely?" inquired Paul.
               "At Newport, so the Duchess informed me," replied Bruce.
               
               Bruce and Paul yielded to the solicitations of Allan and Arthur, which were
                  strongly seconded by their own inclinations, and remained some days with them.
               Parties were assembled in honor of the guests—at the Manor, at the Cottage, and in
                  the beautiful groves adjacent. On all these occasions, Paul was Mary's attendant;
                  and, as day by day, his heart was thawed beneath the humanizing influence of her
                  sunny smiles, he laid aside the indifference of manner, the bitterness of speech,
                  which, at first assumed had, by long indulgence, become habitual.
               Arthur saw the change, and congratulated Mary upon her success.
               "You are working wonders, Cousin May," he said. "It is evidently your mission to
                  'beautify and beatify,' the soul of this Paul. His heart is not worthless. It is a
                  gem that will require a great deal of polishing, before its brilliancy and beauty
                  become apparent; but it will finally reward your labor."
               Mary blushed, and laughed.
               
               "You slander him, Cousin Arthur!" said she. "I have not found this root of
                  bitterness in his heart of which you told me; but if I do, I will pluck it
                  up."
               
               "I wish the Dowager would adopt me, and leave me this beautiful Manor for my
                  future habitation," said Bruce, after he had explored the farm through its whole
                  extent. "I shall be quite lonely after I have been called upon to act in the
                  capacity of groomsman for my friend Paul. I believe I will turn traveler, like
                  Baron Humboldt, Marco Paul, Bayard Taylor, et ceteri
                     omnnes. A life of wild adventure will just suit me. My resolution is
                  taken."
               As he mused, he walked toward the Cottage, passing through the garden, where Uncle
                  Harry was leisurely digging.
               "That," observed Bruce, "is a very peculiar-looking old man. His head so white,
                  his face so black, that he looks exactly like a black-faced, white sheep! Uncle,"
                  he said, accosting Harry, in a pleasant voice, "you seem to be very busy?"
               Harry raised himself deliberately, planted his hoe firmly on the ground, crossed
                  his hands, and leaning upon the handle, said, with a long-drawn sigh,—
               "Yes, master, I is mighty busy, bless the Lord!"
               "You never get through with your work, do you, Uncle?" continued Bruce.
               "No, master," replied Harry, with as near an approach to a smile as he ever
                  allowed to be exhibited on his face; "I never does. I love work so dearly, that I
                  always keep some by me, bless the Lord!"
               "That is a novel and ingenious apology for laziness;" said Bruce, as he walked on,
                  "that I, with all my inventive faculties at task, have never thought of."
               
               Time passed, and Paul and Mary were living happily at the Manor much to the
                  delight of good Mrs. Cabell, who was deeply interested in all that concerned her
                  Mary, who held a daughter's place in her warm, motherly heart.
               Annie, after several seasons' dissipation at various watering-places, became the
                  Hon. Mrs. Bentham. She was far away, and her hand ministered not to her mother in
                  her declining years.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVII.
               THE life-stream of Allan and Zenaida flowed calmly on, sometimes in sunshine,
                  sometimes in shadow. Allan, the kind, the generous, from the stores of his wealth,
                  showered blessings upon those less favored. The destitute, the afflicted, never
                  appealed in vain to him; and in his good deeds he ever found his fair wife ready
                  to aid. Their charity was unostentatious. No trumpet was blown before them when
                  they went to give alms; but quietly and noiselessly as the gentle dews of Heaven,
                  fell their gifts, their kindly sympathy upon the desolate, barren waste of hearts,
                  tried in affliction; and around their pathway bloomed the flowers of love,
                  gratitude, joy and peace, which had been called into life by them.
               
               Many a young man, discouraged at the outset by the ruggedness of his life-path,
                  had cause to bless the kindly ministering hand of Allan Elliott, which raised him
                  from his despondency, placing him upon a path made more smooth, more easy, by his
                  exertions. As the steward of the Lord, he dispensed good gifts, and the talent
                  committed to his keeping was not hidden in a napkin, or buried in the earth.
               And Zenaida? The centre of a circle around whom the learned, the good, the noble
                  revolve, willing and delighted satellites, the lustre with which she shines is not
                  borrowed from artificial sources. It is the clear light which beams from her pure,
                  bright spirit, as rays from the sun. She seeks not to allure by a display of
                  costly jewels and rich attire; but is adorned with "good works." Her religion is
                  not of the lips, but from the heart, and appeals forcibly to all who come within
                  the sphere of her gentle influence.
               
               It is Christmas night, and the parlors of the "Fairy Bower" glow with light, and
                  echo with the sound of happy, musical voices. The rooms, under the superintendence
                  of Zenaida, have been decorated in good old English fashion, wreathed with
                  evergreens and bunches of mistletoe, with its beautiful clusters of shining,
                  pearly berries. Bright flowers, from the conservatory, arranged by her tasteful
                  fingers, gladden the rooms with almost summer radiance, as in the winter of her
                  life the sweet blooms of love will brighten the chambers of her heart.
               For whom had all this been done? Who was to be the honored guest? None other than
                  our friend Frank, who, though he could not occupy the lover's or husband's place,
                  had not refused to be chief among Zenaida's chosen friends. In the years that had
                  passed, he had learned to look upon the happiness of Allan without envy, though
                  his heart still remained true to his first, his only love.
               The oldest child of Allan and Zenaida was named for Allan's father, and as he was
                  called Frank, Churchill claimed him for his namesake, and could not sufficiently
                  admire his infant beauty and intelligence. This sweet child soon became the chief
                  pet of Frank, who would sit and gaze dreamily into his spiritual eyes, so like
                  Zenaida's; but his reveries, though sometimes tinged with sadness, had lost all
                  bitterness.
               They were now looking for his coming, to welcome which Zenaida had collected a
                  party of friends with whose faces we are strangely familiar. Arthur and his Helen,
                  Ashley and the stately Florida, Allan and his mother, are grouped around the
                  cheerful hearth.
               "What can detain Frank?" said Allan, who, at every footstep, every rustle of the
                  night-wind, started, fancying he heard his friend.
               "Ah, there he is at last!" he exclaimed, as the tinkle of the door-bell was heard.
                  "Why, Frank," he continued, meeting him at the door, and greeting him cordially,
                  "I had almost begun to fear that you were not coming. Come in. I am delighted to
                  see you; so will be some old friends, whom you will find here."
               All crowded round, giving him a joyful welcome, and he was soon installed in the
                  seat of honor reserved for him by Zenaida. No sooner was he seated, than he looked
                  round in search of his little namesake, who soon climbed into his accustomed customed place upon his knee, where he
                  sat, contentedly playing with Frank's knife and watch, with which he permitted him
                  to amuse himself, until the golden head drooped, the white lids closed above the
                  blue eyes, and the pretty child slept, undisturbed by the joyous clamor of voices
                  round him, his hand clasped tightly upon his playthings.
               "Let me take him, Frank," said the soft voice of Zenaida. "He is troublesome, and
                  will weary you."
               "You shall not have him," replied Frank. "I have not heart to disturb so beautiful
                  a picture. Allan," he said, turning to Elliott, "you will have to give this child
                  to me. I will make a great man of him. But no," he continued, "I retract. His
                  mother will make a good man of him, and that will be better than a great one."
               "If you made him like yourself," replied Allan, gracefully, "he would be both
                  great and good."
               Zenaida smiled her thanks to her noble husband, for his generous praise of her
                  friend.
               "Zenaida," said Arthur, "where is that poem of Allan's, which you promised to show
                  me. This will be a fine time to read it, while we are all together; and I am sure
                  Allan need not blush to hear it, or the praises it may call forth."
               Zenaida brought the manuscript, and placed it in Arthur's hand.
               "Read it brother," she said. "Allan has dedicated it to me, and, in so doing, has
                  committed to me his fame. I wished to hear Frank's opinion; but I feel confident
                  he will agree with me."
               "Is it a connected narrative?" said Arthur.
               "The story," she replied, "is but the thread upon which he has strung some pearls
                  of poesy, some gems of thought."
               Arthur read, and his fine voice, perfect in intonation and emphasis, ringing with
                  lofty pride, or trembling with tender pathos, conveyed the thoughts, the
                  sentiments of the poet faithfully to the minds of his delighted hearers.
               Frank sat spell-bound, drinking in the sound of the melodious numbers. When Arthur
                  ceased, and all the others had expressed their admiration, Zenaida turned
                  appealingly to him.
               "What do I think of it?" said Frank, smiling. "I think you have cause to be proud
                  of Allan; of him whose brain is filled with these glowing fancies; whose heart is
                  stored with these exquisite feelings. This poem is one of those rare, soft-tinted
                  shells of perfect beauty, which are sometimes thrown up from the ocean of Eternity
                  upon the shores of Time; one of the bright scintillations from the fire divine
                  which occasionally light up, with vivid gleam, the darkness of the light of Life.
                  It is a pure brilliant, dug up from the mines of thought, which, like the
                  Koh-i-noor, rewards the labor of a lifetime. Your name will be immortalized,
                  Allan!"
               "No," replied Allan, "it will not. This immortal fame which poets dream of, is as
                  fallacious in its glittering brightness as the mirage of the desert, or the image
                  of a kaleidoscope. Books are so many, verse-makers so numberless—and all hope for
                  immortality! There are some few which stand out, eternal rocks upon the shores of
                  life's river; some which, like the oak-ribbed ships, glide majestically over its
                  waves, outriding many a storm. Others, like the smaller craft, dance merrily on
                  the current for a time, soon to be submerged beneath the waters of oblivion; and
                  others again are like the painted bubbles on the tide, beautiful, but vanishing even while we look upon them. Must I
                  commit my frail bark,—which is freighted with withering flowers, and not with
                  imperishable gems, as my little wife would make me believe,—to the current, that
                  it may be overwhelmed before my eyes?"
               "You underrate your own merit, Allan," said Frank; "Zenaida's estimate is correct.
                  It is the duty of every man to exalt and enrich humanity, and you have no more
                  right to withhold thought-treasures, than you would have to keep back your gold
                  from a brother in need. But come, let us have some music."
               Under the instruction of Allan and other masters, Zenaida has made rapid progress
                  in music; and now her rich voice rings out in her favorite songs, the words of
                  which were composed for her and set to music by her lover-husband. He is very
                  proud of her sweet voice, and smiles approvingly as she rises from the
                  instrument.
               Thus, in the pleasant communion of friendship, pass the hours, and upon the happy
                  circle look down the pictured eyes of little Amy. Their look of love is answered
                  by Zenaida, who never looks upon the sweet image except through tears, which keep
                  green the memory of the "withered flower" in the heart of her faithful friend.
               
                  
                     Now, while the current of its life's so calm,
                     We'll breathe a soft farewell to this loved home.
                     The sky above is blue, the air is balm;
                     But sure as earth is earth, the storms will come,—
                     We will not see them break o'er thee, sweet home!
                  
               
            
            FINIS.
