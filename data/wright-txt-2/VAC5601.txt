"And whataveil I Let then die to-day and

The nobleman, in his Irregular movements up
and down the stone floor, passed unconsciously
through the wide arch that afforded communal-
cation between the room occupied by the dame,
and was there pacing to and fro, deep in his dark
thoughts, when he suddenly stopped, with an
exclamation! -
A broad stream of moonlight poured through
-         the lofty lattice, like a silver river, and fell bright-
ly upon the face of the sleeping child ! It
lighted up its golden hair, lent a radianceofsuper"
natural glory toits fair brow, and revealed a face
such as seraphs must have in heaven ! Lord
Robin paused and gazed as if he had seen a
vision. He held his breath and remained mo-
tionless, as if he feared a step  , cause it to
\,          vanish. Save the face of th '   a'll else was
in obscurity, the bed, the muffie head of the old
dae--and out of, and, from the  'dst of the
darkness, was revealed the lovely sight, such as
Lord Robin thought could not appertain to
earth.        -
"If sleeping demons have been permitted to
visit me, and madden me with horrors unspeak-
able," he said, mentally, "waking, I behold an
angel ! Yet this fair sight must be human, for I
see the moving lips and.smile of one pleasantly
dreaming; and the living heartlifts the vestment
with its undulations ! I will draw near and see
what means this sweet vision."       -
He bent over the lovely child. Its rich hair
was still wet. He wondered whence it had come.
Aslightfrown contracts its forehead. A troubled
look crosses the face.
"Hama! dear papa ! Let me not drown !"
it murmurs, and turns restlessly.
The careful lname even in her sleep seemed to
-ear and ,be conscious of her precious charge.
Por without waking, she seemed to answer:
"I willsave thebabe ! I will throw out the
line as the under-tow drives the dead man this
way! I have it ! TheUe catches thebodyby

"Be it so !" he answered, yielding. "Hark !

" This way, Lord Robin," she replied ; but her
face was strangely altered in its expression.
He followed her along a passage betweenthe

And he laid down the torch which he bad held
tiiow, to raise her up.., At this crisis he was
,Noined by hi, lieutenant, and hastening with
their lovely burden down to the court, where
there wag. a well of water, tey speedily revived
AeW, with its refreshing .coldness. WAqn she
cnie to, she looked fearfully around, and then
"0, let her not have ne I She will hill me,
and drown mein the seal"
"No-ado not fear, ay sweet child," he said,
tenderly., "She is dead, herself,. in the seali
you shallsoon. be safe with a kind mother, and
with everybody who will love you and pet youi

"O,shallI    0,takemetodear motheit .-I
hayentsgen her since she was in the big ship in
the naughty storm!"
" (O- at once to the hamlet inn, Antonio," said
the officer, "and order three horses for me!
Have them here at once. 'Tis but thee miles."
This order was addressed to his servant, a
young Spanish lad %of eighteen (whgse lifes
story in itself was full of romance enough for a
tale, if we had time to tell it), who, answering,
"Si, senorP quickly disappeared on his errand.
The officer now laid his cloak folded upona
stone- bench, and placing the littlegirIupon it
with tenderness, soothed her with promises of
goon being at home. In W lttle'tima she fell
asleep,4ith her bead upen his-arm,.
"Was ever epeated thing so. lovely I" he sqid,
half aloud, as heassd upon her.A "AA orphan

it is -iow daybreak, wo:shall have light to aid

A searchwas, now uinstituted of the closest
character. More than once those who sought
the noble passed-the wal -wherein he was con-
cealed. He heard ;their: voices, and gathered
enough to know: that they were, indeed, as his
fears foretold, looking for him. *He thanked old
Alice in his heart forthe secure place In which
she had so carefully hidden him, and feeling se-
cure, he laid down on-the hard rock-to try to get
some rests trusting' that when he awaked, his
pursuers trould havelefte the tower. Suddenly
a shriek far above him in the air, startled him,!
Then-a dark body passed like a descending rock
by a little window in the cliff. He was unable
what to make of it. But it was the falling body
of the woman !  Again be slept. When he next
. aked, they dad departed It was high noon,
and they had been gone two hoars-Captain

seeing him land..Lord:Robin could see that it
was lay bya light that cam, through the breath-
ing hole,,or smalwindowsin the rock, that look-
ed towards the sea. It was not large enough to
put his head out of, yet sufficiently so to afford
himelight rad air,s and a prospect of the ocean ;
and even,:by putting hit face close to it, he could

want to hear such sounds again."        -
"Where was it, fatherI I recollect that last
year, when we came down here from the hamlet
where we liveyou said thafrobbers were haunt-
ing here."
" Yes,,robbers and ghosts, and Sathan, it may
be. It is a bad old place, and I ne'er heard good
come o't. Once it was dwelt in, some dozen
years or so ago, by an arrant witch, Dame
Alice; and one night, in a storm, the devil fiew
off with her from the tower top and dropped
her, shrieking awful, in the sea I Some say she
believed that she could fly, and so jumped
off, in her folly, and was drowned at the bottom
of the cliff. Her ghost haunts the place ever
since! Sometimes she is seen dancing a tot o'
yon rock, and sometimes skipping about e'
moonlit nights on the sea below I"
"Hast seen her, father ?"
"tany a-time I But I always gave her a
wide berth; for I could hear her scream lo g
before she was in sight."
"Perhaps it was a curlew, father ?"
"4r sounds avery' deal like, one, boy; but a
witch can imitate any sound. But this is not
the worst. There has been heard most awful
criescoMing out from tUndpr the- tower. They
seemted"to bein the vary 'bowels of the rock.
Onetught, it may be ten years age, this yery
mgonth,.or there-bout, I was catching mackerel
off the tower. There had been a great storm,
tvp nighis before, and a shipwas wrecked, and
not a s#ulsjyed, And4y ,that toleh I,ret4ember

in teboat.. ,All at once the stillness was broke
by a terrible gry thatseemed to come from the
mi4d-air. WeVere well frightened, and Jacob's
line slipped through his Augers i to these, and
I lost the best book I Qwned, and a line sixty
fathoms long."
"But the cry, father?' What was it T"
I Isoundd'like some fiend shut up in' the
bowels of the cliff. It was a most dreadful
soun&amp;amp; as ever human ears heard. It seemed to
cry for help-and then it would' roar and yell
like a wild beast. ' We were so'near the clif hat

their courage gave us courage, and we landed,
and armed with our boat hooks and fish knives,
seven of us in all, we got up to the tower."
"You were very bold, father,!"
"We were very scared, boy, and a har eross-
ing our path, would have made us run away
back again. When we got near the tower, just
about where you see that larch tree, we were all
startled by the cries again; for we had not heard
them since we -landed. They now seemed to
come from below and out in the air. The
bravest men drew close to the cliff edge and
said the sounds were not from the tower, but
were from the middle air-and that it was not
from an earthly. being. We trembled, but still
listened, till we were assured that they were not
in the air, but far below. This discovery not a
little amazed us, and as they grew more and
more horrible, we did not long delay in return-
ing to our boats. When we got to them, we
could hear the shriek above us ! By.and-by
'teyf eased,,and we pulled off, and for my part,
I have never fished there again by night."
"I think I would not have feared, father,"
answered the youthful Philip. .    ,rs
"Youth is ignorant, and ignorance is rash,
boy I But see Lwhat brave cavalcade have we
here"
The youth turned his head, and saw galloping
forward, towards the tower, a party of-fouror
five ,gay riders; evidently an excursion .from
some one of the country-seats of the noblemen
or gentry within the vicinity.
" They are Lord and Lady Monteagle, lad !
Deff-thy cap, when they pass 1" said the old
man,setting hini the example of deference 'tto
one's betters" by uncovering his rough, white
head, while letthey were hundred yards off,
But the lad did not hear. His eyes were
fixed uponan. apparition of loveliness.:such, as
only visit the dreams (if even these) ofthe
lowlyborn. I- 1was a fair, child-like maiden of
fourteen or ften, not older, dressed in a green
hunting jacket, with gold buttons, a broad
brimmedstraw  hat, hanging by the ribbon
around her neck upon her shoulders, ove which
waved and flashed in the sun-rays, as ,ehecan-
tered rapidly along,a cloud of golden brown
hair. Herebarsaing and expressive face was
fall of animation, an4 richly roseate with the
excitement of, n motion. She was laughing oer-
rily, and her voice was an alembie, in which all

Thus gratulating himself, the young and sub-

thoughts, with a feeling of resentment against
himself for loving one so obscure, and against
LordMonteagle for permitting him to remain in
ignorance of her history.,
After the departure of the young nobleman

had seen the weird woman appear from among
the trees, and address him as he galloped past
her. Instantly he left the castle by a postern on
that side, and rapidly made his way to theforest.
He beheId the gray figure of the old woman
moving swiftly in the direction, of the ancient
church. He followed, and saw her disappear

The lady Clan-William, upon an interview
with tie earl and 'countess on:her arrival at the
estde, showed them clearly that Agnes must be
'her daughter. She explained to them how that
she had taken' pssnge in a barque, at London,
to go to her brother, a Scottish lord, near In.
vemss, after, the-treason and crime of her hue-
band, Lord RObert; and 'that the vessel was

re er. She stated 'that she had been washed
a    sie some miles 'above the tower upon a piece
o the ship,,aIdthat' afitherwoman rescued her,
and entieated' her with hospitality for severid
days and'that finally.her son had conveyed her,
to tie nearest town. Here she made known her
desolate situation to her brother who came for
her, and took her to his home. .

She was soon ushered-into theroom where,
Agnesawas seated, helplessly, an usual, in, her
arm-chair, Lady Clan-William  gazed a mo-
ment upon the lovely face, eaeh Instant thelight
of maternal recognition brightening her conate-

In an instant they were folded in one another"
arms, and so clung they together that it seemed
they would mingle into one.. Lady Monteagle
wept, and ,Dame Alice let the tears trickle an.
heeded adown'her wrinkled 'chgeks..
A few days passed of such happiness as earth
seldom bestows upon its.children.- The time at
length arriyed that, theearl shoAld return to his
post at Madrid. Lady Plan-William counted
to accompany there with Agnes, who nowwould
not for a moment be. separated froa kernew-
,found modter. The earl had insisted that Agnes
ought to go to 'Spain, for he said he had heard
there of the reputation of a great Arabian ma.
gician and -alebymist, who had restored sight to
the eyes of many blind persons.
"It was our intention,/ he said; to .ady
ClauMilliamny "to have taken her back with-us,
that the skill of this person, who. often' comes
into Spain from Barbary;'may he tested i her
case."              -'       '
"Whatever holds out any hope for the recov-
ery of her sight, mustitot b untried," said her
mother; and so it wad decided'that they should
sail with them.
Three wgka afterwards, the wholepartywere,
in London, waiting the -sailing'of their frIgdte.

friar, who a sheral occasions (as averred by
the poasanta) had been seen flitting among the
Ivy-anled stones, or stoping over the broken
.slabs Io the anetent burial-place. But the work
of restoration was never, commenced, though It
was asserted that commissioners from the king
had actually visited the place, and (as was said)
entered upon negotiations with artisans. How-
ever, there was very good reason why the de-,
sign of rebuilding the abbey (if such, indeed,
had been entertained) should not be completed;
for about this period the pious James was forced
to pack up his 'royalty, and decamp for the
French court, whilst his dutiful daughter Mary,
and his-son-in-law William of Nassau, took quiet
possession of his crown and kingdom.

ticed the bewildered look of the maiden, "for I
have lately received an appointment in the
army. And I was sent to these old ruins to-
night, with my regiment, to surprise a band of
banditti, who are supposed to have their rendez-
vous within its old walls. And I have obtained
indubitable evidence of the Baron Lord Bldred
do Gottingen being the leader of this terrible
band, which has so long infested this forestaad
been a terror to travellers in these parts." ** T
He then conducted the maiden within the
shade of a large pillar, at some distance off,
where she would be safe from harm during the
expected conflict. He then returned to his men#.
in order to place them in an advantageous posi-
tion &amp;amp;  the approaching combat, which he did
by dividing them in two parties, and placing
one on either side of the road.
Hardly had the preparations been hastlyexa
ented, when the party appeared in sight, at a
short distance off, coming at a moderate pace;
for the broken columns and walls, together with
the brambles and thorns which grew thickly
about, presented a. strong impediment to their
faster progression. As they proceeded, every
hedge and projecting column was searched.
But when they caught sight of the soldiers,
drawn up in such formidable array to receive
them, they all drew rein, as if by common conF
sent. The baron, who rode infront, turned pale
with a guilty consciousness that his schemes,
whatever they may have been, were discovered.
But his confusion was but momentary, for, turn.

tone; when the whole party wheeled asoand,
and started off from the place.I
