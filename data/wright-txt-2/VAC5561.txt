               CHAPTER I.
               A HEROINE.
               EIGHTY-SEVEN years ago the old bell in the tower of Independence Hall,
                  Philadelphia, rang out a joyous pæan for the birth of the American Republic. And
                  many a time during the succeeding seven years did its clangor toll out, through
                  summer breeze and winter blast, calling Americans to arm and meet the foeman. At
                  the end of that time its iron tongue sang the requiem of Oppression and the Te
                  Deum of Liberty, sweet, beautiful Liberty; and the warrior fathers of Seventy-Six
                  returned in peace to their homes. Three millions of people were unshackled, and,
                  laying aside the musket, they took hold of the plow, the helm, and the loom; and
                  the new Republic was soon in the van of nations.
               For the better portion of a century thereafter Peace and Prosperity reigned within
                  her borders, and her flourishing cities and plenteous farms stretched from the
                  Atlantic to the Pacific.
               Suddenly, however, her life was imperiled. Hostile batteries, insidiously masked
                  for twenty years, were trained upon the "Banner of the Stars." Chilled with
                  horror, more than twenty-one millions of anxious ears were strained to catch the
                  dull roar of traitor guns. The sullen and unwonted sound came at length rolling
                  and echoing from Cumming's Point, and the lightning, on its swiftest pinions, bore
                  the dire news that Freedom's meteor flag drooped amidst the sulphurous smoke that
                  shrouded Sumter's battlements.
               At the very moment the telegraphic dispatch reached Philadelphia, announcing that
                  Beauregard had lit the fires of rebellion, a conflagration burst forth in the
                  city, and the bell in the tower of Independence Hall tolled a general alarm, and
                  was quickly followed by all the bells in the city. There was a strange
                  significance about this coincidence which was noted at the time, and which
                  increased the excitement, already so intense. Old men, middle-aged men, young men,
                  and boys, with one accord, surged along through the streets of the city,
                  shouting:
               "Down with the traitors! Give us arms! give us arms! Forward! forward! Our dear
                  old flag forever! Let us fight for it! Fight! ay, that's the word! Fight!
                  fight!"
               
               Chestnut street, from Third street westward, was the bed of a human torrent that
                  rushed and swelled and eddied along with a violence which oftentimes seemed to
                  threaten to crush in the banks of houses on either side and sweep turbulently on
                  over the ruins. Once in a while a car or a carriage toiled through the mass,
                  leaving a furrow behind it for a moment, but only a moment, for the seething,
                  churning, whirling crowd flowed over and obliterated it instantly.
               Down upon these billows of heads and shoulders and upturning faces looked two
                  persons from a window of the Continental Hotel. The appearance of both
                  distinguished them as Southerners.
               One was a tall, aristocratic young man, elegantly attired, and possessed of a
                  fine, handsome, and intellectual countenance. To some his attractiveness was
                  enhanced by the long raven-hued hair, which, soft and silky, curled naturally
                  almost down upon his shoulders.
               The lady who stood beside him was slightly below the medium height, but of that
                  peculiar dignity of carriage and mien which always seems to increase stature and
                  to command general attention and deference.
               As the two continued gazing down upon the crowd, some one in the latter, who had
                  obtained an old American flag, unfurled it. The effect was electrical, and, like
                  the roar of an ocean, a mighty cheer went up for the glorious and holy standard of
                  our beloved land. Eleanor Poindexter, the young lady we have just referred to,
                  waved her handkerchief and clapped her hands by turns, in the greatest apparent
                  ecstasy. Her companion, however, not only manifested no pleasure, but scowled
                  fiercely upon the scene below.
               "I am astonished at you, Eleanor," he exclaimed, taking hold of Miss Poindexter's
                  arm, and with no gentle grip. "You," he continued, as the young lady, in anger and
                  surprise, turned toward him—"You, the daughter of a father whose very name is
                  inseparable from the South, and whose life is devoted to her interests and
                  honor!"
               "Brother," replied Eleanor, her cheeks pale with offended dignity, and her voice
                  quivering with emotion, "I am astonished at you! That glorious banner
                  which is filling the thousands in the street with the wildest joy, and which, even
                  as I speak, may be torn in shreds from its staff at Fort Sumter, is the only true
                  emblem of real liberty. Yet you, the descendant of forefathers whose blood was
                  shed on every field of the Revolution, now that that flag is insulted, attacked,
                  destroyed, turn against it with the dastard foe! Shame on you!"
               "Eleanor," answered Henry Poindexter, his anger increased, but as though
                  regretting his rudeness to his sister, "I am sorry for my roughness, but you
                  incensed me beyond control; and I warn you that if you make any further such
                  demonstrations as you have just now made in favor of the cause which every true
                  Southerner must hereafter detest, I will exercise the authority father has deputed
                  to me and take you immediately home."
               "Provided I consent, sir," quickly retorted the beautiful girl, her proud blood
                  mounting to her cheeks and her eyes flashing fire. "Do you think," she continued,
                  stepping back a pace and glancing at her brother with a sort of contempt, "that
                  because father ordered you to attend me through our tour and afford me the
                  protection due from any gentleman to a lady, he intended me to be your slave and
                  obey your whims and commands?"
               "Then, if you are so free and independent, Eleanor, I will alter my decision, and
                  say that without you comply with my wishes I shall return home with
                  you at once, and if you refuse to accompany me thither I will withdraw my
                  protection from you and let you find your own way as best you can."
               These remarks were uttered with an air and tone which were intended to be crushing
                  in their effect. The speaker's surprise may, therefore, be imagined as his
                  beautiful and heroic sister, drawing herself up with the utmost dignity, haughtily
                  rejoined:
               "You withdraw your protection indeed! I can dispense
                  entirely with it; I do not need it! I can make my own way alone, sir, not only
                  home, but to any part of the country to which I may see fit to go."
               "To be insulted by Yankee gentlemen!" sneered Henry, laying great
                  emphasis on the word "gentlemen."
               "And, alas, to be unprotected by a Southern chevalier!" answered
                  Eleanor, throwing the most biting irony into the last word, and glancing at her
                  brother with that kind of a look which makes a general allusion at once
                  personal.
               Eleanor's sarcasm was received with applause by a group of ladies and gentlemen
                  who had quickly gathered near her and her brother. This recalled her to the
                  remembrance that her standing in society would not permit of her quarreling in the
                  drawing-room of a public hotel without lowering herself, and therefore, bowing to
                  her admirers, she said:
               "I beg pardon, gentlemen and ladies, for having, in an unguarded moment, forgotten
                  what is due to the laws of good-breeding, and thereby allowed myself to become
                  angered. Come, brother," she added, turning to Henry, "let us go."
               The latter did not answer, but, allowing his sister to slip her arm through his,
                  walked from the apartment to their own private parlor. On entering the latter
                  room, Eleanor cast herself upon a tete-à-tete,
                  and burst into a flood of tears. Henry guessed at the cause of his sister's grief,
                  and seating himself beside her he passed his arm caressingly about her, and
                  drawing her head upon his shoulder he kissed her repeatedly, saying, as he did
                  so:
               "Indeed, dear Eleanor, I am heartily ashamed of my rudeness in taking hold of you
                  before all those persons in the drawing-room; will you forgive me and forget the
                  offense? Come, now, say you will, there is a dear girl."
               "Oh, dear brother," exclaimed Eleanor, looking up into his face, "I can easily
                  forgive and forget that; but the exhibition on your part of hostility to your
                  country, how can I forgive that? Tell me," she continued, in earnest tones, "that
                  you were not yourself, dear Henry, when you manifested hatred to the flag and
                  cause for which, in the darkest days of Seventy-Six, our ancestors gave their
                  lives and fortunes?"
               For a moment or two Poindexter remained silent, and then, dissimulating, for he
                  knew well the determined and noble disposition of his sister, he replied:
               "I confess it, Eleanor, I confess it! I was not exactly myself when I expressed
                  myself so warmly on the all-absorbing topic of the day."
               "And in future, Henry," resumed Eleanor, fixing her penetrating eyes upon her
                  brother, "what course do you intend to pursue? for, depend upon it, there will now
                  be but two sides—for the rightful government or against it; for the national flag
                  or against it."
               Henry Poindexter, in dissimulating in his previous reply to his sister, had
                  thought thus to close the conversation, at least on that head. But from her look
                  as she asked him the question about his future course he was convinced that his
                  artifice had not served its intended purpose. He therefore determined to nip all
                  inquiry in the bud by answering, in his naturally imperious tones:
               "Eleanor, let me distinctly inform you that every true Southerner will choose the
                  proper side in the contest that has just been so bravely and defiantly 
                     inugurated
                     inaugurated
                   by General Beauregard in Charleston harbor. The South has determined to
                  sever all further intercourse with the North, except as a foreign nation. The blow
                  has been struck, and the battle remains to be fought."
               "All of which means," said Eleanor, releasing herself from her brother's arm,
                  "that the South has determined, causelessly, to destroy the Union, to trample
                  under foot the American flag, and commence one of the most fearful civil wars that
                  ever deluged the earth with blood and tears; and that you, as a true Southerner,
                  will side with such an unholy cause."
               "Your interpretation is a strong one, Eleanor. But let me assure you of one or two
                  things: the South is resolved on gaining its independence at all hazards, and the
                  Poindexters, to a man—your father, your uncles, and myself—are resolved to go with
                  her. Consequently we spurn the established government, spurn its laws, its power,
                  and its institutions!"
               "And do you spurn its flag?" asked our heroine, in tones ominously quiet.
               "Certainly!" was the unhesitating reply.
               "Then," exclaimed the lovely girl, springing to her feet, "I spurn you! No longer
                  are you a brother of mine when it becomes so easy a task for you to turn traitor!
                  To-morrow I shall set out on my return home to ascertain whether your assertion
                  about our father is true or only a base calumny!"
               "Go you without my protection?" asked Henry.
               "Without your protection?" repeated Eleanor, with the same irony in
                  her manner as she had exhibited in the drawing-room. "Why," continued she, "if you
                  do not curb your tongue, I shall be obliged to protect you ere long.
                  Do you not hear the popular storm raging in the street below? Listen to it! Let
                  its fearful voice sink deeply into your ears, and teach you discretion, if nothing
                  else!"
               "Ha, ha! The scum! the rabble!" exclaimed Poindexter 
                     contemptously
                     contemptuously
                  . "Do you see these, and do you not know that I am an expert with both?"
                  Henry drew forth a revolver and bowie-knife as he spoke, and grated his teeth in a
                  manner that made his
                     "Quick, quick, Poindexter! escape with your sister! The mob has heard of
                        us as secessionists!"
                  
                   sister's blood run cold, and seemed to
                  court an encounter.
               At this juncture some one came running along the hall, and, stopping at the door,
                  knocked loudly. Then, without awaiting any reply, the summoner entered the parlor
                  in which were Henry and Eleanor Poindexter. The unceremonious intruder was a
                  friend who had accompanied Henry and his sister from the South, and his features
                  were blanched to a chalky paleness as he exclaimed:
               "Quick, quick, Poindexter! escape with your sister! The mob has heard of us as
                  secessionists! There are ropes hanging on the lamp-posts in front, and before we
                  know it we'll be strung up! You never saw such a frenzy in your life! Quick! bring
                  your sister along, and we'll get out the back way, on George street."
               As the new-comer ended his half-breathless exclamations, the uproar of the mob,
                  which for a moment had lulled, broke forth afresh and with increased violence, and
                  the parlor door being open it seemed for that reason to be much nearer than
                  before. When his friend first rushed into the room, Poindexter became instantly
                  perturbated, and now, as the increased clamor of the mob broke upon his ears. his
                  nerves became so affected that he actually dropped his revolver, sprang toward the
                  door, and called upon Eleanor to follow him, instead of bearing her forth in his
                  arms like a brave man should have done. An exclamation from his companion, who,
                  though rather cowardly, was not quite so far gone as Henry, restrained him on the
                  threshold, and he turned back to assist Eleanor.
               That heroic young lady had, however, in the mean time secured the dropped pistol,
                  and as her brother advanced toward her she motioned him away, as, with the utmost
                  coolness and most terrible sarcasm, she said:
               "Thank you, Henry, you have kindly left me a weapon, and I do not, therefore, need
                  your protection! Save yourself!"
               The chivalrous brother, in the midst of his fear, was stung to the quick, and
                  remained for a moment or so endeavoring to persuade Eleanor to accompany himself
                  and friend to a place of safety. But, as she steadily and sternly refused, Henry
                  took her advice, left her to protect herself, hurried down stairs with his friend,
                  and valiantly escaped into George street in the rear of the hotel. With equal
                  precipitancy the fugitives obtained a carriage and were driven some distance ere
                  they breathed freely.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               TWO MATTERS SETTLED.
               UPON finding herself really deserted in peril by her brother, Eleanor Poindexter
                  became fearful that some terrible fate was in store for her, but be it what it
                  might, she determined to face it unflinchingly. So, calling her servant, a light
                  mulatto girl, from the next room, she closed and locked all the doors and then
                  calmly awaited coming events.
               The noise of the excited populace continued without abatement to a late hour; but
                  it came no nearer, and after Eleanor, in company with her her maid Rosa, had
                  remained a long time, expecting momentarily to be at the mercy of the mob, she
                  began to think that the friend who had brought the intelligence causing her
                  brother's flight had been premature in his judgment. Her mind was, however, in a
                  terrible state of suspense, and so unbearable did this become that our heroine
                  resolved to go in person and ascertain whether or not there was any danger. In
                  pursuance of this resolution she cast about her a shawl, and concealing the weapon
                  so unceremoniously left her by her brother she unlocked the door leading to the
                  hall and stepped boldly forth. Finding that the faithful Rosa was following close
                  behind her, she said:
               "Rosa, you stay here; I will go alone, for your presence, under the circumstances,
                  might but serve to increase our danger."
               "Oh, Miss Eleanor!" exclaimed Rosa, in earnest tones, and seeking as she spoke to
                  restrain her mistress, "don't you go! Let me go, and you stay here! I'll come
                  right straight back, and then if anything happens it'll only be me, you know! Now,
                  Missey, let me go! You'll get hurt sartin, ef you go!"
               Eleanor's education had always led her to the belief that a slave was incapable of
                  showing any of those higher and admirable qualities of human nature which were
                  thought to be exclusively attributes of the superior white race. Here, however,
                  she had a most practical refutation of the hackneyed assertion. Our heroine's mind
                  was one, however, not easily satisfied with any evidence that might be incomplete,
                  and therefore, on the instant, now that the question was raised, she determined to
                  put her servant to the test. Not that she feared to face danger herself, for she
                  was as brave as she was beautiful; but she might never again have an opportunity
                  so good as the present of satisfactorily settling for herself a mooted
                  question.
               "You are a noble girl, Rosa," she said, turning to her servant, "and you may go,
                  as you desire it, but, above all things, do not become frightened, and if there is
                  any real danger hurry back immediately, and we will then look to our escape."
               "Yes, Miss Eleanor, I'll mind all that, God bless you!"
               As she spoke Rosa bounded from the side of her young mistress, and went flying along the hall and down the stairway on
                  her perilous mission. She was absent some fifteen or twenty minutes, and a shade
                  of apprehension for her safety had just crossed our heroine's mind when she
                  returned with light footsteps and a lighter heart. She scarcely entered the
                  parlor, where Miss Poindexter was anxiously awaiting her, before she exclaimed, in
                  joyous tones:
               "Why, Missey, you'se been scared all for nuthin'. The people's not agoin' to hurt
                  nobody. They'se only hurrahin' an' hollerin' for the 'Merican flag an' Major
                  Anderson. I went right round through the middle of 'em, in the middle of the
                  street, an' right round the corner ag'in through George's street, an' they didn't
                  even say nuthin' to me!"
               Though the words of Rosa relieved Eleanor from the dread of personal danger, they
                  awakened at the same time within her the deepest chagrin for the cowardice of her
                  brother Henry, who, without staying to ascertain what foundation there was for the
                  report of his dastard friend, had fled with the latter on the first intimation of
                  peril, and had deliberately left her to meet death or perhaps a worse fate, for
                  History had recorded that mobs were capable of the most heinous crimes. However,
                  she had now nothing to fear, and her mind, consequently, was left free to
                  contemplate a matter the settlement of which the action of the slave girl had
                  fixed.
               Our heroine reasoned thus: "Rosa has been raised from her birth in bondage. She
                  has been prohibited by law from being educated. She has been every day of her life
                  taught to consider herself an inferior being; to consider herself as born and
                  reared for the sole object of serving her superior white owners. In short, she has
                  been taught to consider herself an intelligent brute—nothing more! Yet in spite of
                  these disadvantages she has this very hour exhibited traits of character of which
                  the most highly educated whites would justly be proud. What a contrast between her
                  and my haughty, domineering brother, whom, at least until now, I had always looked
                  upon as a hero."
               "Rosa," said she to the slave, "what caused you to go down stairs in place of me;
                  did you not suppose that you would be killed by the mob?"
               "Yes, Missey, I know'd all that, but I loved you to much to let you go. I'd sooner
                  be killed twenty times over than have any hurt come to you, Miss Eleanor, God
                  bless you!"
               This reply was uttered in such earnest tones that it needed not the poor slave's
                  gush of tears to stamp it as sincere.
               "Rosa, would you like to be free?" asked Eleanor, as her own feelings began to
                  well up within her.
               "Oh, Miss Eleanor," exclaimed Rosa, with sparkling eyes, "'deed an' 'deed I would!
                  Fur then I'd work very hard, and save up, and give Massa Poindexter all my money
                  for mother, so that she'd be free too!"
               "Slave, then, you shall be no longer!" said our beautiful heroine, in accents that
                  showed she had forever swept from her mind prejudices and opinions which had been
                  inculcated there by lifelong education and custom. "To-morrow I will have your
                  manumission papers duly made out, and then I shall immediately return home.
                  Hereafter, Rosa, I will pay you four dollars a week, and you must learn to depend
                  on yourself."
               "Oh, Miss Eleanor!" burst from the lips of the delighted Rosa, "God bless you! God
                  bless you! and then I can save up, my wages an' buy my poor old mother, and she
                  won't be a slave no more! Oh, God bless you, Miss Eleanor, God bless you, again!"
                  And the poor, elated child of bondage, already freed from the degrading shackles,
                  shed grateful tears on the lily hand of her young mistress, which she kissed over
                  and over.
               Ere proceeding further with our narrative we may state for the information of the
                  reader that Miss Eleanor Poindexter had, at the time of which we write, been in
                  possession for more than a year of a large plantation in Tennessee, bequeathed to
                  her by her uncle Harrison Poindexter. All the slaves thereon, of which there were
                  a hundred and seventy-five, the testator had devised to his brother Robert, our
                  heroine's father, with the exception of Rosa, who was to accompany the plantation,
                  and who consequently belonged to Eleanor. Harrison Poindexter's niece was past
                  twenty-one when she became the possessor of her uncle's valuable estate, and, of
                  course, was perfectly competent in law to attend to her own affairs. None could,
                  therefore gainsay her legal right to strike the manacles from her slave Rosa, and
                  thus make her a free agent.
               The next day the first duty performed by Eleanor Poindexter was that of
                  emancipating Rosa, and she was amply, thrice amply, repaid on beholding the
                  extravagant joy of the latter when the magic document was placed in her hands. Our
                  heroine next settled the hotel bill, and without waiting for the reappearance of
                  her brother Henry set out on her return home. She left a letter for him, however,
                  with the cashier, in which she simply stated her intentions, and extended to him
                  some sisterly advice concerning courage and patriotism.
               Before night fell she was nearly one hundred miles on her way to her father's
                  home, the celebrated Palmetto Plantation, on the banks of the Savannah river. All
                  along the road she met with the same excitement and confusion as she had left in
                  Philadelphia. At every station anxious crowds would besiege the train and ask a
                  thousand vain questions concerning the new and the impending war; and until she
                  entered Southern territory she was everywhere greeted by the display of the
                  national flag, or at least some makeshift for it, for the reader doubtless
                  remembers what a sudden scarcity of bunting arose from the unprecedented demand
                  for that material by the patriotic.
               After passing through the most northern counties of Maryland, however, Eleanor
                  lost sight altogether of the Stars and Stripes. As though swayed by one universal
                  frenzy, the inhabitants now exhibited none but State flags, or nondescript
                  banners, made by ambitious and inventive geniuses who hoped to see their various
                  designs adopted as the grand standard for the opening rebellion. Though pained to
                  the soul by this, Eleanor Poindexter was possessed of discretion enough to remain
                  a silent spectator of the violent scenes by which she found herself continually
                  surrounded.
               Upon arriving in Richmond our heroine was
                  surprised to find a telegraphic dispatch from her brother Henry awaiting her
                  arrival. Henry was aware that she would most likely stop at a certain hotel there,
                  and thither he had directed the dispatch. It must have passed her on the road not
                  three hours before, as it had been received only that morning. It was a request
                  that she should stop in Richmond until the next mail brought her a letter from
                  Philadelphia. Eleanor promptly returned a message, inquiring of the cashier at the
                  Continental Hotel, Philadelphia, whether Mr. Henry Poindexter was still there or
                  had started home. An answer came in due time that he had hastily set out on
                     his return! The same train, therefore, that would bring the letter
                  referred to would bring also her dastard brother, and now she became fearful of
                  him, for she knew him to be of a bitter and relentless temperament and he had
                  manifested a most suspicious alacrity to overtake her and also to conceal his
                  movement.
               Originally our heroine had intended to stop a few days in Richmond to visit some
                  relations residing in the city; but now she quickly altered her intention, and
                  taking the next train south she hurried homeward, and succeeded in reaching
                  Palmetto Plantation without being overtaken by her brother.
               As might be expected her father was amazed upon beholding his daughter thus back
                  full two months before he had expected her, and unaccompanied by her brother, to
                  whom he had given the strictest injunctions to travel with and protect her. His
                  amazement was increased, too, when he learned that Eleanor had journeyed all the
                  way from Philadelphia attended only by Rosa; and the incensed father plied our
                  heroine with a thousand varied questions, to all of which she replied simply and
                  truthfully, seeking neither to conceal nor aggravate her brother's dastardly
                  conduct. She wisely said nothing, however, respecting the telegram that reached
                  her at Richmond, on account of her father's anger; and for the same reason, and
                  also because Mr. Poindexter was an intensely pro-slavery man, she remained silent
                  about Rosa's emancipation.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               ELEANOR IN TROUBLE.
               ON the afternoon on which our heroine reached home, her father was obliged to ride
                  some distance across the country to attend to an important matter of business.
                  Eleanor was exceedingly sorry for this, because she was fearful that each
                  succeeding hour would bring her brother, and of him she had, since leaving
                  Richmond, conceived an inexplicable yet terrible dread which all her efforts were
                  unavailing to shake off. One fact, too, that added a degree of intensity to this
                  dread was the absence of her mother, who was spending a few days at the house of a
                  friend in Savannah. Eleanor's only hope rested on the continued non-arrival of
                  Henry, and, to judge from the closeness of his pursuit, this was but frail.
               The next day Henry's sister was sitting at the window of her chamber, from which
                  an uninterrupted view of the country could be had for miles. As she sat thus,
                  gazing forth upon the luxuriance of the scenery, she could not help thinking how
                  soon it might be desolated should the war, which was now fairly opened, be carried
                  to the bitter extremity.
               "Oh," said she, in low tones of soliloquy, "how awful is the contemplation of such
                  a future! Sword and fire will devastate fairer scenes than this. Sons, torn from
                  dependent mothers, will be ruthlessly slaughtered! Husbands, dragged from their
                  wives and little ones, will be tumbled lifeless into the yawning burying-trenches
                  of distant battle-fields! Families now united and happy will then be broken up and
                  scattered abroad, never to gather again around the same hearthstone! All the
                  landmarks of society will be washed away in a deluge of blood! Such, such, alas!
                  must be the result!"
               Eleanor closed her eyes as though to shut out the scene of misery and desolation
                  her fancy so vividly portrayed to her, and a shudder thrilled through her whole
                  frame. Alas, how fearfully true has that picture of Eleanor's prophetic
                  imagination become! Upon the Moloch-altar of Treason every family in the
                  Confederate States has been forced to offer up its first-born, ay, and its
                  youngest also. Such a repulsive scene, though as yet it had no existence in fact,
                  was more than our tenderly-nurtured heroine could endure, and, starting up, she
                  glanced far out over the country, upon which the bright sun was smiling so
                  brightly, to dispel the delusion.
               As she did so her quick eye caught sight of a person riding up the shaded avenue
                  toward the mansion. A full view of the new-comer could only be had at certain
                  intervals, where the trees forming the avenue were not so luxuriant in their
                  foliage as usual, and through one of these Eleanor directed her anxious gaze.
                  Whether actuated by the same curiosity as herself, our heroine knew not, but,
                  directly in the interval through which she was gazing, the stranger slackened his
                     animal's mal's pace in order to glance
                  up at the casement of Miss Poindexter's room.
               Those handsome upturned features, wreathed as they were in a meaning smile, were
                  her brother's, and Eleanor grew faint at the discovery. Her feelings belonged to
                  that class of emotions, inexplicable in themselves, but yet tenaciously holding
                  their place when once possessing the mind; and, startling as it may appear, she
                  actually found herself wishing for a weapon. It would, however, be an injustice on
                  our part to fail to record the fact that our heroine most strenuously exerted
                  herself to cast from her this repulsive feeling. But the more she endeavored to do
                  so the deeper hold did it take upon her. For her to display it, however, would be
                  to place herself on a level lower even than that occupied by Henry himself, and so
                  she quickly resolved to face the latter.
               In pursuance of this resolution, she descended promptly to the supper-room when
                  the tea-bell rang, and took her place at the table, at which it became her duty to
                  preside.
               To her astonishment her brother did not present himself, and in consequence,
                  besides herself, there were only Freddy and Mary Poindexter, a younger brother and
                  sister, to keep her company. After the conclusion of the meal, she made inquiries
                  concerning Henry, and learned that shortly after arriving home he had set forth to
                  join his father. This intelligence, while it relieved our heroine of her anxiety
                  in one point of view, served only to increase it in another. A mere desire to see
                  his father could not have actuated Henry to a long, exhausting ride after just
                  completing a forced journey, and there was no matter of sufficient importance to
                  demand so speedy an interview, for Mr. Poindexter was to return the next day. The
                  only interpretation, therefore, which presented itself to our heroine, as the
                  correct one, was that her brother wished to say something to her father about the
                  events that had caused her to so hastily return home. Yet why could he not await
                  the coming of her father?
               For once, in her life, Eleanor was obliged to acknowledge to herself an
                  overweening curiosity as to the reason for her brother's extra journey. Until his
                  return this curiosity, however, could not be satisfied, and so naught was left her
                  but to conjecture, which in truth, we must add, she did not cease to do until the
                  moment she beheld her father and brother coming up the avenue toward the house
                  arm-in-arm. Upon Henry's features she noted the same half-satisfied, half-menacing
                  smile that rested thereon the day previous, while upon her father's she noted a
                  calm sternness more terrible than the fiercest frown.
               "Eleanor," said Mr. Poindexter, scarcely parting his tightly compressed lips, and
                  refusing the kiss which his loving daughter proffered him, "I wish to see you in
                  the library immediately!"
               Eleanor stood like one petrified, and gazed after her father and brother, as the
                  two passed on to the apartment referred to, with emotions that neither pen nor
                  pencil could truly depict.
               Robert Poindexter had always loved his children dearly, and especially Eleanor,
                  who, whenever he left home or returned, was always the first to receive his kiss.
                  His strange conduct, therefore, on the present occasion was the more inexplicable,
                  and was rendered more offensively personal to our heroine by the following
                  incident: as he reached the hall-way that traversed the middle of the mansion,
                  Freddy and Mary, his two youngest children, who had in playful glee concealed
                  themselves here, bounded from their ambush with merry shouts of welcome and made
                  him prisoner. Bending down he embraced and saluted each of them in a loving
                  manner, and then releasing them, turned and somewhat impatiently beckoned Eleanor
                  to follow him.
               Already had the scalding tears, springing from our heroine's heaving bosom, begun
                  to course down her cheeks, but the last gesture of her father, accompanied by that
                  unparental expression of countenance, instantly dammed the torrent, which, thus
                  suddenly arrested in its flow, chafed within fair Eleanor's breast like a
                  tempestuous sea. Conscious of her innocence of any crime, and out to the heart by
                  her father's uninquiring displeasure, the proud girl dashed away every tear from
                  her bright eyes, and then hastened to obey the imperative order of her parent.
                  Entering the library, she stepped with quiet dignity to the corner of a rosewood
                  book-case, against which she partially leaned for support, while Mr. Poindexter
                  closed and locked the door. Henry had gone to one of the windows, and stood
                  thereat, looking carelessly out, or rather merely affecting to do so. He kept his
                  face averted from his sister, which fact the latter was not slow to notice.
               "Eleanor," commenced our heroine's father, coming forward and placing a chair near
                  her, "be seated. I have something of importance to say to you. Here, Henry!" he
                  continued, addressing his son, "sit you here by me."
               Young Poindexter hastened to obey, but in taking the proffered seat, with a
                  seemingly unintentional carelessness, moved it so that it would only partially
                  face Eleanor.
               "I thank you, papa," said the latter, in reply to her father, "but, with your
                  pleasure, I prefer to stand where I am."
               The paleness that overspread Eleanor's lovely features as she spoke, and the
                  tremor in her tones, were not caused by fear, but by her wounded feelings. Her
                  parent's treatment was a thorn driven into a tender heart, and each moment it
                  rankled deeper and became more painful.
               "I wish you to be seated, Eleanor," answered Mr. Poindexter, adding a fresh degree
                  of sternness to his manner.
               Eleanor bowed and stepped forward to the chair that was set for her. Instead,
                  however, of immediately seating herself thereon she moved it from where it stood
                  to a spot directly in front of her cowardly brother, who could not conceal his
                  surprise, that found expression in a perceptible start.
               Our heroine felt perfectly assured that she owed her harsh treatment by her father
                  directly to her brother, and in the scene which was about to ensue she determined
                  to have the dastard at least to face her.
               "Eleanor," said Mr. Poindexter, fastening his eyes upon his daughter, "I have
                  received an account of you from your brother Henry that has angered me beyond
                  anything I have heard of for many a year, and from which you must satisfactorily
                  clear yourself before you can again be instated in my favor."
               
               Eleanor thought she partially suspected what the offense really was, and, as her
                  conscience assured her that she was right, she felt calm, and perfectly convinced
                  that she could prove the correctness of her conduct by the force of her argument.
                  Little, however, did she dream of the snare that had been so adroitly set around
                  and sprung upon her by Henry.
               "Pray, dear papa," she therefore replied, "what have I done thus to incur such
                  cutting, and, I may add, such undeserved treatment as you have just bestowed upon
                  me without even asking a single question?"
               "Can it be!" exclaimed Mr. Poindexter, in tones of impatient anger, "that you,
                  Eleanor, whom I have had educated with such care, and nurtured so tenderly, should
                  now, instead of confessing what you have done and asking my forgiveness, seek to
                  prevaricate?"
               "Your words astonish me, my dear papa!" exclaimed Eleanor, "I prevaricate! About
                  what? Did I not inform you truthfully why I returned home after being deserted by
                  Henry here, to whom, I do not doubt, I owe your displeasure?"
               Mr. Poindexter silently regarded his daughter with apparent perplexity for a few
                  moments, and then resumed:
               "Eleanor, when I, at your reiterated desire sent you on your Northern tour with
                  your brother Henry, I intended it to be one of pleasure in each other's
                  companionship. You remember I told you, distinctly, that I did not wish you to
                  form any permanent acquaintances in the North, most especially of the opposite
                  sex, as I wished you at the proper time to wed some Southern gentleman, a man in
                  whose breast love for the South and her institutions should be paramount. With
                  this restriction I left you entirely free as to the person of your choice."
               "And I did not disobey you, dear papa!" exclaimed our heroine, with a start, for
                  she saw from her father's words and tones how fierce and uncontrollable his anger
                  would become should he learn at the moment of her action in regard to Rosa. She
                  saw, also, that her cowardly and vindictive brother had hatched up some tale
                  against her for the sake of covering up his craven conduct in deserting her, or
                  for some other and worse motive.
               "Oh, my dear sister!" suddenly ejaculated Henry at this instant, with an air of
                  hypocritical astonishment that would have deceived the shrewdest observer, "how
                  can you say that and hope to be believed? Did you not on several occasions
                  accompany Mr. Drayton, who is a well-known Philadelphia abolitionist, to various
                  places of amusement and also out driving?"
               "Yes," replied Eleanor, fixing her flashing eyes upon her brother, who quailed
                  not, alas! in his villainy, "but you always knew of it. And, besides, he was so
                  gentlemanly and courteous and attentive, while you were always away either at the
                  club-house or the academy. But even if I did allow Mr. Drayton's visits I intended
                  no permanent acquaintance with him, for, though I could enjoy his company as a
                  passing friend, I could never, even with papa's permission, accept him as a
                  suitor."
               "Henry," said Mr. Poindexter, turning to his son, "as this is the first time you
                  have seen your sister since your return, just narrate in full the account you gave
                  me; and you, Eleanor, refute it if you can, which I hope you can and will."
               "It pains me to do so," rejoined Henry, with a fresh display of hypocrisy, "but my
                  duty to you, father, and to Eleanor herself, demands that I should—not to mention
                  the utter necessity of my own vindication."
               Our heroine's proud spirit was now fully roused, and a smile of scorn and disdain
                  flitted upon her pale features as her brother proceeded. Yet, notwithstanding his
                  outrageous falsifying, she retained her silence to the end of his narrative, in
                  which he accused her of the most unbecoming conduct with Mr. Drayton, who, by a
                  strange coincidence, had taken passage in the same train Southward as she had.
               He plausibly accounted for his apparent desertion of Eleanor by saying that the
                  mob had already started upstairs in search of him, and that, fearful if they
                  reached the room he was in with her at the crisis that they would maltreat her on
                  his account, he and his friend rushed down to meet the ruffians after leaving her
                  his best weapon, the revolver, in case the ruse should prove unavailing. With
                  naught but his bowie-knife he had hewed his way through the cut-throats, followed
                  by his friend, and had succeeded in drawing them away in another direction. After
                  flying and fighting for several squares, he and his friend were finally overtaken.
                  In the confusion that ensued the latter was most likely killed, while he, slipping
                  up a dark alley and leaping several fences, made his escape without much injury.
                  He had been unable, owing to the excitement in the city, to return to the hotel
                  for two whole days, and when he did he was horrified by finding that Eleanor and
                  Mr. Drayton were gone.
               He could not certainly ascertain that they went in company, or else he would have
                  sought out Drayton to the ends of the earth and taken his heart's blood, but they
                  certainly left the city in the same southward bound train.
               He had then instantly telegraphed to Richmond, asking his sister, who could not
                  yet have reached there, to wait for his arrival. Instead of complying, however,
                  she had immediately hurried away. On the books of the hotel where she stopped he
                  found Mr. Drayton's name entered as arriving on the selfsame day.
                  This fact could be proved simply by referring to the book itself.
               Such conduct he thought very unlady-like, besides being unsisterly. In conclusion,
                  he begged of Eleanor to acknowledge her fault and seek her father's forgiveness.
                  As for himself he had already forgiven her, for he loved her too deeply to do
                  otherwise.
               Several times during the recital of this base concoction our heroine, with the hot
                  blood mounting to her temples, was on the point of starting to her feet and giving
                  her vile brother the lie direct, but as many times she sank back, overcome and
                  appalled by his heartless conduct. He had evidently, however, and somewhat to
                  Eleanor's relief, heard nothing of Rosa's emancipation, for if he had he would
                  most assuredly have imparted the fact to her father, whose already excessive wrath
                  would in that case scarcely have retained bounds.
               In his anxiety to convince his father of his sincerity and truthfulness Henry
                  Poindexter rose from his chair as he
                  concluded, And, stepping to Eleanor, actually took her hand, and was about to
                  implore her, in language that he had well studied beforehand, to acknowledge her
                  guilt and obtain her father's forgiveness. Instantly as she felt his touch,
                  however, Eleanor sprang to her feet, and, pushing him away from her, eyed him with
                  a look of the most contemptuous loathing and scorn, as she exclaimed in bitter
                  accents:
               "Away, foul, perjured man! Infamous creatures who, for no greater reasons than to
                  cover up a cowardly act and his own neglect, would not hesitate to blast a
                  sister's character; to tear asunder the ties of love which bind a father to his
                  child; to bring the gray hairs of the one with sorrow to the grave, and crush the
                  heart and reputation of the other beneath a load of infamy! Touch me not, hideous
                  reptile! The puff-adder rather would I call brother than you! Away! touch me
                  not!"
               And the beautiful girl, almost insane with rage, sprang back several paces and
                  stood gazing with burning eyes upon the brother, whom she well styled "hideous
                  reptile."
               Henry's calculations had included some such crisis as this, and he had accordingly
                  schooled himself to meet it.
               "Oh, father," he exclaimed, in broken accents well assumed, "Eleanor, I fear, has
                  lost her reason! None other than a maniac would have conducted herself for the
                  last few weeks as she has done! Alas, I fear that monster Drayton has thrown his
                  blighting spell upon our dear, sweet Eleanor!"
               Mr. Poindexter was a man of impulse rather than reason. The first casual glance at
                  a matter, if it seemed to him at the time to be correct, would decide his opinion,
                  and from that nothing could hardly shake him. Therefore he was overbearing and
                  unreasonable. His son, knowing his exact disposition, had carefully prepared every
                  point of his vile story, and imparted it to him with every art which deceit could
                  suggest to carry his point. So complete was the statement, and so well hung too,
                  that Mr. Poindexter had immediately credited it, formed his opinion at once, and
                  condemned his daughter. This was why he repulsed her so sternly upon returning
                  from his journey across the country. As a natural result, when what he chose to
                  call her guilt was brought so decisively home to her, he expected her to fall upon
                  her knees and beg his pardon. But a contrary result he never dreamed of, and
                  consequently, when he beheld Eleanor's fierce repulse to her accuser, he concluded
                  that she was guilty and sought to save herself by a display or anger.
               Henry's deeply studied remark, however, touched a chord in his father's heart that
                  partially thrilled with mercy toward Eleanor, and he instantly shifted half the
                  culpability from her to Drayton. His duty, however, he thought was plainly
                  indicated to him.
               "What have you to say, Eleanor, to what you have heard?" asked he, in tones much
                  softened as he saw his child's tearless, speechless anguish.
               "That all Henry has uttered," replied our heroine, unfalteringly, "is a vile
                  fabrication, built up for some sinister purpose of his own on one or two distorted
                  and misrepresented facts! I call Heaven to witness its falsity! Beyond what you
                  heard from me concerning Mr. Drayton, I know nothing! If he came south in the same
                  train that I did, I am not aware of it! If he put up at the same hotel in
                  Richmond, I never knew it. I never saw him there!"
               "Did you not receive a telegram in Richmond from Henry?" asked Mr. Poindexter.
               "I did," replied Eleanor, "but it asked me to wait for a letter, and not for him.
                  In it he never mentioned his coming!"
               "Why did you not tell me concerning it when you first saw me?"
               "Because you were just leaving home, and there was consequently no time to do so.
                  I say again that I answered truthfully all the questions you then asked me."
               What rejoinder Mr. Poindexter would have made to his daughter, or what new
                  hypocritical exclamation was ready on the lips of the villain Henry, it is alike
                  impossible to say, for just at this moment the voice of Mrs. Poindexter, who had
                  just returned home, was heard without, calling to her husband to open the
                  door.
               Eleanor's father drew the bolt, and the next moment our heroine's mother stood
                  surveying the scene before her with astonishment. She had divested herself of her
                  bonnet and traveling shawl, and held in her hand a paper which was rolled up.
               "What may this mean?" she asked, handing the document to her husband, who was
                  nearest, "have you been giving Eleanor permission to do this, Robert? And,
                  by-the-by, why are you home so soon, Henry and Eleanor—you were to stay two months
                  yet."
               Had Mrs. Poindexter known what had just passed, she would never have added fuel to
                  the flame by introducing the subject she thus so innocently did. But it was too
                  late! She had sprung a fearful mine beneath the feet of Eleanor, whom she loved so
                  dearly, from which the latter could not be rescued.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               A STARTLING EXPOSURE.
               MR. POINDEXTER, upon taking the paper from the hand of his wife, noticed before
                  unrolling it its new appearance, as though it had just come from the lawyer's
                  office. As may be supposed it was not long ere its contents were spread before his
                  eager eyes, and in a moment he scanned their purport. Livid with rage did his
                  countenance become, and striding to his daughter he seized her roughly by the arm,
                  and, placing the document before her, hissingly exclaimed:
               "See, base girl! this is one fruit of your association with that vile abolitionist
                  Drayton, and what the next may be Heaven only knows! You emancipate and forever
                  declare free your slave Rosa, believing that she has as much right to be free as
                  yourself! Yes, yes! so she has, for you should be the inmate of a mad-house or a
                  penitentiary! And you shall be till your aberrated reason comes back to you! You
                  shall be!"
               And the enraged father, crumpling up the deed of Rosa's emancipation, thrust it
                  into his daughter's face, and shook her at the same time so fiercely as to loosen
                  even the hold he had taken of her.
               Without a word Eleanor, so brutally and senselessly used by her inconsiderate
                  father, bounded across the space that separated her from her mother, and flinging
                  one arm about the latter, said:
               "Dearest mother, will you protect me from this violence until I can prove my
                  innocence, or at least until my father can treat me somewhat better than a
                  brute?"
               "Silence!" thundered Mr. Poindexter, striding toward Eleanor, "you prove your
                  innocence! You cannot, dare not attempt it! at least of this, base girl! Here is
                  proof positive of your commission of a crime for which alone I would disown you
                  forever! for which alone I ought to take your miserable existence!"
               This fearfully harsh language, accompanied as it was by menacing gestures, was
                  more than the poor, persecuted girl could endure, and, losing control of herself
                  entirely, she tore herself loose from her mother's embracing arms, flung herself
                  wildly upon her knees before her father, and, in a paroxysm of grief,
                  exclaimed:
               "Oh, my father, if your heart has become so hardened as to insult me thus, to
                  condemn me of such heinous offenses as I never dreamed of, take my life! If you
                  ought to take my miserable existence, here is my heart. Strike home! strike home!
                  and with my dying breath I will proclaim my innocence of the charges laid against
                  me by the reptile who calls himself my brother! He left me in the midst of danger
                  to save himself; left me to death, or what other fate he did not wait to see! And
                  you, my father, on whose strong arm I thought to lean for protection, you, without
                  so much as hearing me in my own defense, threaten me with death! I fear you not! I
                  fear no death! Strike here! Strike here, man! Here, father, plant your unjust
                  vengeful steel!"
               With these wildly spoken words our distracted heroine, striking her palpitating
                  bosom, sank forward, with hysterical sobs, until her disheveled tresses lay about
                  his feet.
               In another moment her bewildered, yearning mother sprang to her, and, raising her
                  upon her feet, said to her husband:
               "For shame, Robert! Have you no heart? You have killed our Eleanor! Here, Henry,"
                  she continued, to her son, "come, take your sister's arm, and assist me to place
                  her upon the sofa."
               "Oh, no, no!" gasped Eleanor, in tones of horror, "do not let his hand come upon
                  me! Sooner would I feel the hand of Satan himself! This is all his work! Oh, God!
                  I am dying; forgive my enemies—my father—my brother!"
               Nature was exhausted, and, with the meek words of forgiveness on her pale lips,
                  Eleanor, thinking that she really was expiring, sank swooning upon the sofa to
                  which her mother had just gotten her.
               Robert Poindexter, as he beheld this sad result, and as the angelic words of his
                  child rang in his ears asking the forgiveness of Heaven upon him, his feelings
                  revolted, and he fell on her neck, and covered her cold, marble features with
                  kisses, upbraiding himself and son the meanwhile for causing her death.
               The vile Henry—whose real design has yet to be made known—conscious of the wicked
                  part he had taken in the sad affair, stood aloof, and did not so much as place a
                  finger upon his sister, fearful that if he did the act would recall the pure soul
                  to the inanimate form to curse him. It was necessary, however, that the deceptive
                  vail which he had drawn over his parent's perception should remain intact. With
                  this object, therefore, he hastened away to obtain some restoratives, with which
                  he soon returned. These were lavishly applied, and manifested their power by
                  shortly bringing Eleanor back to consciousness.
               When our heroine had fully recovered she turned to her father, and in reply to a
                  question of his she said, in the tones of one whose determination was irrevocably
                  taken:
               "Father, I freely forgive you, but I can not longer stay beneath a roof where I
                  can never again enjoy any peace of mind. I am my own mistress, a fact which both
                  you and Henry seem to ignore, and I shall therefore use my undoubted rights."
               Though deeply sorry for what he had done, Mr. Poindexter's ungovernable temper
                  would not allow him to submit to opposition, or to be taken to task even by
                  Eleanor, and in a moment his anger was rekindled. And as though fate had
                  determined to bring on another and final crisis, Rosa, who had been absent on an
                  errand for her mistress, came bounding into the library in search of her.
               "Here, you insolent wench!" exclaimed Mr. Poindexter, "Stop, why didn't you tell
                  me that your mistress had given you your freedom?"
               "Because, Massa Poindexter," answered Rosa, somewhat taken aback, "you wasn't
                  here. But I'ze agoin' to save up my wages an' buy my mother from you, Massa, so
                  she'll be free, too."
               "You are, are you," hissed Eleanor's
                  father, in a fearful rage, "take that for your impudence;" and striking the
                  inoffensive slave a heavy blow in the face, he sent her stumbling and reeling
                  across the room.
               Eleanor's temper, though slow to rouse, was not unlike her father's when it was
                  roused, and this act of Mr. Poindexter stirred his daughter's very soul. Springing
                  to her feet, she exclaimed:
               "Father, do not repeat that! You had no legal right to strike Rosa, even when she
                  was a slave! And now that I have made her free I myself even have no right to do
                  so!"
               "Free! free!" thundered the furious man, "I'll flay the wench within a hair's
                  breadth of her life!"
               As he spoke Eleanor's father seized a whip that chanced to be near at hand, and
                  bounded toward Rosa with the intention of putting his threat into execution.
               In an instant, however, and even as the upraised lash was about to descend, the
                  passionate father was transfixed with horror. Over poor, crouching Rosa stood
                  Eleanor Poindexter, her eyes burning with intense fire, her cheeks ashy pale, and
                  her disordered tresses floating carelessly about her shoulders. In her hand she
                  firmly held the revolver so incontinently dropped by her dastard brother in the
                  Philadelphia hotel. The hammer of the weapon was thrown back, the nipple capped,
                  the muzzle pressed hard against Eleanor's own bosom, and the lovely girl's finger
                  firmly embracing the fatal trigger.
               "One stroke," she said, in tones of frightful composure, between her compressed
                  lips, "and as there is a God in heaven I die, forced to the act by your insane
                  rage and injustice"!
               The stern, self-devoting, and unyielding heroism of his daughter overcame Mr.
                  Poindexter, when everything else failed, and as he stood trembling at her
                  desperate and perilous situation—for a nervous twitch of her finger, no matter how
                  slight, would end her existence—he admired her bravery.
               Flinging from him the whip, he exclaimed: "Away with your weapon, Eleanor; you
                  have conquered!"
               Without another word he strode from the library to his own private room, where he
                  shut himself up during the rest of the day, refusing entrance even to his
                  wife.
               Not until her father had entirely disappeared from sight did our heroine remove
                  the deadly weapon with which she had in her excitement threatened her own life,
                  and then, calmly restoring it to the concealment from which she had taken it, she
                  bade Rosa to rise.
               "Mother," she said, stooping and picking up the deed of emancipation that lay
                  crushed and torn on the floor where her father had thrown it, "how came you to
                  have possession of this document?"
               "I found it,"' replied Mrs. Poindexter, "upon the dressing-bureau in my room. I
                  could not tell what to make of it, I saw your signature, and still I thought it
                  was nothing more than a joke on your part, until I noticed the legal seal stamped
                  upon it. I immediately brought it down stairs, not aware even that you had
                  returned, and imprudently enough brought about the terrible scene that has just
                  been enacted. But, Eleanor, my dearest child, what is the matter? You carrying a
                  deadly weapon! You must explain all to me, for everything is a mystery to me. This
                  loathing, too, of your brother Henry, so unnatural—what means it all?"
               "Come, my dear mother," replied Eleanor, passing her arm about Mrs. Poindexter and
                  moving toward the door, "let us go to your room. I have much to impart to you; my
                  heart is well-nigh broken. However, one moment, I must speak to Rosa! Rosa,"
                  continued the fair girl, leaving her mother just outside the door and returning to
                  the still frightened mulattress, "did you give that book to Miss St. Aubyn?"
               "Yes, Miss Eleanor," replied Rosa, "an' as I was comin' back from there I met a
                  genl'man, who poked this letter into my hand an' told me to give it to you right
                  away."
               Rosa spoke in so low a tone that Henry, who stood with his back toward her, could
                  not hear what she said. And even had he been watching her he could not have
                  detected her slipping a small white envelope to her mistress, so quickly and
                  adroitly was the act performed.
               "Very well, Rosa," answered Eleanor, taking the envelope and concealing it, "you
                  can go down to the quarters now and see your mother."
               "Thank you, Miss Eleanor," replied Rosa, quickly comprehending that the permission
                  thus given was a partial order, and yet unable to perceive the reason for it. She
                  knew that something terrible had occurred, but what it was she dared not inquire.
                  So, courtesying to Eleanor, she hastened away to the quarters.
               Our heroine was soon closeted with her mother, and in her maternal ear she poured
                  forth the full burden of her sorrow. Mrs. Poindexter soothed her daughter, and
                  assured her that if all the world should turn against her still would she love and
                  cherish her.
               "God in his infinite goodness bless you, dear mother!" wept Eleanor. "Your love,
                  pure and holy, shines forth like a bright, beautiful star in the heavens where all
                  else is so dark!"
               "I have heard," said Mrs. Poindexter, after some further conversation, "from
                  veritable sources, that Henry has become connected with bad characters. If it is
                  so, Eleanor, and I fear it is, you must forgive him and help me to save him."
               Our heroine gently shook her head, and kissing her mother said, as she turned to
                  go to her own chamber:
               "Forgive me, dearest mamma, perhaps I am rather too harsh, but I will seek repose
                  and we will talk again to-morrow."
               When Eleanor had gained the solitude of the neat little room, from whose window
                  she had first witnessed the return of that brother who had laid such a deep,
                  mysterious, and unaccountable plot against her, she opened the envelope that had
                  been given to Rosa for her by the strange gentleman.
               "Who can have sent it? What can it be about?" were questions that Eleanor asked
                  herself as she unfolded the missive. To answer the first there was not even an
                  initial, but to the second the following contents fully replied:
               "MISS POINDEXTER—Your brother, Henry Poindexter, has conspired against you for the
                  most vile and sinister purpose. Having become associated with certain bad men, he
                  has involved himself in overwhelming debt. One of the villains, a neighbor of your
                  father's, and a gambler, ay, worse, a murderer, James L. Santee, is Henry's principal creditor. In fact, I
                  may say he is his only creditor, for, with the purpose of using your brother as a
                  tool against you, he has purchased all the claims against the latter, or nearly
                  all, and he has demanded, as a condition of release, that Henry shall influence
                  your father to force you to an alliance with him. Your brother, dastard as he is,
                  has consented to become the creature, the contemptible but powerful tool, of the
                  vile Santee. You may disbelieve me, but as I hope for salvation I utter only the
                  truth, and you will soon have proof of it.
               "But fear nothing, I will protect you and warn you of every movement. Be discreet,
                  be brave! I need not, however, urge you to bravery, for your heroic conduct, when
                  your brother deserted you in such a cowardly manner at the Continental Hotel in
                  Philadelphia, satisfies me that you are a true heroine.
               "Above all things, keep this letter a secret even from your best
                     friends. The snare is deeply laid for you, but again I say, 'fear
                  not.'"———
               "Do I dream, or am I bereft of reason?" murmured our heroine, after perusing the
                  mysterious letter again and again, and pressing her hands to her temples. "My
                  brother! oh, my brother!" she continued, in agonized tones, "who would have
                  thought you capable of such infamy? Alas, this warning is too true! But who can
                  the author be? Surely it cannot be that Drayton penned these lines? Stop, I have a
                  note of his; I will compare the two!"
               With trembling fingers, Eleanor ransacked some papers in her trunk, among which
                  she presently discovered a note, that she had received from Mr. Drayton while in
                  Philadelphia, excusing himself on one occasion from attending her to an exhibition
                  on account of sudden indisposition; but unfortunately this had not been written by
                  Drayton, but by an attendant, which fact was disclosed at the bottom of the billet
                  by the line "per J. C. E."
               "It is preposterous, at any rate," soliloquised Eleanor, "to suppose Mr. Drayton,
                  a man of such wealth and such refined literary culture should follow me home, and
                  in a day learn all about a conspiracy which must have begun ere Henry and I left
                  home. I was only introduced to him in Philadelphia. Why should I be so silly? The
                  question, therefore, again arises, Who can be this mysterious friend who has
                  discovered to me such a plot against my welfare and happiness? Heaven bless you,
                  kind stranger, whoever you may be!"
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               A GLIMPSE AT TWO VILLAINS.
               AT the date of the opening of our life-narrative, the Southern rebellion was
                  bursting into full and deadly bloom, and lading every pure breeze and air of
                  Heaven with its noxious odor. Designing, wicked, and unscrupulous men were
                  immeasurably gratified at the coming of a reign of blood and terror, for under a
                  popular, delusive agitation, they foresaw their opportunities for giving full sway
                  to their wickedness. Like buzzards they scented the smell of the contest from
                  afar, and were impatient to fatten on the carrion feast.
               To this class belonged James L. Santee and Henry Poindexter, the former, however,
                  being by far the latter's superior, both in experience and abilities, although
                  Henry was by no means unaccomplished in villainy.
               Young Poindexter, naturally wayward and headstrong, had, several years before,
                  fallen in with Santee, who, having purchased the plantation next to Robert
                  Poindexter's, was admitted into the society of planters, and rated at half a
                  million. The connection had resulted in Henry's ruin, and Santee soon conceived
                  the diabolical plot of compelling his victim to crown his infamy by forcing or
                  maneuvering a marriage between himself and the innocent, beautiful Eleanor
                  Poindexter. It had taken Santee some time to arrange everything satisfactorily
                  before he made the proposition to Henry, but, with consummate hypocrisy, he at
                  last accomplished this, and finally brought Henry to the dilemma of choosing
                  between his own and his sister's ruin, for a marriage with Santee could scarcely
                  amount to more. He had well judged the character he was so adroitly manipulating,
                  for no sooner was the difficulty presented to Henry, than he at once selected
                  Eleanor as the victim in place of himself.
               Instead of continuing the terrible story in our own words, however, we shall place
                  before the reader a scene that occurred in a private room of Santee's palatial
                  mansion, on the evening of the day on which the events narrated in tie last
                  chapter took place.
               An elegant inlaid card-table stood between the two occupants of the
                  apartment—James L. Santee and Henry Poindexter—on which was the professional
                  gambler's usual set-out, viz., a pack, of cards, some ivory counters, a decanter
                  of spirits, and two richly cut glass goblets.
               "Well, Harry, my boy," exclaimed Santee, in tones of rough pleasantry, "you're in
                  deuced good luck to-night! All the aces three games hand running, which just rakes
                  in a cool thousand for you! Spending money for a week or two, eh? I've had enough
                  for to-night, so let's fill up and drink!"
               The glasses jingled together, the rich liquor gurgled down the two worthy
                  companions' throats, and Santee resumed:
               
               "Now, Harry, I'm ready to hear what progress you've made in the siege. I hope you
                  did not have to beat another Continental retreat. By the by, Harry, that was
                  rather bad. When Jenkins ran up stairs, frightened out of his wits, to tell you
                  the mob was going to hang you, there was no demonstration whatever, except their
                  infernal yelling and hooting for their dirty, drooping Stars and Stripes. I was in
                  the bar-room at the time."
               "Well," replied Poindexter, with a laugh, "you see I thought discretion was a good
                  deal better than valor on that particular occasion, and so I left."
               "But I ought to challenge you, Harry, for leaving our pearl behind, to be snapped
                  up may be by that abolition 
                     scroundrel
                     scoundrel
                   Drayton. He was dead in love with Eleanor, and I tell you what it is, if
                  I had only got a chance at him some dark night, I would have slipped this into
                  him."
               The speaker displayed the hilt of a concealed bowie-knife.
               "He's rather crazy, that Drayton," said Henry. "He's one of these literary geese
                  who travel all about the country, cackling, and 'making notes,' as he calls it,
                  upon the habits, and manners, and customs, and political tenets, and so forth and
                  so on, of people."
               "Yes, and he's a red-hot, infernal abolitionist, too!" added Santee, "and I'm no
                  Southerner if I don't settle him quietly, if he ever happens in this
                  vicinity!"
               The concluding part of this sentence came piecemeal from between Santee's teeth,
                  as he ground the latter together in mock rage.
               "But what about the scene this afternoon?" continued the planter, "tell me that. I
                     thought Eleanor would make a game fight of it!"
               "Well, you see," answered young Poindexter, "when I got home I found I could do a
                  good deal better than if I had overtaken Eleanor in Richmond, for father had gone
                  over to Barrington's to settle about a lot of likely niggers. So off I went
                  immediately after him, and had the good luck to find him in the exact humor. He
                  was as mad as creation at first at my leaving Sis, but I explained it all to him,
                  and then if I didn't stuff the governor, I'm a Yankee mudsill, that's all!"
               "By the time I got half through I had him pretty well roused; but at the end of my
                  yarn I had him jumping over his head; and I believe if he'd had Sis there at the
                  moment he would have hung her instanter. And then I begged for her, but still
                  advised him to make her ask his forgiveness, and then to make her marry a
                  right-striped Southron, Mr. Santee, for instance, who had told me privately that
                  he was deeply in love with Eleanor!"
               "Bravo, my boy! bravo! bravissimo!" exclaimed Santee, with a hearty laugh of
                  approval, and reaching across the table to slap the wicked brother upon the
                  shoulder. "I feel inclined to write you a clearance for that ten thousand bond
                  that I bought from Foster on your account. That was hard in you, Harry; but never
                  mind, you'll see day through it yet, my boy. But go on, I feel interested in your
                  narrative. The more I hear of Eleanor the more I desire her. Go on!"
               "Well," obeyed young Poindexter, "I had the old man just worked up right, when we
                  left Barrington's, and coming home he scowled and muttered all the way along. And
                  didn't he bless Drayton and all the rest of the abolitionists! I knew there was a
                  storm to break when we reached home; but I tell you what, Santee, I didn't expect
                  the one that did come! Whew! Lord save me if I'd ever undertake such another task
                  for double what I'm going to make by this; and it's only because I'm so bound up
                  by your friendship that I don't leave this job half done. I tell you, Santee,
                  honestly, I'm afraid we'll fail after all, for Eleanor's got more judgment and
                  grit than most women have at twice her age!"
               "Never say fail, my boy!" exclaimed the planter, in rallying accents. "Just go
                  according to my instructions, and we'll make a full, clean crop; see if we don't.
                  And then you know what depends on your success and failure!"
               "Oh, I'll carry it through, even if I fail at last!" replied the heartless
                  brother.
               "That's the right way to speak, Harry! But go on, you did not finish your story,
                  and I am anxious to hear the climax."
               "When father and I went into the house," replied Poindexter, resuming the thread
                  of his narrative, "the first one that came bounding forward to greet him—not poor
                  me, for I was in her black books—was Eleanor. You ought to have seen the look the
                  old man gave her, though, as he pushed her away from him, and jerked back his head
                  to avoid her kiss. It would have made a good scene for an artist. And you ought to
                  have heard his tone, as he ordered her into the library, to give an account of
                  herself.
               "I expected her to be frightened, but just as true as I'm here, she marched into
                  the library as stiff as you please. Then came the tempest. She talked and raved,
                  and denounced me; but then you know how father is, when he once gets an idea in
                  his head, and I had taken good care to put the right idea there. I acted my part
                  well, and had just got to the wind-up, when who should come rapping at the door
                  but mother just returned from Savannah.
               "That ruined everything!" interrupted Santee, as a shade of disappointment
                  suddenly flitted across his sinister features.
               "Oh, no, it was exactly the thing," said Henry gleefully. "When I saw her, I, like
                  you, began to give up, for mother's the only one besides me who knows how to
                  handle father. But she brought me good luck. It seems that, some day while in
                  Philadelphia, Sis had gone and emancipated Rosa, the yellow waiting-maid, and had
                  the paper regularly made out before a magistrate. The document, by some means or
                  other, had been left on mother's bureau in her room. Rosa most likely left it
                  there herself by some mistake. However, no matter how it got there, it got there,
                  and mother innocently enough brought it down to father.
               "As I said before, Santee, you know what father is. He was mad enough before, but
                  when he saw this, he went up in the most approved style. Just at this moment, too,
                  to help matters on, the wench herself came in, and father, snatching up a whip,
                  was going to give her a flogging, when Eleanor sprang forward, and, drawing a
                  revolver, stood over Rosa, and threatened father, if he struck the nigger, that
                  she would shoot herself. And she was in earnest, for she pressed the pistol to her
                  breast, and I saw the quick pulsations of her heart pushing the deadly muzzle back and forth.
               "Father was more angry than I ever saw him before, but when he saw Sis do what she
                  did he caved right in, and, throwing down the whip, left the library and I hav'nt
                  seen anything of him since."
               "Bless my soul!" exclaimed Santee, in tones of apparent ecstasy, "if Eleanor isn't
                  a heroine it to adorn the pages of a first-class romance! Now, mark you, Harry, if
                  I fail to get her, I'll come down on you as hard as I can. But if you succeed in
                  getting her for me, I'll give you a full clearance and ten thousand dollars in
                  hard cash besides."
               "I will do the best I can, Santee," replied Henry Poindexter, "and you know I
                  cannot do more. I do not see why Eleanor should not be Mrs. Santee as well as Mrs.
                  Any-body-else. That's my candid opinion."
               "Indeed, Harry," said Santee, with a leering, meaning smile, "you ought to have
                  sufficient reason for thinking that she ought rather to be Mrs.
                  Santee than Mrs. Any-body-else! But let me see!" he suddenly added, drawing forth
                  his watch, "I'm half an hour behind time for an engagement I made this morning.
                  Now, remember, Harry, don't lose your courage, and all will come out right. If
                  anything now occurs, why, you can let me know of it immediately, and in the
                  meantime, au revoir."
               Santee passed from the room, leaving Henry Poindexter, the heartless conspirator
                  against a pure and innocent sister, to finish the glass of liquor he had just
                  poured out for himself, and then to make his way home and slumber beneath the same
                  roof with Eleanor.
               Alas to what fearful turpitude can man sometimes descend! But to return to our
                  heroine.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               A MYSTERIOUS FIGURE.
               AFTER perusing several times the mysterious billet which contained the warning of
                  the base intrigue against her by Santee and her brother, our heroine cast herself
                  upon her couch and gave herself up to surmising. She asked herself how it could be
                  possible that a crime so deadly an offense against the laws of nature so terrible,
                  could even have been projected against one so innocent as herself. The fact,
                  however, she could not doubt, and so all that was left to her was to marvel at
                  Henry's turpitude. The setting sun found her musing thus painfully, and the
                  evening star had climbed so high above the horizon as to slant its gentle rays
                  down upon her pale face, ere she arose and bent her steps to the room of her
                  mother to bid the latter good-night.
               Mrs. Poindexter was alone and battled in tears when her daughter entered her
                  chamber, and in a moment the loving girl, all forgetful of her
                  own heavy troubles, wound her snowy arms about her mother's neck and cried:
               "Why do you weep, dear mother?"
               "I am mourning, my dear Eleanor," replied Mrs. Poindexter, "because I see in the
                  future nothing but sorrow and distress, not alone in our country, but also in our
                  own immediate family."
               "Let us pray, mother," was the reverently uttered answer of our heroine, "that it
                  may in both cases be averted."
               "It is useless; Eleanor, useless," said Eleanor's mother, with a prophetic despair
                  in her tones. "The bitter cup is already at our lips; we have had a sip of its
                  contents, and it will not pass away until we swallow the last drop."
               Whether it was that the fair girl participated in her mother's boding fears we
                  shall not attempt to say, but the only reply she made to the last remark, was
                  silently to press her mother closer to herself and nestle her cheek against
                  hers.
               A moment later the firm, heavy tread of Mr. Poindexter approached the chamber, and
                  our heroine wishing to avoid a fresh interview with her violent-tempered father,
                  exchanged a hurried kiss and "good-night" with her mother, and passed into an
                  adjoining room. From thence, as the night was clear and beautiful, she made her
                  way down stairs and out upon the piazza which ornamented three sides of the
                  mansion.
               As she emerged into the open air the light, cool breeze which was moving at the
                  time greatly refreshed her, and caused her to lose a degree or two of that
                  heaviness with which she had been so oppressed before leaving her chamber. The
                  scene, too, spreading out before her was certainly most romantic, for the
                  atmosphere was so fine that the gentle light that fell from the far-away stars was
                  sufficient to make objects discernible at some distance; and yet so soft was
                     this illumination that it filled the
                  spectator with that dreamy, poetical pleasure that finds its cause alone in that
                  wondrous blending of light and darkness which nature only can produce.
               Drawing a rustic, antique stool into one corner of the piazza, Eleanor seated
                  herself and directed her gaze across the lawn and through a clump of woods toward
                  the quarters of the negroes. The latter were, as it happened, holding one of those
                  peculiar prayer-meetings which have become a characteristic custom of their race.
                  The wind also set in from that point of the compass, and owing to the solemn
                  silence that reigned, our heroine could easily distinguish the tune, and
                  oftentimes the words of the wild, sad hymn of devotion that her father's slaves
                  were singing. She could distinguish, too, by the light of the flaring torches,
                  whose rays flickered and flitted through the alleys of the intervening woodland,
                  the various motions of the humble congregation. And as their weird but simple
                  vesper song floated to her ears, her own disturbed spirit was soothed, and she
                  felt almost happy.
               She was absorbed, so much so, indeed, that she did not notice the approach of a
                  tall figure that came gliding up the path until she was almost discovered. Quickly
                  shrinking, however, into the deep shadow of a clustering vine that clambered
                  luxuriantly about the corner pillar of the piazza, she succeeded in concealing her
                  presence from the new-comer, whom, as he set foot upon the topmost step, she
                  recognized at once as her brother Henry. She had previously judged that it was he,
                  for none save the members of the family, or one or two of the most intimate
                  neighbors, ever approached the house by the path referred to, which was a shorter
                  way to reach the manor than the shaded avenue. He was just returning from the
                  interview between himself and Santee, and seemed, from the slow, uncertain manner
                  in which he walked, to be painfully thinking. Pausing, for a moment, on the
                  piazza, before entering the house, he suddenly pressed one hand to his forehead,
                  while the other still remained where it had been thrust into his breast, and
                  exclaimed in a low, baited tone:
               "Possessed of a devil! Yes; yes! it must be so! Oh, Santee!"
               With these words hissingly uttered, Henry Poindexter strode into the mansion, and
                  was lost to Eleanor's view.
               Our heroine was astonished, she was amazed; and the anger that had been so justly
                  excited within her against Henry, began to waver before a feeling of pity and
                  forgiveness that his strange words awakened. She felt persuaded, although there
                  was nothing in his exclamation to justify it, that he was already the victim of
                  remorse for the harm he had worked toward her, and she experienced a pang of
                  sorrow that she had shook her head when her mother asked her assistance in saving
                  Henry. Alas! too angelic in her own nature even to conceive of wrong, she was
                  incredulous enough to think that remorse must necessarily be succeeded by
                  repentance. She resolved, therefore, on the spot, to go to Henry the next morning
                  and conquer him into loving her again as a brother should. She even repeated over
                  in her mind the words of affection that she would use to him.
               Occupied with this idea she left the shadow of the clambering vine and stepped
                  toward the same door by which Henry had gone in. As she did so she cast a passing
                  glance out over the lawn, and was considerably startled by seeing at a little
                  distance the figure of a man, who, at the same instant, seemed to have caught
                  sight of her. In a moment he slipped up to a tree and disappeared behind it, nor
                  did he leave his place of concealment until he heard our heroine shut to and
                  secure the mansion door, when quickly gaining the road, he hurried away. By his
                  strange action Eleanor was convinced that the mysterious intruder must have been
                  following her brother, and yet for what purpose she could not surmise. Had his
                  intention been one of assassination, he had, before reaching the house, ample
                  opportunities which he did not improve. If he was a neighbor, he would have been
                  accompanying instead of stealthily following Henry, and he would not, moreover,
                  have sought such hasty concealment as he did when finding his presence
                  observed.
               Upon entering the house Eleanor rang for the porter, a stout, athletic negro, and,
                  informing him of what she had seen, ordered him forth immediately to ascertain who
                  the interloper was and what might be his business. Milo hesitated not a moment,
                  but, hurrying from our heroine's presence, quickly procured a loaded gun and
                  strode out, as he thought, for an adventure; but, much to his disappointment, he
                  failed to find any one, and reluctantly returned to Eleanor with his report.
                  Praising him for his alacrity and bravery, Milo's young mistress sought her
                  chamber and prepared to pass the night. For several hours she found it impossible
                  to sleep, but at last the soothing goddess gently enthralled her senses, and she
                  sank into Nature's refreshing unconsciousness.
               When she awoke she was surprised to find the sun well up in the heavens on his
                  day's journey, and filling her airy room with his glorious beams. Springing
                  quickly from her couch, Eleanor made haste to arrange her toilet, for the morning
                  meal must have already been finished. While thus engaged a trampling of horses'
                  hoofs struck upon her ears, and going to her lattice she opened it and looked
                  forth.
               A dozen or fourteen horsemen were just riding away down the avenue, among whom she
                  recognized her father, her brother Henry, and their neighbor James Santee. These
                  three were riding together in the rear of their companions, and Santee, looking up
                  at that moment toward Eleanor's window, caught sight of our heroine ere she could
                  withdraw. He smiled, inclined his head, and raised his cap with the easy grace of
                  the perfectly accomplished gentleman. Eleanor could do no less than return the
                  salutation, but she did so hastily and then immediately drew back. Scarcely had
                  she done so when a gentle knock came to the chamber door, and, in response to her
                  reply, she heard the voice of her maid, Rosa. Stepping forward she gave admittance
                  to the latter, who, seizing her hand, kissed it affectionately, saying, as she did
                  so:
               "Oh, Missey Eleanor, I'se so glad you ain't sick! Missus Poindexter's gittin'
                  right skeered 'bout you; 'deed she is! 'se been up two times 'fore dis time an'
                  couldn't make you hyear, an' ef I hadn't
                  'a done it dis time yer mar waz a coming' up herse'f."
               "Well, hasten down to mamma, Rosa," replied Eleanor, "and tell her that I will be
                  with her immediately."
               Rosa promptly obeyed, but she had hardly delivered her message ere the subject of
                  Mrs. Poindexter's anxiety came tripping into the breakfast-room, and, embracing
                  her mother, exclaimed:
               "I am very sorry, mamma, that I should have kept you waiting, but indeed I did not
                  fall asleep until nearly daylight, and I did not awaken until ten or twelve
                  minutes ago."
               "I thought such was the cause of your non-appearance, daughter," answered
                  Eleanor's mother, caressing the lovely girl as she spoke; "and that is why I did
                  not sooner become uneasy. But, come now, you must be ready for breakfast, for it
                  is so much past the usual hour. Rosa, tell the cook to bring it in."
               Only a few minutes elapsed ere a salver was brought in containing a small silver
                  urn of fragrant Mocha, with the usual accompanying dishes and relishes. Mrs.
                  Poindexter had already breakfasted, but, to please her daughter, she partook
                  again, though very slightly. When the meal was finished, the two ladies retired to
                  the cabinet, where they were soon deeply absorbed in conversation. It was the
                  first opportunity they had had to converse since the exciting and almost tragic
                  occurrence of the previous day, and that its bearing upon our narrative may be
                  appreciated we shall record the essential points of it.
               In answer to a request of Mrs. Poindexter, our heroine narrated fully everything
                  that had taken place, from the moment of her altercation with Henry at the
                  Continental Hotel in Philadelphia up to the mysterious event of the last
                  evening.
               A great portion of this detail, as the reader is already aware, she had yesterday
                  imparted to her mother, but as she was much excited at that time the latter
                  preferred to hear it again, now that her daughter was calm and collected.
               "My dear Eleanor," said Mrs. Poindexter, after listening most attentively to the
                  recital, "under the circumstances it behooves me to impart to you certain matters
                  which have come to my ears from time to time of late. Ere proceeding, however, I
                  feel it my duty to state that, for several years back, I have noticed at certain
                  periods symptoms of insanity manifested by your brother Henry, and in no other
                  manner can I account for his unnatural behavior toward you.
               "Within a year, too, he has become connected with several bad characters about
                  here, and I have reason to believe that he has committed himself in some way so as
                  to place himself in the power of some of them. I feel well assured, also, that the
                  principal of these villains is no other than James Santee, notwithstanding that he
                  passes as such a high-toned, honorable man, and is held in such esteem by your
                  father."
               "Oh, my dear mother," exclaimed Eleanor, "I fear you may be doing Mr. Santee an
                  injustice, although I must confess that sometimes, as I have looked attentively at
                  his features, a feeling of repulse came over me. Yet this I have always set down
                  to mere whim on my part, rather than to any good cause given therefor by him.
                  Strangely enough, however, this peculiar, repulsive feeling to which I refer
                  nearly always takes possession of me when he is making himself most
                  agreeable."
               "You must be aware, Eleanor," said Mrs. Poindexter, "that Santee wishes you for
                  his wife!"
               "I have for some time suspected such to be his object, mother; but I assure you
                  such an event can never come to pass, for I do not, nor could not, love him, and I
                  have resolved several times to frankly tell him so on the first opportunity he
                  affords me."
               "Then he has not as yet proposed to yourself?"
               "Never has he breathed a syllable in that direction. Has he to any one else?"
               "He has once or twice made overtures to your father, and I am sure he has
                  favorably impressed the latter."
               "You surprise me, dear mother!"
               "Do you know, Eleanor," resumed Mrs. Poindexter after a short pause, "that he
                  followed you the next day after you set out with Henry on your tour North?"
               "No, I do not; I met him several times at the Continental Hotel in Philadelphia,
                  and met him also in other cities, but never dreamed that he followed me thither.
                  Mr. Jenkins—whose cowardice I can never forget—traveled with us to
                  Philadelphia."
               "Well, my dear, Santee not only followed you as I state, but he also endeavored,
                  in company with Henry, to overtake you on your journey homeward. And it was he who
                  dictated the telegraphic dispatch which you found waiting for you in Richmond.
                  This I learned from your father, who had it from Henry himself. In this way, too,
                  I heard of Mr. Drayton, who, it seems, made such a strong impression upon you,
                  Eleanor. Who is he?"
               "Mr. Drayton," replied our heroine, blushing somewhat at the unexpected mention of
                  the name, "is a Northern gentleman, a native of Philadelphia. He is very wealthy
                  and philanthropic, and spends nearly all his time traveling in different parts of
                  the country. Why, mamma, he is as well acquainted with the region about here as
                  you or I. His intellect and information are astonishing."
               "Well, tell me, Eleanor, was it through his persuasion that you emancipated Rosa?"
                  asked Mrs. Poindexter, half interruptingly.
               "No, my dear mamma, no!" was the quick reply. "I emancipated Rosa from my own
                  solemn conviction that she should be free; a conviction, as I have already told
                  you, that was forced upon me in an instant, like the conversion of Saul on his way
                  to Damascus. And, mother," continued our heroine in a deliberate tone, raising her
                  eyes to heaven as she spoke, "if I possessed a thousand slaves, I would free them
                  every one!"
               "God prosper and bless you for those words, my daughter!" cried Mrs. Poindexter,
                  impulsively, clasping our heroine to her bosom and imprinting a kiss upon her fair
                  brow. "I would to God that every shackle had been loosed long, long ago, for then
                  we would have been spared the fearful war which is about to ravish our land."
               "I know," resumed Eleanor, sorrowfully, "that I have by my action deeply offended
                  father, and that it may be turned to
                  account by those who seek to destroy my happiness; but, mother, come what may, I
                  am determined never to yield the position I have assumed. I believe it, I know it,
                  to be my duty, and from it no earthly power shall swerve me!"
               The conversation between Eleanor and her mother continued several hours, and ere
                  its conclusion each had confided to the other the inmost secrets of her heart. For
                  her mother's sake our heroine promised to forego the determination she had formed
                  of quitting home, and, if possible, also to win her brother Henry from his wicked
                  course. In her own mind, however, she felt that the first depended upon her
                  father's future treatment, and that the second bordered on the impossible. From
                  the revelations made by her mother she now looked upon Santee as a heartless
                  monster; and by the very contrast afforded by him to Drayton we must not fail to
                  record that the mere respect Miss Poindexter had hitherto entertained for the
                  latter was deepened to a much stronger feeling.
               After dinner Eleanor had her favorite horse saddled and rode over to visit Miss
                  St. Aubyn, the daughter of a gentleman residing about a mile and a half from
                  Palmetto Plantation. It will be remembered that Rosa was returning from Miss St.
                  Aubyn's when met by the mysterious stranger who had given her the strange letter
                  of warning for Eleanor.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               A STRANGE ADVENTURE.
               OUR heroine had accomplished about half the distance between Palmetto Plantation
                  and the St. Aubyn estate without meeting a human being. But, just as she reached a
                  bridle-path that led down to the main road out of a stretch of timber land, she
                  encountered a man riding slowly and with apparent caution toward her. As he caught
                  sight of her he reined in his horse for a moment, as though to ascertain who she
                  might be, or whether she was alone, and then came quickly forward. She did not,
                  however, alter the pace of her own animal, and consequently she was a little
                  distance beyond the end of the bridle-path ere the unknown rider came out of the
                  woods upon the road. The next moment she heard her name repeated by the horseman,
                  who in addition requested her to stop a moment as he wished to speak to her.
               Eleanor immediately checked her spirited steed, brought him half way round, and
                  held him in this position until the stranger approached close enough to speak. As
                  the latter came up, our heroine scrutinized his countenance, or at least what she
                  could see of it between the broad rim of his hat and a most luxuriant growth of
                  wiry, red, or rather dark, sandy beard. The quick, furtive glances of his large,
                  restless blue eyes impressed her unfavorably, and, gathering the reins more
                  tightly in her hand, she held herself ready for an emergency. Carelessly as she
                  attempted to do this act, it was noticed by the new-comer, who said:
               "Fear nothing, Miss Poindexter; I merely stopped you to ask a question and a
                  favor. Answer the one and grant the other, and I leave you immediately, with the
                  assurance that our meeting was entirely unexpected and equally fortunate."
               "I will do so, sir, if in my power," replied Eleanor, with composure and
                  dignity."
               "First, then, did you receive a note within a day or so from your maid, Rosa,
                  given to her by gentleman on this road?"
               "I did, sir," answered our heroine, somewhat startled that the forbidding-looking
                  stranger should know of that matter.
               "That is the question," continued her companion, who had respectfully ruined up
                  his own hose some ten feet or so from Eleanor, "and now for the favor, or rather
                  the two favors. Will you believe and profit by the contents of that note? and,
                  also, will you promise not to mention to any living soul that you have seen a
                  person of my description in this locality?"
               "As to the first," answered Eleanor, "I could not do otherwise than believe, for
                  of the truth of the mysterious note I had already had proof before receiving it.
                  And as to the second, I see no objection to promising to do as you request."
               The horseman started as our heroine ine
                  made this reply, and a glance of surprise shot from his eyes when he heard his
                  fair companion state her previous knowledge of the truth of the singular letter.
                  But controlling himself in all instant, he added, as he cast furtive glances up
                  and down the road:
               "Will you positively assent to my last request, Miss Poindexter? My safety, and
                  perhaps your own future safety, depends on your doing so."
               "Certainly, sir, I will say nothing about having met a person of your description
                  here, if my silence on the matter will be of service to you."
               "Thank you, Miss Poindexter, it will be of service to me, and also to yourself. I
                  shall place every dependence on your word. Good day!"
               The look which accompanied this reply was more peculiar than any with which the
                  unknown had yet regarded our heroine, and increased the feeling of uneasiness that
                  had sprung up within her breast. This mysterious stranger was altogether
                  unrecognized by Eleanor, and consequently she marveled the more that he was so
                  familiar with her name, and she was on the point of inquiring who he was when he
                  thus bade her a hasty good-day. As he gracefully wheeled his horse, he bowed to
                  our heroine, and, riding into the timber, on the opposite side of the road to
                  which he had come, quickly disappeared.
               At first Eleanor thought of returning home, but remembering that there were
                  several houses immediately on the roadside between where she now was and the St.
                  Aubyn mansion, she put her noble animal to his speed and hastened forward. Yet the
                  swift gait of her gallant Arabian was a snail's pace to the lightning-like
                  progress of her own thoughts. A thousand surmises and a thousand suspicions
                  flashed after each other through her mind, but all failed to illumine the
                  mystery.
               All at once, however, an idea struck her that she had the solution she sought.
                  Santee was a man of the deepest plot; Jenkins she knew to be a sworn friend of
                  Santee; and the mysterious man she had just encountered—who seemed so afraid of
                  discovery—strongly, very strongly, resembled Jenkins. And that the stranger was
                  disguised she had felt from the first moment she saw him. When, however, she
                  examined this suspicion more deeply, it vanished, as had its predecessors, like
                  the morning mist of summer before the rising sun. If the stranger was in league
                  with Santee, he would scarcely have thus divulged the fact, at least to her, and
                  yet, if he was not, what necessity was there for his unaccountable
                  concealment?
               So engrossing and so bewildering was this whirl of thought and counter-thought
                  that our heroine, without knowing it, had actually passed her friend's mansion to
                  the distance of a quarter of a mile before discovering her mistake. Smiling at
                  herself, she turned back, and was soon after assisted from her horse by a younger
                  son of Mr. St. Aubyn.
               This was her first visit thither since her return from the North, and her welcome
                  was exceedingly cordial. Of course the occurrences which had so lately taken place
                  at Palmetto Plantation were entirely unknown to the St. Aubyns, and the latter
                  were eager in their kind inquiries concerning the health of the Poindexters.
                  Nellie St. Aubyn, who was a confidential dential companion of our heroine, was
                  very particular in asking after Henry, who, owing to his marked and
                  favorably-received attentions, had come to be regarded as the successful suitor
                  for Nellie's hand and heart, each of which was a fortune in itself.
               Independently of the promise she had given her mother, Eleanor, from her own
                  natural goodness of heart, was inclined to conceal the base conduct of Henry
                  toward herself. Yet so truthful was her heart that many times during the
                  conversation which she held with the St. Aubyns she almost committed herself.
                  However, by carefully wording her replies she avoided such a result, and without
                  speaking a single untruth.
               Eleanor's friends entreated her to remain to tea; but as she had said to her
                  mother that she would be home soon she was compelled to decline the kind
                  invitation, although she gladly accepted the proffer of Herbert's company to
                  Palmetto Plantation. Her cavalier was soon ready, and both mounting their steeds,
                  our heroine and Herbert were just waving their adieus to the St. Aubyns, when a
                  cavalcade appeared over the ridge of an elevation in the road at a short
                  distance.
               Foremost among the approaching horsemen the quick eye of Eleanor discerned Santee,
                  mounted on his large, gray courser, and closely followed by her brother Henry.
                  These two together, with three or four companions, seeing that the St. Aubyns and
                  their fair visitor had noticed them, dashed forward at a gallop and soon reached
                  the mansion. It was evident that the whole party had been drinking, but still they
                  retained a sufficient amount of reason to behave themselves in a gentlemanly
                  manner toward the ladies. Henry was the only one who dismounted, and he did so
                  that he might the more conveniently converse with Nellie St. Aubyn, who expressed
                  the liveliest pleasure at seeing him, and naively informed him that she had been
                  "cross-questioning Eleanor about him."
               While the two lovers stood thus apart from the company, Santee, after lifting his
                  cap to Eleanor and the other ladies, reined his horse close to Mr. St. Aubyn, and
                  swinging himself gracefully half way down and out of his saddle, he grasped the
                  hand of the latter, and said:
               "Well, St. Aubyn, have you made up your mind to join us yet? We've been gathering
                  up the neighbors all day, and we're going to have a strong meeting to-night at my
                  place—all the influential men for thirty miles about. I suppose you've heard the
                  confirmation of the glorious news about the secession of the 'Old Dominion?' She
                  adds another star, and a brilliant one, too, to our Confederacy. You must come
                  now, St. Aubyn, or you'll be stigmatized as a Unionist."
               "No, Mr. Santee," replied Mr. St. Aubyn. "Indeed, I shall not join you. I do not,
                  and cannot, approve of such a course. If the South is wronged she can be redressed
                  much better in the Union than out of it, and, until I see much stronger reasons
                  than I do at present, I cannot join you."
               "Now, St. Aubyn," urged Santee, in a positive and yet conciliatory tone, "do give
                  up your obstinacy. Why, with the feelings of the people worked up to such a pitch
                  as they must very shortly be, your property, and even your life, will be in
                     danger. Now, to show you to what a
                  frenzy they are excited, these men whom you see coming up the road have collected
                  all the national flags they could find and are going to burn them this very
                  night."
               "And instead of seeking to allay this unwarrantable excitement, this silly
                  madness, you, Santee, and men who know better, have been encouraging it, and are
                  still hounding it on. You sit there coolly, and tell me that at the meeting which
                  is to be held to-night the damnable sacrilege of burning a number of national
                  flags is to be permitted, aye, applauded by you! No, sir! sooner than lend my
                  presence to such a meeting I would thrust my right hand into a cauldron of molten
                  iron! The man, too, who would countenance such an act is a black-hearted traitor
                  and a poltroon! There! you have my answer, once for all!"
               Santee swung himself up again to an upright position in his saddle, and, shaking
                  his finger slowly and malignantly at the patriotic St. Aubyn, rejoined, in a
                  bitter undertone:
               "You'll regret those words, St. Aubyn! You're a marked man; remember!"
               He savagely twisted, rather than wheeled, his horse as he spoke, and, darting
                  forward to meet Mr. Poindexter, who was close at hand with a dozen others,
                  whispered something in his ear.
               Our heroine's father immediately lowered his brows, and, riding forward, he thus
                  addressed Herbert St. Aubyn, who still sat on his horse beside Eleanor:
               "Your courtesy, young man, is not needed. I will accompany Miss Poindexter home
                  myself!" Then, turning sharply on his daughter, he continued: "Eleanor, ride by my
                  side."
               "Very good, sir," haughtily replied Herbert St. Aubyn, stung to the quick by this
                  intentional rudeness, and pulling his horse backward. Quickly recollecting
                  himself, however, he smiled graciously at Eleanor, and raised his hat, which our
                  heroine as graciously acknowledged.
               Both Henry Poindexter and Nellie St. Aubyn noticed about the same moment that
                  something of an unpleasant nature had occurred, and, parting with a hasty
                  farewell, the former remounted and joined the cavalcade, while the latter retired
                  with the rest of her family within doors.
               Ten minutes later, even the stragglers of Santee's followers had passed by, and
                  the solemn, holy quiet of evening drew on over the scene.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               ELEANOR'S RESOLVE.
               NEVER before in her whole life had Eleanor Poindexter seen her father under the
                  influence of intoxicating liquor, and even now he had partaken just sufficiently
                  to make him testy, and disposed to exhibit his temper, which, as is already known,
                  was of the most unreasonable and ungovernable character. Well aware that, if she
                  refused to obey him when he ordered her to ride beside him home, a scene would
                  ensue more tragic than even that which had occurred the day previous in his
                  library, Eleanor quietly did as he told her.
               Santee rode on the side opposite to her father, so that she was between the two.
                  All the way along the former did his best to please and entertain his fair though
                  unwilling companion. Henry, her brother, as though conscience-stricken, did not
                  come near his sister, but kept some distance back in the column, chatting
                  pleasantly the while with his comrades.
               Upon nearing Palmetto Plantation, Eleanor, making some gaily-spoken remark to her
                  father, gave her steed the rein, and galloped forward to the mansion. On the
                  piazza she found Rosa anxiously awaiting her arrival, for darkness was so close at
                  hand that lights had been already lit.
               "Rosa," said she, springing from her saddle, and giving the reins to her servant,
                  "you must be my ostler to-night. Take Mehomet quickly to the North side of the
                  barn, secure him there and return immediately. But do not on any account let my
                  father see you. He is coming up the road with some friends. Be quick! When you
                  fasten the horse and come back, watch me, and when you see me go toward the barn,
                  you must mount the first horse you find and follow me to Mr. St. Aubyn's."
               Rosa, though naturally enough much astonished, comprehended that there was
                  necessity for the utmost despatch, and she accordingly hastened away with the
                  words:
               "I'll do jes' 'zactly what you sez, Missey Eleanor!"
               Our heroine forthwith sought her mother, hurriedly informed her of the meeting
                  that was to be held at Santee's, of the temper in which her father was, and of her
                  own intention to return immediately to Mr. St. Aubyn's house, at least until the
                  next day. She, also, in a few words, informed her mother of the strange meeting
                  she had had in the afternoon with the mysterious horseman, and also of her
                  suspicions in regard to him.
               Mrs. Poindexter heartily approved of the resolve and begged her daughter not to
                  delay her departure for fear that her father might come in.
               A few minutes sufficed for Eleanor to bound up to her own room, change her
                  riding-habit, and secure a few articles which she most highly prized. An
                  unaccountable impulse caused her also to conceal in her pocket the loaded revolver that her brother had left in her
                  possession in such an unknightly manner.
               Hearing the tramp of the approaching horsemen, Eleanor glanced from her window and
                  beheld the troop in its dark, shadowy outlines coming near, but still at a
                  sufficient distance to allow her to bid her mother good night.
               A moment more and she had gained the apartment in which she had left the latter;
                  but Mrs. Poindexter had, in the meantime, descended to the supper room. Eleanor
                  was tempted to hurry down a flight of stairs that was close at hand, and thus make
                  sure her escape. But filial love instantly overcame the temptation, and she ran
                  down to the supper room. Her mother was alone, waiting to receive her husband and
                  his guests, and was much startled at seeing her daughter enter, for she believed
                  her to be by this time fully on her journey.
               "Oh! my dearest mother!" exclaimed our fair heroine, fondly embracing Mrs.
                  Poindexter, "I could not leave until I bade you good night!"
               "Good night, my Eleanor, good night? And God bless you! I will come over and see
                  you in the morning. Now hasten away!"
               Mrs. Poindexter, while making this reply, pressed several fervent kisses upon our
                  heroine's lips and cast several fearful glances in the direction of the door by
                  which she expected her husband to enter.
               In an instant more Eleanor unclasped her arms and left her mother; thanking Heaven
                  as she did so that the arrival of her father had been delayed. Scarcely had the
                  assuring thought passed from her mind, however, before Mr. Poindexter, leaping
                  from his saddle, strode across the piazza and entered the supper room, meeting his
                  daughter face to face. Eleanor's heart sank within her, but swelled with
                  unexpected pleasure as the following moment Mr. Poindexter, a smile wreathing his
                  features, took her gently by the hand, and led her to a chair beside her mother's,
                  at the head of the table, saying, as he did so:
               "Come, my dear Eleanor, you must assist your mother to do the honors, for we have
                  some visitors and we are already behind time."
               Our heroine felt inclined to embrace her father, for his kind manner burst upon
                  her as suddenly and as genially as the warm summer sun breaks its way to earth
                  through the dark thunder storm. Mrs. Poindexter, also, was so overcome with the
                  pleasing surprise that her voice trembled with gladness as she welcomed her
                  husband home, and Eleanor to her side.
               Ten gentlemen, who had been specially invited by Mr. Poindexter, entered the
                  apartment after their host, and, at a word from him, proceeded to seat themselves
                  at the well-filled board, after interchanging the customary civilities with the
                  two ladies who presided.
               The rest of the numerous company that had returned with our heroine's father and
                  Santee, were entertained amongst the immediate neighbors, Santee supping by far
                  the largest number of them.
               During the casual conversation that ensued among Mr. Poindexter's guests, nothing
                  was said at which our patriotic heroine could take exception, as all the
                  gentlemen, moved apparently by the same motive, avoided allusions to politics, and
                  conversed only on general topics in which the ladies could be interested. And to
                  the end of the meal nothing occurred of any note except the following: As Eleanor
                  once chanced to cast her eyes toward a side window that looked out upon the
                  piazza, she was startled at beholding the visage of the unknown horseman whom she
                  had encountered as she was going over to Mr. St. Aubyn's in the afternoon. The
                  stealthy watcher raised a warning finger, as though to enjoin silence upon his
                  discoverer, and then disappeared from the window like a fleeting apparition.
               Eleanor's happiness was broken, for, though being unable to account for it, she
                  felt that there was some mysterious connection between this singular man and the
                  figure she had seen gliding across the lawn on the night her brother Henry had so
                  nearly discovered her watching the prayer-meeting of her father's slaves. And, as
                  naturally as a deduction could follow premises, the suspicion flashed upon her
                  that this mysterious man was linked in some manner with, and guided by,
                  Santee.
               Upon the conclusion of supper, Mr. Poindexter's friends went out, remounted their
                  horses, and waited for their host to join them before riding over to Santee's
                  place. Here, as we have already stated, was to be held one of those violent
                  meetings by which the traitorous leaders of the rebellion sought to lead captive
                  the masses of the South, and yoke them to the bloody chariot whose pitiless wheels
                  were already in motion. Mr. Poindexter was the last to rise, and, upon doing so,
                  he stepped to his daughter and said, in tones still more pleasant than he had yet
                  used:
               "Come, Eleanor, my dear, I am going to take you with me. You are cast to-night for
                  a rôle of which you may well be proud. You have been unanimously selected on
                  account of your grace and beauty."
               "Pray, papa, what is the rôle to which you allude? I may not be as good an actress
                  thereof as you seem so confidently to believe I will."
               Eleanor knew, or at least strongly suspected, of what character the meeting was to
                  be, and though her reply was made in pleasant tones, still there was a touch of
                  anxiety about the latter which all her efforts were unavailing to conceal.
               "Ah, my dear," answered her father, "I may not inform you until you reach the
                  stage. Come, mount your horse! Never mind about redressing; come along just as you
                  are. There will be a grand affair."
               Our heroine grew sick at heart as her father persisted in his request, for she
                  dreaded that she was about to be subjected to a terrible ordeal. However, after a
                  few moments' consideration, during which her mother urged her to go with her
                  father, Eleanor said:
               "Yes, my dear papa, I will accompany you with the utmost pleasure, and I will show
                  you that the daughter of Robert Poindexter knows, and will truly perform her
                  duty."
               "Well said, my daughter!" exclaimed Eleanor's father, kissing his daughter's
                  cheek—the first kiss he had given her since her departure for the North—"Let us be
                  off," he continued, drawing her toward the door, "for the meeting will be opened
                  before we get there."
               Our heroine loosed herself a moment, and stepping back to where her mother was standing, she embraced the latter
                  fondly, and whispered:
               "Heaven bless you, dearest mother! good bye—perhaps for ever!"
               The strange look which accompanied these scarcely audible words betokened the
                  determination of an iron will, and caused Mrs. Poindexter's heart to throb with
                  apprehension. Eleanor then turned and followed her father out on the piazza.
               But here a fresh difficulty presented itself. Her horse, which ordinarily should
                  have been hitched near-by, or else put up in the stable, was secured, as she had
                  ordered, on the North side of the barn. With perfect calmness, however, Eleanor
                  told her father that she had seen Mehomet going over toward the barn and that she
                  would go and catch him herself. He would have detained her and sent a slave to
                  bring the horse, which would have been the usual way, but Eleanor was gone like a
                  fairy, and quickly disappeared in the surrounding gloom.
               She soon reached the barn and was joined a moment or so later by Rosa, who had
                  faithfully, and at no small risk, observed the minutest point of Eleanor's orders
                  as far as consistent with the new circumstances.
               "Rosa!" exclaimed our heroine, in a low, tremulous voice, "I feared you would make
                  some mistake, but, thanks to your good judgment, you have done admirably. Yet your
                  task is not ended. Get one of the horses out of the stable, ride over to Mr. St.
                  Aubyn's, and tell him that I will come over as soon as possible. Tell him, too,
                  that if I should be a little late he will oblige me by waiting up for me. Ask him,
                  also, to allow you to remain til I come."
               "Oh, Missy Eleanor! what's agoin' to happen? I'se nearly skeered to def 'bout
                  you!"
               "I cannot stop to explain now, Rosa," quickly replied Eleanor, "but do as I tell
                  you, immediately!"
               "'Deed I will, Miss Eleanor!"
               Ere the mulatto had finished her reply, Eleanor vaulted into the saddle, and was
                  riding back toward the mansion.
               As Mehomet pranced proudly up with his fair burden, an exclamation of welcome
                  burst from very lip of Mr. Poindexter's guests, and he and they, accompanied by
                  our heroine, forthwith started for the meeting which was about taking place.
               It was at no slow pace that they rode, and yet, upon arriving at the spot—a wide
                  and beautiful field belonging to James Santee—in which were gathered more than a
                  thousand people, impatient shouts were already being uttered for a speech.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               "HAIL! ALL HAIL, BRIGHT BANNER!"
               THE field of which we speak was indeed a beautiful spot. Sloping on the side of a
                  gentle acclivity, it was covered with rich, green grass, and surrounded by a deep
                  woodland. Only a little imagination was required to suppose that it had once been
                  an immense emerald, and that ages ago it had fallen from the sky, and, crushing
                  down through the forest foliage, had imbedded itself in the earth, and lain hidden
                  there ever since.
               At the Western or highest side of this field, a large staging had been erected for
                  speakers, and also for another purpose which the course of our narrative will
                  develop. Flowers and flags were tastefully festooned and draped about it, the
                  latter invariably being State flags only, and representing some one or other of
                  the seceded States, or those which it was supposed would soon secede. The whole
                  scene was rendered most brilliant by large fires, while strings of colored lights
                  were fancifully distributed among the branches of the trees with which this
                  natural amphitheatre was surrounded. The tableau, therefore, presented to Eleanor
                  Poindexter, as she emerged from the moss grown aisles of the forest into the
                  field, was indeed grand and impressive, and she involuntarily checked her horse
                  that she might contemplate the scene at a distance.
               As she did so, however, her father exclaimed, with a kind of joyous
                  excitement:
               "Do not tarry, Eleanor, my dear. Come, let us hurry through the throng and reach
                  the stage."
               After she recovered from the startle his exclamation had given her, our heroine
                  pointed out to her father that it would be more advisable to ride around the
                  outside of the meeting, and thus, without trouble or delay, gain the desired
                  point. Mr. Poindexter adhered, however, to his own determination, and began to
                  urge his own and his daughter's horse in among the spectators, who, giving way in
                  all directions, sent up loud acclamations for our heroine, she being as well known
                  to nearly all those present as was her father. This appeared to be exactly the
                  result that Mr. Poindexter had wished; for, as the welcoming shouts broke forth,
                  his cheeks flushed, his eyes brightened, and, as he rode along, he often made such
                  remarks as these:
               "Last, but not least, gentlemen! Ah! Mr. Mason, Beauty and Goodness, as well as
                  Valor, are enlisted in our glorious cause."
               But while Miss Poindexter's father was thus engaged, she herself rode alone beside
                  him with ashen checks and drooping eyes (for on reaching the meeting her cavalier
                  companions gradually mingled with the assembled spectators). Yet no word of
                  remonstrance, none of complaint, parted her tightly compressed lips as her father
                  thus made a show of her for a certain effect. She was pretty well assured in her own mind for what reason
                  he had brought her hither, and she accordingly resolved on the course which she
                  intended to pursue.
               As she neared the stage she noticed particularly the absence of the national
                  standard, and the peculiar selection of State flags. But she had not time to
                  observe much more, ere her father, guiding her around the Southern end of the
                  platform, led her to a roughly built inclosure, that had apparently been put up
                  for the occasion.
               Outside of the entrance thereto stood Santee and a select group of companions,
                  among whom Eleanor noticed her brother Henry. The latter turned carelessly away,
                  while Santee, springing forward, offered her his assistance to dismount. But,
                  without a sign even of recognition to the man whom she now feared and hated, she
                  leaped lightly to the ground, and turning to her father, who had also dismounted,
                  asked him what he desired her to do.
               "To step in here a moment with me, dearest Eleanor," replied Mr. Poindexter,
                  throwing open the door of the inclosure, or cabin, if the layer of clap-boards,
                  that served the place of a roof, could constitute it one. Still obedient, Eleanor
                  entered as directed.
               "Dearest Eleanor," resumed her father, closing the door after him as he spoke, and
                  changing his former tone to one of more gravity, "this is the rôle you are to
                  play, and remember, on your proper performance thereof, depends my future regard
                  for you. A crisis has arisen in the history of our land. The Southern States have
                  determined to assert their freedom and declare their right to independence. Up to
                  February 1st, seven States withdrew from the Union, and within a day past the
                  glorious news has reached us that Virginia, the oldest and most influential State
                  in the country, has forever sundered the ties that bound her to the old
                  government. To celebrate these glorious events, and also to encourage and give
                  proper aim to the struggles of our countrymen in this region, we have determined
                  to have this splendid demonstration to-night. The whole affair has been arranged
                  by Mr. Santee and a few noble friends, and will produce the most startling effect
                  imaginable.
               "By his, that is, their courtesy, you, Eleanor, have been selected, as I told you
                  before, to play the most important rôle. This I will explain to you fully, in
                  order that you may better understand it. There will be eight speakers, one for
                  each seceded State, and there will likewise be eight beautiful maidens, seven
                  besides yourself. All the young ladies will be attired in a costume allegorical of
                  Purity and Truth, and each of them will bear three flags, one the State flag, One
                  the old national flag, and the other the new Confederate banner. The speeches will
                  be made in the exact order of the secession of the State represented by the
                  speaker, and at the conclusion of each speech, the young lady who personifies the
                  genius of that State, will go to an altar, on which a fire will be burning, and,
                  unfolding the old national flag from about the State flag, will fling the former
                  into the flames. She will then reverently entwine the State banner with the new
                  Confederate standard.
               "You, my dearest Eleanor, will represent Virginia, the last and most powerful
                  sister of the New Confederacy. And now you will retire to the next apartment,
                  where the rest of the young ladies are doubtless waiting for you, and don your
                  costume; but ere I leave you," continued Mr. Poindexter, taking his daughter's
                  hand, "let me know that you fully and cheerfully consent to be thus distinguished,
                  Eleanor."
               "Have I not already obeyed you, father?" replied our heroine, in a smothered,
                  husky voice.
               "Yes, my dear, but I am still fearful, from Henry's report of you, and your own
                  acts of late, that you might disobey my wish on this occasion."
               "I will do my duty, father! As God above is my witness, I will not flinch!" said
                  Eleanor in fervent tones, as a flush sprang to her hitherto pale cheeks and she
                  stepped toward the door opening into the next room—for the little building of
                  which we speak had been partitioned.
               "Ha! that is how a daughter of Robert Poindexter should speak!"
                  exclaimed our heroine's father, in tones of ecstasy, impulsively clasping Eleanor
                  to his breast, "Good bye, daughter, until after the meeting is over, for the
                  people, as you may hear, are becoming more and more impatient."
               "Farewell, my father, farewell!"
               Mr. Poindexter was making his exit as these words fell upon his ear, but their
                  strangely mournful utterance instantly arrested his steps, and he turned to look
                  upon his daughter. He caught a glimpse of her features, which had lost their
                  blush, and were again ashy pale, and he heard her final farewell as she passed
                  into the room beyond.
               While this scene was passing within, another of equal interest was transpiring
                  without. As Miss Poindexter had disappeared with her father, Santee drew two of
                  his immediate companions aside, and thus addressed them.
               "Well, Mason and Keit, what do you think of that wire pulling, eh? Poindexter's
                  one of the most influential men about here, and with proper managing he will make
                  one of our best advocates. He is very proud, vain, and sensitive, and so I tickled
                  his vanity by proposing to him that his daughter should represent Virginia at the
                  meeting to-night. She has just come home from the North, and the people knowing
                  that, and seeing her thus taking sides with her father's cause, will be bound the
                  more readily to that cause. You see we must enlist the women on our side, and not
                  men only. I was very much afraid that the sweet dear would refuse, for she and her
                  father have had a scene or two since she came home, on account of her getting in
                  with some of those infernal abolitionists while in the North. But I guess the old
                  man has taken the advice I gave him, and gained his authority over her again, with
                  honey instead of vinegar."
               "By the way, Santee," replied one of the latter's auditors; "are you not casting a
                  net of your own in the direction of Miss Poindexter?"
               "Well, perhaps I am," was the answer, given with a light laugh. "She's a fish
                  worthy a good net and a better fishermen."
               "
                     Epecially
                     Especially
                   the last!" chimed Keit, playfully digging Santee in the side with his
                  thumb.
               "Well, I do hope," resumed Santee, after some further irrelevant conversation sation, and speaking with
                  a serious air, "that she'll play her part as I have arranged it; but I tell you
                  what it is, it would not surprise me one whit to see her bounce out of there,
                  pistol in hand, and in the highest kind of dudgeon."
               "Hist!" exclaimed Mason, "the door's opening now!"
               All three instantly fixed their eyes in the direction indicated, and Santee
                  actually cut his lip between his teeth from very suspense. When he saw only Mr.
                  Poindexter come out of the cabin, however, he gave a deep sigh of relief, and,
                  springing forward, seized the hand of our heroine's father, and said:
               "Now, Mr. Poindexter, isn't my advice the best? If, instead of smiling upon
                  Eleanor, and coaxing her, when you went in to supper, you had stormed at and
                  threatened her, you would not have had her here. You see she has a temperament
                  high-strung and defiant."
               "You were right, Santee, you were right! and I believe that, with a little
                  kindness, I can persuade her even to undo her silly act in, regard to that wench,
                  Rosa. At any rate I have accomplished this much—that she has promised me not to
                  flinch from her duty to-night!"
               "Good! good! better than good!" exclaimed Santee, rubbing and clapping his hands,
                  while a gleam of delight suffused his sinister countenance. "But behold!" he
                  continued, after a pause, "here come the nymphs now! They look like angels! Stand
                  by with the matches, Ned!" he called to an assistant, who only awaited his order
                  to discharge a flight of rockets, which was a signal for the commencement of the
                  meeting.
               The distance between the platform and the little building out of which the eight
                  lovely girls had just issued was but short, and, by the time the latter had
                  reached the stairs leading to the stage, the word was given by Santee. Instantly
                  the heavily charged rockets screeched skyward, one after another, until all were
                  discharged, by which moment the young ladies had reached the seats set apart for
                  them. No pen can attempt properly to depict the wild and tumultuous excitement
                  that followed. The ground itself trembled with the noise, and, during the uproar,
                  the rest of the stage was filled with those who had been invited thereon.
               When all was ready Santee stepped forward, and, with a motion of his hand, gained
                  the silent attention of his audience. He stated the object of the meeting in that
                  treasonable balderdash which was the common stock in trade of the vile leaders of
                  the rebellion, and he ended by nominating Mr. Robert Poindexter for President,
                  which, of course, was carried by acclamation. The usual long list of
                  Vice-Presidents and Secretaries followed, and then commenced the real performance
                  of the evening.
               From the moment Eleanor Poindexter bade her exit from the cabin with her seven
                  fair companions, three pairs of eyes were constantly riveted upon her. These
                  anxiously gazing eyes belonged to her father, James Santee, and a tall man wearing
                  a broad-rimmed hat, and a long, heavy reddish, wiry beard, which nearly concealed
                  his face. The last mentioned stood alone in the shadow of a large tree, from which
                  position he could see all that passed without being likely to attract much attention
                     Eleanor, disrobing herself instantly of the glorious standard of Liberty,
                        waved it above her, and added: "Hail! all hail to thee, bright Banner!
                           Mayest thou ever float above the Union, unharmed by foemen! unsullied by
                           traitors!"—Page 
                           51
                           52
                        .
                  
                   himself. To those who may be curious
                  about this last pair of eyes, we will say that they were bright blue in color,
                  large in size, and remarkably restless in movement. They were in short, the same
                  eyes that had inspired our heroine with such a mysterious fear.
               The eight young ladies who were to take such a conspicuous part in the proceedings
                  of the meeting were attired in a uniform costume, consisting of a long, flowing
                  robe of pure white, confined at the waist, with a belt of blue ribbon, and
                  streamers, also blue. The bodice full, and of the same material as the skirt, was
                  entirely plain, while the sleeves were wide and slit up on the outside to a point
                  midway between the elbow and shoulder, thus displayed the arms, which were jeweled
                  according to the taste of the fair owner. The headdress was a light, elegantly
                  made tiarra of flowers mingled with tinsel. Rising from the middle front of each
                  tiara was a star, also of tinsel and highly polished.
               Though no taller than most of her companions, our heroine seemed to tower above
                  them all like an empress, and right regal was her mien as she advanced with a firm
                  step to the platform, carrying the flags already designated in either hand.
               "Surely I am deceived!" said the man who stood alone in the shadow of the large
                  tree, as he beheld our heroine going upon the stage.
               If he added aught to these words, it was lost in the tumult that broke forth at
                  that juncture.
               The first speaker—he who represented South Carolina—was Colonel Keit, and when we
                  have said that, there remains to us no necessity for recording even a synopsis of
                  his fierce harangue. When he had finished, however, that part of the programme
                  most impressive and most incendiary to the minds of the more ignorant portions of
                  the spectators was initiated.
               Prominently, in view of all, had been erected a sort of altar, upon the stage, and
                  at a given signal by Santee, that master-spirit of evil, a sudden fire burst forth
                  upon it, kindled by a pyrotechnic contrivance from beneath the platform. As the
                  flames grew strong, Miss Ruffin, daughter of the man who fired the first
                  traitor-ball at Fort Sumter, and who, therefore, was a fitting vice-genius of
                  South Carolina, went to the altar and stood silently before it for a few moments.
                  Then, assuming the supposed dignity of one of the ancient priestesses, she
                  disengaged a Palmetto flag from about a Star Spangled Banner, about which it had
                  been entwined, and, with a contemptuous manner, cast the latter into the fire,
                  exclaiming as she did so:
               "So perish the Old Union!"
               Then, with the deepest expression of reverence, folding the Palmetto flag with the
                  standard of the rebellion, she added:
               "Hail! all Hail to the New Confederacy!"
               Surely the madness that Heaven sends upon those whom it would destroy had seized
                  the beholders of this impious idolatry, this horrid sacrifice to their Political
                  Moloch, for the very welkin trembled for several minutes with the yells and shouts
                  and screams of applause that greeted the offering.
               But let us not tarry even upon the description of such a scene.
               Six speeches, all much of the same tenor as Keit's, had been made, and six of the
                  young ladies had, like Miss Ruffin, enacted their parts in the treasonable
                  mummery. The President of the meeting had by this began to gaze oftener and more
                  anxiously at his daughter, who seemed to be getting paler and paler as her turn
                  approached.
               Santee was to be the last speaker, and he, too, was eagerly watching his intended
                  victim. He occupied a seat immediately behind Mr. Poindexter, and, bending forward
                  his head, he whispered in the ear of the latter:
               "I hope Eleanor will get through without breaking down, but I must say she looks
                  rather nervous! Don't you think so?"
               "Oh, no! She'll face it when it comes," answered our heroine's father. "You see
                  I've got her to take the point, and she will go through for very shame. The
                  success of the others will inspire her if nothing else will."
               The seventh orator was a Texan judge, who roughly, but no doubt naturally,
                  represented his State. His speech was short and brusque, and delivered in a manner
                  rather unbecoming and vulgar for a judge.
               The President announced, as the last speaker, "his patriotic friend,
                  James L. Santee, Esq."
               At the mention of his name our heroine started almost to her feet, and glanced
                  about her as though longing for some avenue of escape. Her change of demeanor did
                  not escape the eyes of either Santee or her father; but each believed it to be
                  only the result of the near approach of the moment for her own performance.
               As Santee opened his address, Eleanor looked over to where she had left her horse,
                  and a thrill of something that was almost despair flashed through her, for,
                  standing with his hand on Mehomet's bridle, was the mysterious horseman of the
                  afternoon. But a strange gleam of determination came upon her countenance the next
                  moment, and she turned and coolly answered some casual remark that one of the
                  ladies addressed to her.
               Santee was not long, and at the close of his speech, after alluding to the power,
                  influence, and importance of Virginia, he paid a high-flown tribute to the fair
                  Eleanor, which gained for her a compliment that none of her companions had
                  received—a round of three deafening cheers. While these were still ringing, Santee
                  took his seat.
               The final moment had come at last, and, with the most intense anxiety, Mr.
                  Poindexter and Santee eyed our heroine.
               Not until perfect silence was restored did the latter stir from her seat, and
                  then, rising with the utmost dignity, she advanced close to the altar. Here,
                  instead of facing the latter as had done her companions, and hurrying through her
                  part, she confronted the spectators. Gazing upon these a moment, she raised her
                  eyes heavenward, and crossing her hands upon her breast, sank gradually down upon
                  her knees to the platform.
               So genuinely natural was this unlooked-for act that every breath was suspended,
                  and those who sat upon the stage actually rose with one unconscious accord to
                  their feet and leaned over toward the lovely girl, who looked more like an angel
                  of light than a human being. Eleanor
                  continued in this posture several minutes, her lips, the while, moving in silent
                  prayer. She then arose, and as she did so a relief came upon the audience, which
                  expressed itself in a low murmur or sigh, as it were of reverence and
                  approbation.
               "Noble Eleanor!" gasped her father to Santee, in a whisper of half stifled joy,
                  and then, with the latter, he turned to witness his daughter's further
                  performance.
               The incomparable girl took her place before the altar, and, after a pause, began
                  the usual unfolding of the flags. There was no hurry, for she alone, of all the
                  eight maidens, was calm and really not acting. The State flag of
                  Virginia was disentwined from around the Star Spangled Banner, and the next
                  instant, twisted and wisped with the standard of the rebellion, it was cast
                     loathingly into the flames.
               With the act the imprisoned soul of our heroine burst the restraint that until now
                  had confined it, and, as flashes of fire darted from Eleanor's eyes, and the
                  bright blood rushed to her cheeks, the heroic girl cast about herself the "Banner
                  of the Stars," the sacred banner for which Southern blood had often been shed, and
                  in a voice that rang out as clearly as a bell:
               "Perish! forever perish all treason! all traitors!"
               Then, disrobing herself instantly of the glorious standard of Liberty, she waved
                  it above her, and added:
               "Hail! all hail to thee, bright Banner! Mayest thou ever float above the
                     Union, unharmed by foemen! unsullied by traitors!"
               The bursting of a tempest down from a soft Italian sky could not equal the effect
                  that the act of our heroine produced.
               First came a lull, as of death, and then, like some monstrous animal, stunned for
                  a moment by a terrible blow, the spectators broke forth into bellowings of rage.
                  Even highly bred gentlemen on the stage, who were wont to boast of their chivalry,
                  rushed toward Eleanor, and whipped out their favorite bowie-knives to make her a
                  sacrifice. But the imperious empress who had let loose the tempest was not one to
                  cower from its fury.
               Eleanor had merely slipped on her white robe over her own dress, in the pocket of
                  which she had secreted Henry's revolver. In an instant this was in her grasp, and,
                  inspired at the moment, like Samson of old, the glorious girl threw herself
                  forward into the midst of her enemies.
               "Back! back!" she cried, leveling her weapon now to the right, now to the left,
                  and now in front of her, as occasion required.
               In the excitement of the moment lay her advantage, and she pursued it
                  successfully, for, strange as it may seem, she reached in safety her horse. Some
                  friendly hand had already unhitched him. A moment more, and Eleanor was in the
                  saddle, flying away through the forest at the top of Mehomet's speed, and at the
                  imminent risk of being swept from his back by the pendent limbs and branches.
               Once, as she was entering the woods, she cast a glance behind her, and noticed
                  that the foremost and most eager of her pursuers was that same mysterious man whom
                  she had seen standing beside her horse, and whom she now felt thoroughly convinced
                  was an accomplice of Santee.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               AN UNLOOKED-FOR REFUGE.
               ELEANOR POINDEXTER, in directing her flight through the forest, well knew the
                  peril with which the projecting limbs of trees threatened her, but there was no
                  other choice left, except that of remaining to brave the fury of the mob. Besides,
                  in taking the course she did, she reasoned that, in case of a pursuit on foot, she
                  could soon distance the fleetest, and few mounted foes would care to even enter,
                  let alone continue, the chase at a constant risk of their own lives. The wisdom of
                  her action was proved by the result, for she had not galloped more than a quarter
                  of a mile when she became satisfied that all save one of her pursuers had already
                  ceased their efforts. Though in the darkness she could not see this solitary foe,
                  she felt certain that he was no other than the mysterious being who had dogged her
                  footsteps all the afternoon and evening.
               Nearly a mile now stretches between Eleanor and her enraged enemies, and all this
                  distance the heroic girl had ridden unharmed. But an undefined dread of the danger
                  we have already mentioned induced her suddenly, almost involuntarily, to somewhat
                  check her steed. And not a moment too soon did she do so, for the following
                  instant she was swept from her horse by the latter running beneath a low-branched
                  tree. Had she been going at her previous headlong speed, her death would have been
                  as sudden as it must have been sure. As it was, her consciousness only lasted long
                  enough to allow a single gasping word of prayer to pass her lips, and then the
                  lovely and unfortunate girl fell heavily to the earth.
               So intent had been Eleanor's pursuer upon her motions—which were rendered
                  distinctly visible by reason of her white robe *
                   —and so close at
                  
                     *Any object that is white can be seen at a
                        long distance, even on the darkest night. During the war this fact has been
                        continually turned to a useful account. A white rag, tied around the cap or
                        arm of soldiers, has served to keep the latter in the best order while
                        making night attacks, on executing any night movement, or while on picket
                        duty. A still more scientific application of the fact was made by the late
                        Commodore Morris, we think, while passing the rebel batteries at Grand Gulf
                        to assist the gallant Porter, Of Vicksburg fame. The passage was to be made
                        after dark, and yet lights aboard of ships offered the best of marks for the
                        vigilant rebel artillerists. But still it was necessary that there be light
                        of some sort to enable a prompt and proper performance of their
                        duties by the men. Here was indeed a serious difficulty, and one that
                        promised much trouble. Suddenly, however, a thought struck the Commodore,
                        and, sending for the hands, who had been engaged in lime-washing the hold,
                        he ordered them up with their brushes and buckets. Much to the astonishment
                        of all, the Commodore next ordered a good thick coat of the wash to be
                        spread on the deck, inspecting the work himself. But astonishment was
                        quickly turned to amazed delight, for, as fast as the lime went on, every
                        thing on deck became visible, even, to a small picking rod. It is needless
                        to add that lights were immediately dispensed with above deck on every
                        vessel, and the whole fleet passed up without giving the rebels any other
                        advantage than that of random firing.—W. B.
                   at hand was he
                  that her helpless limbs had scarcely settled themselves upon the couch afforded by
                  the fallen leaves before he leaped from his horse and raised her inanimate form in
                  his arms. No word did he utter which could mark the thoughts or emotions that were
                  passing within his breast; but as he rose to his feet he turned half way round,
                  and looked back in the direction of the meeting our heroine had so appropriately
                  ended. He could see nothing; and the only sounds that reached him were faint hums,
                  the thin apparitions of angry roars that were being sent up from a thousand
                  throats.
               After standing thus for a minute or so, the mysterious stranger gently placed
                  Eleanor's head upon his right shoulder, and supported her easily with the same
                  arm, thus leaving his left at liberty to lead his horse. Then, with as quick and
                  yet noiseless a step as possible, he plunged on through the forest, changing his
                  course almost at right angles to that in which he had come.
               Half an hour's travel brought him to a small creek flowing into the Savannah
                  river. As the water was shallow, he experienced no difficulty in fording it, and,
                  on reaching the opposite bank, his course was again changed. His gait, also, now
                  became more brisk, his fair and insensible burden apparently not impeding him at
                  all. Perhaps it was a mile, or three quarters of a mile, distant from the stream
                  that the stranger came to a ridge or swell of land, which seemed to stand out
                  almost as abruptly from the surrounding surface as a grave mound in the midst of a
                  level prairie. The length of the ridge was about ten or twelve rods, while its
                  average breadth was seventy feet. It was covered with a dense and tangled thicket,
                  interspersed with occasional trees.
               The stranger, halting within a hundred feet of this mound, secured his horse to a
                  sapling. Then going to a point midway along the side of the ridge, he parted the
                  thick bushes and made his way slowly into the ticket. So knitted together were the
                  masses of tough branches, tougher wires, and thorny creepers, that it was a task
                  of no small labor and pain to penetrate a dozen feet into this natural network. At
                  this distance, however, the bushes suddenly parted with extreme ease, and six feet
                  further brought Eleanor's bearer to an opening in the ground, that was so artfully
                  concealed as to defy detection.
               Descending half a dozen steps, constructed simply of heavy logs, the singular
                  unknown reclosed the entrance. Then groping his way along a passage whose depth
                  permitted him to walk erectly, he soon emerged into a cave, or rather room, of
                  extensive dimensions. A large and beautiful astral lamp depended from the middle
                  of a huge roof beam, which, with a framework of others, supported the
                  superincumbent earth of the ceiling. By the light thus afforded the stranger
                  strode to where stood a handsome bedstead, and with the utmost tenderness, placed
                  Eleanor who had begun to exhibit signs returning to consciousness, upon the richly
                  appointed bed, which was of the softest down. Rising to his feet, he now
                  contemplated the beautiful girl in silent admiration for a moment or so, and
                  suddenly bending down snatched a kiss from her pale lips, and murmured some half
                  inaudible words of endearment.
               With this he turned away to an iron chest near at hand, from which he took a phial
                  filled with the powerful extract of a rare oriental gum. Stepping back to the side
                  of the couch on which Eleanor lay, he removed the stopper from the phial, and
                  instantly applied the latter to the nostrils of his charge. This treatment he
                  varied by pouring some of the precious liquid into the palm of his hand, and
                  bathing with it the forehead and temples of the fair girl.
               The efforts of Miss Poindexter's companion proved successful, and at the end of
                  about ten minutes, Eleanor slowly opened her eyes and gazed about her. As she
                  recognized the stranger, a shudder ran through her frame, and she murmured, in
                  weak tones:
               "Oh, God, protect me in this peril!"
               With these words she clasped her hands, and with a strong effort she attempted to
                  rise, but as yet her physical system was unequal to the task.
               "God has protected you wonderfully, Eleanor, and will continue to do so," said our
                  heroine's companion, in a soothing voice, but never ceasing his exertions to fully
                  restore the life that had thus begun to flow again in its wonted channels.
               Eleanor started at the language and tone of the stranger, so totally unexpected to
                  her were both, and while he for a minute stopped bathing her forehead, she fixed
                  her eyes upon his countenance, as though she hoped thereby to solve the
                  mystery.
               The broad-rimmed hat had been removed, revealing a high, intellectual forehead and
                  thick chestnut locks, but the dark and heavy sandy beard was still sufficient
                  concealment for the features, and so our heroine's scrutiny went unrewarded.
               That strange fear of Santee and his wiles still clung to Eleanor and oppressed
                  her. A glance or two about the apartment satisfied her that she was the occupant
                  of no house, and as she smelled the damp, earthy odor which pervaded the
                  atmosphere, she was at once convinced that she had been carried to a cave, and
                  that, too, by the strange, inexplicable being who had made such an unfavorable
                  impression upon her from the first moment she had encountered him, and who, also,
                  had so recklessly followed her through the forest.
               "Oh, sir!" she exclaimed, in a voice rendered broken, and yet stronger than
                  before, by excitement and apprehension, "where am I? and by whom was I brought
                  hither? and for what purpose?"
               "You are, Miss Poindexter," replied the unknown, in assuring tones, "in the only
                  place of real safety that you could find within a circuit of fifty miles, after
                  the act you performed to-night. You were brought, hither by one who would give his
                  life freely, for your security, and the purpose of bringing you here is to prevent
                  the successful consummation of a diabolical plot against your happiness."
               Eleanor, by the time her companion ceased speaking, had raised herself partially
                  on her elbow, and, was gazing intently into his countenance. There was such a
                  truthful, straight-forward forward manner
                  about his utterance that very much of her suspicion of him fled, and she
                  exclaimed, half musingly, half interrogatively:
               "To save me from a diabolical plot! from James Santee?"
               "To save you from James Santee, Miss Poindexter!" added the stranger, quickly, and
                  with strong emphasis.
               In an instant each event of her life, from her desertion by her brother Henry, in
                  Philadelphia, up to the very moment that she had been struck from her flying
                  steed, flashed before her like a lightning-painted panorama, and, with more of her
                  suspicion in regard to the character of her companion dispelled, she resumed:
               "And were you, sir, the author of the strange billet that was given to my maid
                  Rosa a day or two ago?"
               "I was."
               "Well, sir," rejoined Eleanor, "you therein mentioned an incident that occurred in
                  Philadelphia, which caused me at first to think that the writer was a Mr. Drayton,
                  whom I had met in that city, and of whom I formed a very high opinion. I sought to
                  settle the point by referring to a note that Mr. Drayton once sent me, but
                  unfortunately the note had been written by a friend."
               "Drayton! Drayton!" rejoined Eleanor's companion, in a musing, and, as our heroine
                  fancied, somewhat envious tone, "I have heard of him. He has traveled in this part
                  of the country, if I am not mistaken."
               "He has," said Eleanor, "and to hear him converse you would think he had resided
                  here from childhood."
               To this the stranger made no answer, but after a pause he said:
               "Miss Poindexter, I know not whether you have noticed the fact that you are not in
                  a house, but a cave; a much safer refuge, however, than any house, at least in
                  this, region. Your safety demands that you remain here for a time, but I shall not
                  compel this course, in proof whereof I assure you that you are at liberty to leave
                  this place whenever you choose. But for your own sake, and the sake of others to
                  whom you are very dear, I do indeed hope that you will remain."
               "You must be aware, kind sir," replied Eleanor, as the speaker paused for the
                  purpose of giving his fair companion an opportunity to speak, "that though I owe
                  you so deep a debt of gratitude for your noble aid, yet there exist certain
                  proprieties—"
               "Your pardon, Miss Poindexter!" interrupted the other, hastily, "I perceive what
                  you would say, and acknowledge its truth and force. But let me pray of you to
                  waive the demands of etiquette; at least for a time. Your stay here shall be made
                  as comfortable as every luxury can make it, and if you desire it your maid Rosa
                  shall bear you company. I will go and fetch her hither at the first
                  opportunity."
               Eleanor was utterly perplexed by the thousand varied emotions and thoughts that
                  the earnest and anxious words of her companion awakened within her, and for
                  several minutes she remained silent. At last she thus addressed the mysterious
                  being beside her:
               "Kind stranger, in the course of Providence we are often brought into situations
                  where an error of our judgment may lead to terrible, even fatal consequences. In
                  such a position I now find myself. I know you speak the truth when you say that
                  there is no safety for me within fifty miles. I would even increase the distance.
                  I am sure that had you intended to harm me—which, in truth, I must acknowledge to
                  you that I suspected at first you did—you would scarcely offer me my liberty when
                  just in your power. I am equally certain that were your intentions evil you would
                  not offer me the company of my maid Rosa, and I therefore, kind friend, throw
                  myself upon your generosity, your honor, and trust myself confidentially to your
                  guidance."
               "And I," answered the stranger, taking the hand our heroine offered him, "promise
                  you, Miss Eleanor, that, as Heaven is my witness, I will keep my word, and that I
                  will protect you, as I have said, with my life, if necessary. And now," he
                  continued, in brisker tones, "I must be gone. It is a few minutes past twelve. I
                  will return as soon after daylight as possible. Rosa is an early riser, is she
                  not?"
               "Oh, sir!" exclaimed Eleanor, neglecting to answer the question as she remembered
                  the message she had sent to Mr. St. Aubyn, "if possible, grant me one favor?"
               "As many as you like," replied the stranger.
               "Before going to the traitor's gathering to-night," resumed Eleanor, "I was
                  impressed that some such result as actually happened would occur, and I therefore
                  sent Rosa over to Mr. St. Aubyn to request him to wait up for me, as I intended to
                  take refuge with him. Rosa was also to remain with his permission at his house
                  until my arrival. If, therefore, it is not too far from here, will you see him and
                  tell him of my safety? for my dear mamma is to visit there to-morrow, and, if she
                  find me not there to meet her, she will think some evil fate has befallen me."
               "It is not very far," said Eleanor's mysterious companion, though our heroine gave
                  him no directions, "and the carrier-dove would not speed thither more straight
                  than I. If Rosa be there, I will bring her back long before daylight. But ere I
                  go," continued the speaker, "I must insure you against becoming lonesome during my
                  absence. In that book-case opposite you will find volumes on all subjects, and
                  this closet, close at hand here, contains refreshment in plenty. This hand-lamp I
                  will light and place upon that shelf. And as I know you are fond of music, you
                  will find in yonder chest a flutina and lute, with whole quires of harmony and
                  melody. There is, besides, a musical box set for eight airs, seven besides your
                  glorious favorite, 'The Star Spangled Banner.'"
               "Oh, then, indeed, time will not hang heavily on my hands!" smiled Eleanor.
               "Then I will bid you farewell until my return!"
               "Farewell, kind protector, and God take you in his holy keeping."
               The next moment the strange host was gone from the sight of our heroine into the
                  passage which led to the outside entrance of the cave.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               ONE OF REBELLION'S FIRST FRUITS.
               UPON emerging into the open air, the mysterious friend of Eleanor Poindexter—for
                  his actions thus far entitled him to be called such—carefully concealed the mouth
                  of the subterranean passage by which ingress was had to the cave. Then, stepping
                  three paces to the right, the bushes parting, as we have elsewhere remarked, with
                  the utmost ease, he seized a thick, wild grape vine, that sent several twining
                  stems up along the trunk and into the foliage of a large tree. With an ease that
                  showed previous practice, our strange friend using the tough, strong vine as a
                  ladder made his way up into the tree.
               Close to this tree stood several others, and through the foliage of each the grape
                  vine passed, actually forming a safe and convenient bridge to a tree that stood on
                  the outer edge of the thicket, through which Eleanor's preserver had previously
                  passed. Here the vine had been deflected and rooted in the earth beneath, thus
                  making a second natural ladder like the, one up into the tree in the thicket. The
                  most consummate art had been exerted to make this whole work resemble nature's
                  handicraft so closely as to deceive even the most inquisitive eyes. And most
                  successfully had the object aimed at been attained, for the lines of vision from
                  every portion of the forest had been so thoroughly intercepted by trees and vines
                  that a person might, with impunity ascend, cross and descend the vine-ladder and
                  bridge in broad daylight, no matter if a hundred pursuers were within as many
                  yards. A fugitive might possibly be discovered by any one standing on the top of
                  the ridge; but, as the latter was everywhere covered, as with a garment, by the
                  impenetrable thicket, these, was absolutely no risk from this point.
               As, however, a full account of this strange subterranean retreat will be recorded
                  farther on in our narrative, we will at once follow the footsteps of the
                  mysterious stranger.
               Quickly finding his horse, he unfastened him, and with as much ease as though the
                  sun were shining, led him to a bridle path. Then mounting the animal he rode away
                  in a direction that soon brought him upon the main road. Once here the gallant
                  steed was put at his best pace, and in a comparatively short time the singular
                  friend, of our heroine was within sight of Mr. St. Aubyn's mansion, not that the
                  soft starlight made it discernible, but because it was illumined by lurid flames,
                  which were just bursting through the roof and sides of the barn that stood but a
                  short distance behind it.
               By the red and increasing glare the rider quickly distinguished also a mob of men,
                  who, as the sparks and, cinders shot up from the consuming building, whooped and
                  yelled with savage delight like so many wild Indians. Motives of prudence induced
                  him to halt, and, as he did so he said:
               "Santee's work, as certain as fate! St. Aubyn is noted as a Union man, and perhaps
                  Santee knew or suspected that Eleanor would take refuge with him after breaking up
                  that vile meeting. He has, therefore, instigated the infuriated mob to take
                  vengeance on St. Aubyn, whom, however, he had already proscribed."
               "Is that you, sah?" almost whispered a low voice coming from the clump of bushes
                  against which the stranger's steed was standing.
               "Who are you?" exclaimed the horseman, astonished at finding a human being in such
                  close proximity, "who are you? Come out of that bush!"
               "Oh, I's Rosa, sah! Rosa! Don't you knows me, sah? Don't you 'member I give a
                  letter, sah, from you to Missey Eleanor? don't you 'member now, sah?"
               With his second exclamation, the rider had quickly drawn a pistol, and, doubtless
                  struck at that moment with the truth of the adage, that "delays are dangerous,"
                  Rosa hurriedly scrambled from her retreat, and presented herself before our
                  mysterious friend, in order that he might recognize her.
               "Ah, Rosa! it is you, eh?" replied the horseman, replacing his weapon, and
                  speaking in milder tones than before. "But what are you doing here, Rosa? I
                  thought Miss Eleanor sent you to stay at Mr. St. Aubyn's house?"
               "Yes, sah, so she did, but I'll 'splain everything in a minute. Oh sah! ef it
                  hadn't 'a been fur lovin Missey Eleanor so much, I'd 'a been skeered to def, sah!
                  I knows I would!"
               "Well, Rosa, just be quiet a moment or two," said the stranger, perceiving that
                  the mulatto was considerably nervous, "and then coolly tell me what you wish to.
                  No harm shall befall you."
               "Oh, sah! I'se not skeered fur mese'f! I'se skeered fur Missey Eleanor. She told
                  me just after supper to come over hyear to Mr. St. Aubyn's, an' tell him she wuz
                  'a comin' over hyear herse'f, an' to set up fur her. I know'd there wuz somethin'
                  wrong sah, an' I asked Missey Eleanor what's do matter. But she told me to mind
                  what she said, and off she went. So, I come over hyear to Mr. St. Aubyn's, an'
                  told him what Missey Eleanor said, an' he told me all right, an' told me to stay
                  till Missey Eleanor come. But she didn't come, sah! an' we waited, an' waited, an'
                  waited, till a little while ago, when de fust thing we heered all them men 'a
                  comin' up de road. An' when they got to de house, they busted in de doors, an'
                  hollered, an' hollered, sah, like a million debbils, sah! An' one man, Mister
                  Santee, his name is, he run at Mr. Aubyn, sah, with a big knife, an' grabled him,
                  an' told him Missey Eleanor wuz dar, an' ef he didn't give her up he'd kill him,
                  an' burn everything up. An' some o' de other men, sah, they grabbed Miss Nellie
                  Aubyn, a' hugged her, an' kissed her 'gainst her will, sah, 'cause she squealed
                  murder an' they kep' on a' huggin' an' kissin' her, till Mister Henry Poindexter
                  run in an' got her away, sah! An' when Mrs. Aubyn got down on her knees an' prayed
                  to 'em not to 'buse an' 'sult Miss Nellie, they pulled off her wig, sah, an' hit
                  her in de face with it, an' laffed at
                  her, an' called her a d——d old Union woman, sah!
               "Oh, sah! they cut up wicked, an' when Mister Aubyn an' de two young gen'lemen
                  began to fight, why they jus' run on 'em, an' trampled 'em under their feet. Jus'
                  then I thought mebbe Missey Eleanor 'll come an' git hurt without knowin' what's'
                  agoin' on, an' I run out an' run froo de men outside de house, an' come across de
                  field to here, 'cause Missey Eleanor 'll come dis way, an' I want to tell her to
                  go back, sah."
               "Are you sure, Rosa," asked the stranger, as the mulatto ended her awkward but
                  vivid and truthful account, "that Mr. Santee was among those villains yonder?"
               "Yes, sah, jus' as sure as def!"
               "Well, Rosa," resumed the horseman, "Miss Eleanor is safe, and I have come to take
                  you to her. Would you not like to go to her?"
               "Oh, sah, 'deed an 'deed I would! I'll run every step of de way after you,
                  sah!"
               "I will not let you do that, though, Rosa," replied the other, "so mount behind me
                  and you shall ride to her."
               Why no suspicion of the stranger's intentions arose in the mind of Rosa it would
                  be impossible to say, but none did, and scarcely had the kind invitation been
                  extended to her, ere, with the assistance of the rider, she was seated behind
                  him.
               The mysterious man then casting a look over at the work of riot and ruin, which
                  seemed still to be going on, turned his horse's head back in the direction he had
                  come, and set off at a trot. In due time he reached the point where the bridle
                  path of the forest struck the main road, and here he halted.
               "Rosa," said he, as he did so, "you must be blindfolded before you go any further,
                  for the place in which your mistress is concealed must not be known even to her
                  best friends."
               "Oh, sah," pleaded the mulatto, "please don't! I wouldn't tell anybody ef I was
                  roasted in fire! 'deed an' 'deed, sah, I wouldn't!"
               Rosa's earnest solicitation, however, was unavailing. Her companion persisted in
                  his demands, and threatened, in the most determined tones, to use force if she did
                  not submit.
               In an instant a terrible suspicion flashed upon the hitherto unsuspecting girl
                  that the name of her beloved mistress had been used to deceive her, and that she
                  was to be made the instrument of ill either to the former or herself. To conceive
                  this idea was to think also of escape, and as, she had by this time dismounted she
                  bounded away down the road. But she had not taken thirty steps ere she was grasped
                  in the vice-like grip of the stranger, who, however, did not handle her roughly,
                  nor lose his temper. He promptly prevented Rosa from making any outcry by
                  thrusting a handkerchief into her mouth, which done he proceeded in an equally
                  summary manner to bandage her eyes.
               "Silly girl!" said he to his captive, as she struggled for her freedom, "I am not
                  going to harm you! be still! you cannot escape!"
               But with her shackles Rosa seemed also to have put off the craven characteristic
                  of the slave, and, refusing to yield, she fought fiercely with her captor, who
                  only conquered her at last by threatening to take her life if she did not submit.
                  This threat, and the cold muzzle of a pistol pressed against her forehead, had the
                  desired effect, and Rosa sullenly allowed the stranger to lead her back and place
                  her in the saddle which he had vacated. In this manner he led her through the
                  forest, until he came to the thicket-grown ridge, beneath which Eleanor Poindexter
                  was entombed.
               The mouth of the cave he reached in the same manner as when he bore our heroine
                  thither, and a minute later Rosa, all gagged and blinded as she was, stood in the
                  presence of Eleanor.
               "Do not be alarmed, Miss Poindexter," said the stranger, addressing the latter,
                  "Rosa is unharmed. She naturally enough suspected me of evil intentions, and I was
                  obliged to use a little compulsion. She will quickly recover when she learnt that
                  she is with friends. Rosa," he continued speaking to the mulatto, as he unbandaged
                  her eyes, "here is your mistress."
               As Rosa's sight was restored to her, her tongue was also loosed by the removal of
                  the gag. The scene that ensued can only be imagined. Poor Rosa, overcome by
                  mingled joy and surprise, wept and laughed by turns, and begged the strangers'
                  pardon a dozen times for the trouble she had given him. This was readily granted,
                  and in twenty minutes Rosa was happier than if she had been at home, for she now
                  felt assured of the safety of "Missey Eleanor," as she affectionately called her
                  mistress.
               "Miss Eleanor," said the stranger, at length, "necessity forces me to absent
                  myself at least for some hours from your presence. Ill has befallen your friends
                  the St. Aubyns, through the malign influence of Santee. I may not tarry to give
                  you any details, Rosa will do so. One promise you must make to me, however, ere I
                  leave, and that is,that under no circumstances will you or Rosa attempt to leave
                  this retreat while I am gone."
               "That promise, kind friend, I willingly make," answered Eleanor, "on one
                  condition."
               "On what condition?" asked the stranger.
               "That you will tell me the name of one to whom I owe such an overwhelming debt of
                  gratitude."
               The other drew forth a card, and, with a bow, placed it in Eleanor's hand.
               "I shall never forget you, Mr. Iredell, while memory survives," said the fair and
                  grateful girl, after glancing at the boldly penned autograph, and extending her
                  hand to her hitherto, and even now, unknown friend.
               The latter pressed the taper fingers and waxlike palm long and warmly before
                  releasing them and taking his departure.
               Once more he had crossed the airy bridge of grapevine and set off through the
                  quiet, gloomy forest for the main road, and, while we leave Rosa to impart to
                  Eleanor the terrible story of the St. Aubyn outrage, we shall again follow the
                  mysterious Iredell.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE ASSASSINATION.
               IT yet lacked more than two hours of sunrise as Iredell rode up to the mansion of
                  Mr. St. Aubyn, which, fortunately, owing to the wind setting in from the proper
                  direction, escaped the fate of the barn. The latter was, by this time, a heap of
                  dull red embers, and whose fitful flashes, as a fresh breeze awakened the
                  smouldering demon, caused the shadow of the mansion to rush into the adjoining
                  field as though unrecovered from its previous fright. How long since the mob had
                  left, Mr. Iredell, of course, could not conjecture. He did not advance immediately
                  to the house, but halted at the outer fence, or rather where the outer fence had
                  stood, and listened for a sound that might betray the presence of any person. But
                  the terrible silence that brooded over the scene was unbroken, except by the
                  snapping and cracking of the remains of the fire, and after a pause of several
                  minutes Iredell went forward, and, dismounting, tried the hall door. This was
                  fastened on the inside, showing that some one was within. Whether the present
                  inmates were members of the family, or some of the mob, however, was a matter the
                  settling of which involved some risk. The risk Iredell promptly assumed, and
                  knocking heavily with his knuckles, for the proper knocker had been torn away, he
                  anxiously awaited a response. Thrice did he deliver his summons ere he got any
                  reply, and then a trembling female voice exclaimed:
               "For God's sake, do us no more harm!"
               "I am a friend, Mrs. St. Aubyn!" instantly interrupted the traveler. "My name is
                  Iredell. Do you not know my voice?"
               "Yes, yes!" replied the same trembling tones as before. "I will take down the
                  bar."
               A moment or so later the door was opened, and Iredell entered the mansion, whiled
                  Mrs. St. Aubyn herself—for every servant had been driven away—replaced the
                  bar.
               "Oh, Mr. Iredell," said she, as she led her visitor into an adjoining parlor,
                  "surely the wicked one himself must have been let loose in the land, and selected
                  my family as his victims. Just before twelve o'clock several hundred maddened
                  wretches, led on, or rather urged on, by James Santee, made a most murderous
                  attack upon our house. They burned the barn and destroyed all they could lay hands
                  on, as you can see for yourself. They vilely insulted both myself and daughter,
                  and how they maltreated Mr. St. Aubyn and my two sons you shall judge. Here they
                  are."
               As Mrs. St. Aubyn concluded, she guided our friend to a bed, which had been pulled
                  by the mob from one of the chambers to the parlor, and there half emptied of its
                  contents. Upon it now lay Mr. St. Aubyn and his two sons, all three with their
                  clothes torn, and their features cut, bruised, and bloody. They had all, too, been
                  insensible up to within about five minutes, and consequently scarcely recognized
                  Iredell.
               The latter, with words of consolation and encouragement forthwith proceeded to
                  render the victims all the surgical aid in his power, and in half an hour he had
                  the satisfaction of seeing them so far recovered as to be able to converse with
                  him and Mrs. St. Aubyn. From them he received an account of the late attack which
                  was materially the same as that he had already received from Rosa; but there were
                  one or two additional points which of course the latter could not have
                  ascertained. The first was that the State Vigilance Committee, of
                  which Santee was an officer, and the elder and younger Poindexter members, had,
                  through Santee, warned the St. Aubyn's to leave the State within ten days, under
                  pain of a still fiercer attack than the present one. And the second was that
                  Nellie St. Aubyn had, after being rescued by Henry Poindexter from the insults of
                  his companions, consented to go with him, as the mother understood, to take
                  shelter with his father or Santee—which it was she did not know.
               The heart-broken mother burst into tears, as she added:
               "Ah, Mr. Iredell, my poor Nellie, I fear, is too deeply enamored of young
                  Poindexter! But, perhaps I wrong her! She was not in her right senses!"
               The lips of both the sons quivered, and their brows contracted, while Mr. St.
                  Aubyn pressed his hands upon his face and groaned deeply as Mrs. St. Aubyn
                  spoke.
               Iredell remained in conversation with his afflicted friends until the sun began to
                  rise, when, promising to see them soon again, and bidding them farewell, he took
                  his departure.
               It would be natural to suppose that our singular friend was weary, but, apparently
                  indifferent to fatigue, he rode away in the direction of Palmetto Plantation,
                  which in due time he reached. He was astonished as he neared it to see a servant
                  at such an early hour tying up the shutters with crape, and, noticing a negro
                  leaning against the fence, and looking long the road, he asked him what had
                  occurred.
               "Massa Poindexter waz stabbed froo do heart, sah, up at de meetin' las' night.
                  Somebody, nobody seen who, jabbed a big knife into him an' dat wuz de end ob ole
                  Massa, sah!"
               "Assassinated!" exclaimed Iredell, in amazement.
               "Dunno, sah, 'bout dat; but I knows Massa had a big knife jabbed into his heart
                  froo an' froo de middle."
               "Was his murderer seized?" asked Iredell.
               "No, sah!" replied the black in a tone not very sorrowful, and Iredell, seeing
                  that he was acquainted merely with the general fact, rode on.
               Proceeding about half a mile he met a gentleman, mounted like himself, and whom he
                  recognized as an intimate friend of Mr. Poindexter's, although almost a stranger
                  to himself. Of him Iredell inquired into the particulars of the murder, but
                  learned only that the affair was involved in an impenetrable mystery.
               
               In a paroxysm of anger Mr. Poindexter had sprung toward his daughter Eleanor,
                  after her unexpected action—which the narrator detailed very fully to his
                  listener, supposing the latter to be utterly ignorant of it. In the excitement and
                  jostling that ensued, some unknown person had driven a knife into the back of his
                  victim, piercing his heart, and thereby causing his instant death. What motive
                  could have induced the bloody act was as much a mystery as the deed itself, for,
                  though so passionate and headstrong, Mr. Poindexter was courted as a friend, and
                  often used to boast, that he had not an enemy in the world.
               Iredell bade the gentleman good morning, and continued his journey. As he rode
                  along he pondered deeply on the terrible homicide, and thought it passing strange
                  that he should have heard nothing of it from the St. Aubyns. He could not rid
                  himself of a suspicion that if Santee had not perpetrated the bloody act himself
                  he was cognizant of who did. For it would have been natural to suppose that
                  Santee, being the leader of the mob, would have added the murder of Mr. Poindexter
                  to the supposed harboring of Eleanor as an incentive to his willing sans culottes. But neither had he nor Henry Poindexter
                  mentioned the occurrence while at the St. Aubyns. Henry, however, had not occupied
                  a seat on the stage, but had been talking to friends in the body of the meeting
                  when the tragedy took place, and, consequently, he might have started with the
                  rest on their vengeful mission without being aware of his father's murder. The
                  more Iredell thought upon the matter, the stronger became his conviction, in
                  regard at least to the complicity of Santee.
               Suddenly the question occurred to him, how should he break the sad news to
                  Eleanor? for though her father had behaved so unfatherly toward her, yet the
                  springs of filial love were too deeply heated in her heart to be choked or
                  destroyed, even by a long series of wrongs. It was a duty, however, which, no
                  matter how painful, he deemed he ought promptly to perform, and, trusting that
                  when the moment came the proper language would come of itself, he rode on in a
                  direction that brought him to the vicinity of the cave.
               At the distance of a quarter of a mile from the latter, stood a neat and well kept
                  cottage, deeply embayed, in fact almost concealed, in the midst of a clump of
                  beautiful English Lindens that had been imported at a very heavy expense. To a
                  little stable in the rear of this cottage Iredell straightway led his steed,
                  which, in truth, sorely needed rest and feeding, and, after grooming him himself,
                  he stepped into the cottage.
               The old black dame whom our friend addressed as Polly, and who was alone in the
                  kitchen—her husband being out in search of wild honey—seemed in no way surprised
                  at the arrival of the owner of the cottage for such in fact was Iredell. On the
                  contrary she proceeded, after wishing him good morning, to prepare a meal for him
                  as methodically as though he had just come down from his chamber. While she was so
                  engaged, he conversed pleasantly with her on casual topics, and when he had
                  refreshed himself he took his rifle from its rack, and went out, saying as he did
                  so:
               "I am going on a little shooting 
                     expidition
                     expedition
                  , Polly; if any one calls, tell them so. Do you understand?"
               "De Lor' bres you, Mister Iredell, I understan' you!" replied the negress, who
                  added in a low tone to herself, as the door closed upon the former, "dat dar man's
                  de queerest man an' de best man what de good Lord ebber put on dis earf!"
               By a roundabout way Iredell reached the cave, shooting as he went, several fine
                  birds as an addition to the larder of his underground hotel.
               He found Eleanor deeply engaged in the library to which he had directed her
                  attention, while Rosa slept soundly upon a rough pallet, which had been improvised
                  during his absence.
               Our heroine's first question after greeting her kind friend, was in regard to the
                  St. Aubyns, of whose sufferings Rosa had given her a most vivid account. She was
                  deeply touched with sorrow when informed of the departure of Nellie St. Aubyn in
                  the company of her brother Henry, and deplored her fair companion's lack of
                  firmness and judgment. When, however, Iredell little by little broke to her the
                  awful fate of her father, she found her own firmness unequal to the task of
                  bearing herself up, and, burying her face in her hands, she grieved with that
                  silent, internal grief, which is ten times more poignant than the sorrow that
                  finds its expression in weeping and wringing of hands.
               "Oh! Mr. Iredell," she moaned, after a long silence, "to think that my dear father
                  should die so ignobly, and in such a cause!"
               Tenderly did Iredell seek to console the afflicted girl, and at last succeeded, at
                  least to the extent of obtaining her promise that, as much as possible, she would
                  endeavor to regard her misfortune in the light of one of those inscrutable
                  dispensations of an all-wise Providence, which, though apparently misfortunes at
                  first, afterward became merciful blessings.
               There was now however, another matter which assumed the utmost importance. It was
                  that of Eleanor's future. After the barbarous usage of the St. Aubyns by Santee
                  and his minions, she especially could expect no consideration whatever, and yet
                  she could not remain in her present subterranean abode a great length of time.
               For whole hours together did our heroine and Iredell, to whom she owed so much,
                  canvass this subject, but no definite course of action was arrived at for more
                  than a week. By this time, however, a plan, which Eleanor's strange friend
                  originated, was set for execution.
               Under his guidance and protection, she, accompanied by the faithful Rosa, was to
                  make her way to Tennessee, in which State was the valuable plantation left to her
                  by her uncle. This she was, if possible, to sell for cash, and then set out for
                  the North, where she was to be joined by her mother, if Iredell could prevail on
                  the latter to adopt such a course. Eleanor entertained not the slightest doubt of
                  his success, for, besides the love which she knew her mother had for her, she was
                  aware, also, that Mrs. Poindexter had always wished to reside in the North, but
                  had invariably given way to the reverse inclination of her husband. So sure,
                  indeed, was she that her mother would
                  come, that she consented not to attempt to see her before starting on her journey,
                  a proceeding which would have been attended with great risk to all concerned.
               Every sun that now rose and set saw public matters becoming more and more stormy,
                  and consequently the departure of our lovely heroine from her retreat was fixed at
                  the earliest practicable date after the decision had been arrived at.
               Accordingly, just past midnight, ten days subsequent to the eventful night that
                  had witnessed her own glorious vindication of the national cause and banner, the
                  murderous attack on the St. Aubyn family, and the tragic fate of her father,
                  Eleanor Poindexter issued from her place of refuge, preceded by Iredell, and
                  followed by Rosa. Though the latter had been blindfolded by Iredell, upon being
                  brought hither, he had been so deeply impressed since then by her display of the
                  noblest qualities of mind that he now dispensed with his previous precaution.
               Three horses stood ready saddled outside the thicket, and, after a short delay,
                  during which Iredell was readjusting the disturbed bushes, the trio mounted and
                  rode away through the forest to the main road. Here the animals were given the
                  rein, and ere day dawned they had carried their riders twenty miles on their way
                  to Tennessee. A longer distance might have been accomplished, but Iredell at this
                  point had a friend on whom he could depend, with whom he determined to rest until
                  the next night.
               In this manner he reached Atlanta, Georgia, in safety with his charge, and hero
                  putting up the horses he took passage by railroad for Memphis, Tennessee.
                  Eleanor's plantation lay some three or four miles above the latter city,
                  immediately on the bank of the Mississippi.
               Previous to reaching Chattanooga a difficulty occurred which almost proved fatal
                  to the success of Iredell's plans; but, with consummate adroitness, he overcame
                  it, and from that time out the journey was without any incident worthy of record.
                  Great good fortune seemed to await our heroine at every turn, for when she arrived
                  in Memphis she found that Mr. Lander, the owner of the plantation next to her own,
                  was exceedingly anxious to purchase the latter. He offered a much larger price
                  than he otherwise would have done if payment was allowed in Northern funds, which
                  he was fearful—although he did not say so—would soon become worthless. Iredell,
                  who conducted the transaction on behalf of his fair protege, shrewdly kept silent
                  in regard to the intentions of Eleanor, and finally obtained a second additional
                  sum before closing out the sale.
               Mr. Lander congratulated himself hugely on his sharpness, while Mr. Iredell
                  quietly enjoyed his own astuteness. His grateful client persistently
                  endeavored—all the way from Memphis to Cairo, to which city he accompanied her—to
                  gain his acceptance of a handsome sum, to cover the expenses he had necessarily
                  been under. He as persistently refused, but at last, just as they were about to
                  exchange farewells, he compromised the matter by asking our heroine for a small
                  gold ring that she wore. Eleanor hesitated a moment, and then, slipping the
                  ornament from her finger ger, she placed it upon one of his, saying, as she did
                  so:
               "That, Mr. Iredell, is a larger price than my fortune, but you are the more
                  welcome to it on that account, and I am sure that when you see my dear mother and
                  tell her how you obtained it, she will say the same. She gave it to me; my name is
                  engraved within it."
               The recipient would have returned so precious a memento, but Eleanor forbade
                  it.
               The train, which was to bear her preserver back to the South, was now nearly ready
                  to start, and Eleanor, as she held his hand, did not seek to check the tears that
                  trickled down her cheeks. At last, the final bell rang, and, as its clangor fell
                  upon her ear, our heroine, with that innocence that is untrammeled by the
                  restraints of etiquette, drew her friend toward her, and, tenderly imprinting a
                  kiss upon his cheek, said, in trembling tones:
               "Mr. Iredell, I kiss you for my dear mother; when you see her give it to her, and
                  tell her I will await her in Philadelphia. God bless you, dear friend! God bless
                  you! I hope we shall meet again."
               "And God bless you, dear Eleanor!" was the response, made in a very husky
                  voice.
               The next moment the panting locomotive rushed away.
               Eleanor Poindexter's simple and impressive act of affection was witnessed by a
                  crowd of spectators, and a subdued murmur of applause ran from lip to lip.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE ANGEL'S MISSION.
               SAD, sad, indeed, were the feelings that welled up within our heroine's bosom as
                  she turned away from the depot to reach the hotel in which Mr. Iredell had
                  succeeded in procuring rooms for her. The last six weeks afforded truly a dark and
                  repulsive retrospect, while the future was, like the future of other mortals, a
                  sea of uncertainty.
               Such an uninviting town as Cairo possessed no attractions for Eleanor, and she,
                  therefore, soon took passage for Philadelphia, in which city she was to await the
                  appearance of her mother.
               A month passed away, and as yet no tidings had reached our heroine, who fondly
                  anticipated the pleasure of soon being joined by Mrs. Poindexter. Finally, at the
                  expiration of six weeks, a letter arrived, which she noticed was directed in the
                  handwriting of Mr. Iredell.
               Impatiently she opened the missive which, however, she found had been already
                  violated, most likely by some rebel post-office official.
               Ere she read far, a sentence informed her of the sudden illness of her mother, who
                  had been taken sick immediately after the burial of Mr. Poindexter. A succeeding
                  sentence told her how her mother had rapidly grown worse, and further along was an
                  account, couched in as gentle words as possible, of how the dear one had called
                  for her Eleanor before she expired, and how she had prayed that Heaven might bless
                  her exiled child.
               Here was indeed a terrible blow! Never dreaming that death would interfere, and
                  cut short a life so cherished, Eleanor, as we have elsewhere stated, had, at time
                  of setting out for Memphis, foregone the risk and delight of a parting interview
                  with her mother. And now she might commune with the loved one only when she had
                  herself put off the garments of this life and passed on into the land of
                  shadows.
               The well-chosen words of consolation and endearment, that made the conclusion of
                  the letter, softened somewhat the heart-breaking intelligence, and added a degree
                  or two to the strength of a feeling for the author, which had already passed that
                  of mere friendship.
               "I gave your kiss, dearest Eleanor," ended the writer, "to your mother, as you
                  desired me. I imprinted it upon her cold cheek as she reposed so stilly and softly
                  in her shroud. Never performed I so holy a duty. But let me not dwell upon your
                  bereavement longer than to point you to that Heavenly source from which alone
                  flows the real balm for wounded hearts. I shall be unable to reach Philadelphia
                  for some time yet, but I shall continue to hold you in the deepest reverence, and,
                  allow me to add, affection.
               "P. S.—Sealed in the inclosed paper I send you a long tress of soft brown hair,
                  mixed, as you will see, with silvery strands. I need not tell you whose it is. I
                  obtained from the lady who attended your mother double as much as I
                  herewith send you; but fearing that, perhaps, in these troublous times, this
                  letter might miscarry, or be lost, I retained one-half. I will preserve it
                  carefully, and, when I see you again, will add it to what I now send, or, in case
                  of loss, will replace the latter with it."
               The little sealed paper referred to had not yet been opened by Eleanor in her
                  eagerness to read the accompanying letter, but now she carefully, reverently broke
                  the seal, and, taking out the sacred memento, pressed it to her lips. Then,
                  wrapping it again in its envelope, she placed it next her heart, and murmured:
               "God forever bless you, Mr. Iredell, for your tender forethought and
                  solicitude."
               Eleanor was now an orphan, and, in reality, nearly friendless, for, though the
                  fact of her being a Southern refugee awakened for her the good wishes of the
                  people among whom she found herself, yet she had no one to whom she could confide
                  her sorrows, and from whom she could draw consolation, excepting poor, faithful
                  Rosa. Yet a better or truer friend she could not have found, for, though
                  uneducated, the latter continued to display all those finer qualities of mind
                  which had originally caused Eleanor Poindexter to strike from her the degrading
                  chains of the slave and make her free.
               Being of an active temperament, our heroine could not endure idleness; and it was
                  therefore her constant aim to find employment, not only for her head and heart,
                  but also for her hands. Her philanthropic efforts were directed principally in
                  behalf of the families of those noble men who had, in a vast number of instances,
                  rushed to the battle's front ere they had time to attend properly to the wants of
                  their dependent wives and children. The greater portion of the proceeds of her
                  immense fortune she devoted to the great cause, and many hundred hearts were made
                  thrice happy by her munificence.
               Suddenly came the tidings of the first really great battle of the war—Bull's Run.
                  After the first news thereof, every hour brought fresh and heart-rending accounts
                  of the sufferings of the wounded Union heroes, many of whom had been left to the
                  after-horrors of battle. Surgeons were lacking, nurses were not to be had, and
                  urgent appeals came for both, and also for lint and bandages.
               Not for a moment did Eleanor attempt to resist the inclination that arose within
                  her to offer her services, and, ere she had finished perusing a graphic detail of
                  a scene that had occurred in a hurriedly made hospital just beyond Centreville,
                  she resolved to devote herself to the welfare of the sick and wounded soldiers in
                  the field. There were thousands of women who would attend the city hospitals, but
                  none would venture to the field, where danger and hardship lurked in every
                  step.
               "It is my solemn duty!" said Eleanor to herself, "and ere to-day's sun sets I will
                  be on my way."
               The rest of the morning, and part of the afternoon, our 
                     heorine
                     heroine
                   spent in arranging her own affairs,and purchasing quantities of little
                  articles that she judged would be most
                  acceptable to the suffering soldiers.
               With her precious freight, and accompanied by Rosa, who insisted, against all
                  remonstrances, on going with her, Eleanor Poindexter, the child of such luxuriant
                  affluence, set forth upon her mission of mercy and peril.
               At Washington she experienced no delay in obtaining the necessary passes, and in
                  due time she reached a point above Centreville, at which were the outer Union
                  pickets. Like a ministering angel, she had, during her progress hither,
                  distributed fully three-fourths of her supply of delicacies. Just before her
                  arrival at the point referred to military necessities had compelled a contraction
                  of the Federal lines. The order, therefore, had unfortunately been obeyed so
                  promptly that a number of wounded men had been left behind in a wood about a mile
                  west of Centreville. What rendered the matter more painful was that the helpless
                  patients had received no attention for over twenty-four hours. No sooner did
                  Eleanor hear this than she resolved to visit them at once, despite the peril she
                  ran of being captured by the rebel cavalry.
               Major Williams, the Federal commandant, had but awhile before asked vainly for
                  volunteers to go to the relief of the wounded men, and he was about to order a
                  company out for the duty at the time our heroine arrived. This fact he stated to
                  her, in hopes that she would be dissuaded thereby from her own resolution; but
                  after listening to him she said:
               "Major, surely your men misunderstood you. Will you grant me permission to ask for
                  volunteers?"
               "As you choose," replied the officer, courteously; "but I fear you will have no
                  success," he added.
               "We shall see," said Eleanor in pleasant tones.
               One regiment had been already drawn up for some duty or other, and, riding down
                  its front, accompanied by his fair companion, Major Williams stated that Miss
                  Poindexter had come all the way from Philadelphia in order that she might devote
                  herself entirely to the wants of the sick and wounded soldiers.
               "She intends," said he, "to go over to the hospital in the woods west of
                  Centreville. She would like to have an escort; but, if she cannot obtain one, she
                  says she will go by herself. Now, then, who will volunteer for the duty, or rather
                  the pleasure?"
               Scarcely had the Major ceased speaking, when, with single accord, every man
                  stepped forward one pace, and, removing their caps, cheered wildly, and offered
                  instantly to accompany the lovely young lady on her mission of mercy.
               "I acknowledge myself vanquished, Miss Poindexter," said Major Williams, turning
                  to Eleanor, "but I still wish you would be persuaded to remain here. You know not
                  into what hands you will fall if you should be taken by the enemy."
               "I place my trust in God, Major," answered Eleanor, with such simple, dignified
                  faith, that the rough soldier was touched; and he sought no further to dissuade
                  her.
               One hundred and fifty men, partly from each company, were selected, and, forming
                  about their beautiful charge and her indomitable servant, Rosa, they marched out,
                  amidst the cheers of their companions, toward Centreville. The captain who led
                  them—Stevens by name—had seen service in Mexico, and was as prudent as he was
                  brave. He chanced, also, to be well acquainted with that region of country, a fact
                  that enabled him to march by another road than the one generally used.
               The hospital was reached without incident, and our heroine immediately proceeded
                  to dispense her luxuries and kind words of consolation. Flitting from pallet to
                  pallet—constructed of trees, branches and straw—and from stretcher to stretcher,
                  she administered here a little jelly, there a gill of cordial; to one poor fellow
                  a sip of wine, and to another a copious drink of water, for which he had been
                  begging for hours.
               Never before in her life had Eleanor witnessed so much horror accumulated, and on
                  every pale or grimy face over which she bent she dropped her pitying tears. There
                  were forty-five patients alive, and four dead. One wretched man, who, after having
                  been shot through the body, had had his eyes ruthlessly thrust out with a bayonet,
                  exclaimed, as she gave him a draught of water:
               "Oh, God bless you! God bless you, dear lady! I wish I had my eyes again, only for
                  a minute, that I might look up into your beautiful face, for I know you are as
                  beautiful as you are good!"
               A boy who was dying, as she pushed back his glossy curls and pressed her cool hand
                  upon his burning brow, exclaimed, in the ecstacy of his delirium:
               "I knew you would come, mother! I've been praying for you to come all day! Kiss
                  me, mother!"
               Instantly the request was granted, and with a satisfied smile upon his pallid
                  features, the recipient expired.
               On the next pallet lay a stalwart, bearded man, unable to speak by reason of a
                  ball having completely cut out his tongue, and also wounded him through both jaws.
                  He was also mortally wounded in the side. In his hand he clutched a pocket
                  picture-case, on one side of which was photographed a fair young woman with a babe
                  sleeping in her arms, and on the other side of which was written, in letters a
                  little straggling, but plain:
               "John Collins, Fire Zouaves, Mercer street, New York—his dear wife
                  and baby."
               He placed the case in Eleanor's hands, after pressing it to his lips, and made her
                  to understand by motions that he would die happy if the picture were returned to
                  his wife.
               From several others Eleanor received cherished articles, love mementoes, charms,
                  which, alas! had not charmed aside the bullet—pocket-books containing money, and
                  farewell messages of affection to be delivered to mothers, fathers, wives,
                  sisters, and sweethearts.
               At last, amidst the reiterated blessings of her grateful patients, our heroine had
                  accomplished all in her power. But this alone did not satisfy her. The wounded men
                  were still in danger of capture, and she forthwith proposed to Captain Stevens
                  that eighty or ninety of his men be detailed to bear their unfortunate comrades to
                  a place of safety.
               "That'll be a big job, Miss Poindexter," replied the Captain, "but we guess we'll
                  run most any risk, after what you've done. Men," he continued, "the lady wants us
                  to carry our comrades back into the
                  lines. You'll do it, I know, to please her. I'll relieve you now and then, and the
                  job'll come easier."
               "We'll do it! We'll do anything she says!" answered the self same men who had
                  before been too much afraid to volunteer for the very mission they were now
                  accomplishing.
               In as short a time as possible, the dead men were buried, and Eleanor's escort,
                  bearing among them the surviving inmates of the hospital, set out on their
                  return.
               Half the distance was passed in safety, and all were congratulating themselves on
                  a successful issue of their expedition, when a body of between seventy and eighty
                  rebel cavalry came dashing after them.
               To the undisciplined soldier, unable as he is to appreciate the safety that lies
                  in a cool and determined use of his bayonet, nothing is more dreadful than a
                  cavalry charge;*
                   and on the occasion to which we allude it is quite likely that, but for
                  the timely and heroic action of Eleanor Poindexter, Captain Stevens would have
                  found himself left entirely alone. Seeing the men wavering, our heroine checked
                  her horse, and then urging him rearward along the files, she exclaimed:
               
                  
                  *It is a well known fact that a thousand veteran infantry men can defy and
                     laugh to scorn the fiercest onslaught of four times their number of the best
                     cavalry that can be put in the field. The reader doubtless remembers the
                     dread that the mere appearance of Stuart's rebel horsemen used to strike
                     into the Union volunteers. But now, and for some time past, a picket of a
                     few men, armed with the bayonet, will not only face, but actually defeat and
                     even capture twice their number of Stuart's boldest riders—W. B.
               
               "None but cowards will fly!"
               These magic words, and their still more magic tones, instantly stopped the
                  wavering, and Captain Stevens, taking quick advantage of the moment,
                  thundered:
               "Company, about face! shoulder arms!"
               The men had been well drilled in "the manual," and came from a "shift" to a
                  "shoulder" with precision.
               "Front rank," quickly added the commander, "resist cavalry—rear rank, present—fire
                  by rank, ready, aim—steady, now—wait for the word—steady—fire!"
               The charging column of maddened steeds, infuriated by the spurs, and shouts, and
                  yells of their riders, struck the gleaming line of bayonets. Those in front
                  essayed to sheer off from the deadly and firmly held points, but they were pushed
                  forward by those behind.
               Each word of the latter part of Captain Stevens' command had been deliberately
                  uttered, as his cool eye calculated the shortening distance of his foes, and the
                  word "fire!" let loose a volley on the rebels, at such close
                  quarters, that half a dozen saddles were cleared.
               For an instant the rebel steeds were stunned, as it were, into a prancing,
                  plunging herd. But so well trained were they, that a trumpet blast brought them to
                  their ranks, whilst a second blare hurried them off in rapid yet orderly
                  retreat.
               At that time the rebels had not rid themselves of the unfortunate belief that a
                  Southron, according to their arithmetic, was a fraction the superior in battle of
                  four Union heroes, and consequently the seventy repulsed cavaliers only drew off
                  to make a second attack.
               This critical moment called forth Eleanor's good judgment as prominently as the
                  other had her bravery, for turning to Rosa, she said:
               "Rosa, you know the road we came along! Ride back to Major Williams and tell him
                  we have been attacked, but are standing our ground! You are not afraid, are
                  you?"
               "No! no, Missy Eleanor, I'se not afraid! I sees what you want! You wants more
                  sogers, an' a cann'n gun!"
               Eleanor had no time to add a word before the mulatto was dashing back to the Union
                  lines. She was a capital rider, and with both feet and whip she urged her animal
                  to the top of his speed.
               "Well, Miss Poindexter," exclaimed Captain Stevens, "you ought to be commissioned
                  a general, and that yellow girl of yours ought to be put on your staff! She knows
                  something. Be steady, now, men," continued the speaker, addressing the latter,
                  "re-enforcements 'll soon be up now! Keep your lines steady, and the reb's 'll
                  soon have to skedaddle!"
               The enemy perceived the departure of the messenger, and well knowing what the
                  result must soon be, they prepared for a second and fiercer charge than before, in
                  hopes of capturing the escort and wounded ere help came. This charge was broken
                  ere it had neared the serried Union bayonets, and an attempted flank movement was
                  likewise foiled in a masterly manner.
               Time was growing precious on both sides. Captain Stevens feared to retreat too
                  much as his men might be thrown into disorder, and this was the exact object the
                  rebels wished to accomplish.
               Suddenly from a wooded knoll about a mile back a puff of smoke was seen, followed
                  by a roar, and at the same instant a vengeful shell fell close to the rebel
                  cavalry. Another and another of the screeching missiles sped over the heads of
                  Eleanor's escort, and, awhile later, rising over a ridge in the road, came a full
                  Union regiment at the double-quick.
               The chivalrous would-be captors waited for no further demonstration, but leaving
                  their killed and wounded in the hands of Captain Stevens, they galloped off. The
                  piece of artillery a light twelve-pounder, thundered up, and being again speedily
                  unlimbered, sent another shell or two after the fugitives to add wings to their
                  flight.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               A HEROIC DEED.
               MAJOR Williams had not expected that the detachment he sent out with Miss
                  Poindexter would attempt to bring in all the wounded, and when, therefore, Rosa
                  appeared in his camp with her urgent message, he the more promptly ordered out the
                  force already mentioned. The rescuing regiment was accompanied by the faithful
                  mulatto, who would sooner have perished than desert her mistress or have any harm
                  befall her.
               Not only was the praise of our heroine on the lips of all immediately concerned,
                  but, Major Williams sent to the War Department a special and glowing account of
                  her devoted and heroic conduct; and the sole reason why the public had not an
                  opportunity of knowing of the services she rendered, was that her own modesty
                  forbade any mention being made thereof.
               General McClellan had now assumed command of the Army of the Potomac, and it was
                  presently apparent that another battle would not take place soon unless forced on
                  by the enemy, as the demoralized Union troops required a vast amount of
                  reformation before they could be brought to any sort of excellence. Eleanor,
                  therefore, after spending several days in the hospitals about Washington, went
                  North for the purpose of fulfilling the hundreds of promises that sick and dying
                  soldiers had obtained from her. Those that she could not perform in person she
                  executed by letter, and the extent of her correspondence was such that during one
                  week she expended nearly twenty dollars in postage stamps alone.
               The season wore on, and certain significant movements rendered it evident that a
                  collision must occur at a close date between the hosts of the Union and the
                  legions of rebellion. Our heroine, therefore, immediately prepared to take the
                  field, and her preparations were not completed too soon, for after a few
                  comparatively unimportant skirmishes, in several of which Eleanor participated,
                  came the battle of Edward's Ferry.
               Many a sorrowing bosom heaves at the recollection of that conflict, for many a
                  gallant soldier of the Union perished there uselessly on the banks and in the
                  waves of the darkly flowing Potomac.
               Fortunately for our heroine she did not get forward in time to cross the river,
                  and consequently she escaped almost certain capture. However, she found
                  opportunities more than sufficient for the full exercise of her self-sacrificing
                  philanthropy on this side of the swollen river. And we cannot forbear recording,
                  to the eternal disgrace of the Confederates, that they fired volley after volley
                  across into the helpless wounded and dying, notwithstanding the fact that they saw
                  Eleanor passing from one to another ther attended only by Rosa, and ministering to
                  the unfortunate.
               Thanks to a merciful Providence, the devoted girl escaped uninjured, as did also
                  Rosa, who faced the whistling balls with as much coolness as her mistress. The
                  latter had given her leave, if she chose, to remain in a place of safety, where
                  she might, too, be equally as useful as in the more exposed position. But Rosa's
                  invariable answer was:
               "No, no, Missey Eleanor, I love you too much; 'sides, I wants to show you, so
                  you'll see it fur you's'f, that a slave, when she's free, or even when she ain't
                  free, ken have as much heart an' be as brave as a white pussun!"
               It was during this bloody action at Edward's Ferry—better known as Ball's
                  Bluff—that some wounded hero, experiencing the kindness of our heroine, and filled
                  with gratitude, gave her the title of The Angel of the Battle-Field.
                  In an instant the words passed from lip to lip, and thenceforth the gentle Eleanor
                  was called Miss Eleanor, The Angel of the Battle-Field.
               "Ah my dear old mother," wrote a gallant fellow of the lamented Baker's regiment,
                  "you ought to have seen Miss Eleanor flying round among tho boys that got struck.
                  I tell you, mother, when she came to Jim Carty and me, as we were lying in a
                  little hollow, the rain pouring down on us in torrents, and the rebel bullets
                  whizzing around us, I felt like I was home with you and Sis, and Jem cried, right
                  out with gladness, and said he felt like he'd like to die for her. She unstrapped
                  our knapsacks and put our blankets over us. We give her a new name to-day—'The
                  Angel of the Battle-Field,' and she deserves it, don't you think so? I know I
                  wouldn't have been here to-day if it hadn't been for her, and I want you to write
                  her a pretty letter for me, and I want you to pray for her, too."
               What an enviable title, and how gloriously did our heroine win it. Richard of
                  Anjou wrote the names of Ascalon and Acre in blood, that he might attach "the Lion
                  Heart" to his name; and Napoleon widowed and orphaned half of Europe for "a ten
                  century" renown. But Eleanor Poindexter, the loyal lily of the South, by her sweet
                  deeds of love and mercy has won a place in every heart that can cherish whatever
                  is noble and truly great.
               Eleanor was supremely happy in her hazardous labors, excepting those moments in
                  which she thought of her younger brother and sister, left, as she knew they were,
                  to no better influence nor guidance than Henry's. At the time she had received the
                  letter from her mysterious friend, Iredell, in which was inclosed the tress of her
                  mother's hair, she had written him a long reply, in which she begged of him to
                  obtain, if possible, control of the two orphans and send them on to her at
                  Philadelphia. Vainly she had waited for a reply, and just as vainly did she wait
                  the coming of her brother and sister. She had long since arrived at the conclusion
                  that either her letter had miscarried, or been destroyed by some vindictive rebel
                  postmaster, or that Iredell himself had suddenly died.
               What was her surprise, therefore, one day to receive a letter, via Richmond and
                  Fortress Monroe, directed in the bold,
                  clear chirography of Iredell. Like the first one, it had been violated. So
                  unexpected was its reception that Eleanor's feelings mastered her for several
                  minutes, and prevented her from opening it. Controlling herself, however, she
                  removed the sheet of letter paper from its envelope, and spreading it open glanced
                  at its contents. In an instant she noticed that the handwriting was different from
                  that of the direction, and looking at the bottom she was almost stunned to see the
                  signature of James L. Santee, immediately above which her eye as quickly caught
                  the underscored words, "Your adoring lover, or your bitter enemy, as you may
                     choose."
               So totally overcome was the fair Eleanor, that she sat in her little tent without
                  power to peruse the epistle. At length, however, summoning to her aid all her
                  determination, she did so.
               "Miss Poindexter," it began, "how I came into possession of this letter was by a
                  very fortunate accident. I suppose you will call it by an opposite name. However,
                  my dearest, we will not quarrel on that point. I expect that you will fret and
                  fume the pretty flesh off your bones to know that I came across this letter of
                  your dear friend Iredell, but I hope that it will not add too much to your anxiety
                  when I tell you that Iredell will be properly attended to. He has long been looked
                  on with suspicion, and now he will be fixed.
               "Your dear, or, let me quote correctly, your 'loving friend', Iredell, had filled
                  every side of a long foolscap sheet with information, and love and various other
                  matters, which I admired so much as a curiosity that I retained it, and send you
                  this in its place."
               Here followed a semi-ironical, semi-obscene allusion to himself and Eleanor, which
                  respect for the feelings of the latter has deterred us from recording. And the
                  conclusion was such an incongruous mixture of rubbishing jargon that the belief
                  forced itself upon the reader that the author must have been intoxicated when he
                  wrote it.
               Wonder, curiosity, sorrow and indignation took turns in the possession of our
                  heroine's mind after she had perused the shameful document. Previous to her coming
                  to the army this misfortune would have taken a terrible effect on Eleanor's mind,
                  but it dwindled to small dimensions as she compared it with the misfortunes that
                  she had witnessed befalling others for months past. So she resigned herself to
                  Fate.
               Time rolled on, and at last the Army of the Potomac prepared for a grand
                  demonstration against the enemy, who had so impregnably intrenched themselves at
                  Manassas. Whether, with one mighty effort, it was to hurl itself like a mailed
                  giant on the rebel stronghold, or whether its strategic evolutions were to
                  accomplish the desired result, had keen debated and settled by the solemn counsel
                  of its leaders and high government officials. It was to strike a long distance in
                  the rear, and, accordingly, the next announcement was that the Army had landed on
                  the peninsula, and commenced its march toward the heart of the rebellion,
                  Richmond.
               Thither did Eleanor, attended as usual by the ever true and faithful Rosa,
                  accompany the Union host, and soon enough did she find ample employment for those
                  self-sacrificing exertions that had rendered her so beloved and respected by the
                  soldiers.
               The subject of the sufferings, both in battle and otherwise, of the Army of the
                  Potomac, its splendid bravery and indomitable endurance, has been too often spoken
                  of and written of to require any repetition here. Suffice it to say that, from the
                  first conflict at Yorktown to the wasting carnage at Malvern Hill, the angelic
                  Eleanor Poindexter was ever present, exercising her heavenly offices, despite
                  every peril and horror by which she was surrounded. Surely she must have been
                  under the special protection of God's good angels, for, beneath the darkest battle
                  pall, and where the tempest of iron rained most pitilessly, she bound the gaping
                  wound, or moistened the dying lip, or spoke sweet words of hope and consolation in
                  the dulling ear, whilst shot and shell screeched and howled above and around her
                  like demons from the eternal lake of fire.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               CAPTURED AT LAST.
               WITH what anxious expectancy the national heart beat as the details of the
                  sanguinary seven-days' battle came in is even yet fresh in our memories. It was
                  known that McClellan was endeavoring to reach the James river, and it was also
                  known that his flank was thus fully exposed to the consummate Lee and Jackson.
               A flying march, then a halt, a hasty unlimbering of pieces, a mustering out of
                  hundreds of souls, and another rapid march to the rear, were the bloody monotony
                  of those dreadful seven days. Mothers, who lost your noble boys there, we weep
                  with you indeed! Let us not, however, dwell upon the carnage, but, replacing the
                  pall, leave the question of responsibility with that mighty commander whose
                  decisions man may not gainsay.
               Malvern Hill was the last point at which the rebels could possibly make a
                  successful attack upon the Federal army before it reached the protection of the
                  gunboats, and, here, as General McClellan had rightly conjectured, they made their
                  final and most desperate attempt to overthrow the Army of the Potomac. So fearful
                  was McClellan of anything going wrong, that he spent the whole night previous to
                  the battle in personally disposing of his wearied but heroic legions. Glorious
                  Kearney, stout old Heintzleman, Fighting Joe Hooker, and Unconquerable Sumner were
                  all rightly placed and impatiently awaited the onslaught of the foe. Many a brave
                  volunteer, as he rolled himself in his blanket that night and cast himself upon
                  the green turf, gazed up at the far-away stars and thought how the self-same orbs,
                  when they again reached the zenith, might twinkle down upon his own grave or
                  corpse.
               
               Dawn came at last, and with it came the battle, for as the first silvery rays
                  glimmered up the eastern sky dark masses of rebels began to move and manœuvre in
                  front of the Union army. The latter had been formed in a semicircle, a plan
                  afterward adopted in every detail by General Meade at Gettysburg, the arc
                  presented to the enemy, and the chord free for rapid tactical evolutions.
               Lee was stirring betimes, and scarcely had the sunlight illumined the hill-tops
                  before his closely-massed artillery was belching shot and shell, cannister and
                  grape, into the devoted Union lines. It was three o'clock in the afternoon,
                  however, ere he got his gray-clad hordes properly positioned for the grand attack.
                  At this crisis, as usual, there was an ominous lull in the firing, and during this
                  lull the Federal commander wisely strengthened those points at which it was
                  apparent the heaviest blows were to be struck.
               These preparations were just concluded as the rebel cannon again burst forth in
                  horrid harmony. Under cover of this fire a heavy column was hurled against the
                  Federal army, at that moment the living Gibraltar of the Union.
               The battle-field was open and hilly, or, more properly speaking, undulating; and
                  as the rushing rebel column sank and rose into the troughs and over the billows of
                  rich green grass, it looked like some fabulous monster hastening to a feast of
                  blood.
               On, on it comes, roaring, closer and closer. The artillery has ceased again, and
                  the head of the monster is at the foot of the slope whose summit Franklin holds.
                  The volleys of musketry hurtled into its body draws only its blood and rage; and,
                  with a convulsive bound, it crushes its way into Franklin's corps d'armee.*
                  
               
               The rock was splintered and toppled back with the impact of the blow, but,
                  quivering in every atom, it rushed forward instantly, and pushed back the monster
                  into the grassy waves at its feet. Again, collecting its energies, the reptile
                  charged at Sumner, but failed as it had before. Its third attempt was made upon
                  Hooker and Kearney, and how these heroes repulsed it, needs no comment. There was
                  now but one untried point remaining, namely, the left wing, held by Porter's
                  regulars, and, gathering up all its expiring powers, it precipitated its scarred
                  body full upon these devoted men, and sought, with its gory claws to tear its way
                  to a flanking position. How it failed, and how, breathless and bleeding, it was
                  hurled back into the grassy sea over which it had come, and how it writhed its
                  mangled body away to its retreat, scored and shattered at every movement by the
                  gunboats, has passed into history.
               During the battle, Eleanor Poindexter had got almost to the extreme left, and
                  while the closing contest was raging, she was most unfortunately captured—as was
                  also the faithful Rosa—during a fierce charge by the Twenty-first South Carolina
                  Regiment. Several desperate attempts were made to recapture "The Angel of the
                  Battle-field," but the foe were too fleet, and, therefore, secured the prize.
               
                  *The youthful appearance of Franklin's corps always attracted general notice,
                     and it came at last to be called the "Boy Corps." When Harrison's Landing
                     was reached, Franklin chanced to meet General Kearney.
                  "Well, Kearney," said he, taking the only hand of his companion-in-arms,
                     "What do you think of my boys?"
                  "Boys! boys!" exclaimed the one-armed hero, in his characteristic, charging
                     manner. "why, d—n it, Franklin, they're not boys! they're horses, air,
                     regular horses!" W. B.
               
               As Fate willed it, our heroine and Rosa, the mulatto, were taken by a squad of men
                  who had been recruited from the very district in which Eleanor had lived nearly
                  all her life. The consequence was that she was instantly recognized, and subjected
                  to the jeers and ribald insults of her enraged captors, until a lieutenant came to
                  her rescue.
               "What are you about, you villains!" he exclaimed, dashing one and another of them
                  aside. "I saw that lady giving a drink of water to two men of your own company,
                  who were dying. One of them was my own brother, and the first man that insults her
                  has got to fight me!"
               "She's a renegade! she's a Southerner, and ought to be on the side of the South!"
                  shouted several fierce voices, made husky by the dust of the battle.
               "It's a lie! I don't believe a word of it!" retorted the officer. "She's an angel!
                  I saw her myself all the time during the battle, and she was helping the wounded
                  and comforting the dying, our own men as well as the Yankees, right under the
                  heaviest fire of our pieces, and I don't want to hear any more about it!"
               This rebel officer immediately detailed a strong guard, under whose protection he
                  placed our heroine and her servant Rosa, with instructions where to report.
               All that night Eleanor was obliged to pass just in the rear of the Confederate
                  army, and, as may be supposed, sleep was put far from her. In the pitying kindness
                  of her heart she offered to assist in the care of the wounded, but she was not
                  allowed to do so. The next morning she and Rosa were taken to Richmond, where they
                  were delivered into the hands of a Major Wharton. With a respect that becomes the
                  more conspicuous from the fact of its being exceptional to the general rebel
                  habit, Major Wharton selected, for the use of Eleanor and her servant, a small
                  outhouse, separated entirely from the main building, where the ordinary prisoners
                  were lodged. He lauded the object that had brought her to the battle-field, and
                  apologized that circumstances did not permit him to treat her as well as he would
                  like.
               As our heroine was passing to the out-building spoken of, Rosa suddenly called her
                  attention to a man who was standing at a little distance.
               "There's Mister Santee, Missey Eleanor, jus' as sartin as def!"
               A cold chill ran through our heroine's frame, and she quickly raised her eyes and
                  glanced in the direction indicated. But quick as was her motion, she had not an
                  opportunity of verifying or destroying Rosa's assertion, for the person whom Rosa
                  had seen passed at the moment out of sight behind the corner of a fence. Eleanor
                  paid no more attention to the matter, for she confidently believed that Rosa was
                  mistaken.
               Miss Poindexter had been too long schooled in hardship to waste time in useless
                  repinings over her present situation, and sending out into the city she obtained,
                  at exorbitant prices, various matters
                  wherewith she and her unflinching servant might be rendered as comfortable as
                  possible.
               One soldier only was placed as a guard before the entrance to the little prison,
                  and he, ignorant why his fair charge was a captive, and struck, too, with her
                  beauty and gentle demeanor, endeavored, in a number of kindly ways, to gain her
                  approbation.
               "I've got some papers here, Miss," said he, in the evening, "and if you'll accept
                  of them you're very welcome to them. They'll pass your time. I wish I had
                  something better to read, but I haven't."
               Eleanor quickly accepted the offer, with many thanks, and was soon after poring
                  over the papers, one of which was a Charleston Mercury of a recent
                  date. A paragraph, with the caption "A SAD FATALITY," caught her eye. It read
                  thus:
               "Jas. L. Santee, Esq., of Beaufort county, sends us the following statement in
                  regard to the family of his friend and neighbor, Robert Poindexter, Esq., the
                  proprietor of the celebrated Palmetto Plantation. At a political meeting held just
                  after the secession of Virginia, on Mr. Santee's estate, Mr. Poindexter was
                  mysteriously assassinated. The deed was committed by some unknown person, during
                  an excitement caused by the action of Miss Eleanor Poindexter, who, in the very
                  faces of the assembled multitude, audaciously waved and saluted the Yankee Stars
                  and Stripes. She instantly fled, and, with the aid of an accomplice—at whom the
                  finger of suspicion points as her father's murderer—reached Tennessee.
               "There she sold a valuable plantation, which had been left to her by her uncle,
                  and with the proceeds went to the North. She has never been heard of since, and it
                  is quite likely that the infatuated girl at last fell a victim to the accomplice
                  by whose assistance she got to Tennessee.
               "Within a few days after the murder of Mr. Poindexter, his estimable lady was
                  suddenly stricken down and died. A short time subsequent, Henry, the eldest son,
                  took his remaining brother and sister down to Beaufort, in hopes that the
                  invigorating pleasures of that fashionable resort would, in a measure, divert
                  their minds from the grief which had fallen upon them. But, sad to relate, both
                  these lovely children were drowned while enjoying a sail on the bay with their
                  protector.
               "This accumulation of trouble so weighed upon the mind of Henry that, within the
                  past few days, he became a raving lunatic. Mr. Santee kindly took charge of him,
                  but, by some means or other, he made his escape, since which time no clue to his
                  whereabouts has been obtained, though a most vigorous search has been instituted.
                  No doubt exists that the unfortunate man has committed suicide in some out of the
                  way place which naught but chance will discover.
               "Thus, within so short a time, one of the most wealthy and aristocratic families
                  in the State, has been swept from existence. Eleanor, a beautiful, educated, and
                  highly refined young lady, is still in the North, but whether living or dead is
                  uncertain.
               "Mr. Santee has administered to the estate of his late friend, and will charge
                  himself with the proper management thereof until the truant Eleanor, or some other
                  heir, comes forward."
               This was indeed a most fearful stroke to our heroine, and she was unable to
                  repress the emotions that were awakened within her by the perusal of the paragraph
                  quoted.
               Terrible, also, were her suspicions in regard to the complicity of that
                  dark-souled man, Santee, with the "sad fatality" spoken of by the
                     Mercury. Had she been ignorant of the control that Santee had
                  obtained over her brother Henry, and how he had attempted to make herself the
                  victim thereof, she would not perhaps have thought as she did. But added to this
                  knowledge, she had the testimony of her own dear mother as to his villainy, and
                  the testimony of Iredell. And as Iredell's image came up before her, she was
                  seized by another anxiety. The article in the Mercury had come from
                  Santee, and the accomplice therein mentioned could be no other than her mysterious
                  friend, who, she remembered, had experienced some peril near Chattanooga, the
                  character of which, however, she had never heard. Could it be that Santee had
                  followed him to Tennessee? Surely not, or he would have found an opportunity for
                  revenge. Iredell's last letter, however, had fallen by accident into Santee's
                  hands. And Santee, in the one that he sent to Eleanor in place of the original,
                  boasted that, by it, Iredell had placed himself in his power, and that he would
                  most certainly use this power. Had he done so? Alas! naught but a miracle could
                  prevent him.
               "What a demon is that awful man!" murmured our fair captive, shuddering, and
                  involuntarily casting about her a glance of alarm.
               The rest of the evening Eleanor endeavored to beguile by conversing with Rosa. She
                  assured the latter that she would not permit the rebel authorities to seize her as
                  a slave. But if, regardless of the deed of emancipation—which, by-the-by, Rosa had
                  religiously preserved ever since Eleanor returned it to her—they proceeded to sell
                  her, she would buy her at any price. Being reduced again to slavery had been
                  Rosa's greatest fear in accompanying her mistress to the battle-field; but her
                  love for, and gratitude to, the latter had induced her to brave even this
                  peril.
               At eleven o'clock the guard was changed, the place of the first—who was a
                  well-bred kind of man—being taken by a sullen-looking fellow, who, Rosa declared,
                  would prevent her sleeping all night. Eleanor endeavored to reason with her
                  servant that discipline restrained even the worst men within certain well-defined
                  limits, and consequently that nothing was to be feared from the new guard, who,
                  unfortunately, was so unprepossessing in appearance. Rosa, however, would not be
                  convinced, and persisted in remaining awake.
               About one o'clock in the night a light footstep approached, and the next moment a
                  voice was heard by Rosa conversing in low tones with the guard.
               "Well, Major," said the sentinel, at length, "if you'll give me the thousand clear
                  in my hand, and promise to see me out of the trouble of the escape, I'm at your
                  service."
               "I'll do so," replied the voice more audibly than hitherto, "there's your money,
                  and I promise you the other."
               "All right, Major," answered the guard,
                  "now go ahead, and be quick about it."
               The next instant, and even as Rosa gently awakened Eleanor, a knock came to the
                  door which was then pushed softly back, giving entrance to a tall, manly figure,
                  completely disguised in a Spanish mantle and broad felt hat.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               THE RESCUE, AND THE STRANGE HORSEMAN.
               UPON a broken table in one corner of the contracted room occupied by Eleanor and
                  her faithful companion, there was a candle dimly burning, and this the mysterious
                  stranger extinguished after raising his finger to caution silence upon the
                  captives. The following moment his lips were close to our heroine's ear.
               "Dearest Eleanor," he whispered in scarcely audible tones, "ever since your
                  arrival in the city, I have been maturing a plan for your rescue. Now is the
                  favorable moment for your escape. Everything is ready. I have bribed the guard,
                  and it only remains for you, and also your servant, to follow me to a place of
                  safety."
               "First tell me," replied the fair prisoner, her voice tremulous with the suddenly
                  awakened hope of escape, "to whom do I owe this act of kindness."
               "My disguise must be perfect, indeed, dear Eleanor, or is it possible that you can
                  have forgotten Iredell?"
               These words were spoken in as low a tone as before, but there was a feeling thrown
                  into their utterance that caused a thrill to run through Eleanor's whole
                  being.
               "Oh, my dear friend," replied she, taking the hand that her invisible rescuer had
                  laid upon her arm, and pressing it warmly, "you must forgive me, but when you
                  first came in you seemed to be at least two inches taller than you used to be, and
                  not so broad."
               "Nothing to forgive, dear Eleanor. You would have recognized me had it not been
                  for my mantle. But let us not lose the precious moments. Come, all is ready—and
                  your servant—what do you call her—she must not be left behind in the hands of her
                  brutal 
                     jailors
                     jailers
                  ."
               "Here's' me, sah," quickly, but softly, said Rosa, as she extended her hand
                  through the gloom and placed it upon the arm of the speaker.
               Eleanor knew well the value of dispatch, and whispering a word or two to her
                  servant, she allowed her rescuer to lead her toward the door of the little prison.
                  This he cautiously opened; and pushing his two companions back somewhat, he gazed
                  out to see that the coast was clear.
               "All goes well! Come!" whispered he.
               The next moment the guard was passed, and the fugitives soon reached the wall
                  inclosing the grounds attached to the building, used as quarters for Union
                  prisoners. This was readily surmounted; owing to the skill and strength of the
                  guide, and five minutes later saw the trio safely ensconced in a carriage that was
                  driven rapidly toward the southern portion of the city.
               When satisfied that there was no further peril of discovery, Eleanor could not
                  longer forbear addressing her friend.
               "Mr. Iredell," said she, "can you recall the contents of the last letter you sent
                  me, that is, I suppose it to be the last. I received the first after it had been
                  opened—by the rebel postmaster—but all I got of the second was the envelope."
               "What mean you, dear Eleanor? I certainly sent you two letters."
               "The first of which," replied Eleanor, "came to hand; but the second, most
                  unfortunately, by some means or other, fell into the clutches of that vile man,
                  Santee. He must hold some position in the rebel post-office. He removed your
                  letter from the envelope, and sent a scurrilous and insulting note in the place of
                  it."
               "The villain!" exclaimed Eleanor's companion, interrupting her, and speaking from
                  between his shut teeth. "But I have a copy of the letter, dear Eleanor, and I will
                  let you read it. Better late than not at all."
               "I feared," resumed our heroine, "that in it you had, perhaps, betrayed your
                  whereabouts, or, at least, written something that might bring you into the power
                  of Santee."
               "Ah, calm all your fears on that point, dear Eleanor; my presence here with you at
                  this moment is proof sufficient that he has, as yet, been unable to harm me, and
                  of the future I will take good care. So pray dismiss all your apprehensions."
               "I suppose, Mr. Iredell," rejoined Eleanor, "that you are aware of the sad
                  fatality that has swept our family from existence, with the exception of
                  myself."
               "I have, indeed; but how came you to hear of it, dear Eleanor?"
               "In the most unexpected manner. This very evening the soldier who was placed as
                  guard over me, and who, I must add, was much of a gentleman, gave me several
                  Southern newspapers, that time might not hang so heavily upon me. Almost the first
                  article that struck my attention was one in the Charleston Mercury,
                  headed 'A Sad Fatality.'"
               "Really," interrupted our heroine's rescuer, "the ways of Providence are
                  inscrutable. And, alas dear Eleanor, that sad paragraph was too true. I saw it.
                  Your mother died soon after your father, and was followed by her two sons and your
                  sweet sister."
               "With this terrible fatality," said Eleanor solemnly, "I feel certain, too, that
                  the black-hearted Santee has had a close connection."
               "Not more certain than I do myself, dear Eleanor!" quickly added the other, with
                  much emphasis. "But do not dwell," continued he, in soothing tones, "upon a
                  subject that pains me because it grieves you."
               "No, I will not think of it; or at least I will try not to. But I cannot always
                  banish it, and when it rises before me I experience the most 
                     unchristain
                     unchristian
                   feelings against Santee. I hope God will forgive him, for I cannot. No
                  more, however, on that. Tell me, though, dear friend about the noble St. Aubyns; the account in your first
                  letter was but meagre."
               "Their history, dear Eleanor, is almost as painful as that of your own family.
                  Three days after the attack that was made upon their mansion, on the night that
                  you ended Santee's meeting in such an ungracious manner, the two sons determined
                  to be revenged, and sought Santee for the purpose of shooting him. His good or
                  evil genius protected him, however, and they failed in their attempt. After they
                  fired at him he returned their shots, and one of the young men fell dead, while
                  the other was so badly wounded that he died the same night.
               "The old gentleman had ten days' notice given him by the State Vigilance
                  Committee, of which Santee was a chief officer, to quit the State, or at any rate
                  to leave the neighborhood in which he lived. So, after burying his two sons, he
                  wisely took his wife and servants and went down to Savannah, where he is yet, I
                  believe."
               "And Nellie, the daughter, what of her, Mr. Iredell?" asked our heroine, with much
                  concern.
               "She went away with your brother Henry, on the night of the attack. He took her to
                  Santee's mansion, and her wretched fate I need not inform you. Suffice it to say
                  that she, like some others, has never been heard of, from that day to this, and
                  never will."
               "Oh, horrible! horrible!" exclaimed Eleanor, "and to think that my brother should
                  allow himself to become the abject, wicked tool of such a demon as Santee!"
               "Ah! my dear Eleanor, you were indeed fortunate to escape the monster, for you
                  were to have been his grand prize. It was to secure you that he made a cat's paw
                  of your brother. And though you eluded him once, he has recorded a vow to possess
                  himself of you yet, and complete his vengeful designs."
               "Sooner than which," replied Eleanor, in a solemn tone, "I would, with my own
                  hand, part soul from body, and rejoin the dear ones from whom his machinations
                  have separated me in this life."
               Until this moment Rosa had maintained a respectful silence; but a thought entered
                  her mind at the instant, and she asked:
               "Please sah, Mister Iredell, 'scuse me, but, ain't Mister Santee in de city?"
               "Rosa," quickly added Eleanor, reminded by the question of what had occurred as
                  she was going to the little building assigned as her prison, "thought she saw
                  Santee to-day, and called my attention at the time. But I concluded that she was
                  mistaken, as I looked up instantly but could see no one that even resembled
                  Santee."
               "Rosa was right, dear Eleanor," replied our heroine's rescuer. "Santee is in the
                  city. I came with him myself from Beaufort county. He holds a commission in the
                  rebel army as major, and is here on some secret service. Not only is he here, but
                  he knows that you are here. He was close by at the time you were taken from the
                  main prison building and sent to the outhouse. I saw him watching you."
               "Then, indeed, do I owe you a double debt of gratitude for this timely rescue!"
                  answered. Eleanor, in sweet tones. "But," added she, quickly, "it makes me shudder
                  to think what a fearful risk you ran for my sake, Mr. Iredell."
               "I am fond of risks, dear Eleanor, but there was scarcely any in that. I merely
                  assumed the name and rank of Santee himself, bribed the sentinel with a thousand
                  dollars, and the rest you know as well as I."
               "Do you not think that Santee, when he finds that I have fled, will institute a
                  vigorous search?" asked Eleanor.
               "I have not the slightest doubt of it, and I have made my preparations
                  accordingly. I have secured apartments in the city here with a trusty friend. In
                  these you and your servant must keep close until I return for you, which will be
                  when I throw Santee off the track, and then we will make with all speed for
                  Savannah. From thence we will reach the coast, and there be taken on board some
                  Union man-of-war. This is our only course, for to attempt to reach the North by
                  passing through the lines of the army would be to fall into Santee's hands
                  certainly."
               "Any way your judgment decides, dear friend," replied Eleanor, with gentle
                  confidence.
               "By-the-by, here we are at our destination," said Eleanor's companion, as the
                  carriage drew up in front of a gloomy looking building, in which not a light was
                  to be seen.
               Not waiting for the driver to unfasten the door of the carriage out heroine's
                  rescuer did it himself, and, stepping out, handed Eleanor up the front steps of
                  the building, leaving Rosa to follow, which she was not slow in doing.
               "All right, Billy!" said Iredell to the coachman, who, making some incoherent
                  reply, drove away.
               Admission was quickly given to the trio by a servant, who carried a candle, by the
                  light of which Eleanor and her servant were shown to a handsomely furnished
                  chamber. This chamber was on the second story, and communicated with a smaller
                  apartment in the rear.
               "Here, dear Eleanor," said Iredell, "you will be as safe as though you were in
                  Paris. But do not attempt to leave your refuge, neither allow Rosa to do so, on
                  any pretext, until I see you again. Whatever you wish all you need to do is ring
                  this bell, and the servant will bestow upon you every attention. I would gladly
                  remain and converse upon the events that have happened since you and I parted; but
                  the most urgent necessity for my presence elsewhere prevents it. Believe me,
                  however, I will, at the very earliest moment, return, like Noah's dove, to the
                  ark. Farewell!"
               "Farewell," replied Eleanor, extending her hand as he spoke, "farewell, and Heaven
                  protect you, and keep you free from harm."
               "Farewell," again said Iredell, as he took the proffered hand and pressed it to
                  his lip.
               The next moment he was gone.
               During the succeeding two days our heroine saw nothing of her rescuer, but she
                  scrupulously obeyed all his injunctions, and even went beyond them in many
                  respects.
               About the middle of the second night she was aroused from her slumber by a gentle
                  knock at the door, and she heard the voice of her rescuer.
               "Be ready in half an hour," said he, and then walked away.
               Eleanor well knew what he meant; and
                  springing up she hastily made preparations for her journey. These she completed,
                  with the help of Rosa in less than fifteen minutes, and without waiting for the
                  expiration of half an hour she rang the bell.
               The signal was answered by Iredell, himself, cloaked and disguised exactly as he
                  had been on the night of the escape.
               "You are prompt, dear Eleanor," said he, remaining outside the threshold until our
                  heroine should join him.
               Eleanor did not fail to notice the act of gentlemanly courtesy, though, of course,
                  she made no remark concerning it.
               The same carriage that had brought our heroine to her present refuge now awaited
                  her at the door, and stepping lightly into it she was soon speeding away in the
                  direction of the Richmond and Charleston railroad depot. Arriving here she was
                  placed aboard a train which was just about to start and ere sunrise many a mile
                  lay between herself and Richmond.
               Her rescuer, however, did not remain with her. About an hour previous to dawn he
                  left, the car, of which she was (beside him and Rosa) the only occupant. Before
                  going he said:
               "I am playing a deep and hazardous game, Eleanor, and I must beg of you, as you
                  value your own safety and mine, to second me at every turn."
               "Instruct me fully, Mr. Iredell," replied Eleanor, "how I can do so properly, and
                  I assure you you shall have no need of complaint."
               "Well, then," was the answer, "I am acting the part of Santee. He is a secret
                  agent of the rebel government. I have represented you and your servant as
                  political prisoners, placed in my charge to Savannah, where you are to be
                  imprisoned. Should the guard, therefore, at any time question you, you will reply
                  accordingly, for I half think that a little suspicion may have been already raised
                  in that direction. I will see you as often as convenient or necessary until we get
                  to Savannah, when circumstances must determine our future course, especially
                  should the plan of reaching the Union vessels fail.
               "If we get that far," suggested Eleanor, "and any unseen peril should arise, do
                  you not think we could reach the cave?"
               "Ha! the cave!" exclaimed our heroine's rescuer, in a voice of surprise, and
                  almost too loud for safety. Catching himself, however, he remained silent fully a
                  minute, and then asked, in tones that struck Eleanor as rather peculiar:
               "Do you think, dear Eleanor, that you could reach the cave by yourself?"
               "I know I could not," was the reply, "for, as you are aware, I was insensible when
                  you conveyed me thither, and when you led me from it the night was pitch dark.
                  Indeed, Mr. Iredell, there are but two facts about it that I remember, one of
                  which is the singular and delicious perfume that was exhaled by the shrubbery
                  around, and the other of which is the unmerciful manner in which the thorns and
                  briers lacerated my hands and arms."
               "Which rudeness, under the circumstances, you excused, dear Eleanor," laughed
                  Iredell. "But I must leave you," he continued, rising, and speaking in a more
                  serious manner. "Remember what I have told you. Adieu!"
               "Adieu!" replied Eleanor, "I will not forget."
               Our heroine saw no more of Iredell, for whose safety she constantly and fervently
                  prayed, until the next night, when he came to assure her that all was going
                  well.
               In this way (Iredell seeing Eleanor each night), Savannah was reached without
                  discovery, much to Eleanor's joy, and Rosa's also. Here, however, our heroine's
                  rescuer informed her that Santee was in hot pursuit.
               "And so," added he, "there is naught left to us, dear Eleanor, but to seek, as you
                  suggested, the refuge of the cave. Santee knows our object in coming to Savannah
                  as well as we do, and, consequently, he would capture us the moment we reached the
                  coast."
               "As you will, dear friend, so long as no harm befalls you!" answered
                  Eleanor, in anxious but prompt tones.
               "It is not for myself that I fear, fair lady," replied the other, "but for
                  you."
               After some further conversation, during which several points of minor importance
                  in the future programme of the fugitives were settled, the latter set off up the
                  river.
               It was with varied feelings that our heroine approached the home of her birth; a
                  home in which she had spent the happiest and also the most sorrowful days of her
                  life, and fain would she have turned aside to visit the familiar old homestead had
                  circumstances allowed it. But Santee was on her track and that of her protector,
                  and she hastened onward with the latter, after breathing a gentle prayer for the
                  departed ones who lay sleeping so quietly in the grave.
               Since leaving Richmond, Eleanor's rescuer had never once held a moment's
                  intercourse with her during the day-time, but invariably at night. This struck our
                  heroine as exceedingly strange, but, upon thinking over it, she concluded that he
                  had some very good reason for so doing, and she therefore gave it no further
                  consideration.
               After leaving Savannah no incident worth recording occurred until the fugitives
                  reached a point about three miles from Santee's mansion, and four and a half miles
                  from Iredell's cave.
               Here the light carriage in which Eleanor's rescuer was driving her was overtaken
                  by a horseman, who must have turned into the main road from some by-lane just
                  after the carriage had passed. At the moment that this rider came abreast of the
                  vehicle a quaint remark of Rosa's caused Eleanor to laugh quite heartily. The
                  former instantly checked his horse somewhat, as he seemed to recognize the voice,
                  and then, pressing forward, he bent down from his saddle and peered in at the
                  front of the carriage. The next moment, without speaking a word, he sheered off
                  from the latter, and, dashing away, was soon lost in the darkness of the road
                  beyond.
               "That's a suspicious customer," whispered Eleanor's companion, after the horseman
                  had disappeared, "and he may give us trouble. But if he does I am prepared."
               The speaker, as he ceased, applied the whip vigorously to his animal, who was soon
                  going at a heavy run, as though to overtake the lonely horseman in front.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER 
                     XVIII.
                     XVII.
                  
               
               A SECOND AND TRAGIC RESCUE.
               THE carriage in which Eleanor rode was fitted with an extra curtain in front,
                  which, when drawn down, answered the double purpose of keeping the inmates dry,
                  should it be raining, and protecting them, if need be, from curiosity. Though it
                  was so dark, our heroine's companion after the strange rider had gone out of sight
                  and sound, pulled down this curtain, and thus not only shut out all inquisitive
                  gaze, but also cut off any view from the inside, for what reason the reader must
                  judge by the sequel.
               Presently the carriage was turned off the main road on to a smooth graveled path,
                  arriving at the end of which it ceased to move. The driver immediately leaped from
                  his seat to the broad porch of a mansion, and, unfastening the door, handed
                  Eleanor and her servant out.
               Our heroine could not conceal her surprise at being thus taken to an elegant
                  building instead of to the cave to which she supposed she had been going all the
                  while; and, laying her hand upon her companion's arm, she exclaimed:
               "Why, Mr. Iredell, this is not the cave! Is it your residence?"
               "Yes," quickly replied the other. "But hist! we are pursued! Silence! Come
                  instantly into the house, dear Eleanor, or we are both lost!"
               On the impulse, and ere she was really aware of it, Eleanor obeyed the
                  exclamation, and followed her companion, the faithful Rosa keeping her close
                  company. As the trio entered the hall of the mansion, which was in total darkness,
                  Iredell stepped back and secured the door.
               Within the next minute a gag was in the mouths of Eleanor and her servant, and a
                  moment later a strong arm was about each, bearing them, as lightly as though they
                  had been children, up a carpeted stairway. Up! up! up! higher and higher they were
                  carried, until the topmost landing of the house was reached, when the captor,
                  keeping his right arm pressed about Eleanor, seized Rosa with the same hand, so as
                  to leave the other free. With the latter he unlocked and pushed back a door, and
                  stepped through the opening thus made into a room that was more heavily carpeted
                  than the stairs.
               Both captives were loosed while the door was being quickly closed and fastened by
                  the captor, who next lit a large lamp.
               His previous exertions had caused him to drop his mantle, and as the rays of the
                  light illumined his figure Eleanor noticed how different it was from Iredell's;
                  but still she could not recognize him by the closest scrutiny she could make of
                  his half concealed, half lit-up features as he bent over the lamp.
               An opportunity for doing so, however, was not long delayed, for in a moment or two
                  the strange man, turned to her, and, handing her a chair with the utmost
                  politeness, requested her to be seated while he explained his conduct since first
                  seeing her in Richmond.
               Eleanor acceded mechanically, and sinking upon the proffered chair, prepared in
                  silence to listen to what the other had to say. Rosa was much frightened, but,
                  buoyed up by love and devotion to her mistress, she stood close behind the latter.
                  Both prisoners, with one instinct, had removed the gags from their mouths the
                  moment they found their hands at liberty.
               "My darling Eleanor," commenced our heroine's captor, "I believe I told you, as we
                  were coming along from Richmond, that I was playing a very deep game, did I
                  not?"
               "In truth you did, sir," replied Eleanor, "and, I must add, a very strange
                  one!"
               "Exactly so! Strange, no doubt, to you, sweet girl; and, when you learn all, you
                  will say well played. But 
                     al
                     all
                   in good season. Let me begin at the beginning, and by the time I have
                  concluded I think I shall have proven my identity to you, and also explained one
                  or two matters to your satisfaction—perhaps! And yet, why should I
                  keep you in suspense, my angel? No, I will not! You remember that wench there
                  telling you that she saw Mr. Santee, and calling your attention at the time to the
                  fact?"
               "I do!" was the reply.
               "Well, as I told you once before, she was right! Santee was in
                  Richmond at the time on secret service for the Confederate government. He saw you,
                  determined to obtain possession of you, bribed the guard who was placed over you,
                  took you from your prison, brought you to Savannah, brought you to the cave, and
                  is here, your most devoted and rejoicing lover! Behold him, my sweetest!"
               With these words the speaker removed in an instant a false wig and beard, and
                  there, grinning sardonically, Eleanor beheld, not as she had supposed Mr. Iredell,
                  but James L. Santee!
               
               No word, nor no combination of words, can convey to the reader's mind the feelings
                  that seized Eleanor Poindexter at this dreadful moment. Were it possible to
                  imagine the despairing amazement that could possess a spirit which, after a long
                  life of goodness and piety on earth, was given into the power of Satan while
                  stepping across the very threshold of Heaven, it might be possible to imagine the
                  despairing amazement that fell upon our heroine at the moment of which we write.
                  No word burst from her ashen lips; no merciful swoon shut out the appalling
                  reality of her situation; but she sat and gazed in helpless, stony composure upon
                  her gloating master.
               Rosa, too, clutching the chairback of her mistress, her eyes glassy and protruded,
                  stared at Santee, and seemed turning into marble as she stared.
               The silence was broken at length by Santee, who, still grinning maliciously upon
                  his intended victim, said:
               "Now for the explanation, sweetest dove. I had lost sight of you for a long, long
                  time after you behaved so disloyally at my meeting, and had concluded that after
                  you reached the North, you got in with that rascally Drayton. But Fortune smiled
                  on me awhile since, and, one day as I was
                  overhauling some suspected letters at the post office, I came across one directed
                  to you. I opened it and found the choice epistle from that traitor Iredell, which
                  I replaced, as you know, by a little note of my own. I hardly expected, then, ever
                  to see you again, but lo! what a happy disappointment! Public business took me to
                  Richmond, and there my delighted eyes lit upon you. My plan was soon formed. That
                  letter of Iredell's posted me as to what I should say and do particularly, and the
                  rest I trusted to my own genius, and you must own my work has been nicely done.
                  Yet still it has cost me nearly two thousand dollars to get you here. I have not
                  gone after Iredell yet, but I have him fixed so tightly that when I do he'll come
                  like the coon to Captain Scott!"
               "Oh! inhuman being! may God forgive you!" gasped Eleanor, recovering her
                  speech.
               "He'll have enough to do to do that!" replied the wicked, godless man. "But,"
                  added he, in altered tones, "I have no time to trifle! I will tell you the spring,
                  the secret of all this. Your father grossly insulted me once, and I determined to
                  be revenged on him, as I always do on anybody who questions my honor. I swore I'd
                  follow him and his to the grave—ay, and further! I got your headstrong, foolish
                  brother in my power, and I worked him to get you. It was my steel that ended your
                  blustering father's career; your mother died suddenly after eating some delicious
                  foreign fruit that I sent her. Your younger brother and sister were accidentally
                  drowned in Beaufort Bay by Henry, to whom I had suggested that he would become
                  sole heir to the estate by such an accident. After that, to turn suspicion away,
                  he feigned madness, and I, good, kind friend, took charge of him. One night I
                  lured him into the woods, and watching my opportunity slipped a noose about his
                  neck. He died quite easy, and I tied him to a tree in such a manner that when he
                  is found his suicide will awaken general pity. Then his sweetheart, or rather his
                  wife, Nellie St. Aubyn, fell into my possession, as did also Palmetto Plantation.
                  I soon got tired of Nellie, although she was really pretty, and I believe she's
                  dying in the next chamber now."
               "You, my love, are the last of the Poindexters. When you are gone I shall take
                  full possession of Palmetto Plantation. You are a sweet lily that I have plucked
                  with much trouble. Your fragrance I alone will enjoy, and when you wither, as you
                  soon will, why of course you must give place to another. Ha! ha! revenge is a most
                  delicious feast! Come, my love, let me embrace you!"
               Fascinated with horror at the cool detail of his atrocious villainies, Eleanor had
                  regarded Santee in silence. But his last words fully awoke her to the horrid peril
                  that threatened herself, and, starting from her chair, she placed the latter
                  between herself and her foe.
               Santee took a step forward, but no more, for, as he raised his foot for the next,
                  Rosa sprang upon him with the fury of a tigress, and, clutching him by the throat,
                  almost bore him to the floor. Alas! however, the next moment a bowie-knife
                  glittered above her, and flashed down into her bosom like the lightning bolt falls
                  from heaven to earth. The faithful mulatto sank back with a wild shriek of
                  despair; but, faithful to the last, stretched out her arms toward Eleanor, as
                  though to reach and enfold her cherished mistress to her stricken heart.
               "D——d, filthy worm! squirm there," hissed Santee, with the voice of an adder, and
                  spurning dying Rosa with his foot as he spoke. "Now, Eleanor Poindexter,"
                  continued he, fiercely, turning upon the latter, "your doom has come!
                  No escape for you now!"
               Our heroine had often read in romances of pure and lovely women being in just such
                  peril as she was now in. And she had read how valiant lovers or noble men had
                  rescued them. Strange enough, too, she thought bitterly of the incongruity of
                  fiction and reality.
               No time was there to think more, however, for already were the lecherous arms
                  almost about her. Springing back she whirled the chair aloft, and, with fire
                  leaping from her eyes, exclaimed:
               "Demon, back! Touch me not! I defy you! I challenge you, before the righteous God
                  of heaven not to commit the sin you seek to commit."
               "And, by the righteous God of heaven, I challenge you, infamous reptile, to mortal
                  combat!" thundered the voice of a stalwart man, who, dashing in the door at this
                  juncture, rushed upon Santee with a long, keen knife.
               Santee, though taken at the disadvantage of an utter surprise, was cool, powerful,
                  and well skilled in the use of the bowie knife; and, by a quick, movement, he
                  caught his foeman's weapon on his own and passed aside a blow that otherwise had
                  reached his life.
               But the other was equally skilled, and much more powerful. Pausing only for a
                  moment, he measured his distance, and then made two lightning-like,
                  straight-forward, plunging thrusts.
               "That for the liar and murderer!" he exclaimed, driving the steel into Santee's
                  throat, "and that for the traitor and seducer!" planting the vengeful blade in the
                  villain's heart.
               Santee's death was so instantaneous that the groan he uttered ceased ere he
                  reached the floor.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               A PLEASANT DENOUEMENT.
               WITHOUT waiting to deal a third blow, or even to cast another look at his dead
                  adversary, the new-comer turned to Eleanor. The latter instantly recognized in her
                  preserver her former protector, the real Iredell, and, uttering a cry
                  of mingled joy and surprise, she cast herself into his arms.
               At this moment a groan from Rosa called the attention of both to the poor,
                  faithful unfortunate, who, to save her beloved mistress from a worse fate than
                  death, had received a mortal wound. As Eleanor and Iredell kneeled beside her,
                  Rosa took a hand of each, and faintly smiling, said in a low voice:
               "God bres you, Missey Eleanor, I'se done gone; but de good Lord's sent his angels
                  to take me away. He'll bress you, too, Mister Iredell, 'deed he will, fur savin'
                  Missey Eleanor!"
               With these words, the dying Rosa closed her eyes for about a minute, and remained
                  very still. Then, opening them suddenly, she said to our heroine:
               "Oh, Missey Eleanor, dere's one thing 'ud make me die happy, ef you'd only tell me
                  you'd try an' do it some time."
               "Tell me, Rosa!" exclaimed Eleanor, anxiously, as she saw that the expiring girl
                  would soon be past speaking, "tell me what it is, and I promise you that I will do
                  it if at all in my power."
               "Dear Missey Eleanor," replied Rosa, in still weaker tones than before, "der's
                  thirteen dollars in my pocket. Ef you'd put enough to it, an' git my old mother
                  her 'mission paper."
               "Your mother, Rosa," said Iredell, answering the dying servant, "has gone to
                  Heaven. You will meet her there."
               Poor Rosa heard him not, however, for, with the effort in behalf of her still
                  enfettered mother, she passed to that great bar where no wickedly contrived laws
                  of earth could shield the man of oppression and blood to whom she owed her
                  death.
               "It is well," continued Iredell, addressing Eleanor, "that she did not know what
                  the end of her mother was. She, too, fell a victim to Santee, because, when
                  accused of harboring her daughter, at the time the latter went away with you, she
                  would not confess to your brother Henry that she knew where either of you were.
                  She received, at Santee's suggestion, a fearful flogging, from the effects of
                  which she soon after died."
               "Surely! surely that horrible man must have been possessed of a devil!"
                  shudderingly said Eleanor, glancing down at the body of Santee, who, with staring
                  eyes, scowled darkly, stonily up at the ceiling.
               "Then he has gone home at last," rejoined Iredell, "but come, dear Eleanor," he
                  added quickly, "we must be leaving this locality ere any one returns. I will
                  explain all when we reach a place of safety. Come."
               Our heroine was cut to the heart that she could not bear poor, faithful Rosa's
                  body to some place of sepulchre. This, however, was impossible, and she was
                  obliged to leave the true-hearted servant sleeping beside her murderer.
               As Eleanor and her preserver were about to hasten from the chamber of death, a
                  partition door caught the attention of the former, and brought vividly to her mind
                  the brutal words of Santee in regard to Nellie St. Aubyn dying in the next room.
                  At Eleanor's earnest request, Iredell forced this door from its bolts and hinges.
                  The apartment was pitchy dark. Iredell, therefore, stepped back to where stood the
                  lamp that had been lit by Santee, and taking it up entered the unexplored chamber,
                  accompanied by our heroine. Kneeling beside a bedstead, her face buried in her
                  clasped hands upon the counterpane, was Nellie St. Aubyn. The intruders' footfalls
                  disturbed her not, however, for several hours had elapsed since Death had
                  mercifully freed her from her bondage of soul and body, as the corpse was nearly
                  rigid and cold.
               Silent with very horror, Eleanor permitted her protector to lead her down stairs;
                  and in less than an hour more she was safely ensconced beneath the thicket-clad
                  ridge that had once before afforded her a secure refuge.
               Here, in their subterranean asylum, the two, without peril from eavesdroppers,
                  could rehearse the strange events that had happened since they parted at Cairo. So
                  deeply were they interested in each other's immediately past history that nearly
                  the whole night was spent ere the mutual narratives where ended. Doubtless a
                  detail of this conversation would prove highly interesting to the reader; but lack
                  of space compels us to confine our record to such points as intimately concern
                  facts we have hitherto stated.
               "Really," exclaimed Iredell, as Eleanor concluded her narrative, "your story
                  possesses more romance and adventure than the most thrilling romance I ever heard
                  of, and, with your approval, I will add a point, or rather a surprise to it."
               "With all my heart," replied our heroine, smiling graciously.
               "Excuse me then, a moment or two," said Iredell, stepping into a small room from
                  which he quickly reappeared.
               "Mr. Drayton!" exclaimed Eleanor, almost swooning with amazement. "Am I dreaming,
                  or is it all a reality?"
               "All a reality, dearest Eleanor!" rejoined Drayton, for our heroine's companion
                  was indeed no other than he. "But an explanation is due you," he continued, again
                  seating himself close to his lovely charge, "and that you may thoroughly
                  comprehend all, I will begin at the very commencement.
               "I was left an orphan at the early age of four years, with a small income secured
                  to me by my dear mother, whose deathbed I can even now distinctly remember. In
                  charge of a friend I reached sixteen, at which time I entered the counting-room of
                  a merchant on Delaware avenue. Seven years of constant and laborious attention to
                  business made me the possessor of a moderate annual income come; but impaired my health to such an extent that
                  relaxation became absolutely necessary. I resolved to travel throughout the
                  country. That my journeyings might have another object as well as that of health,
                  I determined to note closely and record the manners, habits, and customs of each
                  State, its progress physically, morally, and politically.
               "Thus was I engaged in this section of South Carolina, when, on one occasion,
                  being benighted, I fell in with Mr. Iredell. He was a man of the rarest intellect,
                  and very eccentric, so much so as to be accounted misanthropic, and even deranged.
                  Our accidental acquaintance quickly ripened into the warmest friendship, or, with
                  more truth, into love. In one respect, he and I were alike; neither of us had kith
                  or kin. But while I was comparatively poor, he was wealthy. He asked me to become
                  his adopted son, assuming his name in the State of South Carolina, but
                     nowhere else, and inheriting his possessions when he died, if I
                  should survive him. Eccentric enough, you will say, but, for this reason, the
                  sooner accepted by me.
               He then led me to this cave, which, by an accident, he had discovered long before,
                  and which, as you see, he had finished most elegantly. Not the slightest
                  alteration has been made since his demise. Removing hither from his cottage all
                  his instruments and library, he spent the greater portion of his time here in
                  solitary research of scientific and metaphysical subjects. It was here, too, that
                  he narrated to me the whole narrative of his eventful life, which, however, I may
                  never repeat to mortal ears.
               "Several years we spent together in happiness, and then Death called my adopted
                  father away to the duties of the other life. I had expected that on his deathbed
                  he would seek to exact the most eccentric promises from me, but, to my great
                  astonishment, he made but one request—that was, that six months of each twelve,
                  for the five years subsequent to his decease, I should spend in this cave, while
                  the other six I should spend exactly as I had been in the habit of doing before I
                  fell in with him. After the expiration of the time named, I might guide myself
                  according to my own pleasure. The five years were up a few days since. I had
                  intended, when Mr. Iredell died to spend my whole life here, but my determination
                  was altered by one single event."
               "And pray, what was it?" asked Eleanor, with curiosity.
               "It was my becoming acquainted with yourself, which, if you still remember, took
                  place about the time of which I speak."
               This answer was unexpected, and caused Eleanor suddenly to cast down her eyes and
                  to become some what confused.
               "And that," resumed Drayton, "was not the only result of that event. Shall I tell
                  you what was the other?"
               Eleanor smiled, without replying, and yet, by the very manner of her smile, gave
                  the assent asked for. Drayton, therefore, continued.
               "I became deeply interested in you, and finally fell deeply in love with you. I
                  learned of Santee's wicked plot, and determined to thwart him, whether I should
                  win your love or not. When you went North with your brothers I followed you, and
                  when you returned, I returned turned also, but more cautiously than before, for
                  the plotters against you had suspected me, and, consequently, were on their
                  guard.
               "I need hardly detail the subsequent events that happened. But may I ask of you
                  something in return for my services? Man, you know, is a selfish being."
               Another smile, this time accompanied by a gentle nod of the beautiful head was
                  Eleanor's reply.
               "Then, dearest Eleanor," resumed Drayton, growing so confidently bold as to pass
                  his arm about our heroine, and draw her to him, "reward me with yourself. Let me
                  call you my own through life, through eternity?"
               "William, dearest William," said Eleanor, in tones wealthy with love and
                  gratitude, "to no one could I more safely commit all I hold dear in life, here and
                  hereafter, as to you who have so often shielded me from harm."
               If the beautiful girl uttered other words, they were lost, as she allowed her head
                  to sink forward on her lover's manly breast. But it was all sufficient, without
                  other words, and the angels winged away to Heaven to record the vows of love and
                  constancy that were then made between two pure and noble souls.
               "But, dearest William," said Eleanor, looking up after the expiration of a few
                  minutes, "you have not yet told me how you effected my rescue to-night, or even
                  how you ascertained that I and poor Rosa were in Santee's clutches."
               "True! true!" replied Drayton, "it was not through any ability of my own.
                  Providence directed my course along the road you came, and as I overtook your
                  carriage, I heard you laugh. I instantly knew your voice, and riding forward, I
                  attempted to gain a sight of you, but the darkness prevented recognition. I saw
                  that your driver was Santee, however, for I had seen him in that disguise before.
                  Galloping ahead some distance, I turned aside, secured my horse, waited till the
                  carriage came up, and then followed it afoot to prevent discovery.
               "I was close by when you stopped out on Santee's porch. I heard you address him as
                  Iredell, and I heard him reply about being pursued, so as to distract your
                  suspicions. He little knew how truly he spoke! I was in the very act too, of
                  effecting your rescue, when he hurried you and unfortunate, noble Rosa inside, and
                  secured the door. To attack the massive portal, and thus inform Santee of my
                  presence, might be fatal to you, so I controlled my passion until I could climb in
                  at a second-story window. Rosa's scream was the first intimation I had of your
                  exact whereabouts.
               "Thank God I reached you in time for your salvation, and in time to mete out his
                  just deserts to that wicked man, Santee, who was a fit pet of the vile tyranny
                  that has so enslaved the people of the South. Truly the people of the South, while 
                     triving
                     striving
                   to make the shackles of 
                     theirs
                     their
                   miserable bondmen eternal, are riveting upon their own limbs irons,
                  that, for centuries to come, will eat into their very souls. But it is the
                  retributive justice of God!"
               "Would to heaven!" exclaimed Eleanor, a glow suffusing her lovely features, "that
                  I might take possession of Palmetto Plantation this very night. How soon would I fling to the breeze the
                  starry banner of the Union, and how soon would I, with a single stroke of the pen,
                  smite every soul-cankering fetter from every limb, whose only offense is that it
                  is black. Heaven! yes, Heaven knows my heart!"
               "Would Heaven you could, dearest, best Eleanor!" replied Drayton "but every slave,
                  man, woman and child, has been removed from the plantation and sent to the rebel
                  fortification."
               "Above which," added Eleanor, in a solemn tone, "may the glorious flag of the free
                  speedily float!"
               "Amen! amen!" said Drayton.
               Some further time was consumed by the betrothed lovers in arranging a plan to
                  reach the North. One was finally settled upon, and set for execution the next
                  night. To gather strength for the effort, each retired to slumber.
               Night came, and, full of hope and anxiety, our lovers set forth on their perilous
                  journey, both leaving their estates to their foes until the re-establishment over
                  them once more of the power and authority of the United States. Not a syllable
                  reached them, as they traveled their way, concerning the tragedy at Santee's
                  palatial mansion, and they therefore concluded that it had not yet been
                  discovered.
               Providence must have specially guarded the fugitives, for, though several times
                  almost captured, they at last reached the lines of the Federal army. Our heroine
                  was instantly recognized, and received such a reception as must have gladdened her
                  heart.
               Both Eleanor and Drayton shared in the glories and perils of Antietam's bloody
                  fray, and both shone brilliantly in that gallant contest for the holy cause.
                  Drayton, who had made artillery a subject of study, rendered the most valuable
                  services in that branch, and his was the honor of firing the last shell that
                  scattered terror among the foes of the Union on that sanguinary field.
               When, after the carnage had ended, he sought Eleanor, he found her bright,
                  beautiful, heroic as ever, ministering to the wounded and dying.
               "I now comprehend dearest Eleanor," said he, bending over her and fondly kissing
                  her, "how you came to be called THE ANGEL OF THE BATTLE-FIELD!"
               Other battles, more bloody than Antietam, have since been fought. President
                  Lincoln and many a noble soldier of the Union have passed away, and the black
                  cloud of treason which so long obscured the Sun of Liberty has passed away. But in
                  the blue union of our glorious flag three new stars have appeared,
                  rising from the blood of our noble soldiers and sailors. And, thank God, none of
                  these stars, nor yet any of the others, shall ever pass away!
            
            THE END.
