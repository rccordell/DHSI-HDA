            PREFACE.
            The following narrative, is one of real life. Some of the personages, here
               characterized, are still living; others, have gone to reap their reward. Many,
               probably, will read this Book, who are personally acquainted with the ADOPTED
               DAUGHTER ; and whatever may be the effect produced by the perusal of this story, the
               Author's intentions are good. Her aim, is to encourage those who are left orphans, in
               this unfriendly world, to persevere, through difficulties, with a firm hope, they
               will eventually overcome all obstacles. If they pursue the path of virtue, and shun
               vice, they most assuredly will come off conquerors at last.
            This is the sincere wish of
            
               THE WRITER.
            
         
      
      
         
            The Adopted daughter, or, The trials of Sabra
            
            NARRATIVE.
            
               CHAPTER I.
               MR.AND MRS. HUDSON.
               Samuel Hudson, was the son of a farmer, in good circumstances, who lived in the
                  town of S., M. county, Massachusetts. And in the town of C., near by, lived Miss
                  Ordelia Wilder, his affianced bride. She was the daughter of a farmer, who died,
                  leaving his widow with nine children, some of them quite small. They were all
                  industrious, and having one of the best mothers to superintend the management of
                  their affairs, they succeeded in keeping their farm, and acquired a good living.
                  They were brought up in a strict observance of the Unitarian doctrines, of good
                  morals.
               Samuel and Ordelia, were married at an early age. They selected a farm, for their
                  future residence, upon the lovely banks of the Nashua river, in the county of W.,
                  where they lived for many years, happily and contentedly. They gradually increased
                  in wealth, and often enlarged the borders of their farm. In a few years, they
                  became wealthy and independent. It is true,
                  they labored hard, but what of, that, when they could see the fruit of it.
               Within five years, after their marriage, they were blessed with three lovely sons.
                  The eldest was named Jason, after his grandfather H.; the second, Frederick, after
                  his grandfather W.,; and the youngest, Samuel, and for a long time the fond mother
                  called him her babe. Ordelia did not choose to keep any servants, consequently she
                  had to work very hard. Their farm, at that time, was not all paid for, and she did
                  not think they were able to hire. There was only sixteen months difference in the
                  ages of Jason and Fred, and so did Ordelia spin her day's work,
                  with Fred on her apron; he was always peevish, and would never
                  be quiet, away from his mother. often she would milk, four or five cows, with him
                  on her lap, and Jason beside her. Hard, indeed, did this dear mother labor, to
                  accumulate property, which, in the decline of life, she had not the liberty of,
                  controlling. Alas! how, little do some children realise, when they become men and
                  women, how much trouble, anxiety and care, they have caused their parents, in
                  their childhood. They seem to think, their parents must conform entirely to their
                  wishes. Far better would it be for them, if they indulged them with that kindness
                  with which they were indulged, in their childhood. Jason was a noble, generous
                  hearted boy, too liberal for his own good; he loved everybody, and every body
                  loved him. He was always kind to his parents; their slightest wish was, his will,
                  and he always performed it with pleasure. Frederick's character did not 
                     develope
                     develop
                   as much, in childhood. He was one of the still ones, rather selfish, but
                  on the whole might be called obedient child. Samuel was different from either; He
                  had a mind of his own; he was not disobedient, but would generally have his own
                  way, either by argument or by teasing, and he would also tease for his brothers,
                  as well as for himself. Consequently he was some times called "the tease." They
                  were all very industrious, and their father thought this was of more consequence
                  than acquiring an education. He was willing they should have the advantage of a
                  country district school, and this was all he thought necessary; this was all the
                  privilege he had received, and it would do very well for them; but Samuel managed,
                  somehow, to obtain an education superior to the rest. He afterwards became
                  competent to teach a village school.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               THE DAUGHTER.
               Ordelia toiled excessively, with her household duties, not thinking that her
                  unceasing labors were gradually breaking down her strong constitution, and that
                  eventually she would suffer the consequences of so doing. Alas! as the worm
                  commences at the root of the plant, and in an invisible manner hinders the
                  progress of its growth, so also, Ordelia was slowly destroying her health. The day
                  arrived, when they expected another to bless their family circle, Great hopes were
                  entertained, that the little stranger might be a daughter; to their joy, their
                  hopes were realized. Alas! how often, when the heart rejoices in the very height
                  of happiness, the cherished blessing is removed, and that heart is left to bleed
                  with anguish, until it saps at the fountain springs of life. So it was with
                  them.
               The fair flower was taken away, e'er she knew her mother's smiles. Many think that
                  the death of an infant, before it has entwined itself around the affections, by
                  its tender smiles, and its winning voice, is but a small source of sorrow. 'Tis
                  not so with the fond mother, who in her anguish has seen her beloved infant form
                  carried away, and she unable to follow, to see where they have laid it. How sad
                  does she feel the loss. She even longs to bestow that care, upon some object which
                  it would have been her pleasure to have performed for her child. She arouses from
                  her quiet slumber, at, the slightest noise. It is my child, is the first thought
                  that flits through her mind. But, alas, she finds her, child is not there, and the
                  encouraging truth flashes across her aching breast, that she will never more
                  behold its lovely face in this world; that it is among the bright angels of God,
                  who are his peculiar favorites, and perhaps,, at that very moment, its little
                  spirit is hovering around her head, whispering this cheering sentence, "weep not
                  for me."
               Deeply, very deeply, did Ordelia feel the loss of her little infant, and slowly
                  did she regain her health. When she recovered, her anxiety increased, to be
                  without servants. As soon as possible, she dismissed them, and attended to her
                  domestic duties herself. Her manifold cares seemed to divert her mind from her
                  loss, but there was still a vacuum in her heart, which the other children could
                  not fill. They were out at work, with their father during the day; indeed, they
                  were, not as fond of being petted as many children, but were aspiring to see which
                  could be the most like a man; which could do the most work; or, which could shoot
                  at target the best, which was a favorite amusement for them all.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               THE INTRODUCTION OF SABRA.
               One morning, Mr. Hudson came in from his field, and requested his wife to mix for
                  him a mug of molasses, ginger and water. Ordelia was nursing Sabra. She had been
                  straightening her flaxen hair, and making little curls. She was a beautiful little
                  child, one year old, her eyes sparkled with brightness; they were of that
                  expression, which speaks the sentiment of the heart, plainer than language. She
                  placed the child upon the floor, and she cast back upon her a grateful look, which
                  fully recompensed Ordelia for all her trouble. Mr. Hudson commenced playing with
                  her, she attempted to climb upon his knee; he took her up, and was caressing her,
                  as Ordelia entered, with the ginger and water prepared. He took a drought, and
                  then asked Ordelia, what she intended to do with Sabra? Ordelia looked at her
                  husband, with one of those tender glances, which an affectionate, loving wife
                  bestows upon her companion, when about to ask a favor, and then replied, "I intend
                  to keep her, if you are willing. Her mother says she will give her to us, if we
                  will adopt her, and bring her up as one of ours; you know that she loves me
                  already, as dearly as if I were her mother. She has been with us but a few weeks,
                  and she has already won our affections." Samuel looked very thoughtful. He soon
                  replied: "I have no objections; if you choose to keep her, I am perfectly willing,
                  if we can have the whole control of her, but I should not wish to have mother see
                  her often, lest it should make her discontented."
               "You need not fear that," said Ordelia, "for her mother is going to leave this
                  place, and is anxious to have us take her; she says she will not come here, except
                  to inquire after her health. She says we can bring her up and give her a better
                  education than she can, and she will leave her entirely to us, if we will adopt
                  her; and I wish to, if I keep her. It seems to me, that she would repair the loss
                  of our little daughter. She is very winning in her nature, and tiny ways, I love
                  her dearly, and feel as if I could not part with her." And she pressed the child
                  tenderly to her bosom, saying: "No, my darling, I cannot part with you. I think
                  the boys will love her too. Jason is fond of her already, and often brings her
                  playthings; but you know that the other boys, never notice children; they may love
                  her, after a while, they cannot avoid it, for every body seems to love her." "And
                  she is to call us papa and mama"? said Samuel. "Certainly," said Ordelia, "she
                  calls me mama already." "Well, said Samuel, "I think it a very good plan;" and it
                  was fully decided, that they would adopt Sabra, as their daughter. Her mother was
                  informed of their decision, and consented to their requirements.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               SABRA'S CHILDHOOD.
               Her days of childhood, were indeed happy days. She knew nothing of want. She was
                  naturally, cheerful and happy, and never had trouble, as many other children,, but
                  was happy in the thought of loving, and being loved. When the boys were informed,
                  by their parents, that they had adopted Sabra, as their daughter, Fred or Samuel
                  did not seem to care about it, either way, but Jason was well pleased; he said,
                  she would be company for his mother, and soon be able to help her. He said she was
                  no trouble to any person. He soon won her affections, by his kindness, and he
                  always loved her as a sister. She, unconscious little creature, knew no
                  difference. She would climb upon her father's knee, whenever he came in, and he
                  was always ready to receive her. Jason made a nice little trundle- bed for her;
                  and took her to the shop, and placed her in it, and drew her to the house. He
                  often made playthings for her amusement. All these kindnesses were treasured up in
                  her little memory, never to be forgotten. Sabra had been sick for a few days; was
                  recovering, but had no appetite; Jason was sitting with her, upon the door step;
                  there came a squirrel running past; Jason picked up a stone, threw it, and killed
                  the squirrel. He dressed it, and said, Sabra could eat it; his mother cooked it.
                  She ate that, and it seemed to increase her appetite. Afterwards, he killed wild
                  game for her, every day, until she was quite well.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               JASON'S SICKNESS.
               The three sons, worked very hard; Jason being the eldest, took the heaviest part
                  of the work. This proved a great injury to him, for he worked and lifted more than
                  he was able to bear. He wrenched his side, which brought on a severe sickness, and
                  was never healthy afterwards. For a long time, they did not expect him to recover,
                  and when he began to amend, it was slowly, for his constitution was impaired, and
                  it was decided that he was not able, or strong enough, to work on the farm.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE NEW HOUSE.
               The house, that stood upon the farm when they bought, was getting very old, and
                  began to decay. It was also too small for their family. Samuel had been making
                  preparations to build for a long time. He was one of those close, calculating men,
                  who was always using economy to save money, and all that could be done by
                  themselves, was thought of, and contrived to the best advantage. He thought he
                  would build of brick, for he could have them made upon his own farm, and that
                  would save expense; he was calculating to build a large house, and have it
                  finished neatly. He was able to have it built exactly to his mind, and he expected
                  it to cost him, at least, three thousand dollars. He had his men employed, and at
                  the commencement, He said to Ordelia, he was afraid that Sabra would be in the
                  way, while they had such a large family, or that she would get hurt among the
                  timber, or sharp edged tools. Ordelia had feared the same, and had been talking
                  with Mrs. Heulet, their nearest neighbor, about it. Mrs. Heulet had, very kindly,
                  offered to have Sabra come and stay with them, while they were building. Ordelia
                  told her husband, and he thought she had better consent to let her go, for a short
                  time. She very reluctantly consented. Every night, after her work was done, she
                  would go and see her, and tell her that, in a few days, she should come back, and
                  have a nice large house to live in, and have a nice closet for her clothes, and a
                  shelf in it for her doll; but it so happened, that she did not stay long, for one
                  day, as she was playing, she accidentally fell partly in some hot water, that was
                  left standing on the floor, and was badly scalded. Ordelia's troubles were now
                  increased, for she could not feel easy about her, although she well knew, all was
                  done for her that could be desired. One evening, she asked Sabra if she wished to
                  go home with mama. She quickly replied, that she did, and that Jason could take
                  care of her; that she should soon be well, if she could be at home. Her mother
                  took her in her arms, and carried her home, and with careful nursing, she soon
                  recovered. Mrs. Heulet was very kind to Sabra, and allowed her to call her aunt.
                  She had a son, who had been married a short time previous, living in the same
                  family. They were also very fond of Sabra, and she served as a plaything, and
                  became much attached to them, and has ever since remained so; we shall have
                  occasion to speak of their kindness, hereafter.
               One morning, Katy, the hired girl, came running in to the house, and said to Mrs.
                  Hudson, come and see Jason!" She went to the door, and was quite frightened, for
                  Jason had Sabra nearly to the top of the ladder, and was taking her to the roof of
                  the building, where the men were
                  shingling the house. It was very large; two stories high. He kept her there some
                  time, for it pleased her exceedingly, to gaze off upon the large green flats. She
                  has related to me, how beautifully every thing looked, while she stood upon the
                  top of that house. Jason took her down safely, and led her to her mother, and told
                  her she need not fear that he would let her fall, for he was always careful of
                  her. Sabra was playing with the blocks, and the master builder said to her: "You
                  are a very little girl, to be trudging about here." "Yes, sir," she replied, "I am
                  little, but good." She was always ready to give them an answer, which often amused
                  them very much. They were all very kind to her, and this was a great comfort to
                  her mother, for she loved her dearly, and was very indulgent to her, and allowed
                  her to play out around the door, and by so doing, she found her but very little
                  trouble.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               THE FIRST PUNISHMENT.
               After the house was completed, and the family had moved into it, Mrs. Hudson was
                  turning a large cheese, to put back into the press, for they had a large dairy.
                  She was paring off the tender rind and giving it to Sabra, who was very fond of
                  it, and was always watching to get it. Mrs. Hudson had left a large cheese upon
                  the table, without trimming it; Sabra thought she would help herself; she
                  commenced nibbling off the rind, and nearly spoiled the cheese. When her mother
                  saw the mischief, done to the cheese, she was not sure which had broken it, she
                  was confident it was either Sabra or the cat. She called Sabra, and asked her if
                  she had eaten the cheese; she replied, "yes, mama." You little rogue, you, your
                  mama will punish you, if you spoil another cheese. Sabra looked as if astonished,
                  to hear of punishment; she did not cry, she seldom had any trouble to cause her to
                  shed tears. She went to play, as if nothing had happened. A few days after this,
                  Mrs. Hudson left another cheese in the same manner. Sabra was playing about as
                  usual, and seeing it, she began to break off the rind, as she previously had done;
                  she ate all she wished for, without thinking of her mama's commands. Mrs. Hudson
                  soon saw what had befallen the cheese;
                  she called Sabra, and asked her if she bad broken it. She promptly replied, yes,
                  mama." But do you not recollect I told you, I should punish you" if you spoiled
                  another cheese? Which is your choice, to be whipped, or be shut in the cellar?
                  Sabra quickly replied: "I had rather be whipped." "Than I shall put you in the
                  cellar."' She took be by the hand, and led her down the stairs, and placed her in
                  one of the arches which formed a closet, and closed the door. She went to the top
                  of the stairs, and stopped to listen, for she, expected she would be frightened;
                  but to her surprise, she did not say a word, for some minutes. She then called her
                  mama, and asked how long she had got to stay there. Her mama did not answer her,
                  but waited, expecting to hear her cry.
               After some minutes she commenced crying, and her mother hastened to let her out of
                  her prison. She never, again, nibbled a cheese. Her mother has often said, that
                  she never, after this, had cause to punish her for disobedience. She would also
                  say,, very few mothers have as little trouble with their children, as I have with
                  Sabra.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               THE PARTING WITH JASON.
               It was finally decided that Jason should go to a trade, This was a great
                  affliction to his mother and Sabra. He Was not as healthy as the other boys, and
                  his mother felt quite anxious about him; he was exceedingly kind to her, and also
                  to Sabra, who loved him dearly and delighted to be with him. If he went to walk,
                  he would let her go; if he went to catch pigeons with a net, he would let her lay
                  the bait; if he was from home, she would watch for his return. After he left home,
                  she was very lonely; if he was expected, she would seat herself at the door, or
                  window, and look for him; if told that she must go to bed, she would lay awake and
                  listen, to hear his voice. He would always go and speak to her, and if allowed,
                  she would get up. He always brought something to please her. If asked who she
                  loved the best, she would say, mama, and papa, and Jason.
               Sabra often wondered why Frederick and Samuel did not love her as Jason did. Some
                  times she would fancy that Samuel did love her, for he often called upon her to
                  wait on him, to bring his boots, his hat, or his coat, and as she became
                     older she would take care of them;. some times
                     put strings in his shoes, brush his coat, and hang it up. He was kind to her, but she loved
                  and feared him, for he would always reprove her, if he thought she had done wrong.
                  Some times she would grieve and shed tears alone. When about six years old, she
                  had the whooping cough, and was coughing very severely on the door step; she heard
                  Samuel say to his mother, that he did not believe she had the whooping cough, but
                  he thought she made it. Now, Sabra was very conscientious, and very sensitive, it
                  grieved her exceedingly; her mother found her crying, as if her heart would break;
                  she soon cheered and soothed her sorrows, by her kindness. Often was her feeling
                  heart almost broken by such remarks, while she was ignorant of the true cause.
               One day, there came a lady there; Sabra did not like her, she thought she appeared
                  strange; she thought her mother was not very glad to see her, she knew not why;
                  but she did not stay long; Sabra was glad, for she thought her mother was afraid
                  to have her talk with her. After she was gone, Fred told Sabra, that woman was her
                  other mama, and that some day she would come and take her away. Sabra did not
                  believe him; she soon went to her mama and told her what Fred had said. Her mother
                  said, poh! it is all nonsense, Fred only said that to tease you, there will no
                  person carry away my darling child: I could not spare you. Sabra learned to make
                  herself useful, when quite young; she would gather chips, bring wood, and thus
                  save her mama many steps. She learned different kinds of employment; when only
                  five years old she knit herself a pair of stockings, and then began to knit for
                  the family. She would knit the foot of a man's sock in a day, easily, and
                  performed her task with pleasure, for she took delight in being praised.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               SABRA'S SCHOOL DAYS.
               Sabra's advantages for acquiring an education, were limited. Living in the
                  country, and the district being small, they employed a teacher only a few weeks
                  during the year; generally ten or twelve weeks in the winter, and seven weeks in
                  the summer; and in the latter, the girls devoted much of their time to needle
                  work, their mothers thinking it more profitable for them to learn there, than for
                  them to spend their time to learn them at home
               Very few books were used in the common schools, and at the end of each term, they
                  must be carefully laid aside, in some box or drawer, and remain there until the
                  commencement of another term. Few books were accessible in that family. The Bible,
                  the Hymn Book, and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, with three or four other books,
                  were thought quite sufficient. THE knitting ting work, was a far more important occupation for the leisure moments. Sabra
                  was confined to the common spelling book, in school, until she had nearly
                  committed it to memory. By hearing the older scholars recite grammar, she had
                  nearly committed that to memory, also. One day her teacher told her she might
                  study grammar, if she would bring one to school. She was very much pleased, and
                  hastened to tell her mama. Her mother was willing, and said, perhaps Samuel would
                  let her have his old one. Samuel was willing, and gave her that, and an old
                  English Reader, and Fred gave her an Arithmetic; with these books, she felt quite
                  pleased. Her teacher was surprised, to see with what ease she committed her
                  lessons. The first time her brother Jason came home, she asked him to give her his
                  old Geography and Atlas; he cheerfully gave them to her. Some of the maps were
                  nearly worn out, but she managed to change with Henrietta Heulet, her class mate,
                  and by so doing, she always had her lessons perfectly. Henrietta and Sabra were
                  great friends, and were always striving to see which could be at the head of the
                  class. At one time, the inspector, Mr. Allen, said to the committee, that
                  Henrietta and Sabra might be weighed in almost any balance and not be found
                  wanting. This encouraged them to persevere, and they were remarkable scholars,
                  considering the limited privileges they enjoyed.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               THE SUBJECT OF RELIGION.
               Sabra became the subject of religious impressions, at an early age. When only ten
                  years old, she would retire alone, and pray God to forgive her sins and change her
                  heart. She was a Sabbath school scholar, when Sabbath schools were first organized
                  in that section, and continued connected with it for many years, and became a
                  teacher. When she was about ten years old, there was a revival of religion, in the
                  Baptist church, where she attended worship. Her mother, for many years, had been
                  thought to be a christian, and was exemplary for piety, and early instructed Sabra
                  in the path of virtue and religion. At one time, previous to this revival, she
                  placed her hand upon Sabra's head, and earnestly and fervently prayed to God, to
                  convert her child, and make her an heir of glory. This one prayer, Sabra never
                  forgot. Still, Mrs. Hudson had no abiding evidence in her own heart, of her
                  acceptance with God, but like Thomas, was filled with doubts and fears, she was
                  waiting for some wonderful manifestation of Divine power. It was not so with her
                  father, or the boys. They were worldly minded, and sought for their pleasure in
                  worldly amusements. Upright in their dealings, they thought this sufficient. But
                     at the time of this reformation, Mr.
                  Hudson became serious, and gave the subject of religion his attention, and was
                  hopefully converted to God, and became useful member in the church. During the
                  revival, and just as light began to dawn upon Mrs. Hudson's mind, there was great
                  excitement, caused by a, remark made by Mr. W, a member of the church, whom it was
                  always though possessed more religion in the head than heart. Mr. and Mrs. Hudson,
                  and Sabra, were at the meeting, and at the close, Mr.W. came and said to Mrs.
                  Hudson, "I have lately been spoken to by the Lord, concerning you; unless you turn
                  to God immediately, and go forward ad make a public profession of religion, you
                  will be left in the greatest horror of mind, that ever any poor creature
                  experienced; . darkness and despair will come upon you, and you will be left
                  without hope." This alarmed her very much, and she being of a nervous temperament,
                  and not enjoying good health at the time, she went home almost in despair. And,
                  truly, deep darkness overclouded her mind. While she saw her companion, and
                  others, rejoicing in the first fruits of pardoning love, she was overwhelmed in
                  darkness; the state of her mind impaired her bodily health, and she became unable
                  to attend to her household duties, and soon was confined to her room. It then
                  became necessary for them to employ a housekeeper. They employed a girl, named
                  Betsey, some called her an old maid; but she was a member of the Baptist church,
                  consequently she must be considered suitable. She, too, had more religion in the
                  head, than heart; her tongue was never tired, talking either to Mr. H. or singing;
                  she would often induce him to sing with her, and make the house ring. This was no
                  comfort to Mrs. H., in her trying situation of body and mind; beside this, Betsey
                  did not seem to like Sabra, but seemed to watch her with a jealous eye, and often
                  found fault with her, without just cause. Sabra's mother felt very tender towards
                  her, and liked to have her present with her, most of the time. Sabra would sit by
                  her bedside, and give her medicine when necessary. She often read chapters of
                  comfort and consolation from the Bible. Her mother would request her often, to
                  read the eighty-eighth Psalm; she thought it applicable to herself ; many of the
                  Psalms of David, and the afflictions of Job, seemed to bring comfort to her
                  mind.
               She did not expect to recover her health, and her greatest worldly trouble was for
                  Sabra's welfare. She would say "What will become of Sabra, when I am gone?" Mr.
                  Hudson assured her, that Sabra should be well provided for, and often promised
                  her, in the presence of Sabra, and others, that his property should be equally
                  divided among the four children when he had done with it, and he would not neglect
                  to attend to it, during his life-time.
               Jason had left home; be was more delicate than the other boys, and needed more
                  assistance; this caused his mother many an, anxious thought. Her husband assured
                  her, that she need have no trouble on
                  their account, for Jason and Sabra should share equally with the others.
               All Sabra desired, was her mother's recovery. Young as she was, she often prayed
                  earnestly for this; she seemed to understand her mother's trials, and to
                  sympathize with her, and often endeavored to cheer her heart, by quoting passages
                  from the Scriptures. She felt assured that her mother was a Christian, and labored
                  to persuade her to think the same of herself. Mrs. Hudson thought it was the duty
                  of the Christian to be baptized by immersion, but she could not believe in close
                  communion, or close baptism, as they call it. She believed, that the sacrament of
                  the Lord's Supper, was prepared for every name or denomination; and being filled
                  with doubts and fears, in regard to her own 
                     exceptance
                     acceptance
                   with Christ, she could not see it her duty to be baptized, when her
                  husband was, and she felt quite depressed, when he went forward to receive the
                  ordinance. The winter season, with its dreary aspect and its chilling effect upon
                  the gloomy mind, gradually passed away, and spring, sweet spring, with its balmy
                  influence, ushered in to cheer the despondent heart, and Mrs. Hudson's bodily
                  health began to improve. She was soon able to walk out, and view the wonderful
                  works of nature, that handy-work of that God, whom she had been wont to adore and
                  worship, with love and reverence. Some times she would think, if she had never
                  been converted, she would not be subject of such feelings, and she occasionally
                  had a faint hope; her spirits gradually revived vived, and during the summer she
                  was able, with Sabra's assistance, to attend to her household duties, and to
                  dismiss Betsey; this was a great relief to them both, for neither of them liked
                  her. Sabra's religious impressions never left her; she viewed the Saviour as the
                  giver of all her blessings, and always thought it her duty to pray to him as her
                  benefactor; still, she had not the hope of a Christian, until past her eighteenth
                  year. She always took great delight in the Sabbath school, and was seldom absent
                  from church. Their parson, the Rev. Mr. Saunderson, had six sons; the two eldest
                  were twins; they were a year older than Sabra; she had been accustomed to see them
                  at church, from her earliest recollection; they always recited a large number of
                  verses. Sabra watched them with a critical eye, and strove to recite as many
                  verses as they did; she was unwilling to have them excel her in any thing. She
                  thought them the best boys in school, and the fact was, she thought their equal
                  could not be found. These were her early impressions, but more on the subject
                  hereafter.
               Often, while reciting from the Holy Scriptures, and while listening to remarks in
                  the Sabbath school, would Sabra resolve to give her heart to Christ, and become a
                  Christian; she seemed to have clear views of what was requisite, but being of a
                  lively temperament and somewhat gay, the cares and pleasures of the world overcame
                  her resolutions, and she remained the same, always convicted of sin and of duty,
                  but unconverted. Her mother was less anxious about her literary attainments than her domestic
                  cheese improvements. She was anxious to give her a knowledge of all kinds of
                  domestic employment; she learned to make butter and cheese, to spin and weave, to
                  braid straw, to work lace, and to turn her hand to any employment, whereby she
                  might earn a shilling. With the proceeds, she purchased her clothing; she was thus
                  learned, while very young, to depend upon her own industry, which was a great
                  benefit to her in after years. Between the age of twelve and fifteen, many
                  memorable events transpired, which are recorded in the following Chapter.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE TWO MARRIAGES.
               Frederick always lived at home, and was called bashful, but he married first. It
                  did not require much courage to win his bride, for he married his cousin, Marina
                  Bronson. She was possessed of some good qualities, and became an amiable woman.
                  But at this time, she possessed a large phrenological development, upon the top of
                  her head, which made her aware of all her good qualities. She could braid more
                  yards of straw in a day than any one else; she could make a cheese in the morning,
                  and cut and make a pair of pants the same day; she could wash and iron, and go to
                  the neighbors and tell of it; could spin two days' work in one. These were
                  valuable qualities in a family like this, for there was be done. She was gay,
                  dressy and proud, and always thought her own way the best. Hudson, being of a
                  yielding disposition, Marina soon found it an easy matter to rule In most
                  things.
               It soon became evident, that she did not like Sabra, And her remarks often caused
                  Mrs. Hudson much grief. Sabra tried very hard to please her, but she often had
                  cause to weep, in consequence of Marina's taunting remarks. Their mother was a
                  real peace-maker, and told Sabra that she must not notice them; but be a good
                  girl, and all would be right, by and by. Sabra always worked very hard, and had
                  had the promise of many privileges, when the boys got married.) One was, she
                  should go to school; but she saw no prospect of doing so, for worldly mindedness
                  seemed to increase, and to know how to do all kinds of work, seemed to be the main
                  object Sabra, and her mother; could see that Fred's mind was becoming prejudiced,
                  for formerly He had never spoke harshly to Sabra, but was indifferent; now he
                  often found fault with her. This grieved her often, but she knew the Cause, and
                  feared the result.
               Fred and his wife lived by themselves, and had half of the house, it being large
                  enough enough for two families. Samuel had been from home much of the time, for three or four years; he did not
                  like to work on a farm. He was soon to be married, and his father thought he had
                  better bring his wife home, for the farm was large enough for all; they could live
                  with him in the family, until they could build, then he would take the new house,
                  and the boys, (as he called them,) could have the large one. Samuel married a
                  farmer's daughter, in the same town; she was different from Fred's wife, in almost
                  every respect. The peacock and the dove, might compare as well as these two
                  persons. Asenath, Samuel's wife, was equally as smart for business, and could do
                  as much work as Marina, but she had not the faculty of telling of it. She was
                  unassuming in every respect, and mild and forbearing; she thought others as good,
                  or better than herself; kind to all, and especially to Sabra, and Sabra loved her
                  dearly; she thought her a very dear sister. She knew very well that Asenath loved
                  her as a sister, and treated her as such; she was always happy while with her, and
                  it was always a pleasure for her to do her, or Samuel, a favor. Samuel was quite
                  willing to be waited upon, and always called upon Sabra.
               Jason lived in the town of C., about eighteen miles distant. News came that he
                  would bring his intended bride to his father's, on a visit. Great preparations
                  were "made for their entertainment, for report said she was quite a lady, and a
                  school teacher. Sabra was very careful to have every thing in its proper place,
                  and to be as tidy as possible. She longed to see Jason, but she feared that she
                  would not dare to speak to the lady. She felt sure, that if Jason liked her, she
                  would like her too. But, Oh! if she should meet her displeasure, would she not
                  influence Jason to dislike her; this thought she could not bear, and she gave vent
                  to her grief by a flood of tears. Thus soliloquised Sabra, the day before their
                  arrival. She knew there would be much work to be performed, for they kept no
                  servants, as they do now, and she intended to do all she could, that her mother
                  might sit down and visit with her.
               It was a beautiful summer's day, the sun beamed calmly upon the fields and upon
                  the towering oaks; it was shady at the front of the house, and all were ready for
                  their reception. Sabra had been watching for them, from the chamber window; she
                  had seen a chaise in the distance, and she thought it must be them, she went down
                  stairs and told her mother they were coming; she took her spectacles off and
                  quietly folded them together, and laid them by and waited their arrival. Marina
                  was all on tiptoe, as usual, as if she was all the person to seen. Not so with the
                  quiet Asenath, she kept back and let her mother have an introduction first. After
                  they had all had an introduction, Jason came to Sabra, and appeared very glad to
                  see her. Henrietta, for this was the lady's name, followed, and clasping Sabra's
                  hand, said: "And this is your little sister, I have so often heard you speak of?"
                  How those words thrilled through Sabra's heart; her embarrassment barrassment was all gone, and she thought she never
                  heard a voice so sweet, or saw a form so graceful; if she was a lady, she thought
                  she would like very much to be one herself. When they went to milk, Henrietta went
                  tripping along, with them. She had always lived in a village, and had never milked
                  a cow. She thought it very strange that Sabra could milk, she was so small. Marina
                  tried very 
                     had
                     hard
                   to engross all her attention, by talking as fast as possible, but
                  Henrietta would listen to others as well as her, and would often talk with
                  Sabra.
               The next day, in the morning, the boys went out to hunt for wild game. After
                  dinner, they talked of taking a pleasure ride; they were going to the a adjoining
                  town. Sabra was not accustomed to hear of pleasure riding; she thought it would be
                  very nice, three bellows topped chaises in a row. She expected to stay at home,
                  but Jason said that Sabra might go with them. "Yes," said Henrietta come my dear
                  girl and get ready." Asenath said she would assist her in getting ready; her
                  father and mother were very glad to have her go. She was nearly ready, when Fred
                  came in. He inquired where she was going? His mother said she is going with
                  Jason." "Oh pshaw!" said Fred "we don't want her," and Marina said she should not
                  think she would want to go; but it was just like her, and she flirted out of the
                  room, muttering to herself. Asenath said she saw no reason why Sabra should stay
                  at home, she would like to have her go. But Samuel, seeing how opposed Fred and
                  Marina were, said she had better stay at home. Every thing must be as he said, and
                  Sabra took off her bonnet. Her little heart was near bursting with grief but she
                  said not a word. Henrietta said "Do not feel disappointed, I will give you this,
                  taking a beautiful necklace from her own neck, and placing it upon Sabra's, who
                  thought she had never seen any thing as beautiful. She had often thought she would
                  like to ask Henrietta to let her see it, but she feared, lest she should think her
                  bold or inquisitive; but now, she could examine it, and call it her own. But think
                  not, gentle reader, that even this great gift, could heal the wound made in that
                  tender heart. No, a thousand gifts like that, could not have been a substitute for
                  that affection, for which she pined. Hard, indeed, must be that unfeeling heart,
                  that cannot bestow a kind look, word or deed, when it will not cost a farthing,
                  and harder still, the heart that will prevent others from bestowing them. But,
                  reader, Fred looked to the future; he feared the loss of the (with him) precious
                  dollar; he knew that his father intended Sabra should be brought up as their own
                  child, and share in his large estate equally with the rest, and he was determined
                  it should be otherwise, and Marina was always ready to assist him, in trying to
                  frustrate his father's designs; they seemed to think, that to destroy the
                  affection that existed in the family towards her, would be the safest way, but
                  this was not an easy task, for no one but an unreasonable selfish person, could
                  avoid admiring Sabra bra's good
                  disposition and amiable qualities, always yielding and submissive, ever ready to
                  run at every call, and constantly seeking that affection that she was ready to
                  bestow on every creature; even the faithful dog and cat, the horse and cow, were
                  petted by her, for it was her nature to love.
               After they were gone, her father said it was too bad that she could not go, he saw
                  no reason for her staying at home, it would have been as pleasant to her as the
                  rest. Her mother said she felt grieved, but it could not be helped, Fred would
                  have his own way. Yes, said her father, and I suppose he thinks he always will,
                  but I intend to hold the reins in my own hands. After this conversation, Sabra
                  went to her own a room, and gave vent to her feelings by a flood of tears. She
                  often found relief in this way; she never went to her mother with her trouble, for
                  she did not like to hurt her feelings. She thought to herself, why is it that Fred
                  and Samuel do not love me; she knew that her father and mother, Jason and Asenath,
                  loved her, still she did more for Samuel than for any of them, for he wished to be
                  waited upon; she thought it the greatest pleasure to perform any service they
                  might require. Before they returned, she became composed, and went down stairs to
                  assist her mother. She endeavored to appear as if nothing had happened.
               After they returned, Henrietta asked Sabra to walk with her, and show her the
                  garden. When they were alone, she said: "The next time I come here on a visit, I
                  wish you to go home with me, and we will have fine times, I have no sister, and I
                  should like your company." Sabra was pleased with the prospect of a visit, or she
                  had never been far from home. Henrietta told her that Jason often talked of her,
                  and said he wished she could live with him, and go go to school. The third day,
                  they went home; Sabra often thought of them, and wished that they might come
                  again, for her father and mother said she might go with them.
               Gossip was as prevalent in those days as it is at the present, and it was rumored
                  that Jason was to be married soon. Some said his intended was a lady, and knew
                  nothing about work, and others that she was rich, and did not need to work; others
                  said that she had an education, and taught school. The latter was correct. Her
                  father died when she was quite young, leaving his widow and daughter, a property
                  sufficient for their maintenance. But gossip cannot be confined to one place, or
                  person; every person liked Mrs. Hudson, she was the first to be sent for in
                  sickness, always gathered herbs enough in the fall to supply all her neighbors,
                  and people said that Sabra was just like her mother, for she knew the name, nature
                  and use, of every herb that grew near, and always assisted her mother in gathering
                  them. In addition to Mrs. Hudson's good qualities, she must, of course, have bad
                  ones; and her great besetting sin, in the eyes of the community, was her
                  indulgence to Sabra. Every body said, she would be a spoiled child, and this flame was constantly kept burning by
                  Marina who never let an opportunity pass without leaving the impression, that
                  Sabra always did just as she pleased.
               Nabby Merrium lived near Mrs. Hudson, and was very sensitive, about the time she
                  heard of an intended marriage, (her name being already placed on the old maid's
                  list,) and hearing of Jason's visit, she thought by calling upon Mrs. H., perhaps
                  she might hear something about Jason, or his lady; she thought she would gain Mrs.
                  H.'s confidence, by telling her what she heard. After some preliminary remarks,
                  she said: "Mrs. Hudson, do you know what the neighbor's say about you?" Mrs. H.
                  replied, that she knew of nothing in particular. "Well, continued Nabby, they say
                  you are spoiling Sabra." 'Ah! how so?" said Mrs. H. "By always letting her have
                  her own way." Well, indeed, I do not see how I can spoil her in this way, for she
                  never disobeys me, never teases me, and seldom goes from home, and she is very
                  industrious; she can spin her day's work in a day, although she is not tall enough
                  to turn the wheel, I have ` to lay a plank on the floor, raised at one end, for
                  her to stand upon, and she makes good yarn. She is spinning cotton, now; I am
                  making a long web of cotton and linen, and I intend she shall have her share of
                  it, and all those plaid blankets; I made four of each kind, that they may each of
                  them have one; I intend they shall all share alike, and such articles as I think
                  will be worn out, I make five, that leaves one for myself; all those table cloths
                  and towels, which you saw me making, were five of each kind, and laid by
                  themselves. Sabra takes as much interest in the work as I do; in fact, she never
                  deserves a reproof, If I have less trouble than other mothers have with their
                  children, I ought to be thankful, and be kind to her. It is true, she has her own
                  way, but her way is my way, and there never was a better child. If people had
                  said, that I kept her too much confined, and that she had to work too hard, they
                  might have some cause for saying so; I do not intend to have her work as hard
                  always; she ought to be going to school now. "For my part," said Mrs. H., "I shall
                  pay no attention to what folks say, unless it is of more consequence."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE VISIT OF MRS. HUDSON'S BROTHER.
               Sabra Hudson was taught to call all Mr. and Mrs. Hudson's brothers and sisters,
                  uncles and aunts, indeed, she knew no difference; they all considered her a member
                  of the family. But at this time, Mrs. Hudson had a brother visit them from a
                  distance; he was a large fleshy man, full of good humor and apparent
                  mirthfulness.
               Soon after his arrival, he said to Sabra: "And who is this little black eyed girl,
                  sister?" Mrs. Hudson replied: "It is my daughter." "But, I thought you buried your
                  daughter?" Not this one;" at the same time drawing Sabra near her, and giving him
                  a wink. They dropped the subject. Mrs. Hudson never liked to have any person 
                     alude
                     allude
                   to her adoption; she considered Sabra her own child, and wished every
                  one else to do so.
               Sabra had not heard any allusion made to her adoption, for a long time; she had
                  nearly forgotten that dear mother, which she loved so fondly, was indeed not her
                  parent, and a feeling of sadness crept over her. Her uncle was very talkative, and
                  had a great deal to say to her. He told her, that he was a Methodist, and he
                  questioned her upon religious subjects; he told her, that among them, children as
                  young as herself self, often became church members. He was a great singer, and
                  went about the house and yard, singing as if very happy. At evening, he sang and
                  prayed in the family; his prayer was fervent and spiritual; the tears flowed
                  freely from Sabra's eyes, notwithstanding her effort to restrain them. After she
                  retired, she was overwhelmed in reverie; she thought of her loneliness, of the
                  resolutions she had so often made to be a Christian. She had often heard of the
                  Methodists, but there were none in that town; the nearest society was distant
                  seven miles; she wished she could hear them preach. She believed that John Bunyan
                  was one; she loved to read his Pilgrim's Progress and Shrubsole, she wondered if
                  he was not a Methodist. Thus she spent the most of the night, thinking and
                  weeping. Towards morning, she fell asleep; she dreamed of Angels and of Heaven,
                  and of an innumerable company praising God. Early in the morning, she was awakened
                  by her uncle, passing through the hall, singing this hymn:
               
                  
                     A mighty love inspires, my soul with sacred fires,
                     And animate desires, my soul to renew;
                     I love my blessed Jesus, on whom bright Angels gaze,
                     And symphony increases, above the etherial blue;
                     And Oh! give him glory; and Oh I give him glory,
                     For glory is his due.
                  
               
               The hall extended through the house, above and below, and he made it ring with
                  melody. Devotion, like this, was unusual in this family; if performed at all, it
                  must be with the utmost solemnity. There
                  was seldom time for family prayers, except upon the Sabbath, and then Fred and
                  Samuel never remained. They did not attend church, where their father and mother
                  did; they attended the Unitarian church, occasionally. This was the most popular,
                  and besides, their minister, Mr. A., would take supper with the young people when
                  they had a ball. Marina was fond of dancing, and she could influence the rest when
                  ever she chose.
               During Mr. W.'s stay, he said to his sister: "Ordelia, you ought to send Sabra to
                  school, she has intellect, and would easily become a good scholar. I have had
                  considerable conversation with her, and she has a depth of mind seldom found in a
                  child of her age; and she would make a splendid singer, she is quick to learn a
                  tune, she has learned a number of me, it has taken but little time, her voice is
                  melodious. She ought to sing God's praises here, for God has sealed her for his
                  own, and that child will praise Him in a fairer clime." These words affected her
                  mother very much, she knew that Sabra's advantages were limited; she replied: "I
                  hope Jason will send her to school, as he lives in a village." When he was
                  leaving, he called Sabra to him and said to her, that probably they would never
                  meet again on the shores of time, but that they would meet beyond the grave, to
                  praise God forever, in sweet melodious strains, and then commenced singing a
                  beautiful hymn, which he had taught her to sing. The following is the first
                  verse:
               
                  
                     My soul is fall of glory, inspiring my tongue,
                     Could I meet with angels, I would sing them a song;
                     I would sing of my Jesus, and tell of his charms,
                     And beg them to bear me, to his loving arms.
                  
               
               He then bade them farewell. Sabra often thought of him, after he was gone, and
                  wondered if all the Methodists were like him; she had heard them spoken of as a
                  very plain rigid sect of Christians, but she intended to know for herself, at some
                  future time. Their nearest neighbors, the Heulet family, had built a house, and
                  the son who was married, lived by himself He was very pious, and afterwards became
                  deacon of the Baptist church. Sabra often got permission to stay all night with
                  Eliza, her chief object was, that she might hear Mr. Heulet pray, for he always
                  prayed with his family. She would talk with Eliza about her uncle, and tell her
                  how she wished to be a Christian. Little did Mr. H. know the effect his prayers
                  had upon Sabra's tender heart, or how often they caused the penitential tears of
                  grief to flow. Oh! ye who profess to be Christians, do your duty, it shall be like
                  the bread east upon the water, it shall be found after many days. One kind
                  sentence uttered by you, in faith, may take root, and in after years bring forth
                  fruit an hundred fold. Perform a good deed, speak a kind word, or merely bestow a
                  pleasant smile, and you will receive the same in return. The happiness you bestow
                  upon others, is reflected back to your own bosoms.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE MARRIAGE OF JASON.
               It was rumored about the neighborhood, that Jason was married. Sabra feared that
                  it was a mistake, but it was soon confirmed by Jason himself, who sent them word
                  that he would visit them soon, and bring his wife. Sabra began to think about her
                  clothes; she knew that Jason lived in the center of a fashionable town, and she
                  thought her dresses would look very odd; she feared that Jason and Henrietta would
                  be ashamed of her; she had always been satisfied with her mother's choice until
                  now, although she had often thought her taste old fashioned. Mrs. Hudson was very
                  economical and saving; she usually bought blue and white calico, she thought it
                  the strongest, and it never faded, and checked blue and white factory, she thought
                  the best for aprons; she abhorred the thought of pantalettes, Sabra never wore
                  any. She thought it extravagant to employ a dress maker, she had learned Sabra to
                  cut her own dresses, (gowns she called them,) the waist consisted of a straight
                  piece, gathered at the bottom into the belt, and drawn With a string at the top,
                  and straps to go over the shoulder; two breadths, with bias piece, was sufficient
                  for the skirt. You may imagine, reader, that it would look very inferior at the
                  present day. Sabra asked her mother, if she was to get a new dress? Her mother
                  said, she would get her a bombazette, and Sabra chose a light blue figured one.
                  She asked her mother, if she might get Mrs. Heulet to assist her in fitting it;
                  she said Mrs. H. would think very strange if she did, for Marina could fit
                  dresses. Sabra knew that Asenath would willingly assist her, if she knew how, but
                  she never fitted her own; she said no more, but cut it herself, allowing as usual,
                  for growth. She was cheered by thinking that she could induce Henrietta to fit the
                  next dress, and instruct how to make it decently. She was careful to have all the
                  work performed, and her apparel ready, fondly anticipating nothing but the
                  greatest pleasure.
               Ah! disappointment, why didst thou ever have a name? The day arrived, and they
                  came; they were all very happy in meeting again. Henrietta said she supposed that
                  Sabra was ready to go with them; she said yes; her mother and Asenath said it
                  would be very lonely without her. The time they remained, passed very pleasantly.
                  Sabra was in the height of enjoyment; she thought that even Fred smiled upon he
                  oftener than usual; he had been very pleasant ever since he refused to let her
                  ride. Her mother thought she had better not commence to go to school this time,
                  for she could not spare her long, for they were going to build, and they would
                  require her assistance at home, and the next time she might stay longer. She felt
                  quite grieved, when she bade her father and mother goodbye, but she soon felt quite happy, for Jason
                  was pointing out the places by the road side where he had been hunting, and the
                  streams where he had fished. He often asked Sabra, if she would not be homesick;
                  she was very sure she should not, she could not be homesick where he was; she had
                  never been from home, and had no idea of homesickness.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               SABRA'S INTRODUCTION TO MRS. HUNT.
               They passed a number of villages, but none as large as the town of C., where they
                  resided. At length they entered a beautiful village, there were splendid houses on
                  either side of the street, there was also a large court house. Sabra saw another
                  large stone building, which attracted her attention, it was enclosed by a high
                  stone wall, with iron pickets on the top, and something at the windows, she knew
                  not what, but they were grates. She asked Jason who lived there? He informed her
                  it was the jail, and that there were prisoners confined within, for bad conduct.
                  This made her feel very sad, and she could think of nothing else, until they drove
                  up to their own house. They were getting out of the chaise, when Henrietta's
                  mother, Mrs. Hunt, came to the door, and assisted in carrying in the luggage, for
                  Mrs. Hudson had supplied them bountifully with butter, cheese, lard, and a loaf of
                  rye and indian bread.
               Henrietta said: "This is Sabra Hudson." Mrs. Hunt spoke to her, and said: "Is this
                  the girl I have so often heard you speak of?" Sabra thought that Mrs. Hunt viewed
                  her from head to feet, very critically, and a feeling of sadness crept over her.
                  Jason had gone to take home the carriage; Henrietta went to an adjoining room, to
                  lay by some things. Her mother followed her, and Sabra heard her say: "Is this
                  Jason's sister, he so often speaks of?" "Yes," said Henrietta, " and she is a nice
                  girl, too, mother." Well, your associates will think you have married into a
                  country family, sure enough, how awkwardly she is dressed; Maria Atherton will be
                  ashamed to associate with her, and she lives near, and is about her age."
                  Henrietta said: "You need not be uneasy, it will all be right." Sabra heard the
                  conversation, and being very sensitive, she could scarcely refrain from weeping.
                  She went to the window and looked out for Jason. She soon saw him coming, and she
                  sprang to the door to meet him. It was soon tea time, but Sabra had no appetite;
                  she was thinking of what Mrs. Hunt said to Henrietta. After tea, Jason was going
                  to the shop; he asked Sabra to go with him; she ran for her bonnet and shawl, but
                  Mrs. Hunt said she had better stay in the house; she is fatigued already, and has no appetite. Sabra was again
                  disappointed, but she found an interesting book, and she amused herself by
                  reading.
               It soon became dark, and Mrs. Hunt said Sabra was tired and had better go to bed;
                  she wished, however, to sit up until Jason came in, but was told, perhaps it would
                  be late. She had hoped that she was to sleep alone, but Henrietta took her to the
                  adjoining bed-room, and told her she was to sleep with her mother; that before she
                  was married, she had always slept with her, and that she chose company. Henrietta
                  talked very kindly to her, and told her she would call her in time for breakfast;
                  that they did not rise early as they did at father Hudson's, and bidding her good
                  night, she left her. Sabra tried to pray, but her heart was full; she laid herself
                  down, but thoughts of her own dear home rushed into her mind. She thought of her
                  dear mother, and although twelve hours had not yet passed since she bade her
                  good-bye, it seemed a long, long time to her. She wondered if the chickens and
                  turkeys had been fed, and who milked old Nab and Sputter, and if the rennet had
                  been prepared, for, in the morning, there would be a cheese to make. And then she
                  thought of those she had heard Henrietta speak of as being near her age, Maria
                  Atherton, Sophia Davis, and others. She heard Mrs. Hunt come to bed, but she laid
                  very still that she might think her asleep. She would have given much if she had
                  been alone, that she might have relieved her burdened heart by weeping. At length
                  she fell asleep, and dreamed that Sophia Davis and Adaline Jones called for her to
                  take a walk with them. They were dressed very neatly, and looked very genteel. She
                  thought she stepped out to get her bonnet; she heard Sophia say to Adaline: "Oh,
                  pshaw! how awkwardly she is dressed; what will Sophrona Thomson and Adalaide
                  Woodard say if they see us?" "Oh, never mind," said Adaline, "she is from the
                  country, and they will make allowances. For my part I do not care what they say, I
                  like her countenance; she is intelligent and good company, I know, if she is
                  dressed odd." Sabra could bear no more, she commenced crying bitterly. It awakened
                  Mrs. Hunt, she spoke to her and awoke her, saying: "What is the matter, are you
                  homesick already? I told Henrietta that it would be just so, and that you would
                  want to go home before twenty-four hours." Sabra composed herself as well as she
                  could, and told her she had been dreaming, and that she was very sorry she had
                  disturbed her; she laid still, feeling very glad that it was a dream. In the
                  morning she awoke quite early, she heard Mrs. Hunt get up, she told Sabra to lie
                  until Henrietta called her, as they did not breakfast early. Their bed-room was
                  adjoining the kitchen, and she soon heard Mrs. Hunt relating to Henrietta what had
                  happened in the night; how she was awakened from a sound sleep, by Sabra, and that
                  she had not slept any since she had been awakened; she did not believe that Sabra
                  was dreaming, she thought her homesick, and very likely they would have to take her back home, and
                  that would be expensive, she thought they had better left her at home. Henrietta
                  told her she thought Sabra would be contented.
               Now, Mrs. Hunt was not, strictly speaking, a penurious person, but she had been a
                  widow before, and was necessitated to use economy; she had five small children,
                  when Mr. Hunt married her; they had been educated, and gone from home. Mr. Hunt
                  was connected with the first class in society, and she wished to maintain the
                  position in which he left her, at his death. When Jason came, Henrietta spoke to
                  Sabra, who was ready for breakfast; she was glad to see Jason, and was quite
                  cheerful, she had determined, if she was homesick, that they should not know it.
                  She knew that her mother would come for her in a few weeks. Jason said, she might
                  go to the shop with him, (he kept a jeweller's shop,) and she would see many
                  things new, to attract her attention. Mrs. Hunt could find no reasonable excuse to
                  keep her. She felt quite happy, while she was with him, she saw many fine things,
                  and Jason let her wind up the watches; he told her, that when she was old enough
                  to wear it, he would give her one, this pleased her very much, and in due time she
                  obtained the watch. While she was at the shop, there came in a gentleman, and he
                  said: "Hudson, this is your sister, I know, for she looks just like you." He
                  replied: "Yes, and all the sister I have." The gentleman raised her, and Sabra
                  felt quite proud, to think that any person thought she looked like Jason, for she
                  loved him and thought him good looking. They had some sport about it, after the
                  man had gone. Jason said, he was not the only one that thought they looked alike,
                  he had often heard people make that remark.
               Jason said, "it is near noon, it is time for us to go to the house." "It is only
                  half past eleven," said Sabra, as if anxious to stay as long as possible. But
                  Jason laid by his green baize apron, and started for the house. As he turned to
                  the left, Sabra exclaimed, this is not the way, but he replied, "I am going to
                  show you the milliner's shop." The window was filled with hats, and rich ribbons,
                  it was the first large milliner's shop she had ever seen. Jason said, "we will go
                  in and see what they have got."
               "Good morning, Mr. Hudson, how do you do, how is your family? take a seat, you are
                  quite a stranger," said Miss Mulikan, the milliner's sister, all with one breath.
                  "Good morning," replied Mr. Hudson, "this is my sister, I called to let her see
                  your new fashioned hats, and to let her select one for herself." Sabra was
                  perfectly astonished; it would be hard to tell, which surprised her most, the
                  splendor of the hats, and the beautiful ribbons and artificials, or the idea, that
                  she was to have one herself. She was told to choose one. She accordingly selected
                  one, but it was quite plain; Mrs. Porter, the milliner, said it was very pretty,
                  but not trimmed sufficiently to suit her age, and she selected a rich artificial,
                  and Mr. Hudson told her to put that on the hat; and it would look very well. They left the shop,
                  and Sabra was delighted with her present, thinking that no one, but Jason, would
                  have made her a present like that. She wondered what Mrs. Hunt would say. They
                  arrived at the house, just in time for dinner. Henrietta met them at the door, and
                  exclaimed, "Oh! what a beautiful hat, where did you get it?" Sabra said, that
                  Jason bought it at Mrs. Porter's for her; is not he kind? it is beautiful. Sabra
                  showed it to Mrs. Hunt, she said it was very pretty, but there would be quite a
                  contrast between that and her other apparel. Henrietta said, we will soon have all
                  things correspond. After dinner, Henrietta asked Sabra to go with her to the
                  store. They examined many pieces of nice goods; Sabra thought Henrietta was going
                  to purchase a dress for herself, but she selected one from the rest, and after
                  having it measured and rolled up with the trimmings, she gave it to Sabra, who was
                  quite surprised, and said: "There is nearly twice as much as I usually have for a
                  dress." Henrietta replied: "There is none too much, my dear, we will have it made,
                  and I am sure you will like it." They returned home, and Henrietta went
                  immediately to work at the dress. She prepared the skirt for Sabra, and said: "Now
                  see how well you can make that; not how quick you can have it done; first learn to
                  do your work well, and then try to get along as fast as you can."
               Sabra never forgot this remark; she had not heard it before; it became very useful
                  to her afterwards. Henrietta fitted the waist, and it set neatly; the next day,
                  they finished it, and Sabra put it on. Henrietta told her to wear it the remainder
                  of the day; it was Saturday. At night, when she went to bed, she felt quite sad.
                  She had not, during the week, learned her verses, as usual; she could not sleep;
                  she wished she slept alone, that she might indulge in weeping; this she thought
                  would relieve her burdened mind. It was quite late when she awoke, next morning,
                  but she did not hear any person up. After a long time, she thought she would get
                  up and make a fire, and perhaps get breakfast. She arose, but Mrs. Hunt told her
                  not to get up; that it was Sunday, there was no use in rising early, they did not
                  attend church.
               Sabra was in the habit of rising as early on the Sabbath as any other day, and she
                  thought of the hymn she had so often repeated: "This is the day the Lord arose, so
                  early from the dead," &c. She thought of many other verses, which she had
                  recited at the Sabbath school. When she heard them up, she was very glad, for the
                  sun was shining brightly. After breakfast, the bell began to ring, and afterwards
                  to toll. Sabra felt quite sad, she had not been accustomed to hear the bell toll,
                  for there was none where she attended church. Henrietta called her to take a seat
                  with her, by the window, to see the people go to church, that she might see how
                  they were dressed, &c. Jason had acquired the habit of staying from church, in
                  consequence of ill health, and was not urged by his parents afterwards, consequently it became a habit. He used
                  to spend his Sabbaths reading, as did Henrietta, also; they were both exceedingly
                  fond of reading. Henrietta gave Sabra an interesting book, but she soon thought of
                  home, and the Sabbath school. There was Henrietta Heulet, and Eliza P., they would
                  recite their verses, and perhaps would get ahead of her; and there was Thadeus and
                  Theodore Saunderson, they might excel her in number of verses, they always
                  attended church. She came to the conclusion, that she would commit to memory as
                  many verses as possible, perhaps her teacher would hear them, after she returned
                  home, and credit them. She took her Bible, and commenced her studies. She
                  committed a large number of verses, but the day seemed very long, and often did
                  she wish she was at home, that she might see her mother. She thought how foolish
                  she had been, to anticipate so much pleasure in being away from home; she took her
                  book and went to the garden, and found a retired place, seated herself and wept
                  bitterly. She looked at the cheerful hen, that was picking seeds, and she thought
                  it a happy creature, enjoying itself with the luxury of contentment, and she would
                  gladly have exchanged beings with it; but no, she thought herself a subject of
                  sorrow. After tea, Jason asked Henrietta and Sabra to take a walk. They ascended a
                  hilly in rear of the town, where they could have a view of the whole village.
                  Jason showed Sabra, where a battle had been fought, in the revolutionary war. She
                  had many questions to ask, and was quite interested. The next morning, Henrietta
                  was preparing to wash, for she always observed the good old custom, of washing on
                  Monday. Sabra was anxious to assist her, but she chose to do the washing alone.
                  She told Sabra that she might do the chamber work; this pleased her, for she liked
                  to make beds, to sweep and dust. After she had done this neatly, she went down and
                  inquired for something more to do. Mrs. Hunt asked her, if she found any pins,
                  while sweeping, and what she had done with them. Now, Sabra was always careful to
                  look in the dirt, for paper rags and pins, when she swept, but she had not been
                  particular to put the pins upon the cushion, as she should have done, but had put
                  them upon her dress. Mrs. Hunt told her, she should have put them upon the
                  cushion. Sabra felt quite ashamed, that she had been so careless, and told her she
                  would recollect the next time, and put them in their proper place.
               Towards evening, Maria Atherton and Adalaide Woodard, called for Sabra to take a
                  walk; she thought, immediately, of her dream, but she was happily disappointed,
                  for she found they were not proud or particular, and she knew they were not
                  ashamed of her, on account of her dress. They went to the shop; Jason was glad to
                  see them, and showed them some nice jewelry. They went around the mill pond, and
                  back to the house. Sabra began to enjoy her visit, and to feel more contented, but
                  there seemed to be one obstacle in the way; she could not please Mrs. Hunt, She did not know why it was, for she
                  tried more to please her than any of the other members of the family and she was
                  always respectful to the aged.
               Henrietta was very kind to her and taught her to do many things which she had not
                  been accustomed to do, such as making button holes, darning stockings, and other
                  things which she had been in the habit of getting her mother to do for her; she
                  could perform all, these very neatly; she thought there was no person like,
                  Henrietta. She felt quite contented until Sunday came, it was so unlike her
                  Sabbath at home. She thought of her Sabbath school teacher, of her class-mates, of
                  Thadeus and Theodore, and then applied herself to her lesson determined that they
                  should not excel her in verses. But her heart was full, and she had to find a
                  retired place, and relieve her troubled spirit by a flood of tears.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               MR.AND MRS. HUDSON, OR THE FOLKS AT HOME.
               Mr. and Mrs. Hudson, felt quite lonely without Sabra; neither of them mentioned it
                  to the other, each waiting for the other to mention the subject first. One
                  morning, Mr. Hudson came in and said: "Mrs. Hudson, when do you intend to have
                  Sabra return home, it is very lonely here without her; I tell you, there is
                     one missing when she is gone. I find she is a great help to me, as
                  well as to you. She was always ready to turn the grindstone for me if I required
                  it, and many other services she performs for me, which I did not think of when she
                  was here, but the fact is, I miss her every day. I think we had better go after
                  her some day this week." Mrs. Hudson was very glad, for she was afraid Sabra would
                  be homesick, for she had never been from home before. She said she could go the
                  next day, and it was decided, that they should start the next morning.
               We will now return to Sabra, who felt quite sure they would come for her during
                  that week, and she often stood at the window looking for them. She happened to be
                  there when they came. She ran to the door to meet them, as much pleased as if she
                  had not seen them for months. She had much to relate to them, during ing their ride home, but she did not like to tell
                  them that she had been homesick.
               Asenath met them at the door, and was glad to see Sabra, who thought they all
                  appeared peasant, and she felt quite. happy in being at home again.
               Saturday she had every thing prepared for the Sabbath. She took off the
                  artificials from her new hat; perhaps she thought they would not please her
                  Sabbath school teacher; may be, she thought that Theodore would think her vain; be
                  that as it may, she thought them too gay. Sabbath morning came, it was a beautiful
                  morning, one of those mornings that appear to the thoughtful mind as though nature
                  itself was praising God, she went to church with her father and mother, with a
                  joyful heart.
               When she had recited her usual number of verses, she requested her teacher to hear
                  her recite those she had committed while absent. Her teacher said, she would hear
                  a part of them then, and the rest next Sabbath. On Monday, she applied herself to
                  her work, as usual; she was a ways happy when she thought she pleased the family.
                  She often wished that she could please Fred and Marina, as easily as she could the
                  rest of the family. The fact was this, the love of approbation was prominent in
                  her phrenological developments. She went, to school during the short winter term,
                  but she could not find any time to study or read at home, for the knitting was
                  always ready, and beside this, her mother told her, that, when she had finished
                  her knitting ting, she might knit for herself and she would find yarn.
               During that winter, card playing became an amusement for the evenings. Sabra's
                  mother feared she would, learn acquire a love for it. She promised to give her
                  twenty dollars, when she was eighteen, if she would not play. Sabra very willingly
                  promised, for she did not think it was right, and she had no desire to play.
               During the winter, they were preparing materials for building; the next season the
                  house was finished and they moved into it. Sabra had a nice room for herself, and
                  a closet for her clothes. Nothing in particular happened, until the birth of
                  Fred's oldest child. Asenath came and told Sabra that Marina had a little boy. She
                  was very much pleased, for she loved children, and she thought they would let her
                  nurse it. Many thoughts rushed through her mind, and new hopes sprang up in her
                  sensitive heart. She would love the babe, and they would love her.
               She cleared off the breakfast table and requested Asenath to look at her cheese
                  curd, for she was making cheese, and her mother had not been at home, but was with
                  Marina. Asenath thought she was getting along finely. "I shall get you or mother
                  to look at it before I put it in the press," said Sabra. Asenath said she would
                  come, and then went home. She worked away with a light heart, until she thought
                  her cheese curd was sufficiently drained, and then went to call Asenath, who lived
                  in the first part of the house ; as she came near the door, she met Fred; he spoke very harshly to her, asked what
                  she was going there for; he said she had no business there, that it was no place
                  for her. His words sank to the bottom of her heart, as the stone sinks to the
                  bottom of the fountain, it crushed all her hopes, and brought tears to her eyes;
                  she endeavored to tell him her errand but he waited not to hear it. Asenath heard
                  Fred, she went to the door and said, it was unkind for Fred to speak so harshly.
                  She went home with her, and tried to comfort her, but Sabra could not forget it,
                  for it had been a long time since he had spoken crossly to her. She assisted in
                  putting the cheese in the press, and then went home, leaving Sabra alone.
               Towards noon, her mother came home, and told her that they had got a babe for her
                  to nurse, and that it would be company for her. Sabra felt very differently from
                  what she did, when Asenath told her. Her mother saw there was something wrong, and
                  asked what was the matter. Sabra told her what Fred said; she said it was wrong
                  for Fred to scold her, but that she might go and see the babe. Sabra said she did
                  not wish to go, and it was some time before she consented; when she went, both
                  Fred and Marina were glad to see her.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               JASON AND HENRIETTA'S LITTLE DAUGHTER.
               They had heard of the birth of their child, and no one desired to see it as did
                  Sabra. It was two or three months older than Willie, and Sabra was looking for
                  them, for they sent word they were coming to visit them; the day arrived, and
                  Sabra was waiting for them. She met them at the door. Jason took the babe from the
                  chaise, and said: 'I will give this to you, Sabra, it is your little niece. "Sabra
                  exclaimed: "What a pretty babe? What is its name? Henrietta, I suppose." She
                  continued her baby talk for some time, as follows: (They say your name is Hattie;
                  we must call you that, I suppose, you darling child." She loved Willie
                  exceedingly, but she thought Fred and Marina were not desirous that she should
                  love him; for it was always "take care," "you will hurt him," or "that will do."
                  She often wished that she could caress him, as freely as she did her kitten. She
                  knew it would not be so with Jason and Henrietta, they would permit her to love
                  Hattie, as much as she chose ,and she did love her exceedingly, and was never
                  homesick, when at Jason;s afterwards.
               When Willie was four or five months old, Marina was very glad to have Sabra take
                     care of him. She even condescended to
                  hire her. She had a pattern muslin dress, for a ball dress, and it was quite too
                  small for her, and of no use. She said she would allow her half a dollar a week
                  for her services, until she had paid for that dress, if she desired it. Her mother
                  consented, but she was to come home at night to sleep. Sabra used every exertion
                  to please, and worked very hard; often got very tired, for Marina was a great
                  worker, but she was pleased with the idea of earning the dress herself, and would
                  not complain until she had paid for it.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               THE EXPLOSION.
               One winter's day, Marina asked Sabra is she would stay from school, and take care
                  of Willie, for she had to bake. Sabra was always pleased when asked to take care
                  of him, and willingly consented. Marina was making pies, and Willie was in the
                  cradle, front of the oven. Sabra took him up, but he reached around to see the
                  fire blazing in the brick oven; he was crowing and cooing, but Sabra thought the
                  fire shone too brightly in his face, and she moved from before it, and
                  fortunately, for immediately there was a terrible noise, like a burst of thunder,
                  and the room was filled with smoke. With great presence of mind, Sabra gave the
                  babe to its mother, and commenced moving articles of wearing apparel, which were
                  on fire, out of the window, which was broken in pieces; they had been ironing, and
                  there were many things left to air; the cradle pillow and linen, were all on fire,
                  these she threw out into the snow, and then went out and covered them with snow.
                  They then started for the other house, for it so happened that there was no person
                  else in the house. They met their mother coming up, she had heard the noise but
                  supposed it to be nearer. She told them that it was powder, undoubtedly. Sabra
                  turned back with her mother; they found a desolate looking room, the smoke had
                  disappeared, and the fire was extinguished, except some coals which were scattered
                  on the hearth, the pan of flour was scattered upon the floor, one door broken, the
                  side of the room split off, and the window entirely broken to pieces. They went up
                  stairs, there was no fire there, but the closet was fractured, and that part of
                  the house looked wretchedly. They put things in order, as well as they could, and
                  then went to see Marina and Willie, who had gone to the other house. Willie had
                  screamed frightfully, but they supposed him only frightened, but Marina had
                  discovered two blisters upon his face, this was all the injury they had sustained.
                  Fred had purchased a tin cannister of powder, and had placed it in the oven to
                  dry, some days previous to the explosion, and had forgotten to remove it. On that day he was from
                  home, and did not return until the next day. He thought it a miraculous
                  preservation, that either of their lives were spared. Marina said, that poor
                  little Willie would surely have been killed, if it had not been for aunty, for she
                  had just removed him from the cradle. It was but seldom that she called Sabra
                  aunt, to the child, but this time it was uttered easily. Sabra felt a thrill of
                  joy pass through her soul, she thought, perhaps, they may love me now, as I have
                  saved Willie's life.
               That night was a solemn one to Sabra; she thought how narrowly she had escaped
                  death, she could not sleep, she thought if she had died, her soul would have been
                  lost; she felt that she was less prepared than ever. She prayed as she had often
                  done before, that God would change her heart, and forgive her sins. She knew that
                  she had often grieved the spirit, and said, go thy way, for this time. She had
                  even gone so far, as to join in the giddy dance. She thought of her happy uncle,
                  of the revival of religion, but professors had become lukewarm, and the subject of
                  religion was seldom mentioned. She knew that her mother was always thoughtful,
                  but, Alas! she had no abiding evidence of her acceptance with Christ. Her father
                  always kept up family prayers, upon the Sabbath, and sometimes during the week, if
                  it was convenient. She desired to possess that religion, that would make her an
                  every-day Christian, but childhood and youth are vanity, and her convictions
                  gradually wore away.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               THE SINGING SCHOOL-SAMUEL'S SICKNESS, &C.
               Late in the fall of the year, Sabra went to reside with Jason, with the intention
                  of going to school. She had not commenced, when her father sent for her. The
                  Baptist society were to have a singing school; some of them told Mr. Hudson, that
                  he ought to send for Sabra, that she might learn music, they said she had a good
                  voice, and would be a great acquisition to the choir. He accordingly sent for her;
                  she was very glad to have the privilege of learning to sing, for she had a good
                  ear for music, and was passionately fond of singing. They had a good teacher, one
                  who taught the rules thoroughly. Here she met with her Sabbath school mates;
                  Thadeus and Theodore attended the school.
               Asenath's sister, Emma Morris, was living with her, and she attended the school.
                  She became an excellent singer; Emma and Sabra were often asked to sing 
                     duetts.
                     duets
                   At the close of the school, the teacher said he wished to have the choir
                  organized, and their leaders chosen for each part; they accordingly met for that
                  purpose. Emma and Sabra were chosen to lead the soprano. They were both surprised
                  at this, for they did not think themselves competent. Mr. Hudson felt quite proud
                  of Sabra's attainments, he knew her
                  services would be valuable in the choir, and he was one of the first to sustain
                  the society. The credit of her assistance belonged to himself, for he had bought
                  her a singing book, and paid the expense of her tuition. Soon after this, there
                  was a singing school, in the town of B. Mr. Hudson, thought he would send Sabra to
                  this school, also, if he could find a suitable place for her, where she could earn
                  her board, during the term. It was three miles from his residence. He went to make
                  inquiries respecting the school, and had no trouble in obtaining a boarding place
                  for her, for her services. Sabra was well pleased with the teacher and the school,
                  but the society was more fashionable there, and she often felt annoyed on account
                  of her dress, for although her apparel was sometimes of rich material, yet it was
                  not made after the latest fashion; for this cause, some of the scholars slighted
                  her, others, of better judgment, treated her politely.
               Sarah Bartlet, was a particular favorite of Sabra's, she treated her very kindly,
                  often took her seat by her, and they sang 
                     duetts
                     duets
                   together. Miss Bartlet belonged to one of the first families in society,
                  and Sabra often recollected her kindness with pleasure. We might here remark, that
                  parents and guardians, who are able, should not subject those under their control
                  to ridicule, by dressing them so very differently from others; it frequently
                  causes them to appear singularly awkward. Attending this school, introduced Sabra
                  into new society; she afterwards attended parties in that village, and her
                  convictions, upon the subject of religion, became less frequent. During her
                  attendance at this school, she became thoroughly competent to read music. Much
                  care was taken, by her father and mother, that she might acquire this
                  accomplishment, while other branches of her education were neglected.
               After the school closed, and Sabra had returned home, her brother Samuel had a
                  severe attack of the billious cholic. The physician had little hope of his
                  recovery. Sabra remained with him, night and day; Asenath was with him also, but
                  she had no confidence in her own abilities. She was willing to render any service
                  she might be able to perform, if conscious that it would not be injurious. Samuel
                  had taken a large quantity of calomel, and when he began to recover, his mouth was
                  very sore, and required washing often. This Sabra did, and also prepared all his
                  food. She could broil a steak, to suit his taste better than any other person. His
                  bed was not right, unless she made it. His medicine was not rightly mixed, unless
                  she prepared it. In fact, nothing was done exactly right, if not performed by
                  Sabra, and she took great pleasure in pleasing him. From this time, until Sabra
                  married, she always took care of him, whenever he was sick, and he was often
                  afflicted with the same distressing disease.
               About this time, Samuel (who was not very partial to farming,) engaged in the
                  manufacture of an article that was extensively made in some parts of the same
                  town. In order to accomplish it
                  successfully, it required a water power. He commenced with a foot lathe. Part of
                  this business was usually performed by females, and he employed Emma Morris. There
                  was a small stream passed near the house; Samuel thought a dam might be
                  constructed, to keep back the water, it would only overflow a few acres of land,
                  and the power would be sufficient. He did not wish to incur the expense of
                  building, unless his father would give him a deed of the land. He had urged his
                  father to do so, but he refused. Samuel informed Sabra, that his father had
                  refused the deed, and that he had almost concluded to move away. Sabra could not
                  bear the idea of their moving off; she thought she would ask her father, why it
                  was that Samuel could not have it. She told him that Samuel wished to build; her
                  mother was present, and joined in the persuasion. Mr. Hudson replied: "I shall
                  deed no land to any person, during my life-time, and they need not expect it. I
                  intend," said he to Mrs. Hudson, "the children shall have all my property, equally
                  divided, after my decease, and there will be enough for all of them. I hope each
                  of them will be satisfied with their portion; you recollect the promise I made you
                  when you , was sick, I intend to fulfil it, or leave you able to fulfil it. The
                  children are now young, and can help themselves; it will be just as useful to
                  them, to receive it at a future time, as to have it now. If Samuel wishes to
                  build, I have no objections to make, but he must run the risk of loosing it; I
                  shall not assist him at present." They were sorry that Samuel could not have it,
                  as his own property. Sabra told Samuel what their father had said. He replied:
                  "Perhaps it will make little difference," and with his father's consent, he built
                  a workshop, and employed a number of hands.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               MRS. HUNT'S DEATH.
               Mrs. Hunt was taken ill, and lived but a short time. After her death, Henrietta
                  was very lonely; she sent for Sabra, who went immediately, for they all
                  sympathized with Henrietta. During the time she remained there, she went to
                  school. She was now, what some would call, an interesting, handsome young lady;
                  eyes beaming with intelligence, her form slender and genteel, and with many, here
                  will commence the most interesting part of her history.
               She had thoroughly studied the subject of flirtation, and had fully decided, never
                  to receive particular attention from any gentleman, merely to have it said she had
                  a beau, or to pass away time. She became acquainted with the young people here,
                  and had many friends, particularly among the singers, was invited into the
                     choir, and assisted in leading the
                  singing in church. Here she became acquainted with a gentleman, of pleasing
                  manners and of good reputation. He was a particular friend of Henrietta's. He
                  offered Sabra his hand in marriage; she became almost persuaded to accept his
                  offer, and probably would have done well if she had, as he appeared attached to
                  her, and also pleased her friends; but she decided differently. She knew that his
                  religious sentiments were very different from her own, and although fully aware
                  that she was not a Christian, yet she intended to be one, and she intended to find
                  a partner who would lead her on, rather than retard her progress in the Christian
                  course. She was very tenacious of the opinions she entertained, and we will say
                  here, that she had seldom been compelled to yield to any decision but her own;
                  hence, she was willful, and very much set in her own way. There was more than ore
                  reason, why she did not accept Mr. ——'s offer, she had heard him take the name of
                  God in vain, and it was painful to her; yet, notwithstanding all this, she
                  esteemed him highly as a friend, and recollected him with respect. While we are
                  speaking of offers of marriage, we may here speak of one more, which soon
                  succeeded the first. He was a gentleman of great respectability, a member of one
                  of the best of families, very precise in his address, genteel in his appearance,
                  and evidently as set in his own opinion as was Sabra. He was strictly moral, and
                  this was the creed of his religion, for he was a Unitarian. His manners were
                  pleasing to her, he was some years older than herself she thought she would
                  consider the subject. She often conversed with him upon the subject of religion,
                  and expressed her desire to become a Christian. He endeavored to convince her that
                  she was already all that the Scriptures required. She had been persuaded to attend
                  a large military ball, and when the Captain led up his fair lady to open the ball,
                  many exclaimed, what a handsome couple! But her heart was not joyful, and she
                  thought she would never attend another ball.
               I It was not many weeks before he insisted upon her attending another party. She
                  begged to he excused, but he urged her; she inquired why he wished for a companion
                  for life that did not enjoy this amusement. He finally told her if she would go
                  this time, he would never urge her again. She consented, and sure enough, he never
                  did ask her again, neither did Sabra ever dance after that evening. Her
                  convictions were revived during the evening, and while upon the floor, she was so
                  much overcome with a sense of guilt, that she was unable to end the cotillion, but
                  begged her partner to excuse her, and took her seat. She soon told a particular
                  female friend how she felt, and they left the room, and went by themselves; this
                  friend had similar feelings, and they both resolved never to dance again. Every
                  thing appeared very solemn to them, and they never again entered a ball room. At
                  an early hour they left; on their way home, she told M. W., that she had fully
                     determined never to attend another
                  ball, that she intended to seek religion; he commended her for her resolution,
                  said it was not much pleasure after all, said he would enjoy an evening at home as
                  well.
               About this time, the Rev. Mr. Southmaid, who afterwards became a missionary, and
                  perished with hunger among heathen,) was holding a protracted meeting in the town
                  of C., where he preached; he had, what they called inquiry meetings. Sabra
                  attended it, she was burdened with a sense of guilt, and her sins were as
                  mountains before her, yet her heart rebelled against God. She was tempted to
                  think, that God, being almighty, might have ordained some other way to save
                  sinners, without the suffering of Christ. Mr. Southmaid always dwelt upon the
                  subject of the atonement, and, the sufferings of Christ; it had been his subject
                  during that day. She knew very well that the fault was in her own wicked heart,
                  but still the rebellious principle was there. She said to Henrietta, going to
                  church, that she hoped the minister would have some other subject that evening.
                  She tried to pray, that her feelings might be right, and as she walked to the
                  church, her thoughts were entirely upon the subject. Mr. S. read the hymn,
                  commencing with this line: 
                     "Alas! and did my Saviour bleed."
                   She tried to sing with the rest of the choir but her heart was too heavy. The
                  minister made an excellent prayer, and afterwards commenced reading the 2d chapter
                  of Hebrews; as he read, her heart began to soften; when he reached the 17th verse,
                  a ray of light from above burst into her soul, the plan of salvation looked plain,
                  she was perfectly happy. The whole chapter seemed new, she felt, indeed, like a
                  new creature. She did not think that she had experienced religion, at this time,
                  or any change of heart, only a change in her, feeling, in regard to the plan of
                  salvation. She now thought nothing but Omnipotent Wisdom could have devised a way
                  so plain to restore lost humanity. That our Saviour had taken upon himself our
                  nature, having come to redeem us, and showed our wandering feet the way. The path
                  to heaven looked very plain, so much so, that a wayfaring man, though a fool, need
                  not err therein. She enjoyed the meeting very much, when asked if she intended to
                  be a Christian, she answered yes, but did not tell of the change in her feelings
                  during the evening; if she had, she might have been encouraged to hope in the
                  mercy of God, She went home very happy, told Henrietta how differently she felt,
                  how happy she then was, and of her intention to become a Christian. The next day,
                  she called upon a Christian friend, Mrs. D. and told her what a change there was
                  in her mind. Mrs. D. told her she had experienced religion. Sabra could not
                  believe it, she expected some greater manifestation of Divine Power, and through
                  her unbelief, her happy feelings wore away, but her convictions remained, and she
                  lived in the faithful discharge of her duties, without a good hope in Christ, for
                  nearly two years.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               THE BIRTH OF EVELINE.
               Spring had returned, with all its cheering beauty, and Sabra had returned home.
                  Eveline was Samuel and Asenath's eldest child. A nurse was obtained, who was
                  called skillful, but she would not allow Asenath sufficient food to strengthen
                  her. Asenath said to Sabra, "I shall rejoice when I am able to go to the kitchen
                  and help myself to food. I am often faint and hungry, but nurse will not allow me
                  more, she says food will create fever." Sabra returned home, and told her mother,
                  and inquired if she might prepare some palatable nourishment and carry it to
                  Asenath. Her mother replied, "yes, dear, I always thought you would have been a
                  better nurse for her, than Mary. Get whatever you think proper, and carry it up
                  the back stairs." Sabra made some light pancakes, and some nice tarts, and a dish
                  of tea, and carried it to Asenath, and told her that she had brought her a lunch.
                  Asenath thought it was excellent; every day, Sabra would slip up the back stairs
                  with her server laden with something which she thought Asenath would relish,
                  always having something different, that her appetite might not become satiated by
                  having a similar dish each day. Asenath often spoke of it afterwards, and said she
                  never had her food taste as good as it did then. It may be remarked here, that
                  they never had any hard thoughts of each other, but always esteemed each other as
                  sisters, and a thrill of joy would always enter the heart of Sabra, whenever
                  Asenath called her sister.
               There was now three little children in the family, for Sabra to love. Willie was a
                  sweet child, and it was difficult for her to tell which of the three she loved
                  most. She could love Hatty more freely than Willie, for she knew it pleased Jason
                  and Henrietta. Her time was divided between the two places. Henrietta was lonely,
                  and her mother was willing she should remain there, when she could be spared from
                  home, for Jason furnished nearly all her wearing apparel, and she often earned
                  small sums herself. Jason gave her a valuable watch, and other presents.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXI.
               THE DISMISSAL OF MR. WARREN, AND HIS DEATH.
               The manly appearance, and the genteel deportment, together with the good morals of
                  Mr. Warren, had gained the favor of all the Hudson family. Sabra had become quite
                  attached to him, but there was a vast difference in their manners. Sabra was free
                  and social with both sexes, her heart was pure and unsuspecting, never watching
                  for faults in others, and not having any fears of others watching her.
               But, Alas! for fallen, depraved human nature, how often do we find within the
                  heart a disposition to calumniate or to destroy the peace of others. Sabra
                  scarcely knew, that feelings of this kind were ever veiled within the human heart.
                  How should she, with but little experience, and never having the privilege of
                  reading, except a few books. She had never read the Olive Branch, weekly. No, it
                  was not published then, if she had, she might have been wiser. She was tenacious
                  of her rights, seldom crossed in her wishes, generally having her own way, she was
                  unaccustomed discipline. Her father and mother always being
                  very indulgent, she being strongly attached to them, it was her wish to please
                  them; yet, she might be called willful and somewhat self-conceited. She was often
                  the confidential friend of both sexes; was always careful never to divulge
                  secrets, and always managed to keep out of disputes or difficulties. William was
                  regarded in his father's family, somewhat as Samuel was in their family. His
                  brothers and sisters regarded him more like a superior than an equal; they all
                  seemed to be afraid of offending him. His youngest brother, Philander, was waiting
                  upon a lady, and he thought William was displeased, He thought Sabra would know;
                  accordingly he confided the subject to her, wishing her to find out what William
                  thought of it. William saw them talking together, and jealousy, that fatal
                  destroyer of all happiness, entered his peaceful heart, and not knowing whom he
                  had to deal with, he very abruptly asked Sabra what she and Philander were
                  conversing about; and hastily said, if she liked Philander the best, she might
                  marry him. This was the first unpleasant word he had ever spoken to her. It was
                  like the bursting of electric fluid, which shivers the tree to atoms. She trembled
                  with indignation, but as they had no opportunity then, for an explanation, they
                  each possessed their own feelings. Sabra retired, that night, at an early hour, no
                  one knowing her trouble. She was glad to be alone, that she might find relief in
                  tears. Alas! thought she, is this human nature? Is this the fruit of love and
                  friendship? Was this from him, who seemed to watch my every motion with delight;
                  who I to think me perfection itself? She Prayed God, to support her in this trying
                     hour. She made resolutions, and
                  amended them, but finally concluded that after an explanation she would discard
                  all thoughts of him; hard indeed was the struggle in her mind. Her friends thought
                  she was sick, and would have called a physician, but she said it was a severe
                  attack of the nervous headache, that she would soon be better. Four days elapsed
                  before the explanation. William called to see her. Sabra was calm and decided. He
                  inquired why she was melancholy; if it was in consequence of what he has said
                  respecting his brother. Sabra replied: "I think that is a sufficient cause to make
                  me feel sad." She then related to him the inquiry his brother wished her to make
                  respecting his opinion of the lady before mentioned. William appeared very sorry;
                  hoped she would forgive him. He said all that was necessary to make amendment; but
                  it was evident that a link was broken in friendship's chain, that could not be
                  immediately repaired. Soon after this, he was taken ill. He informed Sabra that he
                  thought of consulting a physician who lived near her father's; that he should see
                  her parents, and ask their consent to marriage. Sabra felt quite indignant, and
                  replied: You had better obtain my consent. If my affections are regained, it will
                  require time, and I shall be offended if you mention the subject to them. Sabra
                  began to think that it was excitement that made him speak thus hastily to her, and
                  that all would be right, and she was as cheerful as ever.
               All would have passed on smoothly, had not another circumstance occurred, which
                  happened at the singing school, a few weeks afterward. William was a musician, and
                  played the bass viol. Sabra though all was harmony when he was present, for they
                  could keep better time. That evening, in particular, she felt a sort of pride when
                  she heard their singing eulogized, accompanied by his splendid bass, for he was an
                  excellent musician. A Mr. Miles was present that evening, a celebrated singer; he
                  was invited to join the choir. Sabra, as usual, sat at the end of the seat, they
                  gave Mr. Miles a seat beside her; she had met him at another school, and had sang
                  with him often. He was quite sociable; he was a married man, and Sabra thought
                  William would not object to her enjoying a friendly conversation. At intermission,
                  he came not, as usual to her seat; she wondered why, for he was well acquainted
                  with Mr. M., and a feeling of sadness crept over her joyful heart; but when they
                  commenced singing, her gloom dispersed, and she was as happy as ever. William had
                  accompanied her to the school that evening, but at the close, he said nothing to
                  her, but started with his bass viol, and candle. Sabra stepped to his side, and
                  offered to take the candle; he answered her abruptly, saying he could carry it
                  himself. He passed on through the crowd, and soon disappeared. Sabra felt somewhat
                  annoyed, but it did not affect her as did the first shock; her mind was better
                  prepared, and she thought he was displeased because she sang and conversed with
                     Mr. M. She had determined to act
                  natural, as formally, let the consequences be as it might. She would not practice
                  deceit. That which had appeared to her like gold, bad began to grow dim; she
                  determined not to change her natural deportment for any man; no, not she. And she
                  fully decided, from that hour, that she would be disengaged the first opportunity,
                  if indeed the cause of his neglect was what she had surmised. She then told
                  Henrietta all her trouble; what had happened a few weeks before, and what her
                  intentions were in future. Henrietta was astonished. She tried to persuade her not
                  to be too hasty, but to consider, or she might regret it; but the decision had
                  been made, and the sacrifice completed, and she would never again pass through the
                  same trial. He might find a companion as precise and polite as himself, if he
                  chose. She could not avoid thinking how happy she had been before the first
                  reproval; but that was passed, and Alas! there was no fond anticipation for her in
                  the future. She cared not for his wealth, or his position in society, so long as
                  he possessed a narrow, contracted mind. Her views of morality and virtue were high
                  and sacred, and she thought petty circumstances had nothing to do with things of
                  this order; if so, ease of manners and familiarity was a virtue. The more she
                  conversed with Henrietta, and the more she thought upon the subject, the more
                  decided she became. William was thinking, at the same time, that the next
                  confession would be made by Sabra; but he found himself mistaken. The gentle,
                  loving girl was now the firm, decided lady. The next time he came to see her, she
                  received him very coolly. He asked her if he had offended her, by his treatment
                  the last time they met. She replied that she was disgusted. He said he thought he
                  would give her an opportunity to accept other company if she chose. She told him
                  plainly that it was her choice, and that she did not wish him to trouble himself
                  to accompany her again. This was not what he expected, but he found all his
                  expostulations and entreaties were in vain. His confession, and even tears were of
                  no avail; her mind was fixed. She wished him to think of her, as a friend, and
                  nothing more; said she should always entertain friendly feelings toward him, and
                  their family. He asked her what she thought people would say. She said she cared
                  not what they said, so long as she felt justified in the course she had taken. She
                  did not intend to sacrifice her own happiness for the favor of public opinion. She
                  told him she was going home soon, and they would not see each other often, and the
                  sooner the past was forgotten, the better. He urged for a correspondence, but all
                  in vain. She requested him never to visit her again, unless it was as a
                  friend.
               Soon after this conversation, Sabra went home. She related all the conversation to
                  her mother; told her frankly of her decision, and disengagement. he, too, was as
                  surprised as Henrietta had been, and gave her a similar caution; told her she was
                  afraid she had been too hasty; she told her that he had asked their consent to
                     the marriage, during her absence, but
                  that she thought at the time, that he appeared as though all was not right; and
                  that her father told him he should not oppose her wishes in that respect, if it
                  was her choice. To this he made no reply. Her mother said: "My child, I am afraid
                  you will not always be as fortunate as you have been; you have not had trouble
                  like many others; but you will remember, that every spoke in the wheel must come
                  up." Sabra could not fully comprehend how this could apply to her; she thought
                  that she had already seen trouble enough, and she was fondly anticipating more
                  happiness in the future; but Alas! we know but little, in youth, what awaits us in
                  maturer age. As adverse circumstances occurred, she often realized the truth of
                  this saying, "that every spoke in the wheel must come up."
               A few days after this, they received intelligence of a fatal accident, which
                  occurred while raising an Academy in the town of M——. They had obtained men from a
                  distance, and among the rest, Mr. Warren was there. After the frame was nearly
                  raised, a support gave way at the foundation, and a number of persons precipitated
                  among the timbers at the bottom. A number of persons were bruised, but none
                  fatally injured but William. When he was removed from among the timber, it was
                  found that one leg was broken and badly fractured. He was carried to a house near
                  by, where he received every attention which it was possible for friends to bestow.
                  His mother and sister were sent for, and attended him until he died. He lingered a
                  few days, enduring with Christian patience and fortitude, the most excruciating
                  sufferings, and then expired. His removal caused a vacuum in society, and he was
                  very much lamented by a large circle of friends.
               At the time the accident occurred, Sabra was watching by the bedside of her
                  mother, who had just been attacked by the pleurisy. The intelligence affected her
                  very much; she was fearful that her mother would not recover, and this made her
                  very sorrowful. The second day, she heard that William was not expected to live;
                  also that his physician bled him, and that the bandage became loose, and the wound
                  bled profusely, and was not discovered until it was seen dropping upon the floor.
                  Mrs. Hudson's physician had just bled her, and Sabra was fearful lest a similar
                  accident as this might occur to her, and she kept awake during the whole
                  succeeding night, and often examined her mother's arm, to see if all was right.
                  Mrs. Hudson did not recover until after the death and burial of Mr. Warren. Sabra
                  did not attend his funeral, or see him during his sickness, in consequence of her
                  mother's illness.
               The day after his burial, his father repaired to the boarding-house, to obtain the
                  wearing apparel of the deceased. He unlocked his chest, and, upon the top of his
                  clothes, he found a letter directed to Sabra; it was not sealed. His father read
                  it; it was very affecting, and displayed a heart full of tenderness, and regret.
                  He sent it to her, and afterwards visited her himself.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS.
               From the time previously referred to, when Sabra experienced the change in her
                  feelings, with regard to the plan of salvation, she was considered an humble,
                  devoted Christian; there was a visible change in her deportment, but still she was
                  like Christian, who had set out for the Celestial city, who, while climbing the
                  hill of difficulty, had lost his roll or evidence. There were some of her
                  associates who had experienced religion and united with the church. Theodore was
                  one, and when she stood by the water and saw him descend the banks of the river,
                  to receive the ordinance of baptism, she felt that she was left alone. She could
                  not tell why she was not a Christian; her mind was calm, and she felt willing to
                  make any sacrifice, but still she had no evidence of her acceptance with God.
                  After her mother had recovered, Jason came to visit them, and she returned with
                  him. While she was there, their second daughter was born. They called her Sabra,
                  after her Aunt. This pleased Sabra, very much, and she loved the child
                  exceedingly, and always enjoyed herself while there.
               A few months before his death, William had bought a watch of Jason, and he
                  informed Sabra he would take it back and present it to her, if his friends wished;
                  but Mr. Warren came to pay for it while Sabra was there. Jason told him what he
                  had said to Sabra, but Mr. Warren wished to keep it himself; said he should never
                  part with it. He gave Sabra some choice articles as keepsakes; he also gave her
                  the value of the watch in money; and Jason gave her the money that he had just
                  received from Mr. W. She felt rich; she had never possessed as much money before,
                  and she knew her mother was saving money, in half dollars, to give her when
                  eighteen, as a fulfillment of her promise to her for not playing cards; she said
                  she would not spend it, but put it out on interest. Mr. Warren insisted upon her
                  going home with him and visiting the family. She had never been there, and she
                  felt diffident about going; however, she went, and enjoyed herself very well. Mrs.
                  Warren was a kind, motherly woman, and Sabra always loved her afterward. They had
                  rich family relatives who resided in Boston, and who lived in style beyond her
                  imagination; she visited there with the family. She had never been in the city
                  before, and she saw many curiosities, but nothing seemed as splendid as the
                  furniture of P.'s house, where they visited; it had been selected in London,
                  without any regard to expense. The sofas were covered with silk velvet plush, the
                  carpets were as soft as down, and the mirrors large and splendid. It was here she
                  formed new ideas of aristocracy. She found the inmates of the family hospitable
                  and kind, affable and entertaining. She saw none of that pride and haughtiness
                     which expected the rich and
                  fashionable possessed, and she never changed her views, although she found some
                  exceptions. Previous to this, she had always felt a sort of bashfulness and
                  awkward restraint, when in the presence of the rich and affluent, but by
                  experience she found that it was not this class who were exacting and precise; but
                  she found a class, in whose presence it was necessary to be constantly upon the
                  watch; it were those who have no material of worth or merit of their own, to raise
                  themselves to respectable society, who are constantly striving to destroy the
                  reputation of others, and build themselves upon their ruins. There are many who
                  think, if they can lower one person in the estimation of another, that they raise
                  themselves in the same proportion. This class is not confined to the lower orders
                  of society, but is found among who think themselves aristocratic. Thus, by
                  associating with different grades of society, Sabra began to become acquainted
                  with human nature.
               After she had remained at Mr. Warren's a week, Sabra thought she had better return
                  to Jason's. She had enjoyed herself very much. Mr. W. wished her to remain, and
                  said he had other sons near her age, and he would like her for a daughter-in-law.
                  We do not know whether they made any proposals, if so, we never heard of it. She
                  soon returned to Jason's, much delighted with her visit, and had much to tell
                  Henrietta about her visit to Mr. P.'s; how Mr. P. had a negro, named Peter, who
                  stood behind his chair, ready to obey his orders, that he stood there during the
                  time they were dining, which was two hours, that the table was cleared off three
                  times, and this was their usual style. Henrietta informed her that there were many
                  families in the city also lived in similar style. "But," said Sabra, " after
                  dinner he told Peter to bring the children from the nursery; there was but one the
                  table, and that one a daughter, named Luella, a beautiful girl about twelve years
                  old; that the other two, a son and daughter, were not considered old enough to
                  come to the table, but took their meals in the nursery, or by themselves. The
                  children appeared perfectly delighted to come to the dining-room, where their
                  parents and the company were enjoying fruit and nuts, and they seemed as pleased
                  to see Peter as any one, and would climb up and straighten his curly locks, and he
                  would roll up the white of his eye, and show his teeth." Sabra thought it strange;
                  but they said he was an old servant, and they esteemed him very much.
               A few days after her return, her mother came for her to return home. She said
                  Samuel wished her to work in the shop, and that her father thought it would be a
                  good opening for her. Samuel said he would give her a dollar and a quarter for a
                  week. Jason and Henrietta remonstrated against it, and said she ought to go to
                  school. Jason said he would pay for her education, and clothe her, but her mother
                  said she had better go, for she could board at home, and she often wished Sabra to
                  assist her; and if any of them were taken
                  sick, they must her. We may remark here, that wealthy farmers are
                  deceived by the love of gain, when they think their children are doing well for
                  themselves, because they are earning money; they often become subjected to willing
                  slavery, and neglect the cultivation of their minds. It was so with Sabra; for the
                  few succeeding years were hard and laborious, with but little opportunity for
                  cultivating her mind.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               SABRA COMMENCES TO WORK FOR SAMUEL.
               She returned home with her mother, and after repairing her wearing apparel, she
                  commenced her laborious servitude. It was an occupation which females were usually
                  required to learn, ere they received a reward for their labors, but Sabra had seen
                  Emma work, and spent much time with her, and she was somewhat qualified for the
                  work. She found that Emma was soon to be married; she would not have her for a
                  companion, as she expected, But she found Samuel had hired Henrietta Heulet, her
                  old schoolmate, and that he had employed another girl named Lucretia. Sabra was to
                  take charge of all the work In the girls department. He also had workmen, and
                  apprentices, two of them we will here mention, as we may have cause to often refer
                  to them in this narrative: Jeremiah Forrester and Joel Parrish. Sabra had been
                  acquainted with Joel from her childhood; he was a Sabbath school, scholar in the
                  same school with herself, and always attended the same church. It will be
                  recollected, that Sabra was all this time trying to live a Christian, or, in other
                  words, to be one. She constantly maintained daily prayer, but still she hard no
                  well grounded hope. The following verses were often repeated or sung by her:
               
                  
                     'Tis a point I long to know,
                     Oft it causes anxious thought;
                     Do I love the Lord, or no?
                     Am I His, or am I not?
                  
                  
                     Yet, I mourn my stubborn will,
                     Find my sin a grief and thrall;
                     Should I grieve for what I feel,
                     If I did not love at all?
                  
               
               Sabra had a Bible which she valued more than any other book. It had been presented
                  her by Samuel, soon after his recovery from a serious illness. She always remained
                  with him day and night, and assisted Asenath in nursing him during his sickness.
                  After his recovery, he would occasionally bestow a present upon Sabra for her
                  services. She usually kept this Bible accessible, that she might read a few verses
                  if she had leisure. She had been employed by Samuel a number of weeks, and he
                  appreciated her services, particularly
                  the care she manifested, that nothing should be destroyed by negligence. She was
                  also a favorite among her shopmates. They place confidence in her; if either of
                  them wished to be absent, they would desire Sabra to ask permission of Samuel. She
                  often found it a difficult task to keep harmony existing between them, for they
                  were different in their dispositions. Henrietta Heulet was very mild tempered, but
                  a great hector. She was constantly teasing Lucretia, by every trifling affair.
                  Lucretia being somewhat passionate, was unable to exercise the virtue of patience,
                  and they would refer their disputes to Sabra for a decision.
               Sabra realized her need of pious company. She had no one to converse with her upon
                  the subject of religion; nearly all employed by Samuel were Universalists. Joel
                  had embraced this doctrine. She esteemed him highly, but it was often a query, in
                  her mind, why he should believe creed, when he had been a Sabbath school scholar
                  ,and also had a pious mother. She soon ascertained the true cause: his shopmates
                  were constantly advocating this doctrine. It is strange that the professor of
                  experimental religion does not as voluntarily advocate this belief, as do those
                  who believe all mankind will be saved. Sabra lacked confidence in her ability to
                  speak in the cause, and she chose not to argue the subject. She could refer to her
                  Bible; she had taken it with her to the shop, as her only counsellor. for some
                  time she kept it concealed. One day she had a few leisure moments, and had been
                  reading, and had laid it upon the bench. Samuel came in and saw the Bible laying
                  there, and took it up. He appeared quite displeased; said he was astonished; asked
                  who brought it there. Sabra told him she did. He said it was no place for books;
                  that he did not pay them for their time, to read. She seldom said anything back,
                  but at this time she felt it would be right. She restrained her emotions until
                  after he was gone, and then burst into a flood of tears. At night, she took her
                  Bible to the house, and retired early; her mother feared she was sick, and came up
                  to her room, as she often did, to see that all was right. Sabra tried to speak
                  cheerfully, but her mother knew something was wrong. Sabra said she had the
                  headache; and it was true, for she always had the nervous headache after weeping.
                  The next day she was unable to go to the shop. Toward evening, Samuel came to see
                  why Sabra was not at work; his mother told him that she had not set up any during
                  the day; he was out of humor, said he hoped she would give her some medicine to
                  take, so that she might be able to go to the shop by the following day, for
                  everything went wrong when she was away; that the girls had done nothing but waste
                  during her absence; that they would as soon dry paint by moonlight as in any other
                  way; that he had just found a rack full of articles left out doors to dry in the
                  rain. He wished she would go and remain there, if she was not able to work. He
                  said her time was worth a dollar a day, every day, he had rather either of his men
                  would leave than her. He never thought
                  what he had said to her about the Bible. After he had gone, his mother went up to
                  her room, and said, "cheer up, you do not know what Samuel says about you;" and
                  then related what he had said. Sabra was not in humor to rejoice, but merely
                  replied: "I always endeavor to please him, and to save all I can." "We all know
                  that, my child," said her mother. "We know that you are careful, and that you save
                  all you can, in everything, but it pleases me that Samuel thinks so much of
                  you."
               Sabra knew very well that nothing grieved her mother so much as to have Fred or
                  Samuel speak wrongfully of her, and she never told her mother, when they reproved
                  her, if she could avoid it. She endured all this kind of trouble silently. She
                  fully realized her situation in the family, as an adopted child, although she
                  seldom heard any allusions made to it. She was satisfied that no mother every
                  loved a child more ardently than her adopted mother loved her, and she was always
                  happy when she could please her, and careful of saying or doing anything that
                  would injure her feelings.
               When she was able, she went to the shop to work. The girls laughed at her; called
                  her foolish. Henrietta said she would bring some fairy tales there, and see what
                  he would say to them. When Samuel came to the shop, he appeared pleased to see her
                  there; said he hoped she was better. She replied that she felt quite well. He went
                  off singing. Henrietta could scarcely keep from laughing. After he was gone, she
                  said it was well it was not her, or she would have given him sauce. Sabra attended
                  teachers meetings during the week, and she thought if he would allow her this
                  privilege, she did not care for others. The fact was, she was becoming well
                  acquainted with Theodore. She always desired this, from her earliest
                  recollections; when he wore a red morocco hat, and she a blue jockey. They had
                  seen each other almost every Sabbath at church, when Sabra had been at home, and
                  had often met at singing sing, and they each had entertained the sane regard for
                  each other from childhood; and this regard was about to terminate in an
                  engagement. She knew that Samuel did not approve of it; she expected every day
                  when he would mention the subject, and she dreaded the consequences; she thought
                  it was none of his business, and she prepared herself to tell him so; she had
                  occasionally seen the fire and smoke, and knew the volcano would eventually burst.
                  He did not approve of her attending evening meetings; it was only for company
                  home. He would say, the girls could not attend to their work the succeeding day,
                  but they did not care for these expressions, as long as he did not forbid it.
               After Theodore had visited Sabra more than a year, and probably they were engaged,
                  he took it upon himself to express his disapprobation. Jason and Henrietta were
                  there on a visit. He commenced by saying, that Sabra had gone through the woods,
                  and was like to take up a crooked stick at last! Jason said, if it was her choice, he did not see as they need care.
                  He thought that Theodore was a steady, industrious young man. "What is he?" said
                  Samuel; nothing but a clerk; no more capable of obtaining a living than either of
                  my apprentices; beside he is poor, and has not much salary. I tell
                  you, that she is going to throw herself away." Sabra could bear it no longer; she
                  let the volcano burst from her mind; she told him plainly that it was none of his
                  business, and that he would find that she should do as she pleased. Said she, "I
                  know that he is poor, but I do not care, as he is industrious and temperate. If he
                  would take a glass of liquor now and then, and use profane language, like some
                  others, I suppose you would think him a fine fellow. I cannot
                  converse with any young man, without being reproved by you. It is not long since,
                  while taking a walk, I accepted the hand of a gentleman, to assist me over a small
                  brook, and we walked hand in hand, in company with the rest. You saw us, and
                  afterward reproved me severely. Emma did the same, but you said nothing to her. I
                  think it is time for you to let me have my own way. I shall do as I please, in
                  this affair, unless some others interfere." Samuel was astonished to hear her talk
                  in this manner. She had always listened silently to his reprovals, until the
                  present time. He said nothing more, but soon went home. Jason said he was glad to
                  hear Sabra talk to him; she had done perfectly right. Her father and mother said
                  they were glad, also, to hear her defend herself; said Samuel always said too
                  much, and was overbearing. Sabra knew she had done wrong to feel angry. She soon
                  retired to her chamber, fell upon her knees and wept bitterly; she prayed
                  fervently that God would forgive her: "Oh, if I was only a Christian, I should
                  never feel angry." Perhaps if she had been chastised for weeping when young, she
                  might have been broken of it; but no, she had always been petted, and
                  this was all that would cause her to cease. Often would Asenath go to her chamber,
                  and endeavor to cheer her spirits, when she knew Samuel had been reproving her;
                  but a severe turn of the nervous headache always followed. Experience afterwards
                  taught her better. The Bleak winds of adversity often rolled their boisterous
                  waves against her frail bark, and, had it not been for Christian fortitude, she
                  would have been reeked upon the shoals of disappointment.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               SABRA BECOMES A CHRISTIAN, AND OBTAINS A GOOD HOPE THROUGH GRACE.
               Sabra's mind became deeply impressed again of the necessity of being a Christian.
                  Professors of religion seemed indifferent and inactive, and she knew not how to
                  take a decided stand. She had heard Elder Fillmore preach, and his sermons always
                  left lasting impressions upon her mind. He was a Methodist. It was seven miles to
                  the church where he was stationed. It was impressed upon her mind that she must go
                  and hear him. She asked her father if she might have the horse, and then asked
                  Joel Parish if he would go with her. We have said before that they had been long
                  acquainted, and the right kind of friendship existed between them. He readily
                  consented. On the way, Sabra conversed much upon the subject of religion. She knew
                  that Joel pretended to believe in universal salvation, but she knew also that he
                  had a pious mother and she could talk freely with him upon the subject. They
                  entered the church; the good man was already there, but he looked unusually
                  solemn. The hymn and prayer was solemn. The text was read in a pathetic manner; it
                  may be found, Zach. 9th chap., 12th verse: "Turn you to the stronghold, ye
                  prisoners of hope; even to-day do I declare that I will render double unto thee."
                  He said it was possible he might be addressing some who were not prisoners of
                  hope. He illustrated the case by an anecdote, which was very affecting; it might
                  apply to those who had often grieved the Holy Spirit, and that it had taken its
                  everlasting flight. Sabra thought perhaps it might apply to her condition, but he
                  proceeded to show that they would have no more sorrow for sin, or desire to become
                  Christians; that they would find no place for repentance. In the afternoon, his
                  subject was the intercession for the barren fig-tree, spare it this year, &c.
                  While he was preaching, a ray of light burst into her benighted soul, and she
                  formed resolutions, the grace of God assisting her, that she was enabled to keep.
                  She told Joel she was resolved to be a Christian, let others do as they would. He
                  replied: "If I could hear preaching like that, I might believe there was a reality
                  in religion." Sabra told her father and mother what a good sermon they had heard;
                  said she did not believe that Joel would try to believe in Universalism any
                  longer. She retired to her chamber early, but not to bed. She took her Bible, and
                  read and prayed, and resolved to spend the whole night in prayer, if she did not
                  obtain mercy. She resolved that, if she perished, she would pray, and perish only
                  there. She found no relief for some time. The adversary told her that she had
                  sinned away the day of grace, and that she need not pray. Darkness, thick
                  darkness, filled her soul, but she still cried for mercy. She heard a voice
                     saying, "Though your sins be as
                  scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall
                  be as wool." The darkness was all, removed ; the light shone about her and she was
                  unspeakably happy. She no longer doubted her acceptance with Christ, and she,
                  longed for morning to come, that she might tell to all around what a dear Saviour
                  she had found. There was no one up stairs but herself. She felt as if she had been
                  floating upon the boisterous ocean, upon a frail bark, and just miraculously
                  landed upon the shore; and could she wait until morning to tell of her miraculous
                  escape? Yes; she would not disturb them, but she would go to bed, and wait until
                  morning. After some time she fell asleep. She dreamed she was in a beautiful pace,
                  where everything was praising God. She joined in singing a favorites hymn; it
                  awoke her mother, who hastened to see what was the matter. She was singing the
                  last line as her mother opened the door; it awakened her. Her mother inquired what
                  was the matter. She said, "Oh mother, I was so happy; but I was dreaming." But,
                  said her mother, "you frightened me. I was afraid you was sick." "No, mother, but
                  I am very happy."
               In the morning she took her breakfast as usual, and went to the shop to work. She
                  informed the girls how happy she felt; that she was sure that she had experienced
                  a change of heart, for everything appeared lovely. She tried in vain to work; she
                  left off, and said she would go to the house. She was astonished that any person
                  son could rest easy who was unconverted; she felt alarmed for them all. As she
                  went out, she met Joel; she informed him how happy she was; that her sins were all
                  forgiven, and then begged of him to neglect religion no longer. She went to the
                  house, informed her mother of the change wrought in her feelings. Her mother said,
                  "you have become a Christian; only be faithful, and you may be the means of doing
                  much good." She spent the day conversing with all whom she met, upon the subject
                  of religion. She asked her father to appoint a prayer meeting at the house; he did
                  so, and she was very happy in telling to all around what a dear Saviour she had
                  found; there were a number convicted of sin.
               One evening, not long after, they were gathered together at her mother's as they
                  often did, and they were going to have some popped corn; they parched it in a
                  long-handled frying pan; she had kindled the fire in the old fire-place in the
                  kitchen. Joel said he would assist her. Sabra commenced the subject of religion,
                  said she would like to be a missionary. Joel said, "If I thought my condemnation
                  would not be a hundred times greater than the heathen, I would be happier than I
                  am at present." "I am rejoiced to hear this," said Sabra; "then you are beginning
                  to see your need of a Saviour. Oh, seek religion now, and you will find mercy."
                  Sabra often conversed, sang and prayed with him. After a few days of deep
                  conviction, he obtained pardon, and had a good hope. He was baptised at the same
                  time with Sabra. Sabra never had any doubts but that the ordinance of baptism should be
                  administered by immersion, still she thought the Methodists were the most correct
                  in their views upon communion. She was not persuaded what course to pursue. She
                  desired that all partitions and bars might be taken down, and that Christians
                  should agree. She came to the conclusion that, when they were first converted, the
                  Lord made them all Christians, of one heart, but they afterwards made themselves
                  Baptists, Methodists, &c. She could find no fault with the doctrines of the
                  Methodists, and she thought they enjoyed more religion than the Baptists. She
                  often thought of her uncle, and she found much of the same spirit in all churches.
                  She knew if Samuel succeeded, in the project he was forming, she would have to
                  form new associations and, she would wait, after being baptised, and perhaps not
                  unite with the church, duty would appear more plain to her in the future. She
                  enjoyed uninterrupted peace of mind; she was faithful to all, especially to her
                  class in the Sabbath school. She met with her associates in the district
                  schoolhouse, and in every convenient place spoke of what the Lord had done for
                  her.
               It was a clear, cold day, in the month of March, the ice had not all disappeared
                  from the river, when they assembled upon the bank of the Nashua, where Joel and
                  Sabra were to receive the ordinance of baptism, to be performed by the venerable
                  Elder Sanderson. Many people were assembled on that solemn occasion. Sabra had
                  selected a hymn, and made, some slight alterations terations in it, for the choir
                  to sing. It was as follows:
               
                  
                     Whither goest thou, pilgrim stranger,
                     Passing through this lonely vale?
                     Knowest thou not 'tis full of danger,
                     And will not thy courage fail?
                     No, I am bound for the Kingdom, &c.
                  
                  
                     Pilgrim thou hast justly called me,
                     Passing through a waste so wide;
                     But no harm will e'er befall me,
                     While I am blessed with such a guide.
                     I am bound for the Kingdom, &c.
                  
                  
                     Such a guide; no guide attends thee,
                     Hence for thee my fears arise;
                     If some guardian power befriend thee,
                     'Tis unseen by mortal eyes.
                     I am bound for the Kingdom, &c.
                  
                  
                     Yes, unseen—but still believe me,
                     Such a guide my steps attend;
                     He'll in every strait relieve me,
                     He will guide me to the end.
                     I am bound for the Kingdom, &c.
                  
                  
                     Pilgrim, see that stream before thee,
                     Darkly winding through the vale;
                     Should its deadly waves roll o'er thee,
                     Would not then thy courage fail?
                     I am bound for the Kingdom, &c.
                  
                  
                     No! That stream has nothing frightful,
                     To its brink my steps I'll bend;
                     Thence to plunge 'twill be delightful,
                     "Christ and Angels will attend,"
                     I am bound for the Kingdom, &c.
                  
               
               
               Joel received the ordinance first, and they were singing the last verse as Sabra
                  descended the bank of the river. She had prepared a nankeen robe with becoming
                  neatness, and heavy weights in the bottom, to prevent it from floating. Before she
                  regained the shore, she joined the choir in singing; she was very happy; she never
                  enjoyed a happier day. The place always appeared beautiful to her, and it may be
                  seen, by her private journal, that she often, when convenient, visited the place,
                  and thought upon the past, and prayed that God would renew her spiritual strength,
                  and enable her to perform the vows that she made when she publicly acknowledged
                  her Saviour.
               We will here insert a few lines from her journal. April 10th, 1831: "I am sitting
                  under this favorite tree, upon the bank of this lovely river, where I have seen so
                  many publicly acknowledge their Saviour, in the ordinance of baptism. How fit is
                  the emblem, "Buried with Christ, by baptism unto death, that as like as Christ was
                  raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
                  newness of life." Rom. chap. 6th, verse 4. It is strange that any shrink from this
                  cross, for underneath is the crown. Oh, the peace, the joy there is in believing
                  in Christ! My peace is like the gentle stream that rolls before me; there is not a
                  wave disturbs my peaceful breast. I know that I have a mansion in the skies, and
                  sudden death, to me, would be sudden glory. I have a conscience void of offence
                  toward God and man, and all is peace within. Oh, that I could find language to
                  fully represent the beauties of religion to others; but, Alas! a finite being
                  cannot fully represent the truth of religion. I must leave this favored bower;
                  perhaps I shall never be permitted to visit it again. Joel passes this place every
                  time he visits his dear mother; doubtless he will always call to mind the time
                  when we received the ordinance of baptism. Oh, that God would keep him in the
                  faithful discharge of every duty, and may he sometimes think of me when I am far
                  away. He seems like a dear brother to me; but, Alas! I must leave him, and all my
                  associates. Oh, if I could but live near, where I could see my friends, how happy
                  I should be; but I must leave all that is dear to me, and go among strangers. Oh,
                  that God would prepare me for this great trial, and give me grace to bear all that
                  awaits me in future life."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               SAMUEL'S PROJECT TO ESTABLISH HIS BUSINESS IN THE WEST.
               SABRA'S MARRIAGE, AND HER TRIALS.
               Soon after Sabra experienced religion, Samuel began to talk of the propriety of
                  Theodore and Sabra being married; he also formed plans for their future welfare.
                  Sabra felt somewhat disappointed at this, but having always yielded to his opinion
                  previously, she could do nothing else at this time. They had not thought of
                  marrying at present. Sabra was contented to remain where she was, and when she
                  married, she desired to live near her dear mother, but Samuel had different plans;
                  he thought that if they would go West, and get established in his business, it
                  would be profitable. He had given Jerry Forester encouragement of assisting him in
                  the business and he was now of age. He proposed that Theodore, Jeremiah and
                  himself would enter into partnership, find a suitable place on the western borders
                  of New York State, and commence business. Theodore knew nothing of the business,
                  As a workman, but he could learn, and beside, he had a tact for business, and was
                  a good salesman. Sabra had acquired a thorough knowledge of it, and on account of
                  her knowledge of the business, and her services, they were to share equally, by
                  paying equal capital. Samuel hurried the plans as fast as possible, as soon as he
                  got the consent of the parties. He encouraged Sabra by telling her thought he
                  should live there himself some time. At evening she would retire to her room, to
                  gaze upon the gentle moon, which had so often lighted up her quiet room, and think
                  it was the only object upon which she could gaze in future that would appear
                  unchanged. And then, with her heart overwhelmed with grief, she would exclaim to
                  herself: "Why does Samuel wish me to leave my beloved friends and home, to go
                  among strangers? Who will attend him, when he is sick? Who will take care of dear
                  mother? and then again, Jason and Henrietta? Ah, why not let me live where I can
                  see them often? After weeping profusely, she would fall upon her knees, and beg
                  for that grace which alone could assist her to bear up under her heavy
                  afflictions. Her nights were spent in wakefulness, and her days in laborious
                  exertions to prepare for her journey. She must work for Samuel as long as
                  possible. Less than a month was given her to prepare for housekeeping, the
                  wedding, and &c. She had worked for Samuel nearly three years, and he owed
                  her, for her services, over seventy dollars; she thought that this would furnish
                  her with many useful articles; but what was her surprise to find that this must be
                  turned in as capital, for to make up Theodore's share. Her father said he should
                  stick to his old motto, not to help the children until he had done with his
                  property, then they would have it all; if her mother chose, she might give her a
                  bed, &c. Samuel said he would give
                  her the, wedding dress, and that she and Asenath might go to the store and select
                  one for each; they did so; they were the same in quality, but of different color.
                  She went to make her last visit at Jason's; it was a sorrowful one; she had spent
                  her happiest hours there; there she had a dear brother, and sister, who had always
                  regarded and treated her as such. Jason said he would go with her, and see her
                  settled in her new house; he said the rest of the company might start a week
                  before they did, and select their pace of residence, and then they would arrive as
                  soon as necessary. This cheered her exceedingly. He told her that they would have
                  a fine journey on the canal boats; if they arrived in time, they would go and
                  visit their Uncle, who lived in Chautauque county. Samuel intended to establish
                  his business near Buffalo; this was where they were to meet. As soon as Sabra
                  returned, she informed her mother that Jason was going with her, and that they
                  would not have to start with the rest of the company. She rejoiced greatly to hear
                  this; said she: "I can hear all about your situation when he returns."
               Sabra had formed many ideas, of the West; some were very erroneous; she had beard
                  of log houses, of shanties, &c, but she had never seen dwellings of this kind.
                  Sabra's exertions to get ready for her journey, her loss of sleep, her nervous
                  excitement; &c., preyed upon her system, and her health became impaired. She
                  had a violent pain in her side, and a severe cough; she did not complain, lest she
                  should cause, her mother trouble and anxiety ; she knew that her mother felt very
                  sorrowful to have her leave, and that she 
                     feard
                     feared
                   that she was fast going into a decline, for she had said her symptoms
                  were alarming.
               The wedding-day was fixed, and they invited all the near relatives of both
                  families. The ceremony was to be performed by Mr. Sanderson, Theodore's father;
                  and his twin brother, Thadeus, and Miss Henry, were to wait upon the bride and
                  groom; Joel and Jeremiah assisted in waiting upon the company. Some of the company
                  were very joyful, while others felt sad. Sabra endeavored to appear cheerful, but
                  her heart was filled with sadness. They were all invited to spend the next day at
                  Mr. Sanderson's. Now, Mr. Sanderson was called an aristocratic gentleman; he was
                  very precise in his manner, and there were certain forms which must be strictly
                  observed in his family; some of these forms he wished his son Theodore to adopt
                  and practice. He was very particular in giving advice to the newly married couple.
                  Mrs. Sanderson seemed quite pleased with he daughter-in-law ; expressed a great
                  desire that he could live near her; she also had many presents for Sabra. After
                  they had got back to Mr. Hudson's, Henrietta asked Theodore if they were always as
                  precise in every particular incident, at his father's, as they were that day. He
                  said: "It is nearly the same every day." She replied "I am surprised that you are
                  not more precise." Said he: " I dislike
                  like formality." In a week from that time, Samuel, Theodore and Jeremiah were to
                  start their journey. Sabra's strength failed each day; the day before they
                  started, she was unable to leave her room. A physician was called; he said her
                  symptoms were consumptive; that perhaps a change of climate and the journey might
                  improve her health. Her cough increased, but the medicine he gave her relieved
                  her, and he thought perhaps she might be able to leave in a week. Samuel insisted
                  upon starting; he said Jason would take good care of Sabra, and that he intended
                  to establish his business, at any rate, and that the machinery was already
                  shipped, by the way of New York, and he wanted to meet it, and he would go,
                  whether she was able or unable. She was able to be helped to the window, to see
                  them leave, and she thought to herself, that she was taking a farewell view of
                  them all. She felt calm and resigned, and that peace within which gives perfect
                  reconciliation to the will of God. She thought to depart and be with Christ would
                  be far better, and she thought, also, that if she died then, she could be buried
                  near her own dear home, and not among strangers, in a strange land. Well would it
                  have been for her, if her heavenly Father had been pleased to have taken her to
                  himself, at that time; but, Alas! this was but the first trial of her faith.
                  Asenath was very kind to her, and endeavored to comfort her, after they were gone;
                  she remained with her every night. One night Sabra had a dream that appeared to
                  weigh heavily upon her mind; she dreamed she started her journey with Jason, and
                  arrived at Albany; that she was taken sick, and unable to rise from her bed; she
                  thought she saw Theodore come into the room; she extended her hand toward him, and
                  exclaimed: "Oh, Theodore! how glad I am to see you!" but he came not to take her
                  hand; he merely looked toward her, and walked out, without even speaking. She wept
                  aloud, and it awakened her; some time elapsed before she got composed. She related
                  her dream to Asenath, and said, "Is it possible that Theodore, who has been dear
                  to me, from my childhood, will ever treat me with indifference? or is he sick and
                  unable to speak? She pondered upon the dream until it seemed like a reality.
                  Asenath tried to persuade her not to think of it. As this dream passed from her
                  mind, other trying thoughts rushed in, to trouble her aching heart. She would
                  speak of the children, and weep bitterly. There was little Ordelia, Asenath's
                  youngest daughter, whom we have not before mentioned; she was a year old; Sabra
                  had nursed her and her mother when she was infant; she loved her exceedingly.
                  People said this child was the image of Sabra; she had black eyes, and the
                  expression of them were like hers; perhaps she would never see her again. And
                  there were Fred's children; she loved them all; he had two sons and one daughter;
                  she must leave them all, and her dear father and mother, all must be left, and she
                  to go, she knew not where.
               
               Notwithstanding all her troubles, she began to amend; the medicine had a good
                  effect, and the next week she became able to start on her journey, accompanied by
                  Jason. The family accompanied her to the town where they were to take the stage
                  coach. Asenath took little Ordelia with her, and she gave the last parting kiss;
                  long did Sabra recollect this last kiss. Her father gave her five dollars after
                  she entered the stage. Sabra endured the fatigue of the journey very well for a
                  few hours, but toward night the way was rough and mountainous. It was necessary at
                  some of the hills to clog the wheels, to prevent them from going too fast down the
                  hill. Some of the Green Mountains are frightful to those who cross them in a
                  carriage. Sabra became very tired, and unable to sit up without support. Jason
                  proposed to remain at the next town, but she insisted upon going as far as
                  Greenfield, for she had been told this was half of the way to Albany, and the
                  stage stopped there over night. When they arrived there, poor Sabra was as
                  helpless as a child; they carried her into the inn, and laid her on a bed. Jason
                  ordered some proper restoratives; she told him she thought her present illness was
                  only fatigue, and in a day or two she should be better, but Jason was much
                  excited; he thought she would never be able to continue her journey. Her cough
                  increased; the pain in her side was severe. She requested Jason to get a mustard
                  poultice for her side, as that had often relieved her of pain. the landlady said
                  Pulmonary Balsam would be good for her cough. As soon as convenient, he ordered a
                  bottle; she found it a great benefit. The next afternoon she was able to be up and
                  walk about the house. As soon as they thought proper, they pursued their journey
                  toward Albany. There were no plank roads at that time, but a few miles near Albany
                  it was McAdamized; this was a curiosity to Sabra; she had heard of them, but had
                  never seen one. She knew they would have to cross the Hudson river before entering
                  Albany, and she felt quite anxious to know how. Jason told her the boat was rowed
                  by horse-power. This alarmed her; but he explained it satisfactory to her. She
                  supposed they would leave the stage before entering the boat but they drove upon
                  what she supposed was a bridge, and then stopped. Sabra clung to Jason, quite
                  alarmed, for she thought the bridge must be floating, for she felt it rock. They
                  soon calmed her fears, by telling her that they had driven the stage coach upon
                  the boat, and that they crossed the river in this manner every day.
               It was between sundown and dark when they entered the city. Sabra was fatigued and
                  disheartened; she thought Albany a loathsome place. When they arrived at a public
                  house, she was still more disgusted; they found it crowded, and the rooms filthy.
                  They had expected to have remained there until she got rested, but it was so
                  unlike their public houses in Massachusetts that they devised means to leave as
                  soon as possible. Had they been directed to other parts of the city, they might
                  have found good houses, and have been
                  well entertained. After tea, Jason went out in pursuit of a canal boat, to take
                  them to Buffalo. It happened that it was not far to the office of the Merchants'
                  Line; he found a boat that would leave the following day. Sabra felt homesick and
                  disheartened; she could scarcely speak without a tear. Jason tried to comfort her;
                  he informed her that the Captain appeared to be a very pleasant man; had but a few
                  passengers; that the journey would be easy; that he could leave the boat often,
                  and get whatever she required; that the Captain and himself were going to hunt
                  wild game, along the banks of the canal; he says he often takes his gun, and
                  leaves the boat, and goes on shore to hunt; he knew where to find a plenty of
                  game. Jason had taken his gun on purpose to hunt wild game in the West; he hoped
                  to kill a deer; he had heard his Uncle say they were plenty.
               Sabra had a poor night's rest; she thought of home; it seemed far, far away, and
                  still she was not half way to her journey's end; indeed, she did not know where
                  her journey would end. The next day they went on board the boat. She found a small
                  apartment for the ladies, at the end of the gentlemen's cabin, or the dining-room,
                  or sitting-room, she knew not which it was called, for it was used for all these
                  purposes. There was, however, a display of neatness and order which she did not
                  expect to find. She went into the ladies' room; it was unoccupied; there were beds
                  piled on either side; one pile just high enough to lounge upon. Jason and the
                  Captain prepared for her a place to rest comfortably, and left her. She then wept
                  freely, and prayed earnestly that God would give her strength to perform her duty,
                  and grace to bear her troubles. At night she found that the seats around the cabin
                  were boxes filled with beds; they were taken out, and swung one above another,
                  three in height. They were not very soft, but they fixed an extra one for Sabra;
                  she thought of what she had heard; of people sleeping upon the soft side of a
                  plank; she supposed it must be like the beds they had there. The first night there
                  was one only, and this the cook or the cabin-maid, to occupy the room with Sabra,
                  and she was very kind and obliging.
               The next day, Jason and the Captain went on shore and killed some birds, which
                  they dressed, and had cooked for her. Sometimes they caught fish and cooked them
                  for her. The Captain persuaded her to try porter, to strengthen her; she
                  consented, and thought it increased her appetite. Jason had bought a quantity of
                  Pulmonary Balsam, in Greenfield; she continued to take this for her cough. Her
                  health improved every day. By the time they reached Buffalo, she had nearly
                  recovered. She loved to journey on the canal boat; they had good company, and
                  evenings they would sing upon the deck; Sabra thought it sounded beautifully upon
                  the water. She had many a good sing while upon the boat, and many a happy hour she
                  passed while sitting upon the deck, conversing with Jason upon the beauties of the
                  scenery; and while admiring the works
                  of the Supreme Being in nature, her very soul was drawn upward to nature's God,
                  from whom she thought emanated ever particle of goodness. Mr. Cameron and his
                  sister had accompanied them nearly all their journey. They were going to reside
                  near Buffalo. Sabra became quite attached to them; they had journeyed together
                  more than a week, and had promised to visit each other as soon as they got
                  settled.
               When they reached Buffalo, they found that they were to be disappointed. Jason
                  found a letter directing them to go back immediately to Rochester; also stating,
                  that Samuel had gone down the Lake, to Kingston, Canada West; that he thought of
                  locating there. This intelligence grieved Sabra extremely; she could not visit her
                  Uncle; she was sorry to leave those with whom she had journeyed; and, worst of
                  all, perhaps she must go to Canada. She had been accustomed, from her earliest
                  recollections, to hear Canada spoken of unfavorably. Erroneous ideas had been
                  instilled in her mind. She thought upon it, and she was indignant. She murmured
                  because they had not informed her that they thought of settling in Canada; she
                  said she would never have started from home to have gone there. She finally said,
                  if they went there without consulting her upon the subject, they might go alone,
                  and she would go back with Jason. Here she displayed her willfulness, for she
                  afterward found good people in Canada, and became attached to the place. Jason
                  tried to quiet her, but she was determined in her own way, and Jason assured her
                  that she might go back, if Samuel would not settle in the States, They returned
                  back to Rochester. They arrived there the day Col. Rochester was buried, and
                  attended his funeral. They had never attended so large a funeral, or seen so much
                  honor displayed upon such an occasion. During the day they met with Theodore and
                  Jerry, who were watching for them. They were very happy to meet. Samuel had not
                  returned, but they were to remain there until he came. They had an opportunity of
                  seeing the Genesee Falls, and many other curiosities. Sabra was passionately fond
                  of admiring and gazing upon the beauties of nature. A heart like hers could never
                  be unhappy while attracted by the goodness and greatness of that Being whom she
                  loved to worship and adore.
               At length Samuel returned. The were happy to hear that he had selected a place in
                  the town of O., upon the eastern bank of the St. Lawrence river; it was a lovely
                  place, and fills the stranger immediately with admiration. They were to start for
                  this port as soon as possible. Samuel had become acquainted with an aged gentleman
                  by the name of Judson, and, by earnest solicitation, he bad consented to board
                  them all, until they could find a house suitable for their family. This engagement
                  was favorable to Sabra. Their family, at this time, consisted of three persons,
                  Mr. and Mrs. Judson, and their only daughter, of sixteen years. They had two sons,
                  who boarded elsewhere. Mrs. Judson was a kind, motherly woman; Sabra esteemed
                     her highly. Through the remaining
                  part of this narrative, we may often speak of the kindness of this family, and of
                  the friendship that existed between these two families. Mr. Judson informed them
                  that, a few days previous, the house next to his residence was vacant; they might
                  have obtained that. Sabra thought if they had hired that house, she would have
                  been perfectly contented. Jason informed Samuel that he would find a house while
                  the rest of the company were fitting up the machinery in the shop. He then told
                  Sabra to rest easy, for he would have that house. He went to the man that occupied
                  it, to make inquiries respecting the house. He said he had just bought it; if he
                  had not moved into it he would rent it. Jason offered to pay him well for moving,
                  and he consented. It pleased all of them exceedingly.
               Sabra felt anxious to know if Mr. and Mrs. Judson were professors of religion. She
                  hoped they were Methodists; she thought they were pious; and the Methodist and
                  Baptist churches were both near; she, thought that at evening she could know, for
                  they would, have family prayers; but she was disappointed, for there was no family
                  devotion. She soon learned. from the family that they had both experienced
                  religion, and were once members of the Methodist church, but had left, and joined
                  the Universalists. This did not change her opinion in regard to their being
                  Christians, for she thought there were Christians In all churches, and also
                  hypocrites in all.
               In less than a week they were comfortably situated in the next house. Sabra was
                  cheerful and did all she could to make her brothers enjoy themselves while they
                  remained with them. Samuel had some business transaction with Dea. Vanson, Deacon
                  of the Baptist church. He told the Deacon that the company he had with him were
                  Baptists; that Theodore was a Baptist minister's son, and a member of the church;
                  that his sister had lately experienced religion, and had been baptised by
                  immersion; that she would be a useful member in the church; she was a good singer,
                  and had been a great assistance to the choir. The Deacon called upon them, and
                  appeared quite friendly. This opened the way for them to attend that church. Sabra
                  had hoped that they might attend the Methodist. She concluded that if Theodore was
                  not willing to go with her to the Methodist, she would unite with the Baptist
                  church with him. She had a long talk with him ; told him her objection to close
                  communion. She afterward joined the Baptist with him; they made this decision
                  before Jason and Samuel left. This conclusion pleased Samuel, who often had
                  conversation with the rich Deacon. He informed the Deacon that his sister was a
                  fine girl; finally said he: "She was only brought up as an adopted daughter, in my
                  father's family." This, of course, made him appear of a little more consequence.
                  Sabra did not know, at that time, that he had taken pains to say this to the
                  Deacon. They got their business started, and then were preparing to leave. Mr. Judson said to them that he would be a
                  father to their sister, and that she might always feel at home in his house. This
                  was very kind, and it rejoiced Jason greatly; he said it would be cheering to his
                  mother to hear of their kindness. We will here remark that Mr. Judson always kept
                  his promise; a father could not have treated her more kindly.
               The day they were to leave, Samuel spoke to Sabra upon the subject of religion. He
                  told her that his mind was deeply impressed with his need of a Saviour; that he
                  did not leave her alone without a Saviour, and no hope. She endeavored to tell him
                  how to become a Christian. She felt happy to hear him express these feelings, and
                  made it a subject of prayer, after he was gone. He told her that he should miss
                  her if he should be sick. Poor man! he did not think of another who would miss her
                  more, and whose grey hairs would go in sorrow to the grave. Alas! that the love of
                  gain should ever blind a child to the welfare of an indulgent parent. Sorrow often
                  encompasses the tomb of parent and child, when this is the case. That others may
                  not a do the like!
               It was a solemn time for all of them when they parted with Jason and Samuel. After
                  they were gone, Sabra retired to her room, to weep and pray; fervently did she
                  entreat her Saviour that he would convert her brothers, and grant her grace to
                  bear her afflictions, and strength to perform her resolutions, in regard to her
                  family devotion. She told Theodore that she had enlisted in the cause of Christ
                  for life; that she intended to attend all the appointments of the church, and that
                  family prayers, both night and morning, must be attended at the commencement. He
                  thought it would be a great cross, but she reminded him of his father's last
                  request. At night, when they came in, Sabra got the Bible, and read a chapter, and
                  Theodore was enabled to bear the cross, and an altar was erected, around which
                  many afterward were blessed. Instead of one prayer being offered alone, as a duty,
                  three or four were often offered, as a privilege. How sweet is the incense of
                  prayer around the family altar, and particularly when every member of the family
                  performs this duty. How choice are the blessings there received; none but those
                  who have received these blessings can comprehend them.
               After they united with the church, they were invited into the choir, and soon
                  began to feel at home. Dea. Vanson always attended meeting; he was the leader of
                  the prayer meetings, and an exemplary Christian. He stood, indeed, like a pillar
                  in the centre of that church; he was the chief support, both spiritually and
                  temporally, and he stands there at the present day, and may the Lord still spare
                  him for his usefulness, and may he live to see, like Simeon of old, the salvation
                  of God come to that people; he has long prayed for it.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               SOME OF THE TRIALS ENDURED BY SABRA WHILE PERFORMING HER DOMESTIC DUTIES, AND
                  HAVING THE CARE OF THE SHOP.
               Sabra endured trials and hardships, during the two succeeding years, which could
                  not be described. She seldom found time to retire to rest at night until midnight,
                  and then arise before the sun, in the morning. Those who are accustomed to the
                  western part of New York State know that a few years ago, before sidewalks were
                  made, the roads were almost impassable after a rain, on account of the depth of
                  mud. Often when Sabra was going to and from the shop, which was half a mile
                  distant, she found, when she raised one foot after the other, that it was minus
                  the rubber; she would stand upon one foot, and extricate the rubber from the mud,
                  and place it upon her foot. She often thought if that was the road to wealth, she
                  had rather dispense with riches; but Samuel had placed her there, and she must
                  perform her duty, and answer for the services of another; but Alas! for her, she
                  found it the road to poverty, instead of wealth. Had it not been for the kindness
                  of Mrs. Judson, and her daughter, Mary Ann, she would have been discouraged.
                  During the three first months they all passed through severe trials; having but a
                  small capital, and being among strangers, before they received any income from
                  their business, their money was all exhausted. Deacon Vanson and Mr. Judson had
                  already kindly helped them, in emergencies, and they did not like to apply to them
                  again. Their flour and meal was gone, and in fact, they needed much at that time.
                  Theodore had tried at several groceries to get flour, &c., but had not
                  succeeded. He was quite discouraged; he wished himself back in Massachusetts. He
                  was not accustomed to trouble like this; he knew not what course to pursue.
               When Mr. Warren made Sabra the present before alluded to, he desired her to keep
                  the money on interest until she went to keeping house, and then buy some valuable
                  pieces of furniture, that she could keep, in remembrance of the family. She had
                  the money still in her trunk, with the interest it had accumulated; she intended
                  to buy with it a clock and a mirror. Should she make the sacrifice? She thought a
                  moment, and went and got it, and gave it to Theodore, saying: "Do not be
                  discouraged; the Lord will provide." He was quite surprised; he knew not that she
                  had it by her. He said, as many other men would say, that she might have given it
                  to them before. However, it relieved their present embarrassments, and they were
                  not cornered again as closely.
               Mr. Judson often reminded Sabra of his promise to her brothers, to watch over her
                  as a father; and he often told her that she ought not to work so hard; that she ought not to attend
                  evening meetings. She told him that it rested her; that if she remained at home,
                  she would have to work. He said he was going to write and tell them how she
                  toiled, night and day, for she was ruining her constitution. She begged him not to
                  write, on her mother's account; she did not wish to have her know that her labor
                  was laborious.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               SAMUEL AND HIS WIFE'S EXPERIENCE, AND WRITE TO SABRA.
               About three months after Samuel returned, he wrote Sabra a letter. It commenced
                  with the endearing appellation of "Dear Sister." What a thrill of joy animated
                  Sabra's heart when she read this; and Asenath had written and addressed her the
                  same. They were both feasting upon the first fruits of pardoning love. They were
                  happy, and wished to make others the same. Oh! "sweet messenger of peace," why
                  dost thou not always remain in the heart of the new convert. They wrote also, that
                  Fred and Marina were converted, and other members of the family; there was a great
                  revival in that neighborhood; that they often spoke of her, and wished her there.
                  This letter cheered Sabra exceedingly, and gave her renewed strength to perform
                  her Christian duties.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               JEREMIAH FORRESTER IS HOPEFULLY CONVERTED, AND UNITES WITH THE CHURCH.
               The Baptist denomination, at that time, only had preaching once in two weeks.
                  Their minister lived about 30 miles distant. He became acquainted with Mr.
                  Sanderson's family, and often spent the night with them. This was a great help to
                  them in their religious devotion.
               The ensuing winter, they had a protracted meeting. Jerry's mind was often
                  exercised upon the subject, but he had never experienced religion. Sabra thought
                  this would be a favorable time to urge him to seek forgiveness. Earnestly did she
                  pray that the Holy Spirit might convict him of sin, and that he might be brought
                  to the knowledge of the truth. The prayers of God's people were answered, and many
                  were converted. Jerry was one of the number; he was baptised by immersion, and
                  united with the Baptist church, and was a useful member. Their family worship was
                  often like a little prayer meeting, where each member unites in the service.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               SAMUEL SENDS THEM A JOURNEYMAN.
               Samuel thought they needed assistance in the shop, and he sent them John Barnard.
                  Sabra felt quite annoyed at this, for he was a man of dissipated habits, and she
                  detested the use of spirituous liquors. He was a clever fellow, only when he chose
                  to have a spree; and these he would have occasionally; but he usually stayed away
                  from the house until he became sober. At one time he had been drinking
                  intoxicating liquor, and went to the shop sick. Theodore and Jerry tried to get
                  him to go to the house, but he said he could not see Sabra. They came in and told
                  her his excuse. She prepared some nourishment for him, and went to the shop
                  herself, and persuaded him to take it, and to go to the house. The change of
                  climate and unnecessary exposure brought on the bilious intermittent fever, so
                  prevalent in that region, and he was very sick; his physician considered him
                  dangerous. Sabra attended him day and night. She had a bed placed near for
                  Theodore, that he might assist her, if necessary. John would often say to Sabra,
                  "I shall never reward you for your kindness." She would reply: "if you will
                  reform, and become a Christian, she would feel doubly repaid." She endeavored to
                  warn him of his lost condition, while under condemnation; of the willingness of
                  Christ to save all who sought him. He became alarmed, and viewed himself a sinner,
                  and earnestly desired salvation. Often, in the stillness of the night, would Sabra
                  kneel, and pray fervently in his behalf. He faithfully promised, if God spared his
                  life, that it should be devoted to His service. He did not obtain an evidence of
                  his forgiveness, until some time after his recovery; but he continued carefully to
                  study the word of God, and was seldom seen seated without his Bible in his hand.
                  In a few weeks he obtained an evidence of his acceptance with Christ, and was very
                  happy. Often in the prayer meeting would he speak of the goodness of God, and
                  faithfully would he warn others to turn to Christ. He remained happy while he
                  resided with them, and when he left he was rejoicing in the hope of Heaven.
               Sabra always attended all the prayer meetings of the church, unless sickness
                  prevented. They had a female Missionary meeting, and at the choice of official
                  members, she was chosen President of the Society. She remonstrated against it; she
                  felt unworthy and unqualified; but the minister's wife did not reside in the
                  place, and the Deacon's wife belonged to the Presbyterian church, and she was
                  obliged to accept the office. She remained in that office until she left the
                  place, and probably would have given good satisfaction, had it not been that
                  Brother and Sister Burdonsome moved into the place, and joined the church by
                  letter. He possessed some
                  peculiarities, which soon placed him in the possession of Deaconship; and as long
                  as he remained a mechanic, he performed his duty pretty well, but, when he assumed
                  the position of a merchant, his religion became an outside show, and his heart was
                  evidently corrupt. His wife partook of the same spirit; she was fearful that some
                  member of the church, that labored for a living, would wear a garment made of the
                  same material like, her own. "Such a Sister was a useful member, but, however!"
                  and there was always a but, however, or some other appellation like the former
                  attached to all the poorer class of members. She was never burdened on account of
                  her own sins, but she groaned under the burden and weight of the sins of other
                  professors of religion. The Deaconship seemed to rest on her shoulders. Sabra
                  often suffered on account of her venomous tongue, but she bore it patiently.
               Sister Burdensome was astonished that Sabra should take such care of Mr. Barnard,
                  if he had a watcher; she would get up to give him his medicine, and she had often
                  been seen up at one o'clock. I tell you, Sister C., this ought not so to be; there
                  is something wrong there in that family ; and then, if Mr. Sanderson is gone, or
                  detained at home, she comes to meeting with Jeremiah. These things ought to be
                  looked after". Oh, if church members would only live exemplary lives, religion
                  might prosper." and then she would draw a deep sigh. Sister C. replied: "I think
                  Sabra tries to live the life of a Christian. She has many duties to perform; she
                  has a class in the Sabbath school; she always attends that, and the prayer
                  meeting; she commenced from a sense of duty; she never talks of the faults of
                  others; I think you must be mistaken, for I am well acquainted with her, and I
                  think her motives are good." "Well," says Sister B., "I hope so. You must not
                  think I meant to say anything against Sabra, for I despise tattling, or evil
                  speaking." Sabra would always hear of her remarks, but she chose to suffer wrong,
                  rather than do wrong. She could not see why it was necessary for her to suffer
                  this way, but she found that it was for the trial of her faith, for she always
                  repaired to the throne of grace for support, and she found her strength renewed.
                  In every towering fabric of falsehood, and the severest trials of her life, Sabra
                  has always had occasion to say: " It was not an enemy that reproached me, else I
                  could have borne it; but it was mine equal. Oh, how deep is the wound when
                  inflicted by a friend ; it seems like a poisonous venom that cannot be healed.
                  Nothing but the grace of God can repair an injury done by a friend or
                  brother."
               Sabra's labors around the sick bed were not at an end when John recovered. Jerry
                  was taken with the same fever. Patiently did she watch by his bedside. She
                  recollected the last advice of her kind mother; it was this; for her to be kind to
                  Jerry, and treat him like a brother; to remember that he would often feel lonely,
                  He had lived in the Hudson family a number of years; they all liked him; he was
                  kind and obliging, and was always ready
                  to grant Sabra a favor, or to assist in doing services about the house. She had no
                  one, now, to see that the pail was filled with water, or the box with wood. She
                  knew that the tongue of the slanderer, which no one can tame, was already set on
                  fire by the powers of darkness; but she feared not; God was her helper; she would
                  try to perform her duty. She watched by his bedside with all the solicitude of a
                  sister. Before he recovered, Theodore was taken sick. This was a still greater
                  affliction. She then thought, if God would preserve her health, she would not
                  complain. She could attend upon him without restraint. Who can describe the depth
                  of feeling, or the tender solicitude of the affectionate wife, as she administers
                  to the wants of him she loves, while she feels that she is stronger than that arm
                  upon which she has relied for protection? How earnestly will she pray for his
                  recovery, and watch for the first flattering symptom. He was not as sick as the
                  other members of the family; the fever had passed off lightly, leaving him
                  afflicted with boils.
               They employed the services of Urana Hunter, who lived with them the two succeeding
                  years. Her father and mother were both members of the Baptist church; they had
                  brought up thirteen children; all of them were members of the Baptist church.
                  Urana would often tell Sabra what Sister Burdensome had to say concerning her and
                  others. She would tell her to keep her news to herself; but she would reply, that
                  it was too good to keep. She knew not that it grieved Sabra, for she seldom made
                  any reply, but listened silently.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXX.
               SABRA VISITS THE HOME OF HER CHILDHOOD.
               It was decided before they left home, that if nothing happened to prevent, Sabra
                  should visit them at the expiration of two years, accompanied by Jeremiah, who
                  would have business there at that time. Sabra was preparing for the journey, and
                  she had many unpleasant thoughts intermixed with her fond anticipations. Her heart
                  was filled with ecstasy of joy, when she thought of seeing her dear father and
                  mother. On the other hand, she must leave Theodore at home, and undoubtedly Sister
                  Burdensome would groan and sigh, as usual, and consider it improper for a member
                  of the church to go a journey unaccompanied by her husband; it would be a topic of
                  conversation during her absence.
               After laboring during the day, and being fatigued, she retired to bed late in the
                  evening. Sabra felt very sad, and could not refrain from weeping. Theodore
                  inquired the cause of her sorrow, She informed him. He replied: "I suppose people will make remarks, if you go;
                  perhaps you had better remain. You have no father or mother to visit." He was
                  unaware of the effect this sentence would have upon Sabra's mind, for he had not
                  alluded to her adoption since their marriage; she had not heard it mentioned for
                  years, and it had never before grieved her as at the present time; at this time it
                  caused the tears to flow more freely. Could it be possible that Theodore had
                  uttered this unkind remark? She uttered not a word. A daughter never loved a
                  mother more tenderly than Sabra loved her mother, and that affection was mutual.
                  Had it not been for this strong attachment, means would never been devised to have
                  her removed to such a distance. Many have attempted to describe the painful
                  emotions of the wounded heart, but our language is not competent for this. That
                  heart which is capable of intense enjoyment, is also susceptible of the greatest
                  suffering. It was some days before she regained her usual cheerfulness. Sabra had
                  carefully put away all her wearing apparel, that it might receive no injury in her
                  absence, and had given Urana many charges respecting the fire, &c. She was a
                  careful house-keeper, and always attended to her domestic affairs closely.
               The day arrived that they were to leave. Theodore and Mr. and Mrs. Judson
                  accompanied them to the boat. Sabra felt sad when she left, but she soon thought
                  she was on the way to see her dear mother, whom she knew was expecting her. They
                  had always kept up a correspondence; her mother's letters were full of kindness.
                  After a long journey upon the same old canal, they arrived at Albany, and then
                  took the stage to Worcester. They arrived at home safely, and enjoyed a happy
                  meeting. All things appeared as usual about the house, and what was best of all,
                  they all appeared glad to see them. The children had grown larger, but the number
                  was the same.
               After a few days, Sabra went to Jason's. She could enjoy freedom in conversation
                  here. If she spoke of her trials, she knew her mother would not know of them. Oh,
                  how delightful it is to unburden the mind to a faithful friend. The sad heart
                  often becomes joyful by sympathy. She had not unburdened her mind with as much
                  freedom for a long time. "Oh," said she, "if I could only live where I could come
                  and see you often, how happy I should be." Her visit must not be long in any
                  place, and she returned. Jason and Henrietta said they would visit her, at their
                  father's, before she went home.
               Sabra was informed by her mother that she had a present of an hundred dollars for
                  her; it being a part of the property which she received at her mother's death.
                  Samuel had advised her to give it to her at this time. Sabra thought it rather
                  strange that he should encourage this; but, Alas! she knew not the depth of
                  calculation which governs the business man. She was quite pleased, and told her
                  mother how it would relieve her embarrassments; that she could have many things
                  which she required; she had not a
                  single drawer, or closet, and not enough common dishes to keep house comfortably ;
                  she could now have pans and bowls, &c., and not be compelled to empty one dish
                  into another, as she formerly had done whenever she wished to use one. She also
                  was informed that Jeremiah was to be married, and take his wife home with them.
                  She would have company; that would be pleasant. Jerry was to receive some money
                  from his father's estate, and to put it into the company; this would add to his
                  capital. Samuel suggested the propriety of Sabra's giving her money to Theodore,
                  that he might not be left in the rear. Sabra made no reply, for her mother was
                  present; but when she retired, her pillow was wet with tears. She wished she had
                  been brought up as a servant, then she could have had more independence. She felt
                  that she had been a willing slave, and was always like to be one. She felt that
                  the crosses and trials which she daily experienced were more than she could bear.
                  She wished she could see Jason. She told her mother that she had better keep the
                  money, that she did not want it. She did not see through her son's designs as
                  clearly as Sabra saw them. She got Samuel to count the money, and gave it to her,
                  telling her she hoped she would use it as she thought proper.
               They had already remained longer than they intended. They started back, but they
                  were detained on their journey by the irregularity of the boats, and did not
                  arrive at home as soon as expected. Sabra had written two letters, but the last
                  one was miscarried. Sister Burdensome said it was just as she expected; she did
                  not believe they ever intended to come back, for Sabra had not left any of her
                  clothing about, not even an old shoe, for Theodore to look at. She had even told
                  Theodore what she thought, and endeavored to sympathise with him. Sabra had not
                  informed them of Jeremiah's marriage, for she wished to surprise them on their
                  return. They were kept in fearful suspense about a week, constantly performing the
                  hardest kind of drudgery for the evil one. You may judge their surprise when they
                  saw Jerry, accompanied by his wife. Urana told Sabra the slang that was going the
                  rounds, but she chose not to notice it; she thought they would feel rather
                  chagrined this time; and she performed her duties as usual.
               When Theodore knew that Jerry had got his money, he lamented that he had not the
                  same amount. His credit was established, and a friend had kindly offered him all
                  the capital he required, but he was always afraid of getting in debt. Sabra also
                  feared that; she had rather deprive herself of any article than to owe for it. She
                  brought forth the hundred dollars, and asked him if that would answer his purpose.
                  She told him that a lawyer, who was a friend of theirs, had accompanied them on
                  the boat, and that she had told him how they were situated in business, and that
                  he had advised her to give the money to him, for the company, and for him to
                  convey it to Jason, in trust for her, in case any accident should occur to the
                  company. Theodore was pleased with this
                  proposal, and he gladly secured that share of the machinery which belonged to
                  himself, to Jason, for it had all been purchased with her money. Mr. G. drew the
                  writings, and all was right. Sabra felt quite contented, and they seemed to
                  prosper in their business; but Jerry, or his wife, were neither of them contented.
                  She did not like the West, or the manners of the people. Jerry proposed to sell
                  out to Theodore. He made the offer, and Theodore accepted, and paid him his
                  demand, and at the expiration of one year they moved back.
               During the time they remained, they all lived together in unity. They esteemed
                  each other as sisters and brothers. At one time Sabra was very sick, and not
                  expected to live. Mrs. Forrester was very kind to her. When told that she could
                  not live long, unless some favorable symptom appeared, she calmly asked Mrs.
                  Judson if she thought that day would end her sufferings. She desired Theodore to
                  tell her mother that death had no terrors; that she longed to depart; she knew her
                  sins were forgiven, and could view by faith the land of rest, where she would be
                  free from suffering, and be permitted to praise God forever for his goodness. But
                  God, for wise and unknown purposes, spared her life, and she began slowly to
                  amend.
               When conversing with a faithful minister, she inquired why she could not always
                  feel that calm resignation which she felt when she viewed death so near. He
                  replied, that our Heavenly Father knew the grace we required; that He gave the
                  Christian dying grace when death approached, and living grace while living, and
                  conquering our enemies. These words were as nails fastened in a sure place; and
                  often, when doubting for lack of faith, they would cheer her drooping spirit.
               Sabra felt very lonesome after Jerry and Louisa left. She did not wish to return;
                  she thought they had passed through their greatest difficulties, and that their
                  worldly prospects were favorable. She knew they owed no person, unless it was
                  Samuel, and his account could not be much. They knew that he was prospering
                  rapidly in his business; he had sent them word that he had given fifty dollars at
                  one time to the Missionary Society. Sure a man in his circumstances, possessing a
                  generous heart like his, would not wrong them. They had many friends. Mr. and Mrs.
                  Judson, aid their family, seemed like near relatives. Their two sons were often at
                  home, and Mary Ann often visited a number of days with Sabra. All holidays they
                  were invited home, as Mr. Judson would say; and truly, no place seemed so much
                  like home to Sabra; if she wished for counsel or assistance, she went to Mrs.
                  Judson. Sister Burdensome said such friendship might last a short time, but it
                  would not last long. She wondered that Sabra did not choose to visit more among
                  the Baptists, where they belonged. We are happy to say, that the same friendly
                  feeling existed as long as life endured, and probably will be reanimated in
                  another world. The same friendly feeling exists at the present day by the
                  surviving members of the families.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               SAMUEL AND HIS WIFE VISITS O.—HE IS DISSATISFIED WITH THE PROSPECTS OF
                  BUSINESS, AND ADVISES THEODORE TO GO BACK TO MASSACHUSETTS.
               Samuel and his wife came soon after Jerry and Louisa returned home. Sabra was
                  rejoiced to see them. She loved them with all the tenderness of a sister; but
                  Alas! she knew not the object of their visit. Samuel soon made it known. He said
                  he did not know about Jerry's selling out so easily; if he could not get all his
                  share, he should hold him responsible with Theodore. Theodore did not know that
                  Samuel had as large a bill against the company. Samuel advised Theodore to close
                  up the business as soon as possible, and go back to Massachusetts, and try some
                  other business. This was even worse to Sabra than leaving home at first. She had
                  got comfortably situated, and she knew it would be a long time before she could be
                  as well off. She must pass through the same trials again; she remonstrated against
                  it, but in vain. Samuel said it was of no use; it would take all the machinery, at
                  the price he was willing to give for it, to pay him. He said they must sell every
                  thing that they could dispose of, for it would not pay to carry it back; the
                  machinery he could use, and he would take it at some price towards his pay. No
                  person can imagine Sabra's disappointment. After Samuel started back, they began
                  to dispose of their furniture and collect their dues. At the next covenant meeting
                  of the church, Sabra's heart was full of grief; she fully realized that she must
                  leave the place where she loved to worship God; she must leave the church, her
                  class in the Sabbath school, and she must leave the choir, where she loved to sing
                  God's praise. They asked for a letter from the church; it was unanimously given.
                  She returned home, and spent the evening in prayer and communion with God.
               Two or three days after, there was a sick man brought to their house; they had
                  known him in Massachusetts, and he had been at their house before, in O. Mr.
                  Smythers was taken sick upon the boat, and knowing their hospitality, desired to
                  be carried to their house. He was destitute of money, and among strangers. Every
                  thing possible was done to arrest the disease. A skillful physician was called,
                  who attended him faithfully. He expressed his opinion that it was doubtful if he
                  ever recovered; that he had the typhoid fever; that it had been settled some days.
                  "But," said the kind Doctor, "we will do all we can for him." His mind was
                  impaired, and he already partially delirious. The Doctor said to Sabra: "You
                  understand taking care of the sick, and he will have the best of care; perhaps he
                  may recover. Sabra's heart was full of trouble; situated as she was, how could she
                  perform the task? She knew he had no relatives to apply to for assistance. It appeared that God
                  designed her to perform this duty, and to Him alone she must look for strength.
                  She thought of the remarks that were made when she had attended upon others, but
                  they had ceased. She concluded that she would do all she could. She watched him
                  night and day. She often felt wearied and exhausted. The Doctor said it was too
                  much for any person in her situation; that she must have assistance, or she would
                  be sick herself. He said he would send watchers; but she must see that he took all
                  his medicine, for much depended upon that, and he was often obstinate and
                  unwilling to take it, and would not take it from others. The Doctor had seen this
                  often, and knew that no person else could make him take it; consequently, if he
                  had watchers, she must be called to give his medicine. The second week, another
                  fever set in, and he was delirious. Little hopes remained of his recovery. The
                  fourth week he began to amend; and the fifth he was able to sit up. The young men
                  kindly offered to assist him, when he became able to be moved, and provided for
                  him a place to board. Sabra could now leave him, at intervals. Mary Ann was there;
                  Sabra asked her if she knew of a woman she could employ to wash for her. Mary Ann
                  said: "Take your bonnet and come with me to the grove. I will find you a woman
                  that will assist you." She did so; and they were soon at the door. Mary Ann
                  wrapped; a good looking woman, well dressed, opened the door bade them walk in:
                  and be seated. Sabra felt bashed; she thought she had seen her before, but knew
                  not where. She immediately called Sabra Mrs. Sanderson, and began to invoke
                  blessings to rest upon her. Sabra delivered her message, and she replied, "God
                  bless yer, Mrs. Sanderson, I will come to yer, if it is on my hands and knees. It
                  was yerself that saved me and my children from starving, when we first landed here
                  in Ameriky; and wasn't our money all gone? and wasn't all of us sick? and yer gave
                  us herbs that cured us, yer did; and yerself and Mrs. Taylor gave our children
                  clothes, it made them dacent to go to school. May God bless yerself and Mrs.
                  Taylor, and long life to yer." By this time they were all three weeping. Sabra had
                  forgotten the circumstance, but her referring to it, brought it fresh to her
                  memory. She recollected a family who took lodgings for a few days with a family
                  who lived in the next house; that she had been told they were destitute and sick;
                  she had called to see them, and given them such things as she thought they
                  required. She had often given them vegetables from her garden, and meat to boil
                  with them. Two years had passed since this occurred; beside, this was a usual
                  occurrence with her, for the poor were never sent empty away; if she had but
                  little, she would divide; and if called upon to visit or watch with the sick, she
                  never refused. This incident had entirely passed from her mind, like many other
                  duties which she had performed for the needy. At this time she felt fully
                  recompensed for all she had ever done.
                  Her heart was filled afresh with love to God, who always rewards the cheerful
                  giver. The next morning, when they arose, they found Mrs. M. sitting upon their
                  door step. She was doubly rewarded for that day's labor; being about to leave,
                  Sabra found many useful articles, which she laid aside for her.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               SISTER BURDENSOME AND SISTER PRECISE CALL UPON SABRA UPON SPECIAL
                  BUSINESS.
               While attending to her washing, and upon the sick, she was interrupted by a call
                  from Sister Burdensome and Sister Precise. She invited them, politely, to be
                  seated. They inquired after Mr. Smythers. She invited them to go to his room. They
                  had not called before during his sickness. They declined, saying that they called
                  upon special business. They hoped she would not think hard of them. They said that
                  some of the Sisters of the Church were dissatisfied with her conduct of late, and
                  had solicited them to call upon her, and converse with her; perhaps she would make
                  acknowledgments that would be satisfactory. She inquired what their accusations
                  were. They replied that she had been seen up at a late hour; and that too, when
                  Mr. Smythers had watchers. They had also been told that she would arise and give
                  him his medicine, and many other services which were unnecessary. Sabra replied:
                  "The Doctor has been very particular to have him take all his medicine, and often
                  he will take it from no person except myself. I feel perfectly justifiable in what
                  I have done for him. If that is all, I have no acknowledgments to make; I need
                  your sympathy rather than reproof, for my trials are great. Sister Burdensome drew
                  a sigh, and said it was a pity.! She thought that such kindnesses as she had shown
                  to Mr. Smythers, and him a stranger, belonging to the poorer class of society, was
                  unbecoming to a professor of religion; we should extend our sympathies to the
                  Brethren and Sisters of the Church. They arose and left the house, saying that she
                  would be waited upon again.
               Sabra retired alone, to weep and pray. She could not understand why her heart was
                  filled with joy on one day, and that the next day she must drink the bitterest
                  dregs of disappointment. She was soon called by the sick man; she could not be
                  absent long without being called. She hastened, as soon as possible, to his
                  bedside. Said Smythers: "What is the matter? You have been crying; you are tired,
                  I know. Why did you not let me die? If it had not been for the kindness of you and
                  the good Doctor, I should not have been alive now to trouble you!" Sabra replied,
                  that it was the mercy of God alone that preserved his life; that he might have
                  time and space for repentance. The kind
                  physician was the only one who seemed to sympathise with Sabra in regard to her
                  great trials. He had many patients at that time, and was often very tired himself;
                  sometimes he would sit a few minutes, to rest. That day Sabra related to him the
                  object of Sister Burdensome's call. He thought it ridiculous. "But," said he, "I
                  would not notice it; she is always troubled about somebody. She sometimes prays
                  for me in public. If it was not for hypocrites like her and some others, religion
                  would prosper better in this place."
               Thus did poor Sabra receive one trial after another, which she never could have
                  borne, had she not been blessed with the sustaining grace of God. Alas! how sad it
                  is that inexperienced youth, who are possessed of virtuous hearts, should be
                  forever under the searching eyes of those monsters, in human shape, who are always
                  lurking about, peaking into key-holes, or half-curtained windows, that they may
                  spoil the fair reputation of others, to, get material to build their own
                  characters upon. They are Cannibals, whose appetites are as insatiable as death.
                  It is more strange, that when the virtuous are caught in their net, that the world
                  looks coolly on. The thief is pursued with avidity, and brought to justice; but
                  the slanderer is allowed to walk upon our carpets, lounge on our sofas, and sit at
                  our tables. We should beware of volunteer witnesses, who are ever ready to drag
                  their neighbors before the tribunal of public opinion. We should be slow to
                  condemn; it may be our turn next. The whisper may have already commenced which may
                  swell into a deafening noise, and be repeated from neighbor to neighbor, and from
                  town to town, until an indelible blot be stamped upon the fair page of our
                  reputation. It is no light, trifling affair to believe a lie, if it told by a
                  professor of religion, or an eminent member of the Church. The heart once wounded
                  by the piercing arrow of defamation, never heals; innocence may have been proved,
                  and the false witness condemned, but the memory of that one deep wrong will never
                  be eradicated; it will glide silently like a ghost among all future joys.
               The injured one may rise to affluence and influence, but the scar still recalls
                  the injury to mind, and too often its woof is visible in the premature winding
                  sheet, and its victim finds peace in an early grave; but its record is in Heaven,
                  written by the pen of the Almighty, and he will avenge the innocent, and punish
                  the slanderer.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               MR. SMYTHERS IS REMOVED, AND MR. AND MRS. SANDERSON RETURN TO
                  MASSACHUSETTS.
               The young men of O. kindly obtained a boarding place for Mr. Smythers. As soon as
                  he became able, he was removed thither, where he received kind attention until he
                  recovered. Mr. or Mrs. Sanderson never received any remuneration for their
                  trouble, although he often promised, during his sickness, that he would recompense
                  them if he recovered. They had previously disposed of most of their furniture;
                  they packed the remainder of their bedding, &c. They left the village, and the
                  society that was dear, very dear to Sabra. Many friends accompanied them to the
                  boat; Sabra took her leave of them with a sorrowful heart. They arrived in
                  Massachusetts safely. Her father and mother welcomed them back. The machinery had
                  arrived at Boston by shipping. Samuel knew that Theodore's share had been
                  intrusted to Jason, for Sabra's benefit, but he thought he had a right to claim it
                  all. Beside all this, he had a demand against Theodore of two hundred and fifty
                  dollars. Theodore thought Sabra had better give up all freely, or Samuel would
                  have hard thoughts of them, and that would grieve her mother. When she saw Jason,
                  she told him she was going to let Samuel have all that had been secured to her. He
                  said she was very foolish; but she made the sacrifice, and all was gone, and
                  Theodore gave his note for the balance.
               Thus they toiled hard four years, to find themselves nearly three hundred dollars
                  in debt, beside what they had accumulated the three years previous to their
                  marriage, together with all Sabra's presents, which amounted to two hundred
                  dollars more. The business man thinks not of woman's rights; no, not he! no more
                  than those men who legislate our laws. Some of them do not allow a woman her hard
                  earnings, that she may clothe and feed her children. Her husband may be a
                  drunkard, or a gambler, and the articles she has toiled day and night to obtain,
                  may be sold by the sheriff to pay his bill. Talk of freedom! where will you find
                  slavery like this? We are happy to say that, in some places, laws like this have
                  been eradicated, and woman is protected, and enjoys the privilege of eating her
                  own bread, using her own furniture, paying her own debts, clothing and educating
                  her children, and woman, poor feeble woman, has the pleasure of bringing up her
                  children to be ornaments in society; it should be so everywhere. Ye men who
                  legislate, hasten the time when women may enjoy that for which they have toiled,
                  night and day to procure, and that for which their mothers; have toiled
                  unceasingly to lay by for them ; your poor-houses would not contain the number
                  they now do, and your penitentiaries would be less crowded; your insane hospitals
                  less inmates. How often has the poor,
                  industrious mother, who was blest with intellect, industry and economy, and
                  capable of bringing up and educating her children, been driven from her home, and
                  her own earnings been snatched from her, to pay the debts owed, perhaps, to the
                  liquor seller, or the gambler, or some other transaction by which she or her
                  children never received a farthing; She becomes disheartened and discouraged; she
                  gives way to her troubles, and at length becomes a maniac. Her children are cast
                  upon the charities of an unfriendly world; they come up without an education, or
                  the cultivation of morality; and tell, if you can, where this unhallowed influence
                  will end? Ah! a finite being cannot trace the end of this one legal transaction;
                  eternity alone can measure the abyss of woe into which multitudes have been
                  plunged, who might have been brought up by their mothers, and been ornaments to
                  society, and able to sustain their parents in the decline of life, and thus reward
                  them for their kindnesses. Countless ages alone can answer this, for its influence
                  may continue beyond our comprehensions.
               Had Sabra enjoyed this protection, herself or her children would never have been
                  destitute of the comforts of life, or even the luxuries, for God always blessed
                  her undertakings, and crowned her labors with success. She soon went to Jason's;
                  they all received her kindly. She saw at once that Fred was not pleased to see
                  them return; she did not like to stay at her father's on that account, although
                  her father and mother urged it. Theodore wished her to stay in the country, until
                  he found a permanent situation in the city; his health was failing; he was fabled
                  with the dyspepsia; he had already obtained the situation of a clerk in a large
                  establishment in Boston. Sabra wished to have a room, and keep house; her
                  situation required it. Jason said she might have a part of his house. This pleased
                  her exceedingly; but her mother persuaded Theodore to leave her with her a few
                  months. She used all the arguments she could to remain at Jason's; told him that
                  it was eighteen miles nearer Boston; that he could visit her oftener; but he was
                  always sure that his judgement was the best, and urged that it was her duty to
                  submit willingly; she always had submitted willingly, but at this time she
                  submitted reluctantly. She could not bear the idea of being a burden; she was
                  unable to earn money, as she formerly had done; they were entirely destitute of
                  money, and she needed many things. She remained a few weeks at Jason's, and then
                  returned to her mother's. After Theodore had gone to the city, she went to a
                  friend, who was soon to be married, and disposed of some articles which she could
                  spare, and obtained money to answer her present emergencies. Samuel and Asenath
                  were very kind to her during the time she was at her fathers. They were always
                  ready to bestow on her a favor; would often ask her to ride with them. Fred said
                  nothing against her staying there; but actions often speak louder than words. At
                  evening, she would retire to her room, and write in her journal, or to some
                     friend. She often wrote to Mary Ann
                  Judson; they corresponded as long as they were separate. She spent many happy
                  hours in solitude. She was in the house where God first spake her sins forgiven,
                  and took all her guilt away, and the place was dear to her; the memory of those
                  happy hours often filled her soul with peace, On the Sabbath, after they were all
                  gone to church, she would take her Bible and hymn book, read a chapter, then
                  engage in prayer, afterward sing God's praise, which was her delight. She
                  constantly enjoyed peace of mind. The greater her afflictions were, the nearer
                  would she approach the throne of grace. She loved to take her album, and read
                  verses that were penned by her Sabbath school scholars; and pieces written by
                  other friends, often cheered her drooping heart.
               In the month of February, she gave birth to a daughter. There was great rejoicing
                  at this event. She was impatient to see Theodore, that he might receive the prize.
                  As soon as he received the intelligence, he hastened home to rejoice with the
                  rest. Sabra deeply felt the responsibility of being a mother. She desired Theodore
                  to get a tenement as soon as possible, that the family might be together; but she
                  passed through many trials before he succeeded; when he did, she was very happy to
                  be by herself again.
               After they moved to Boston, Sabra had more time for improvement. She felt her need
                  of general information, and appropriated a portion of her time each day to
                  reading, which became a great benefit to her. She regretted that she had not
                  acquired a better education, and devised plans to accomplish this; she reviewed
                  her childhood studies, and made great progress; she studied Walker's Dictionary,
                  and was astonished at her ignorance of the meaning of many words. Theodore's
                  father was a college educated man, and he commended Sabra for the course she was
                  taking. He kindly gave her books, which were very useful to her. Sabra could not
                  enjoy this privilege long; she seemed destined to changes. Theodore's health
                  became more impaired. The bleak east winds did not benefit his constitution; and
                  being confined in the store, without bodily exercise, his disease became more
                  established. His twin brother, Thadeus, was in New York city, in business; he
                  wrote him that, if he was there, he could get him a situation any day. Theodore
                  was always hasty in his decision, and he made up his mind immediately to go to New
                  York. He acquainted Sabra with his intention as soon as he went to the house; said
                  he would go to the country and get a tenement for her, and she must move there
                  until he got established in New York, then he would send for her. She begged to
                  stay where she was, but he said it would be more expensive, and his mind was
                  always made up without consulting her, and there was no changing it afterwards,
                  for he was set in his opinion. He went to her father's and informed them of his
                  intentions, and procured a tenement for Sabra about a mile from them. There was a
                  widow lived in the house he engaged, and she was very kind to Sabra and little Helen; she did not like to live alone,
                  and they lived happily together. Sabra urged Theodore to take what little funds
                  they had, for she was fearful that he would not get business immediately. Thus she
                  was left again, without money or means, expecting Theodore would send her money as
                  soon as he found employment; but judge her surprise and grief upon receiving his
                  first letter, for it informed her that ere she received it, her husband would be
                  on his way to one of the Southern States.
               Theodore had met with a merchant from Alabama, who was purchasing goods, and was
                  desirous of obtaining a clerk or foreman. He made Theodore a liberal offer, and
                  would pay all his traveling expenses. He accepted this offer, and started, in
                  company with the merchant, for the Southern clime. He was flattered to believe
                  that a change of climate, and of diet, would improve his health. His letter was
                  full of tender regret that he could not see his wife and child before his
                  departure; but it was impossible. This letter seemed to Sabra more than she could
                  bear. She now fully realized that she was left alone, and that she must devise
                  means for the support of herself and child; she immediately sought employment with
                  her needle. Helen was two years old. Samuel often employed her when he was hurried
                  in his business. He soon proposed that she might have a part of the tenement he
                  occupied, and board those who were employed in the shop. She went to her father
                  Sanderson son for advice; he had moved from the place where he had so long
                  labored, and lived sixteen miles distant. He thought she had better accept
                  Samuel's offer. She began to prepare to move, but her heart was sad, for she loved
                  to be alone. Mrs. A. regretted to have her leave, for they lived very happily
                  together. She prospered very well in her new situation. Samuel and Asenath were
                  very kind to her. Her father and mother were glad to have her near, and often did
                  her fond mother regret that she could not live in the family with them; her father
                  was willing, but, Alas! he feared Fred.
               Joel was one of Sabra's family; there had always existed a true friendship between
                  them. True friendship exists only where God himself prepares the soil. They often
                  conversed upon the subject of religion, and the time when they first made a
                  profession of their faith in Christ; they both belonged to the same church; a
                  brotherly and sisterly feeling always existed between them.
               Sabra toiled very hard; but what of that? she could earn her own living. She often
                  worked until a late hour, but she could have the satisfaction of knowing that she
                  was laying by something every week for the day of adversity, or for future
                  enjoyment. Her father's health began to decline, and he was unable to labor,
                  except some light work. He loved to have little Helen with him; she would often go
                  and take her breakfast with them; they were pleased to have her, and would set a
                  plate for her. Sabra usually took
                  breakfast early, before she was up. It annoyed Fred to have Helen go there to take
                  her breakfast, and he began to reprimand his father and mother, and Sabra, for
                  allowing it. Sabra kept her away for some days. Her father inquired the cause of
                  her absence, and persuaded her to let her come, as usual; said that there was no
                  person but they two, and it was lonesome; that he enjoyed his breakfast much
                  better when she was present, for she was very talkative. He told her not to mind
                  what Fred said, but let her come, as usual.
               Every few days there was something for Fred to scold about; there was always
                  something wrong in Sabra. At length he hit upon the right plan; he knew his father
                  was tenacious of keeping the farm in the hands of his own posterity, and he was
                  the only one who wished to labor upon it, and he thought to leave his father in
                  his old age, or even to say that this was his intention, would accomplish his
                  design. He even carried his design so far as to go abroad to look for land. He
                  said there was no use in staying there; they could not all be supported by the
                  income of that farm. His father felt quite sad; he knew not what course to take.
                  He told his wife, and Sabra, that he would rather live in a secluded place upon
                  his farm, called Thornygutter, in a hut, than to hear Fred forever grumbling; he
                  felt quite sure that his days were nearly finished, and he wished to see his
                  children all united. Sabra told him that Samuel talked of sending the men to a
                  shop in the adjoining town, where there was a large water power; if he did, she
                  would go, to board them, and then Fred would not grumble about her being there.
                  This proved to be a fact; the water failed at home, and he gave it up entirely.
                  Soon after, Sabra moved; her family was not as large as it had been, and she found
                  time to work at one part of the business herself, and often she earned a dollar
                  per day.
               About a year and a half after Theodore went South, he sent Sabra money. Previous
                  to this, she had paid Samuel the interest upon the note he held against them. She
                  could not endure the thought of being in debt, and it often disturbed her peace.
                  She now thought she could cancel the debt, and get the note. She collected what
                  she had earned, and that, with what Theodore had sent her, was sufficient to pay
                  the whole amount. She carried it to Samuel, but to her surprise, he refused to
                  take it. He kindly told her that he should never take it from her. She thought him
                  very kind in this transaction, but still she was troubled about the note.
               She often heard from Theodore; his health was gradually failing; sometimes he was
                  unable to attend to his business; but he said nothing of returning back. More than
                  two years had already passed since he left, and many a lonesome day had she
                  passed, yet she enjoyed religion, and a firm hope of Heaven. A longer time than
                  usual had elapsed since she had received any letter from Theodore. Suspicion, that
                  foe to all happiness, which is often worse than reality, had filled her mind with trouble. She thought he
                  must be dead, or he would write to her. She wrote, and wrote again, but she
                  received no answer.
               One afternoon, while Sabra was at a female meeting, at a near neighbors, she was
                  called home; she met Theodore's father at the door; his countenance was sad; she
                  was filled with fearful emotion, but he led her to the room; there lay Theodore
                  upon the lounge; he was a mere skeleton, scarcely able to reach home. His father
                  told Sabra that he feared Theodore had relaxed in the performance of his religious
                  duties, but she must continue as usual to have family prayers, and be faithful in
                  conversation with him. He remained with them until the next day, and then returned
                  home. Poor little Helen could not be persuaded to think that the strange sick man
                  was her papa. She would say that her papa looked like Uncle Thadeus, and that this
                  man was not like him. She was an affectionate child; if she saw her mother
                  weeping, she would say, "What is the matter, mama? I will be good." Little
                  innocent creature; she never realized the loss of her father. That evening Sabra
                  read a portion of Scripture, as usual, and asked Theodore to lead in prayer, but
                  he declined, and requested Joel to pray; he prayed, and others followed; it was
                  like a little prayer meeting. She often conversed with him upon the subject of
                  religion. He told her frankly that he had not walked with the church since he left
                  Boston; the reasons why were these: He had seen so many professors of religion,
                  who could make long prayers, whom he thought were immoral and dishonest, he had
                  lost the enjoyment himself, and was almost persuaded to believe in universal
                  salvation, through the merits of Christ. She asked him if he did not believe that
                  he experienced a change of heart before he made a profession of religion. He
                  admitted this, and acknowledged the enjoyment he then possessed. She endeavored to
                  explain to him that the improper conduct of professors of religion would never
                  confound the doctrines of the cross, or the reality of experimental religion; that
                  there were hypocrites among the professed followers of Christ, while He was with
                  them upon the earth, and that, undoubtedly, they were as numerous at the present
                  day; that if one in every twelve were all that would be thrust out at last, as not
                  having on the wedding garment, it would be a small portion, compared to what might
                  be lost by believing false doctrines, and awful in the extreme would be the
                  portion of those who knew their Master's will, and did it not. He soon saw his
                  error, and had a great desire to again enjoy the blessings of forgiveness, and
                  peace with God. This he obtained, and was desirous of again uniting with the
                  church, where he first belonged, and where Joel and Sabra then were members. He
                  was then able to ride, and they went to the church, and he was welcomed back. It
                  was sacrament day; it was a solemn time, long remembered by many. He was just able
                  to sit during the service, and then rested at a friend's, where they formerly had lived. They remained two days in
                  the neighborhood where he had spent his youthful days, and saw many of his old
                  associates for the last time. They then went to Sabra's father's, and enjoyed his
                  last visit there. He was cheerful and happy; he only lamented that he had not
                  walked in the path of duty, and thereby and served God more faithfully.
               After they had returned home, and he had become rested, he began to talk of their
                  worldly prospects. He had laid by a small amount of money, notwithstanding his ill
                  health. He could pay Samuel, and have a small sum left. Sabra told him that she
                  had offered to pay Samuel, and that he had refused to take it from her. Theodore
                  rejoiced greatly to hear this; said that they freely gave up every cent they
                  possessed, to him, when they returned from the West, and perhaps Samuel thought
                  that was sufficient. "Surely," said he, "if he would not take it when you offered
                  it to him, he will not take it now, when he sees me upon the brink of the grave,
                  and you to be left a widow, and our only child fatherless. But I will offer to pay
                  it, and thereby get the note, that you need not fret about his holding it against
                  you." He was surprised to find how economically Sabra had managed; that she had
                  all the funds he had sent for her use, upon interest, beside a small amount which
                  she had earned herself; she also had a good supply of clothing. Thadeus had given
                  her a splendid silk dress, and a valuable shawl. Jason and Henrietta had also
                  given her clothing. Little Helen received many presents. Now, if Samuel should
                  refuse to take the two hundred and fifty or sixty dollars, which he had laid by
                  for him, and give up the note, he could leave his family comfortable
                  circumstances. He knew that Samuel could boast of his thousands of dollars, and
                  that he would never feel the loss of it. He knew, also, that it rightfully
                  belonged to Sabra; that it had been lawfully secured to her; that she had freely
                  given up to him more than that amount. His hopes were brilliant; but, Alas! why
                  should disappointment take the place of hope, and thus sadden the heart of the
                  disconsolate!
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               SAMUEL VISITS THEM—TAKES HIS MONEY AND CARRIES IT AWAY.
               Samuel had removed from the homestead, and resided eleven miles distant. He had
                  built himself a splendid cottage, and was doing an extensive business in company
                  with a rich man. The fortunate spoke in his wheel of fortune was upward; indeed,
                  it seemed stationary. He was a stockholder in the bank, and prospered in all his
                  undertakings.
               
               A few days after the conversation alluded to in our last chapter, he called to see
                  Theodore. Asenath and little Ordelia were with him. Theodore did not tell Samuel
                  what Sabra had communicated to him, but during their conversation he told him he
                  could pay him, if he wished for the money; that he had been as prudent as
                  possible, and had saved a little of his salary, although he had always had poor
                  health. Samuel said he supposed it would be as well to have it settled now; that
                  he was in want of money, and immediately produced the note. Theodore had laid by
                  the amount in gold and silver coin; he counted out both principal and remaining
                  interest; it was quite bulky. Samuel tied it up in his pocket handkerchief. He did
                  not stay to tea, but seemed in a great hurry, and soon left. Sabra's heart was
                  full of grief. When they were getting into the buggy, she turned away; her eyes
                  were full of tears. She went to the window; saw him reach the money to Asenath.
                  She felt sure they were carrying away that which rightfully belonged to the
                  fatherless, and widow. Ordelia said to her papa: "What makes Aunt Sabra feel so
                  bad? she is crying." Asenath said, "Theodore looks very bad; he will not live many
                  days." "Yes," said Samuel, "he looks bad; worse than I expected; he'll not live
                  long. I went in just the right time. It increases my credit in the bank to have
                  money deposited there. The business man needs all the money he can get, to carry
                  on business successfully. Sabra can manage well enough without this." "I feel
                  sorry for her," said Asenath; "she looks feeble and exhausted; she has not had a
                  whole night's rest since Theodore returned back." "I suppose not," said Samuel;
                  "but then she can bear more than any person I know of; she will work, you know, if
                  she can find any thing to do." - They were going to spend the night at his
                  father's. They drove up to the door; his mother went to the buggy with a joyful
                  heart, for she was always glad to see her children and grandchildren. Samuel
                  reached her the money, saying, "Take this, and take care of it." "What is it?"
                  said she; " it is heavy for a small parcel." Little Ordelia said: "Grandma, that
                  is all money; papa got it from Uncle Theodore, and you don't know how pale and
                  sick he looks; and Aunt Sabra was crying when we came away." Mrs. Hudson took the
                  money, and drew one of her long, deep sighs. Joy had fled from her cheerful heart,
                  and sadder thoughts were occupying her mind. She knew that Samuel had refused to
                  take the money from Sabra, and she thought he would never take it; she knew that
                  Sabra had freely given up to him all that had been secured to her, and her heart
                  was sad; but thought, that at some future time, she would recompense her for the
                  sacrifice she had made; but, Alas! she knew not how easily others would rule her
                  affairs by foul stratagem.
               The next day Samuel returned home, carrying his treasure. He went to his office;
                  his partner was there, busily engaged looking over the books. He said: "How did
                  you succeed with Sanderson son?" "Oh,
                  very well. Sanderson is a clever fellow; and you know I am not easily duped ; I
                  did not intend to lose that; I have lost enough already. A business man needs all
                  the money he can get. I mean to look out for one, and that is myself." "But, I
                  thought you would give that to Sabra; she needs it." "Not I. She has a faculty of
                  taking care of herself; she is young. If she needs help, I can assist her in the
                  future. Sanderson is almost gone; poor fellow! he has not long to live." He lit
                  his cigar, and went out to gaze upon his extensive possessions. Each of these men
                  possessed their own thoughts. The honest Unitarian thought of Sabra, as he had
                  seen her before her marriage, in her gay assembly; she then appeared cheerful and
                  happy, with a heart buoyant with hope. He thought of the contrast; a gloom had
                  settled upon her countenance, although she tried to appear cheerful; he knew that
                  she toiled hard, and had already broken her constitution, but amidst numerous
                  cares, the thoughts of Sabra passed from his mind.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               THEODORE'S DEATH AND BURIAL.
               Soon after this, Theodore was confined to his room. He become entirely reconciled
                  to his situation. He conversed with all his friends, and those who called to see
                  him, upon the necessity of being prepared for death. Jason came to see them, and
                  brought Hatty to assist Sabra; this was a great relief to her. One day Mr. and
                  Mrs. Hudson were there; Theodore said: "Father, you have always been kind to me
                  and my family; I thank you for this; I shall soon leave them; I hope you will
                  still be kind to them. I am going home first, but you will soon follow. We shall
                  soon both be in eternity; we shall meet there, and be free from trouble." The old
                  gentlemen was much affected ; he seemed fully to realize how short his own life
                  appeared. This was indeed the last time they met on earth. He spake cheerfully
                  about his funeral services; expressed his wish that his funeral might be at the
                  church where he first experienced religion, and where he had recently re-united
                  with the people of God, and spake also of the place where he desired to be
                  buried.
               The scenes of the death-bed have often been described, but faintly are they
                  pictured to the human mind. They can better be portrayed in the mind of those who-have witnessed the scene; and
                  who has not stood beside the dying? who has not lost a friend? We will leave this
                  scene to the imagination of the reader, when we have said, that he passed away, as
                  if sinking in a sweet slumber, leaving his friends to weep for their loss, which
                  was his gain.
               The funeral services were attended at the church where he had requested, and
                  according to his wishes,; it was a solemn scene, long remembered by all present.
                  The funeral services of the wife of their family physician was attended the same
                  hour, at the same place. It is seldom that we see two corpses in a church at the
                  same hour. Two of his brothers returned home with Sabra. Kendrick, his youngest
                  brother, was her favorite. He was then preparing for the ministry; she always had
                  applied to him for counsel, in her husband's absence. She felt now that she needed
                  counsel more than ever. She told Kendrick that she knew not what course to pursue;
                  she feared, if she remained where she was, that the voice of the calumniator would
                  be active against her; she feared their attacks more than the actual pursuit of an
                  highway robber. She had already suffered sufficiently by the remarks of the
                  slanderer to know their direful consequences. Kendrick advised her to remain, and
                  follow the same employment; she could earn four or five dollars per week. She told
                  him if she could prepare herself for a primary school teacher, she would like
                  that; then she could teach little Helen herself. He encouraged her in this
                  project; said if she could stay at her father's during the fall and winter, she
                  might apply herself wholly to her books, and be able to commence in the spring;
                  that he would assist her. She told him frankly that Fred did not wish to have her
                  there. He was surprised; said he thought a perfect union existed in the family;
                  she seldom spoke of her trials. He left her to decide for herself.
               Soon after this she went to her father's, and asked for advice. They said she had
                  better remain where she was; that she would be happier there, for she would hear
                  no grumbling. Her father was failing gradually. Said he, "I have not long to live;
                  perhaps they would like to have you come and live with your mother when I am gone;
                  she will be lonesome, and need some person for company. I wish to live in peace
                  with Fred the few remaining days I have to stay; my trials will soon be ended. I
                  have left your mother," said he, "abundantly able to have all things managed
                  according to her own wishes. I have made my will differently from what I once
                  intended; I have left it for her to manage as she thinks proper. She is to have
                  one-third of all the property to dispose of as she pleases." Sabra said she hoped
                  he would not be troubled on her account, for she could take care of herself; that
                  she had rather have his approbation than all his property. Said he, "I hope you
                  will be prospered, and continue to have good courage. Sabra went home fully
                  persuaded to add all she possibly could to her small stock of knowledge.
               
               After she had retired to her room, wearied with a hard day's work, she would
                  commit a long lesson, or read some encouragement from the Boston Olive Branch. Who
                  can read that paper without thinking, they were created for a high and noble
                  purpose? And we ask, who can read the writings of M. A. Deniston, and others, who
                  write for that valuable paper, without growing wiser and better? Often, when
                  nearly discouraged would Sabra find in the writings of Coleworthy something to
                  stimulate her to action;, upward and onward seemed to be his motto, and she
                  adopted the same course.
               She wrote a letter to Mr. Judson's family, informing them of Theodore's death, and
                  soon received an answer, urging her to visit them, Mary Ann was married, but
                  boarded with her father. She said that her father's health was failing; that he
                  was anxious to see her before his death. Sabra fully resolved to go there in the
                  spring.
               One evening, after Mrs. Hudson had retired to rest, she had a wonderful vision, or
                  a magnificent view of the glory of God. She saw a great white throne, and the
                  glorious purity and perfection of the Deity that sat thereon was too pure for her
                  imagination. She seemed to shrink back from the presence of that holy Being, but
                  it still appeared in view. She was invited to join the number of that innumerable
                  company which surrounded the throne, clothed in spotless purity. She wished to
                  communicate what she had seen to her children; she invited them all home for that
                  purpose. She endeavored to describe what she had seen to them but it was evident
                  that it was past description. She was deeply impressed with the thought that
                  nothing impure or unholy could ever enter that happy place. She endeavored to
                  impress upon their minds that, without purity of heart and purpose, no person
                  could ever enter into the presence of God. Fred said that it was nothing but a
                  dream; that she was always seeing something wonderful. Sabra was astonished to
                  hear him speak lightly of it. After the other members of the family had gone,
                  Jason, Henrietta and Sabra were delighted to hear her speak freely of what she had
                  seen, and to hear her talk of Heaven. She described it as a vision, for she had
                  not been asleep. Sabra told her mother that this was intended to disperse her
                  fears; that now she ought to enjoy the hope of the Christian. Mrs. Hudson
                  delighted to meditate and speak of this event, and her mind became prepared for
                  greater trials.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               THE DEATH OF MRS.HUDSON.
               Mr. Hudson's impressions respecting the brevity of his life were correct. He
                  failed gradually; in the month of January, he died. Sabra sent for her brother,
                  Kendrick, to accompany her to the funeral. He came; the roads were filled full of
                  snow, and the weather extremely cold. They drove up to the door of her dear
                  mother. It appeared that no preparation had been made; about the door the snow was
                  lying in piles. Upon entering the house, they found only one Person within. Sabra
                  nearly fainted; after she was restored, she was told that her father was not
                  buried, that Fred had insisted upon having taken up to the other house; that her
                  mother did not wish to have the corpse removed, but Fred said there would be more
                  room there. She was told that her mother had just gone, and that it was nearly
                  time for the service to commence. She went into the room where she had taken the
                  parting hand of her dear father, only a few days before, and knelt down and prayed
                  God to give her grace to bear this affliction, that God would sustain her dear
                  mother; she knew that her afflictions were multiplied. Oh, how she wished that she
                  could stay with her, and comfort and console her. She knew well that the removal
                  of the corpse was to influence his mother to go there to reside. The stratagems of
                  the designing are artful and cunningly devised. They walked to the other house.
                  Great care had been taken to have the snow cleared away around where Fred lived.
                  Kendrick said: "Is it not singular to have the corpse removed before going to the
                  church? I never heard of an instance like this." Sabra made no reply, but little
                  Helen said: "Mama, did grandpa die up Fred's?" "No, dear." They entered just as
                  the mourners were taking their seats. Sabra had but a few moments' conversation
                  with her mother, for Kendrick had to return to W. that day. She told her that
                  shell would come and see her in two or three days. On their way home, Kendrick
                  asked Sabra what could be the object of having the funeral at Fred's. He said her
                  mother would feel worse to go back to the house than she would if she had gone
                  directly from it. She told him that Fred said there would be more room. "Oh fie,"
                  said Kendrick; "the other house would hold twice the number there were present.
                  Sabra had never made any remarks to Kendrick about Fred; she seldom mentioned him
                  to any person. After Kendrick had gone, and she had retired to her room, she felt
                  inconsolable. "Ah!" thought she, "how miserable must be those persons be who are
                  bereft of friends and never pray," for it was in prayer to God that she found
                  relief. According to her promise, Sabra went to see her mother. She found her
                  calmer than she expected, and at her
                  own house. A friend was staying with her, for company. Sabra told her that she
                  would come and live with her at any time, if she desired it. She replied, that it
                  would be her choice, but that it would be impossible, for Jason had proposed it,
                  but Fred opposed it; he said she might as well move into the house with him first
                  as last; that she would have to. Jason's health was poor; she had proposed to have
                  him come and live with her, but nothing could be done satisfactory unless she went
                  there. Samuel did not like to hurt his mother's feelings, but he could go to Mrs.
                  Heulet, and get her to advise his mother not to have Sabra come there to live.
                  Sabra told her mother that if she did not go to live with her, if she was willing,
                  she thought of going West in the spring; that she must adopt some means of
                  supporting herself and little Helen. Her mother spoke of the will; said she had
                  not seen it; and did not expect to, for Fred had it; that he was Executor. She
                  said her father had given but little to Jason, or to her, but had left a good
                  portion for herself, to give to whom she pleased, and that she should attend to
                  it. Sabra said it was not property that she cared for; it was to have her happy
                  and comfortable. Her mother said, if it could be possible, she would like to have
                  Jason or her live with her, if not, she would choose Samuel next, but she was
                  afraid that she must submit to live with Fred. Sabra went home, and applied
                  herself more faithfully to her books. She succeeded in every study but arithmetic;
                  this often puzzled her. She kept her plan a secret. Joel was very kind to her, and
                  would carry her to see her mother as often as she desired. She told him that she
                  intended to go West in the spring, but he supposed she was going on a visit.
               A few days after the funeral of her father, Sabra received a kind letter from
                  Kendrick. Rich gifts are acceptable to the poor and destitute, but what gift can
                  compare with sympathy, to the sensitive heart. How often she read, over and over
                  again, Kendrick's letter. You here have the letter, as penned by the kind
                  writer:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           DEAR SISTER SABRA:—I suppose you may be a little anxious to learn how
                              I got home, after leaving your place last Thursday, and I improve ,the
                              first leisure hour to write you. I rode warm and comfortable, without
                              stopping to warm; I had a pleasant sleigh ride, except in narrow
                              places; the drifts are abominable in narrow roads; I was obliged to
                              get out and tread down the snow in some places. Enough of this;
                              however, I think your curiosity must be sufficiently satisfied as to
                              my ride. I told you that I wrote to father, in- forming him of the
                              death of your father; I received a reply a day or two since; he was
                              surprised to hear that one of his tried and faithful friends had gone,
                              and seemed to feel deeply the loss. Do not grieve too much, sister
                              Sabra, for your father's departure; I know he was dear, very dear to
                              you; but remember we have a common Father, who is much more watchful
                              and tender than our earthly parents, as he is more able and ready to grant us the
                              favors we desire; and think, too, that we ought be grateful to Him for
                              showing such kindness to the friends whom we most love, as to take
                              them, before us, to their happy home—to His parental bosom; and fear
                              not that you will be left friendless when you see those most beloved
                              leaving you, one after another. Be willing, at least, ever to regard
                              me as a brother, in whom you can confide;- and feel that you are a
                              sister in our common family. I had hardly a moment to talk with you,
                              Sabra, when I was at L. I shall, however, next vacation, I think, see
                              you again; our term closes three weeks from next Wednesday; I shall
                              expect a long letter from you before that time. You must pardon me,
                              dear sister, if I am too light and trifling, for it is my nature. The
                              religion of Jesus, I can't believe, was ever intended to restrict our
                              cheerfulness. If I am too lively, however, do tell me of it, and I
                              will try to correct myself. I do desire, if I know my own heart, to
                              devote myself wholly to the service of my Saviour, and to make all I
                              do, tend to His glory; I believe the same desire fills your soul. Let
                              us pray for each other. My respects to your family, and forget not, a
                              budget of love to little Helen. Good bye for the present.
                           
                              Your ever affectionate brother,
                              KENDRICK SANDERSON. MRS. SABRA SANDERSON.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Sabra went to the trunk that contained her old letters, to lay this one carefully
                  by; she saw a package of letters that Theodore had received while at the South;
                  she thought she would read some of them. The first one she opened was from her
                  brother Samuel; she was surprised to find that it contained sentences that she
                  could not understand; he spake of the money that was due him; said Sabra had
                  received some intelligence from him respecting it, but could not tell what it was;
                  conveying the idea to Theodore that Sabra treated his letters indifferently. At
                  the close of the letter was the following sentence:
               "P.S.—Particularly. Should you have anything to write me alone, you can send me a
                  line in a few days after the first. S. H."
               If ever a person desired to converse with the dead, Sabra did, at this time. Her
                  next impulses were that she would go directly to Samuel, and ask him what he
                  meant. After she had prayed for sustaining grace, she resolved to say nothing
                  about it, but to try to overlook it. Ah!" thought she, "is this from the pen of
                  him over whom I have watched in sickness so many long, long nights, and wiped from
                  his brow what was then supposed to be the cold sweat of death!" Even Fred had
                  chided her for her attention to him in sickness; and now he was misrepresenting
                  her best motives to her nearest friend on earth. Theodore had never sent any
                  message to be given to Samuel; he merely said that he hoped he should be able to
                  pay him sometime. Sabra had freely offered to pay him, from the pittance
                  accumulated by herself, and the small sum received from Theodore for the
                     support port of herself and little
                  daughter. She did not wonder that Theodore came night stumbling over the faults of
                  those professing Christianity; she felt sure that a cloak of professed
                  Christianity would prove but a thin veil to cover base corruption like this. She
                  was more fully resolved to seek her maintenance among strangers; one link alone
                  still bound her to her native home; her dear mother and her early associates.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               SABRA VISITS HER FRIENDS IN THE WEST.
               Dreary winter soon passed away, and lovely spring ushered in. In the month of May,
                  Sabra was ready to start on her journey; her mother thought it would improve her
                  health. She had moved into the house with Fred, but had secured the privilege of
                  keeping her dairy at the other house; she said it afforded her great pleasure to
                  go for the last time before starting her journey; she requested Sabra to go and
                  ask Mrs. Heulet if she would take her to Esq. Haskin's on the following day; said
                  she, "I am going to get him to make my will." Mrs. Heulet consented; and Sabra
                  afterwards heard that they went, and that the will was executed. She left her
                  mother in good spirits, promising to write often.
               She started from the town of L. in the stage coach; the railroad was not then
                  completed. At Albany she took the canal boat, and traveled through the same places
                  she had four times previously passed. Some of the villages were improved in
                  appearance. Little Helen was delighted with traveling. She arrived at Mr. Judson's
                  at night; they received her cordially. Mary Ann, (now Mrs. Gleason,) appeared less
                  changed than the rest; she had a noble little boy two years younger than Helen.
                  Their eldest son lived in the village, and was still unmarried; he often called
                  there; it appeared to her than there had been less changes there than in other
                  places; it seemed like home. She was told that Sister Burdensome still lived
                  there, as busy as Ever; but Sabra cared not for her; she had not The guilty
                  conscience to annoy or frighten her. She was anxious to see Mr. Gleason, but he
                  was away on business. She found that Mrs. Judson's health was not food, and Mrs.
                  Gleason was not then able to assist her. Sabra endeavored to make herself useful;
                  she did not mention her intentions for some time, but visited among her old
                  friends.
               Sidney Judson accompanied Sabra to the Baptist church, to a prayer meeting one
                  evening; Brother Burdensome was there; he led the meeting; he seemed to be in
                  great distress for the prosperity of the church; he was about to leave them, for a
                  few days, to go to New York to purchase
                  chase goods. One would have supposed, by his prayer, that the burden of the whole
                  church rested upon his shoulders, and that he expected they would backslide if he
                  was absent. On their way home, Sidney asked Sabra if she though him sincere. She
                  replied, that she hoped so. He replied, that he did not believe him; and to
                  remember his word, that he would prove as great a hypocrite as ever entered the
                  church. And truly, not many years after, Brother Burdensome left the church, his
                  family and his creditors, and has not returned. Sister Burdensome had business of
                  her own during the summer that engrossed her attention; she became more willing to
                  let other people alone. She knew, by experience, that it was pleasant to have a
                  friend sit by her bedside, in sickness, and brush away the flies, and after she
                  became able to ride, to bring the carriage to the door, and give he a morning
                  drive; her husband was busy; it was not convenient for him to leave; there could
                  be no remarks made, for her attendant belonged to the same church, and beside all
                  this, she was a Deacon's wife.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVIII.
               SABRA'S SECOND MARRIAGE.
               During the summer, Sabra became acquainted with a gentleman of pleasing manners,
                  who possessed a free, open and generous heart; he was well informed, and very
                  entertaining in conversation, He made no pretention of possessing religion; but in
                  his childhood he had received religious, instruction, which had left a lasting
                  impression upon his mind His parents were professors of religion. Sabra spent many
                  pleasant hours in his company; they often met undesignedly, and he often called at
                  Mr. Judson's. The result of their acquaintance was, that he made her a proposal of
                  marriage.
               Sabra had just received a letter from her dear mother; it was full of tenderness;
                  she addressing her as her only dear daughter. Herbert read the letter, and said,
                  she must have one of the best of mothers, to write like that. She told him that
                  she was only an adopted daughter, that she knew no difference; that she had been
                  taught by her adopted parents never to mention it but that it was her duty to
                  speak of it now, for perhaps it might be an objection to the proposition just
                  made. He replied, that it was herself that he wished for a companion. She told him
                  that her religious sentiments were firm and deeply rooted; that she could not sacrifice any of her
                  religious privileges to please any person. He told her that he should wish her to
                  enjoy them, and that he would endeavor not to retard her in the Christian course.
                  She then told him that she must see her mother, and ask her consent, before she
                  gave him an answer. She went home in September, arranged her business, and
                  consulted her mother.- she thought that she would be more free from annoyance at a
                  distance, and perhaps she would return with her the next time she came to her
                  native homes.
               Before, Sabra returned Fred her twenty-five dollars, and said that his father bad
                  left that for her, in his will. He had receipt ready for her to sign in full, as
                  having received all her portion from his father's estate. She refused to sign it;
                  said she would sign a receipt of having received that amount, as a legacy. She
                  told him he might keep the money; that she could do without it. He handed it back
                  to her, and she signed a receipt according to her proposal. She returned, and
                  married Herbert, but did not give up the idea of teaching; she pursued her studies
                  as usual; she thought she could more easily instruct Helen by teaching others at
                  the same time. But, Alas! how often was called to drink of the bitter cup of
                  affliction.
               Soon after her marriage, she was called to part with her dear, beloved child; God
                  saw fit to take her to Himself; it seemed like giving up a part of herself ; she
                  felt that Helen was her all, and she was her earthly idol; she often felt sure she
                  loved her too well, but how could she help it ; she was a lovely child ; every
                  person loved her. But soon, in this affliction, Sabra recognized the hand of her
                  Heavenly Father, and she submitted with Christian fortitude. How much easier it is
                  for the Christian to submit to the positive will of God, than when the affliction
                  arises from persecuting influence of men and devils!
               During the succeeding summer, she was alone much of the time, and found time to
                  devote herself to her studies. She informed a clergyman, with whom she had long
                  been acquainted, of her intentions; she told him that she had long felt it her
                  duty to instruct the youth. He kindly offered to assist her; he told her that he
                  would soon make fractions as easy and plain to her as ABC; she soon became as
                  familiar with arithmetic as other studies.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIX.
               THE DEATH OF MR. JUDSON.
               One great source of enjoyment still remained; she lived near Mr. and Mrs. Judson,
                  and spent many happy hours with them and their family. But Mr. Judson's health
                  gradually failed, and he Became unable to leave his room. Herbert and Sabra had
                  often watched with him, and he talked Freely to Sabra about dying; told her he
                  esteemed her as one of his own family. One day he sent for her to come and see
                  him; she went immediately. Said he, "I have a particular request for you to
                  perform." He spoke of forty acres of land which he owned and had cultivated; he
                  had been accustomed to ride out to it every day, in some seasons of the year;
                  Sabra had often him, and admired the location of it; it was only two miles from
                  the village, and beautiful land upon either side of the road. The urgent request
                  which he desired of her, was for her to accept a deed of it. She told him that she
                  could not possibly accept it; that she valued the existing friendship of his
                  family more highly than property. He urged his request, by saying that Mrs. Judson
                  would like to remain with her a part of the time, and that she would feel more at
                  home if she accepted the farm. Sabra said that Mrs. Judson would always be welcome
                  to a home with her, whenever she chose to remain there; that the favors they had
                  already conferred upon her would entitle her to that. She begged of him not to
                  bestow any of his property upon her, but let her retain the same position in his
                  family which she had for many years enjoyed.
               After she joined the family circle, she asked them is Mr. Judson's mind was not
                  wandering. They said that he was perfectly sensible; that He had been quite
                  anxious all day to see her. She did not tell them the conversation that had
                  Passes; they supposed it was the subject of religion. After this, Sabra visited
                  him oftener, and As his strength failed, and the world receded, Heaven appeared
                  more and more glorious. In a few days he sank quietly to rest, as calmly as the
                  sun disappears at evening, leaving his friends to mourn their loss, which was, his
                  gain.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XL.
               SABRA COMMENCES TEACHING.
               During the second year after her marriage she was alone much of the time. After
                  the birth of her daughter, Ordelia, she seemed possessed with great energy Her
                  husband was a native of Canada, but had resided in the States for some years; soon
                  after the birth of their child business called him back to spend the season. Sabra
                  chose to remain; and, immediately after be was gone, she made arrangements to
                  commence the task for which she had been so long preparing. She obtained a nurse
                  for her child, and took a room in the house she occupied for her scholars. She
                  round many friends willing to patronize and assist her, She commenced with sixteen
                  scholars, but her number increased rapidly ; she soon had forty-eight ; this was
                  all she could accommodate. She found it a delightful task to teach the young ideas
                  how to shoot. She often enjoyed precious seasons while she bowed daily with her
                  scholars to supplicate the blessings of God to rest up on them, her family and
                  herself. She wrote to her friends, and she informed them how she was employed;
                  they wondered, how she became qualified to teach a school, Samuel said "I always
                  told you that Sabra was ambitious, and would take care of herself. "Ah! they
                  little knew how many midnight hours she had spent over her books, or the joy that
                  thrilled through her soul when she reached out her hand to take her certificate.
                  after having passed a strict examination.
               After having taught more than two years, at intervals, a clergyman inquired of
                  her, why his children made such rapid progress in learning; three of his children
                  had attended her school not quite a year; they had all commenced in A B C, and now
                  they could read any book. She replied that she could easily tell him; they
                  attended regularly, and as soon as they could read, he supplied them with books
                  that they could under- stand; be had a large library, and kept a large supply of
                  books, published by the American Tract Society, which are very entertaining to
                  children. If parents would always supply their children with books that they could
                  understand, they would love to read them, and soon acquire a taste for
                  learning.
               Sabra's health became impaired by constant labor, and symptoms of consumption
                  again appeared; she had a cough, and her lungs were affected. Herbert thought she
                  had better visit her friends, and spend the winter; she did so, and visited at
                  Jason's and Samuel's with, her mother, the whole season. They all seemed pleased
                  to see her, and she enjoyed her visit very much. They all loved little Ordelia;
                  she was a lovely Child. How often, in the still hours of the night, would the sad
                  thought pass through Sabra's mind, that she must go back. Alas! who can tell the
                  depth of sorrow that often filled her
                  heart, when she thought that she must leave her dear mother, in her old age, and
                  return, as if an exile. She would not have desired to have shared their luxuries
                  or to have been surrounded with splendor like theirs. No; she would have been
                  contented with an humble abode, if her companion had been there; and she could
                  have enjoyed their society, for her heart twined tenderly around the whole family,
                  still. Samuel often said that he wished she lived near; but she saw nothing
                  flattering, why she should induce her husband to leave his abode, and come there
                  to live. Mrs. Hudson called her sons wives, and Sabra, her girls; and when they
                  were all together, she would talk of her household property. She had a large
                  quantity of beds and bedding. and rich clothing; she wished them all to share
                  equally; said that they might as well have them divided then, what she did not
                  wish to use; she had a valuable shawl, which she wished to give to Henrietta, as
                  she was the eldest; she had often told her to take it, but she had not taken it.
                  Marina said there was no use in her giving them away, but let them remain as long
                  as she lived; perhaps, she might need them herself. Sabra knew that Samuel and
                  Jason endeavored to make their mother comfortable when she was with them, but her
                  home was at Fred's, and she did not enjoy herself while there; there was always so
                  much to do; there was no time to harness a horse for her, and she might as well go
                  to church with him, as to go, where she had always attended, while her husband was
                  living.
               When Sabra returned, Samuel's eldest daughter Eveline, went home with her, and
                  spent the summer. Sabra loved all her nephews and nieces; they were very kind to
                  her, and she liked to have them with her. There seemed but one abiding consolation
                  for her; this she found in the performance of her religious duties, which brought
                  peace and comfort to her mind.
               Shortly after Eveline went home, Herbert's friends influenced him to go to Canada;
                  they wished him to move his family there; they gave him great encouragement;
                  assured him that he would, be successful in business. They were very comfortable
                  where they were; had a large, comfortable house of their own. Sabra felt sure, to
                  leave their home would be to lose it; but what could she say ; it was the home of
                  Herbert's childhood, and his mother lived there, she knew very well how happy it
                  would cause her to be, to return to the place of her nativity. Herbert said he
                  would go, and stay a few months, and see what his prospects were, before he moved
                  his family there. After this, a professed friend of Herbert's, came to persuade
                  her to leave her comfortable home; he was a member of the Methodist church,
                  agreeable in his manners, rich and influential; he held forth many inducements in
                  favor of their moving, (such as the business man often makes, in order to benefit
                  himself). He told Sabra that she might be assured of good society; that she should
                  have the society and friendship of his family. She knew that this was an
                  inducement, for their reputation was
                  known as influential. She taught her school six months after her husband left,
                  having good success, and visited her future home during the time. She was well
                  pleased with the circle into which she was introduced; still her heart was pained
                  within her, to leave her old friends; there were a thousand ties to bind her
                  there; there was their minister and his family; the church to which they both
                  belonged; the dear children who had attended her school; their convenient house,
                  and finally, the home which they had toiled to obtain; all this she left, and went
                  to Canada, as her future home. She soon found all her early prejudices destroyed,
                  for she loved the people there, and found them very kind; she found, also, to her
                  sorrow, that the same spirit influenced the business men there, in Canada, which
                  existed in other places; simply this, to keep what they possessed, and to get what
                  they could; and there are but very few exceptions to this rule of practice, even
                  among professors of religion; but this is not the gospel rule, which teaches us to
                  do unto others as we would wish them to do by us. There are many benevolent men,
                  who profess to possess the religion of the Gospel, and think they follow their
                  Saviour, who give their hundreds of dollars for popular purposes, and take it
                  wrongfully from the poor.
               After they had lived in Canada more than a year, they visited Sabra's mother for
                  the last time. Sabra soon saw that her mother was failing fast, and that she was
                  depressed in her mind. She spoke freely to Sabra of her trouble; said that her
                  home was not in the right family, or where it should have been. It was true, she
                  had the privilege of staying with Jason, or Samuel, whenever she chose, yet it was
                  not her home. One subject weighed heavily upon her mind; she had felt it her duty
                  to be baptised by immersion, and to unite with the church where she had always
                  attended worship, when her husband was living. Fred had persuaded her to go with
                  him; he told her that there was no use in harnessing a horse for her, when she
                  could hear just as good preaching; that her minister did not visit her. She
                  yielded to his request, in this case, as she had in all others. She said if she
                  could enjoy the privilege of conversing with Mrs. Heulet as she formerly had, it
                  would be a great comfort; but they were watched narrowly; if Mrs. Heulet came
                  there to see her, Marina would always be present—and so glad to see her; if she
                  went to see Mrs. Heulet, Marina would go, too, saying, that it was not prudent for
                  her to be left alone. She told Sabra that she was afraid she should be deprived of
                  her reason, by being disappointed in every thing; but one thing remained sure; she
                  had provided for Jason, and for her, and she hoped that they would attend to it,
                  after her death. Sabra begged her not to have any trouble on her account; she
                  could take care of herself; she encouraged her to hope for future happiness beyond
                  this vale of tears.
               When they returned, Jason's eldest daughter, Hatty, went home with them. She was
                  much attached to Sabra, and a mutual friendship always ways existed between them. No person surmised that
                  Sabra was not her own dear Aunt. When Sabra's second daughter was born, many
                  exclaimed: How much she looks like Hatty!" and she was named after her,
                  immediately. Hatty was a dear good girl; she loved her grandma, and many a long
                  talk would Sabra and Hatty have about her. She remained nearly a year, and then
                  returned, leaving her Aunt to mourn her absence.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLI.
               MRS. HUDSON'S DEATH, AND SAMUEL'S VISIT TO CANADA.
               Soon after Hatty returned, she wrote to her Aunt, informing her that what they had
                  feared was actually the case; her grandma was deprived of her reason, and so much
                  deranged that it often became necessary to confine her; she did not know her
                  children ; that Samuel would often try to have her recognize him as her youngest,
                  or her babe, as she once called him, but she would sneer at him; saying that he
                  need not say that to her, for he was not her child; that she had no children
                  there. Oh, how bitterly did Sabra mourn for her mother; she could not see her,
                  neither could she desire to, if she could not be recognized by her. She remained
                  in this distressing condition for a few months, when death ended the sufferings of
                  one of the kindest and most indulgent mothers ever known; an affectionate and
                  loving wife; a kind and obliging neighbor, a faithful friend, an humble, devoted
                  Christian. She had but one visible error; she allowed her children to govern her.
                  This great mistake caused unhappiness in the whole family circle.
               Grievously did Sabra mourn for the death of her dear mother; but she was far, far
                  away, and would not hear the particulars respecting her sickness or death. Samuel
                  had become rich, and thought he would travel. The death of his mother had left a
                  deep impression upon his mind. He thought he would go to Canada, and see Sabra; he
                  arrived there quite unexpectedly; Sabra had been thinking of him all the morning,
                  for she had been making succotash for dinner; she had often prepared it for him
                  before her marriage. She was overjoyed to see him; her first thoughts were, she
                  could hear all about her mother's sickness and death. After dinner, she began to
                  ask him questions about her; but, Alas! his answer. He said: "Yes; mother is dead,
                  and gone; but I do not wish you to ask me any questions about her, for I do not
                  wish to think of her; she has gone where she is free from trouble." As soon as
                  Sabra could leave the room, she found a place to weep, and pray. "Oh," thought
                  she, "and he will not tell me about my best friend; he does not wish to think
                  about his dear mother. If I could have been permitted to have rocked for her the cradle of declining
                  life, she might have ended her days peacefully, with a bright prospect of
                  Heaven."
               Samuel liked Herbert; he thought he had good talents for business. After they had
                  returned from church, on the Sabbath, Samuel and Herbert were talking of
                  opportunities for making money; men of business will often do this, if they do
                  profess religion. Herbert spoke of a great water privilege, about thirty miles
                  distant, which could be bought cheap; it was surrounded with standing timber which
                  would make good, lumber. Samuel said: "That is just the place for you; you can saw
                  the lumber and ship it to our market, and we can make a fortune; let us see Mr.
                  C., (he was their nearest neighbor,) and see what he says?" Mr. C. knew all about
                  it, and had talked about purchasing it himself. They went to Mr. C.; he
                  recommended it highly. It was decided that they would go and see it the next
                  day.
               As soon as Sabra saw Herbert alone she told him not to accept any partnership or
                  help from Samuel; he had undertaken to help her, once, and that was all she
                  desired. If he chose to give them money, she would accept it thankfully, but she
                  wished not to be connected in business with him! Again. She had never told him
                  before, of their ill luck while in business with him, or of the many sleepless
                  nights she had worked, to pay the debt they owed him when they closed their
                  business. She knew that he was rich, in railroad stock and bank stock; that he
                  could boast of giving one thousand dollars toward building the church and owned
                  two shares in the church organ, besides giving fifty dollars at a time to the
                  Missionary Society, but she did not ask his assistance. Before they started, in
                  the morning, Sabra informed Samuel, plainly, that whatever arrangement they might
                  make, that she would never go there to live. Samuel said: "Why not? It is just the
                  place to make money." She said, she intended to live where her children could
                  attend school; she valued an education more highly than money; that there was no
                  road to that place; that it laid upon the Rideau Lake; that it was accessible only
                  by boats or on foot; if he chose to move his family there, she was willing; he had
                  but two daughters; one married, and the other old enough to attend a boarding
                  school; her children were young, and she should not go. This assertion put a
                  damper upon all his calculations; but they went to see it, but did not purchase
                  it. He became acquainted with the family that lived there; the lady of the house
                  took great care to entertain them; she was acquainted with Sabra, and said to
                  Samuel, she wished that he had brought his sister out with him; that she esteemed
                  her highly. "Yes, said Samuel, "she is a very amiable person, well calculated to
                  get along, bring up her family well." but feeling a little chagrined at the
                  difference in their worldly prospects, he said, "She is only my adopted sister!"
                  This surprised the lady very much; she inquired if Hatty was not Sabra's niece. He
                  replied: "She is my niece, but not
                  Sabra's own niece." She had often remarked, how much little Hatty looked like her
                  cousin. This lady merely mentioned it to two or three persons, but it spread like
                  fire in the prairies, and it became tea-table talk; some had it that Mr. Hudson
                  was Sabra's adopted brother, and others declared it otherwise. No person mentioned
                  it to Sabra, for nearly a year, when, Mrs. Inquisitive thought she would ask Sabra
                  which of the two persons was the adopted child. Sabra told her that it was
                  herself. She quietly dropped her spectacles back upon her nose, and said: "It
                  beats me; why, how it is that you have the best education? Why didn't you tell
                  me?" Sabra said that her mother had often told her not to mention it, for that she
                  was her only dear mama.
               Samuel returned home, without urging them to go to the back woods to live; but he
                  urged them to visit them; said Ordelia might come there and go to school, if they
                  chose to send her. A year and a half after, Herbert and Sabra visited again the
                  home of her childhood. They went to Jason's first; there she heard the particulars
                  of her mother's sickness and death; it was even more painful than she had
                  imagined. They spoke of her will; she had told them of it; there had been nothing
                  said concerning it since her death. Fred had complained that his task had been
                  greater than any other member of the family. They concluded that Fred might have
                  all he could get, and they would not look for the will. Marina had taken the
                  shawl, and wore it first to their mother's funeral; she never said any thing to
                  Henrietta. When Marina put the shawl over her shoulders, the day of the funeral,
                  Willie's wife said: "I thought grandma gave that shawl Aunt Henrietta." Jason said
                  he would like know what they would give Sabra; he, supposed she would receive her
                  portion while at Fred's. She replied, that she would inform them after her return,
                  what they gave her.
               They next went to Samuel's; he had built an elegant house, and was surrounded with
                  luxuries of every kind. They enjoyed their visit exceedingly. Asenath was the same
                  kind sister that she had been in former years. When they went to Fred's, Samuel
                  and his wife and daughters went with them. Sabra thought them very kind, for she
                  thought it would be very lonesome there without her mother. They all appeared very
                  cheerful and happy; but Sabra's heart was full sorrow; it was here her dear mother
                  had suffered and died. She stole away, and walked a mile and a half, to her
                  mother's grave; there the tears could flow unrestrained; when she returned, she
                  felt more reconciled. Marina was very pious; they could hear her voice, up stairs,
                  engaged in secret prayer, nearly as loud as when the Prophets of Baal called upon
                  their God; Sabra wondered if she was sincere. They stayed two nights; they were
                  sleepless ones to her. The home of her childhood, where she had spent her happiest
                  hours; the peach trees, which had grown from the peach she had panted with her own
                  hand, when young, seemed to wave its heavy vy branches, mournfully. There was the tree under
                  which she had made her little play house, but now, the noise created by the wind,
                  among its branches, seemed to howl a requiem for the dead. Sabra did, not covet
                  their possessions; she looked forward to a glorious home, where she should meet
                  her parents with joy; she loved to think of them, she had no remorse of
                  conscience; even her dreams of them were delightful.
               A short time before they left, Sabra was in the hall arranging her trunk; Marina
                  hastened to her, bringing two cups and saucers; said she to Sabra: "I thought you
                  would like these; you have often drank tea from them with mother; they are
                  cracked, but I thought you would like them, if they were old." Sabra took them
                  kindly, her eyes filled with tears, while Marina tripped off, singing merrily; she
                  packed them carefully away in her trunk, that they might not be broken; it was all
                  she had given her, and she would keep them choicely. Marina returned to her,
                  singing as usual, saying, "I have brought you this silver plate; it was on
                  mother's coffin; it is of no use to us; I will give it to you; perhaps you would
                  like to keep it; we thought there was no use to have it buried. Sabra took it
                  thankfully, but she thought it strange that they removed it from the coffin. 'Ah!"
                  thought Sabra "how can she speak so unfeeling of one of the best of mothers." Her
                  gifts reminded her of Mariana's visit at her brother Jason's; she had been out
                  shopping, and she purchased a paper of lozenges, for which she paid three pence;
                  she married them to the house, and this Christian philanthropist gave them all to
                  her niece, saying, "It is more blessed to give than to receive," but before she
                  went away, she asked her niece for a few of them to carry to her mother Bronson,
                  for she was going to visit her before she returned.
               As Sabra journeyed toward her humble home, her mind was occupied with various
                  subjects. Many of the ties which bound her so strongly to her native home were
                  sundered; she thought if she only arrived at home safely, and was permitted again
                  to embrace her children, little Herbert, he was the youngest, a dear little boy,
                  if she could find them all in the enjoyment of health, she should be willing to
                  toil for them, and never be discontented. She had often read, over and over, the
                  letters on Palestine, in the Olive Branch, and desired to know who wrote them; she
                  had been informed that it was a dear and near relative of her own, and she was
                  anxious to get home and find the papers, and read them again, for she always kept
                  these papers laid by, after they were read; it proved to her a weekly epistle to
                  cheer her lonely hours.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLII.
               .
               We were passing through the western Province of Canada, and we thought we would
                  visit our old friend Sabra. We found her teaching a school, which numbered upward
                  of fifty scholars. I learned many interesting facts, which might have been written
                  in this manuscript, but we will notice only a few of them.
               Sabra informed me that she had received a visit from Mr. and Mrs. Heulet, the old
                  friends of her youth; that she had the privilege of hearing his voice in prayer,
                  even in Canada. Another fact I learned, that she was a member of the church
                  visible, and trying to live according to her professions, and endeavoring to make
                  herself useful in various ways. She also gave me an extract of a letter from her
                  brother Samuel, written to her husband. It reads as follows:
               I am sorry to hear that you have not succeeded in your business, as you expected;
                  but it is only one of the disappointments that flesh is heir to; I also thought my
                  mountain stood strong, in respect to this world, when I was at your place, but a
                  great share of it has fled; I have lost about eighty thousand dollars, and I
                  sometimes get low spirited; but we have much to to be thankful for, yet; our
                  children are spared; we would not spare one of them for all worldly
                  prosperity."
               "Ah! Said Sabra, "what a blessed privilege would it be to the professor of
                  religion, if the Bible taught not the doctrine of restitution!" But, Alas! For
                  multitudes, it is found in Holy Writ, in many places. Sabra informed me that she
                  often mourned over her unfaithfulness; yet she had a firm, unshaken confidence in
                  God, and a hope of Heaven, which was like an anchor to her soul, sure and
                  steadfast; this hope enabled her to be cheerful in all the changing vicissitudes
                  of life; in adversity, as well as prosperity, she could repair to the throne of
                  grace, and Abba, Father, cry, assured that all would eventually be well with
                  her.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLIII.
               SABRA'S LETTER TO HER ELDEST DAUGHTER
               We also visited Ordelia, Sabra's eldest daughter; we obtained from her a letter,
                  written by her mother, and given to her when she left home to attend a boarding
                  school. We insert it here, for our closing chapter; it may be the language of many
                  a pious mother:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              MY DEAR ORDELIA—MY ELDEST DAUGHTER:
                           
                           You are about to leave your parental home, that you may more
                              effectually climb the hill of science; you may continually be
                              ascending, but you cannot reach the top. No person ever obtained the
                              summit of knowledge; we only commence, in this world, what eternity
                              may finish. It has always been our aim to have you acquire an
                              education; yet I feel more anxious for your moral and religious
                              culture; no toil has been spared by your mother, to teach you, in
                              childhood, the duty you owe to your Maker and Preserver, and to your
                              fellow beings. Be kind and affable to all; be particularly respectful
                              to the aged and infirm; treat them as your superiors; always choose
                              the virtuous and the good, for your associates; never countenance
                              vice. Never circulate an evil report; remember, if you repeat a
                              falsehood, you give credit to the same. Always ways be willing to help
                              build up the character of the poor and virtuous. If you acquire an
                              education, and make a right use of it, you will treat all with
                              respect. Should you gain the estimation of those who are wealthy,
                              never, on this account, slight an old friend, if they are poor. I have
                              seen young ladies, (I should have said girls,) return home from
                              boarding school, who had only been there three months; their old
                              associates have counted the days before their arrival, and longed to
                              greet them; but, judge their disappointment, when they met, they could
                              scarcely be recognized. Think not that such conduct is commendable;
                              they only make themselves a subject of ridicule. If you are slighted,
                              never notice it; a trifling slight often becomes an injury by
                              pondering upon it. You have attended the Sabbath school, from your
                              childhood; endeavor to profit by the instruction you have there
                              received. You have recited a large portion of the Holy Scriptures; if
                              possible, read a chapter every day; 'tis God's own word, which he has
                              given, to teach your soul the way to Heaven; remember that they may
                              all be summed up, in a few verses: Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God,
                              with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind; and
                              thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself; therefore, all things
                              whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them;
                              and the conclusion of the whole is this: Fear God, and keep His
                              commandments; attend church regularly, and listen attentively to the
                              public administration of
                              God's word. Seek to obtain the saving, regenerating grace of God.
                              Never let the imperfections of professors of religion hinder you from
                              becoming a Christian; the very fact that you know they are wrong, may
                              rise up to condemn you, at the last, day, for having known your
                              heavenly Father's will, and having neglected to perform it. It is to
                              be feared that many will approach so near the track which leads to
                              glory, that the car of salvation will pass over them and literally
                              grind them to powder. Life is a mixture of joy and sorrow, smiles and
                              tears, disappointments, crosses, bereavements, grief and pain, finally
                              death; but remember that you were created for a high and noble
                              purpose; God has provided a higher, holier and happier home for us, if
                              we are prepared by his pardoning mercy, and sanctifying grace; He has
                              invited us to mingle with the bright intelligences of saints and
                              angels, who continually surround the throne, and the capacities of
                              your soul, for enjoyment, will continue to enlarge, while you
                              contemplate His wonderful works, His glorious attributes, His infinite
                              perceptions; and when you drop this body of clay, your nobler
                              faculties will be illumined with the blazing lustre of glory, and your
                              soul filled with the fullness of God; you will there find flowers that
                              never fade, and fruit that never decays. Remember, you were a peculiar
                              blessing to me in the time of affliction, sent to claim the affection
                              once bestowed upon those whom God took to himself; the wounded heart
                              of your Mother had scarcely time to heal, ere it would be called to
                              break forth with sorrow, by the removal of one dear relative after
                              another. The year previous to your birth, I was called to part with my
                              only, beloved child; the vacancy which her death caused, was never
                              filled, until I received you, as it were, in her place; I loved you
                              tenderly, and have endeavored to guard you from temptation. Being
                              deprived of wealth, I have toiled to bring you up respectably, and
                              give you an education; thus far, you have rewarded me, by the progress
                              you have made, by your kindness and fidelity; I desire that you may
                              continue to improve your time faithfully in future. There is one
                              request that I wish to make of you: that you would always continue to
                              have a watchful care over your little brother and sister; they are
                              much younger than yourself, and may not enjoy a mother's protection as
                              long as you have; try to guard them as you have been; show them the
                              kindness which you received; and try, if possible, to help them to
                              acquire an education. Take this letter with you to your school; keep
                              it laid by safely, and occasionally read it, remembering that it is
                              accompanied by the prayer of your
                           
                              AFFECTIONATE MOTHER.
