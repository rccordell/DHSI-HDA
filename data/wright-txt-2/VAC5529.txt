            PREFACE.
            IN presenting this work to the public, we are fully conscious of the grave charges of
               misrepresenting society, and misconstruing facts, which will be made by our friends
               of the South, and its very peculiar institution; but earnestly do we enjoin all such
               champions of "things as they are," to read and well digest what is here set before
               them, believing that they will find the TRUTH even "stranger than fiction." And, as
               an incentive to the noble exertions of those, either North or South, who would rid
               our country of its "darkest, foulest blot," we would say, that our attempt has been
               to give a true picture of Southern society in its various aspects, and that, in our
               judgment, the institution of Slavery is directly chargeable with the various moral,
               social and political evils detailed in OUR WORLD.

               CHAPTER I
               MARSTON'S PLANTATION.
               ON the left bank of the Ashly River, in the State of South Carolina, and a few
                  miles from its principal city, is a plantation once the property of Hugh Marston.
                  It was near this spot, the brave Huguenots, fleeing religious and political
                  persecution, founded their first American colony—invoked Heaven to guard their
                  liberties—sought a refuge in a new world! And it was here the pious Huguenot
                  forgot his appeals to high heaven—forgot what had driven him from his fatherland,
                  and—unlike the pilgrim fathers who planted their standard on "New England's happy
                  shore,"—became the first to oppress. It was here, against a fierce tyranny, the
                  gallant Yamassee,* loyal to his professed friend, struggled and died
                  for his liberty. It was here the last remnant of his tribe fought the fierce
                  battle of right over might! It was here, in this domain, destined to be the great
                  and powerful of nations—the asylum of an old world's shelter seeking poor, and the
                  proud embodiment of a people's sovereignty,—liberty was first betrayed! It was
                  here men deceived themselves, and freedom proclaimers became freedom destroyers.
                  And, too, it was here Spanish cupidity, murderous in its search for gold, turned a
                  deaf ear to humanity's cries, slaughtered the friendly Indian, and drenched the
                  soil with his innocent blood. And it is here, at this moment, slavery—fierce 
                     *A tribe of faithful and heroic Indians.
                  
                   monster, threatening the peace of a happy
                  people—runs riot in all its savage vicissitudes, denying man his commonest
                  birthright.
               If history did but record the barbarous scenes yet enacted on the banks of this
                  lovely stream, the contrast with its calm surface sweeping gently onward to mingle
                  its waters with the great deep, would be strange indeed. How mellowed by the calm
                  beauty of a summer evening, the one!—how stained with scenes of misery, torment,
                  and death, the other!
               Let us beg the reader to follow us back to the time when Marston is found in
                  possession of the plantation, and view it as it is when his friends gather round
                  him to enjoy his bounteous hospitality.
               We have ascended the Ashly on a bright spring morning, and are at a jut covered
                  with dark jungle, where the river, about twenty rods wide, sweeps slowly round
                  ;—flowering brakes, waving their tops to and fro in the breeze, bedeck the river
                  banks, and far in the distance, on the left, opens the broad area of the
                  plantation. As we near it, a beautifully undulating slope presents itself, bounded
                  on its upper edge by a long line of sombre-looking pines. Again we emerge beneath
                  clustering foliage overhanging the river; and from out this—sovereign of a
                  southern clime—the wild azalia and fair magnolia diffuse their fragrance to
                  perfume the air. From the pine ridge the slope recedes till it reaches a line of
                  jungle, or hedge, that separates it from the marshy bottom, extending to the
                  river, against which it is protected by a dyke. Most of the slope is under a high
                  state of cultivation, and on its upper edge is a newly cleared patch of ground,
                  which negroes are preparing for the cotton-seed.
               Smoking piles burn here and there, burned stumps and trees point their black peaks
                  upward in the murky atmosphere, half-clad negroes in coarse osnaburgs are busy
                  among the smoke and fire: the scene presents a smouldering volcano inhabited by
                  semi-devils. Among the sombre denizens are women, their only clothing being
                  osnaburg frocks, made loose at the neck and tied about the waist with a string:
                  with hoes they work upon the "top surface," gather charred wood into piles, and
                  waddle along as if time were a drug upon life.
               Far away to the right the young corn shoots its green sprouts in a square plat,
                  where a few negroes are quietly engaged at the first hoeing. Being tasked, they
                  work with system, and expect, if they never receive, a share of the fruits. All
                  love and respect Marston, for he is generous and kind to them; but system in
                  business is at variance with his nature. His overseer, however, is just the
                  reverse: he is a sharp fellow, has an unbending will, is proud of his office, and
                  has long been reckoned among the very best in the county. Full well he knows what
                  sort of negro makes the best driver; and where nature is ignorant of itself, the
                  accomplishment is valuable. That he watches Marston's welfare, no one doubts; that
                  he never forgets his own, is equally certain. From near mid-distance of the slope
                  we see him approaching on a bay-coloured horse. The sun's rays are fiercely hot,
                  and, though his features are browned and haggard, he holds a huge umbrella in one
                  hand and the inseparable whip in the other. The former is his protector; the
                  latter, his sceptre. John Ryan, for such is his name, is a tall, athletic man,
                  whose very look excites terror. Some say he was born in Limerick, on the Emerald
                  Isle, and only left it because his proud spirit would not succumb to the unbending
                  rod England held over his poor bleeding country.
               Running along the centre of the slope is a line of cotton-fields, in which the
                  young plants, sickly in spots, have reached a stage when they require much
                  nursing. Among them are men, women, and children, crouched on the ground like so
                  many sable spectres, picking and pulling at the roots to give them strength. John
                  Ryan has been keeping a sharp eye on them. He will salute you with an air of
                  independence, tell you how he hated oppression and loved freedom, and how, at the
                  present day, he is a great democrat. Now, whether John left his country for his
                  country's good, is a question; but certain it is he dearly delights to ply the
                  lash,—to whip mankind merely for amusement's sake. In a word, John has a good
                  Irish heart within him, and he always lays particular emphasis on the
                     good, when he tells us of its qualities; but let us rather charge
                  to the State that spare use he makes of its gentler parts.
               John Ryan, his face indicating tyranny stereotyped, has just been placing drivers over each gang of
                  workmen. How careful he was to select a trustworthy negro, whose vanity he has
                  excited, and who views his position as dearly important. Our driver not
                  unfrequently is the monster tyrant of his circle; but whether from inclination to
                  serve the interests of his master, or a knowledge of the fierce system that holds
                  him alike abject, we know not. At times he is more than obedient to his master's
                  will.
               Excuse, reader, this distant view of the plantation at early spring, and follow us
                  back to the Ashly. Here we will still continue along the river-bank, pass borders
                  of thick jungle, flowering vines, and rows of stately pines, their tops moaning in
                  the wind,—and soon find we have reached Marston's landing. This is situated at the
                  termination of an elevated plat extending from thence to the mansion, nearly a
                  mile distant. Three negroes lay basking on the bank; they were sent to wait our
                  coming. Tonio! Murel! Pompe!—they ejaculate, calling one another, as we surprise
                  them. They are cheerful and polite, are dressed in striped shirts and trousers,
                  receive us with great suavity of manner, present master's compliments, tell us
                  with an air of welcome that master will be "right glad" to see us, and conclude by
                  making sundry inquiries about our passage and our "Missuses." Pompe, the "most
                  important nigger" of the three, expresses great solicitude lest we get our feet in
                  the mud. Black as Afric's purest, and with a face of great good nature, Pompe, in
                  curious jargon, apologises for the bad state of the landing, tells us he often
                  reminds Mas'r how necessary it is to have it look genteel. Pompe, more than
                  master, is deeply concerned lest the dignity of the plantation suffer.
               Planks and slabs are lain from the water's edge to the high ground on the ridge,
                  upon which we ascend to the crown, a piece of natural soil rising into a beautiful
                  convex of about six rods wide, extending to the garden gate. We wend our way to
                  the mansion, leaving Pompe and his assistants in charge of our luggage, which they
                  will see safely landed. The ridge forms a level walk, sequestered by long lines of
                  huge oaks, their massive branches forming an arch of foliage, with long trailing
                  moss hanging like mourning drapery to enhance its rural beauty. At the extreme of
                  this festooned walk the mansion is seen dwindling into an almost imperceptible
                  perspective. There is something grand and impressive in the still arch above
                  us—something which revives our sense of the beauty of nature. Through the trunks
                  of the trees, on our right and left, extensive rice fields are seen stretching far
                  into the distance. The young blades are shooting above the surface of the water,
                  giving it the appearance of a frozen sheet clothed with green, and protected from
                  the river by a serpentine embankment. How beautiful the expanse viewed from
                  beneath these hoary-headed oaks!
               On the surface and along the banks of the river aligators are sporting; moccason
                  snakes twist their way along, and scouring kingfishers croak in the balmy air. If
                  a venerable rattlesnake warn us we need not fear—being an honourable snake
                  partaking of the old southerner's affected chivalry;—he will not approach
                  disguised;—no! he will politely give us warning. But we have emerged from the
                  mossy walk and reached a slab fence, dilapidated and broken, which encloses an
                  area of an acre of ground, in the centre of which stands the mansion: the area
                  seems to have been a garden, which, in former days, may have been cultivated with
                  great care. At present it only presents a few beds rank with weeds. We are told
                  the gardener has been dismissed in consideration of his more lucrative services in
                  the corn-field. That the place is not entirely neglected, we have only to add that
                  Marston's hogs are exercising an independent right to till the soil according to
                  their own system. The mansion is a quadrangular building, about sixty feet long by
                  fifty wide, built of wood, two stories high, having upper and lower verandas.
               We pass the dilapidated gate, and reach it by a narrow passage through the garden,
                  on each side of which is a piece of antique statuary, broken and defaced. Entering
                  the lower veranda, we pace the quadrangle, viewing innumerable cuttings and
                  carvings upon the posts: they are initials and full names, cut to please the
                  vanity of those anxious to leave the Marston family a memento. Again we arrive at
                  the back of the mansion where the quadrangle opens a courtyard filled with broken
                  vines, blackened cedars, and venerable-looking leaks;—they were once much valued
                  by the ancient and very respectable Marston family. A few yards from the left wing
                  of the mansion are the "yard
                  houses"—little, comely cabins, about twelve feet by twenty, and proportionately
                  high. One is the kitchen: it has a dingy look, the smoke issuing from its chinks
                  regardless of the chimney; while from its door, sable denizens, ragged and greasy,
                  and straining their curious faces, issue forth. The polished black cook, with her
                  ample figure, is foaming with excitement, lest the feast she is preparing for
                  master's guests may fail to sustain her celebrity. Conspicuous among these cabins
                  are two presenting a much neater appearance: they are brightly whitewashed, and
                  the little windows are decorated with flowering plants. Within them there is an
                  air of simple neatness and freshness we have seldom seen surpassed; the meagre
                  furniture seems to have been arranged by some careful hand, and presents an air of
                  cheerfulness in strange contrast with the dingy cabins around. In each there is a
                  neatly arranged bed, spread over with a white cover, and by its side a piece of
                  soft carpet. It is from these we shall draw forth the principal characters of our
                  story.
               Upon a brick foundation, about twenty rods from the right wing of the mansion,
                  stands a wood cottage, occupied by the overseer. Mr. John Ryan not being blessed
                  with family, when Marston is not honoured with company takes his meals at the
                  mansion. In the distance, to the left, is seen a long line of humble huts,
                  standing upon piles, and occupied by promiscuous negro families:—we say
                  promiscuous, for the marriage-tie is of little value to the master, nor does it
                  give forth specific claim to parentage. The sable occupants are beings of
                  uncertainty; their toil is for a life-time—a weary waste of hope and
                  disappointment. Yes! their dreary life is a heritage, the conditions of which no
                  man would share willingly. Victors of husbandry, they share not of the spoils; nor
                  is the sweat of their brows repaid with justice.
               Near these cabins, mere specks in the distance, are two large sheds, under which
                  are primitive mills, wherein negroes grind corn for their humble meal. Returning
                  from the field at night, hungry and fatigued, he who gets a turn at the mill first
                  is the luckiest fellow. Now that the workpeople are busily engaged on the
                  plantation, the cabins are in charge of two nurses, matronly-looking old bodies,
                  who are vainly endeavouring to keep in order numerous growing specimens of the
                  race too young to destroy a grub at the root of a cotton plant. The task is indeed
                  a difficult one, they being as unruly as an excited Congress. They gambol round
                  the door, make pert faces at old mamma, and seem as happy as snakes in the spring
                  sun. Some are in a nude state, others have bits of frocks covering hapless
                  portions of their bodies; they are imps of mischief personified, yet our heart
                  bounds with sympathy for them. Alive with comicality, they move us, almost
                  unconsciously, to fondle them. And yet we know not why we would fondle the sable
                  "rascals." One knot is larking on the grass, running, toddling, yelling, and
                  hooting; another, ankle-deep in mud, clench together and roll among the ducks,
                  work their clawy fingers through the tufts of each other's crispy hair, and enjoy
                  their childish sports with an air of genial happiness; while a third sit in a
                  circle beside an oak tree, playing with "Dash," whose tail they pull without
                  stint. "Dash" is the faithful and favourite dog; he rather likes a saucy young
                  "nigger," and, while feeling himself equal to the very best in the clan, will
                  permit the small fry, without resenting the injury, to pull his tail.
               It being "ration day," we must describe the serving, that being an interesting
                  phase of plantation life. Negroes have gathered into motley groups around two
                  weatherbeaten store-houses—the overseer has retired to his apartment—when they
                  wait the signal from the head driver, who figures as master of ceremonies. One
                  sings:— 
                     
                        "Jim Crack corn, an' I don't care,
                        Fo'h mas'r's gone away! way! way!"
                     
                   Another is croaking over the time he saved on his task, a third is trying to
                  play a trick with the driver (come the possum over him), and a third unfolds the
                  scheme by which the extra for whiskey and molasses was raised.
                  Presenting a sable pot pourri, they jibber and
                  croak among themselves, laugh and whistle, go through the antics of the
                  "break-down" dance, make the very air echo with the music of their
                  incomprehensible jargon. We are well nigh deafened by it, and yet it excites our
                  joy. We are amused and instructed; we laugh because they laugh, our feelings
                  vibrate with theirs, their quaint humour forces itself into our very soul, and our
                  sympathy glows with their happy
                  anticipations. The philosophy of their jargon is catching to our senses; we listen
                  that we may know their natures, and learn good from their simplicity. He is a
                  strange mortal who cannot learn something from a fool!
               The happy moment has arrived: "Ho, boys!" is sounded,—the doors open, the negroes
                  stop their antics and their jargon; stores are exposed, and with one dinning
                  mutter all press into a half-circle at the doors, in one of which stands the huge
                  figure of Balam, the head driver. He gives a scanning look at the circle of
                  anxious faces; he would have us think the importance of the plantation centred in
                  his glowing black face. There he stands—a measure in his hand—while another
                  driver, with an air of less dignity, cries out, with a stentorian voice, the names
                  of the heads of families, and the number of children belonging thereto. Thus, one
                  by one, the name being announced in muddled accents, they step forward, and
                  receive their corn, or rice, as may be. In pans and pails they receive it, pass it
                  to the younger members of the family; with running and scampering, they carry the
                  coarse allotment to their cabin with seeming cheerfulness. Marston, esteemed a
                  good master, always gives bacon, and to receive this the negroes will gather round
                  the store a second time. In this, the all-fascinating bacon is concealed, for
                  which the children evince more concern; their eyes begin to shine brighter, their
                  watchfulness becomes more intent. Presently a negro begins to withdraw the meat,
                  and as he commences action the jargon gets louder, until we are deafened, and
                  would fain move beyond it. Just then, the important driver, with hand extended,
                  commands,—"Order!" at the very top of his loud voice. All is again still; the man
                  returns to his duty. The meat is somewhat oily and rancid, but Balam cuts it as if
                  it were choice and scarce. Another driver weighs it in a pair of scales he holds
                  in his hands; while still another, cutting the same as before, throws it upon some
                  chaff at the door, as if it were a bone thrown to a hungry dog. How humbly the
                  recipient picks it up and carries it to his or her cabin! Not unfrequently the
                  young "imps" will scramble for it, string it upon skewers, and with great
                  nonchalance throw it over their shoulders, and walk off. If it bathe their backs
                  with grease so much more the comfort. Those little necessaries which add so much
                  to the negro's comfort, and of which he is so fond, must be purchased with the
                  result of his extra energy. Even this allowance may serve the boasted hospitality;
                  but the impression that there is a pennyworth of generosity for every pound of
                  parsimony, forces itself upon us. On his little spot, by moonlight or starlight,
                  the negro must cultivate for himself, that his family may enjoy a few of those
                  fruits of which master has many. How miserable is the man without a spark of
                  generosity in his soul; and how much more miserable the man who will not return
                  good for good's worth! To the negro, kindness is a mite inspiring the impulses of
                  a simple heart, and bringing forth great good.
               Let us again beg the reader to return with us to those conspicuous cottages near
                  the court-yard, and in which we will find several of our characters.
               We cross the threshold of one, and are accosted by a female who, speaking in
                  musical accents, invites us to sit down. She has none of Afric's blood in her
                  veins;—no! her features are beautifully olive, and the intonation of her voice
                  discovers a different origin. Her figure is tall and well-formed; she has
                  delicately-formed hands and feet, long, tapering fingers, well-rounded limbs, and
                  an oval face, shaded with melancholy. How reserved she seems, and yet how quickly
                  she moves her graceful figure! Now she places her right hand upon her
                  finely-arched forehead, parts the heavy folds of glossy hair that hang carelessly
                  over her brown shoulders, and with a half-suppressed smile answers our salutation.
                  We are welcome in her humble cabin; but her dark, languishing eyes, so full of
                  intensity, watch us with irresistible suspicion. They are the symbols of her
                  inward soul; they speak through that melancholy pervading her countenance! The
                  deep purple of her cheek is softened by it, while it adds to her face that calm
                  beauty which moves the gentle of our nature. How like a woman born to fill a
                  loftier sphere than that to which a cruel law subjects her, she seems!
               Neither a field nor a house servant, the uninitiated may be at a loss to know what
                  sphere on the plantation is her's? She is the mother of Annette, a little girl of
                  remarkable beauty, sitting at her side, playing with her left hand. Annette is
                  fair, has light auburn hair—not the first tinge of her mother's olive invades her features. Her little
                  cheerful face is lit up with a smile, and while toying with the rings on her
                  mother's fingers, asks questions that person does not seem inclined to answer.
                  Vivacious and sprightly, she chatters and lisps until we become eager for her
                  history. "It's only a child's history," some would say. But the mother displays so
                  much fondness for it; and yet we become more and more excited by the strange
                  manner in which she tries to suppress an outward display of her feelings. At times
                  she pats it gently on the head, runs her hands through its hair, and twists the
                  ends into tiny ringlets.
               In the next cabin we meet the shortish figure of a tawny female, whose Indian
                  features stand boldly out. Her high cheek bones, long glossy black hair, and
                  flashing eyes, are the indexes of her pedigree. "My master says I am a slave:" in
                  broken accents she answers our question. As she sits in her chair near the
                  fire-place of bricks, a male issue of the mixed blood toddles round and round her,
                  tossing her long coarse hair every time he makes a 
                     circut
                     circuit
                  . The little boy is much fairer than the brawny daughter who seems his
                  mother. Playful, and even mischievous, he delights in pulling the hair which curls
                  over his head; and when the woman calls him he answers with a childish
                  heedlessness, and runs for the door. Reader! this woman's name is Ellen Juvarna;
                  she has youth on her side, and though she retains the name of her ancient sire, is
                  proud of being master's mistress. She tells us how comfortable she is; how
                  Nicholas, for such is his name, resembles his father, how he loves him, but how he
                  fails to acknowledge him. A feud, with its consequences, is kept up between the
                  two cabins; and while she makes many insinuations about her rival, tells us she
                  knows her features have few charms. Meanwhile, she assures us that neither good
                  looks nor sweet smiles make good mothers. "Nicholas!" she exclaims, "come here;
                  the gentlemen want to know all about papa." And, as she extends her hand, the
                  child answers the summons, runs across the room, fondles his head in his mother's
                  lap,—seems ashamed!
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               HOW A NIGHT WAS SPENT ON MARSTON'S PLANTATION.
               EARTH is mantled with richest verdure; far away to the west and south of the
                  mansion the scene stretches out in calm grandeur. The sun sinks beneath glowing
                  clouds that crimson the horizon and spread refulgent shadows on the distant hills,
                  as darkness slowly steals its way on the mellow landscape.
               Motley groups of negroes are returned from the field, fires are lighted in and
                  about the cabins, and men mutter their curious jargon while moving to prepare the
                  coarse meal. Their anxious countenances form a picture wild and deeply
                  interesting.
               Entering Marston's mansion, we find its interior neater than its weather-stained
                  and paintless sides portended. Through the centre runs a broad passage, and on the
                  left and right are large parlours, comfortably furnished, divided by folding doors
                  of carved walnut. We are ushered into the one on the right by a yellow servant,
                  who, neatly dressed in black, has prepared his politeness for the occasion. With
                  great suavity, accompanied by a figurative grin, he informs us that master will
                  pay his respects presently. Pieces of singularly antique furniture are arranged
                  round the room, of which, he adds, master is proud indeed. Two plaster figures,
                  standing in dingy niches, he tells us are wonders of the white man's genius. In
                  his own random style he gives us an essay on the arts, adding a word here and
                  there to remind us of master's exquisite taste, and anxiously waits our
                  confirmation of what he says.
               A large open fire-place, with fancifully carved framework and mantel-pieces, in
                  Italian marble of polished blackness, upon which stood massive silver
                  candlesticks, in chased work, denotes the ancient character of the mansion. It has
                  many years been the home of the ever-hospitable Marston family.
               
               In another part of the room is a mahogany side-board of antique pattern, upon
                  which stand sundry bottles and glasses, indicative of Marston having entertained
                  company in the morning. While we are contemplating the furniture around us, and
                  somewhat disappointed at the want of taste displayed in its arrangement, the door
                  opens, and Sam, the yellow servant, bows Marston in with a gracious smile. It is
                  in the south where the polite part is played by the negro. Deacon Rosebrook and
                  Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy, a man of the world, follow Marston into the room.
                  Marston is rather tall of figure, robust, and frank of countenance. A florid face,
                  and an extremely large nose bordering on the red, at times give him an aldermanic
                  air. He rubs his fingers through the short, sandy-coloured hair that bristles over
                  a low forehead (Tom, the barber, has just fritted it) smiles, and introduces us to
                  his friends. He is vain—vanity belongs to the slave world—is sorry his eyes are
                  grey, but adds an assurance every now and then that his blood is of the very best
                  stock. Lest a doubt should hang upon our mind, he asserts, with great confidence,
                  that grey eyes indicate pure Norman birth. As for phrenology! he never believed in
                  a single bump, and cites his own contracted forehead as the very strongest proof
                  against the theory. Indeed, there is nothing remarkable in our host's countenance,
                  if we except its floridness; but a blunt nose protruding over a wide mouth and
                  flat chin gives the contour of his face an expression not the most prepossessing.
                  He has been heard to say, "A man who didn't love himself wasn't worth loving:"
                  and, to show his belief in this principle of nature, he adorns his face with thick
                  red whiskers, not the most pleasing to those unaccustomed to the hairy follies of
                  a fashionable southron.
               Times are prosperous; the plantation puts forth its bounties, and Marston
                  withholds nothing that can make time pass pleasantly with those who honour him
                  with a visit. He is dressed in an elaborately cut black coat, with sweeping
                  skirts, a white vest, fancy-coloured pantaloons, and bright boots. About his neck
                  is an enormous shirt collar, turned carelessly over, and secured with a plain
                  black ribbon. Elder Praiseworthy is of lean figure, with sharp, craven features.
                  The people of the parish have a doubtful opinion of him. Some say he will preach
                  sermons setting forth the divine right of slavery, or any other institution that
                  has freedom for its foe, provided always there is no lack of pay. As a divine, he
                  is particularly sensitive lest anything should be said disparagingly against the
                  institution he lends his aid to protect. That all institutions founded in
                  patriarchal usage are of God's creation, he holds to be indisputable; and that
                  working for their overthrow is a great crime, as well as an unpardonable sin, he
                  never had the slightest doubt. He is careful of his clerical dress, which is of
                  smoothest black; and remembering how essential are gold-framed spectacles,
                  arranges and re-arranges his with greatest care. He is a great admirer of large
                  books with gilt edges and very expensive bindings. They show to best advantage in
                  the southern parlour library, where books are rarely opened. To say the Elder is
                  not a man of great parts, is to circulate a libel of the first magnitude. Indeed,
                  he liked big books for their solidity; they reminded him of great thoughts well
                  preserved, and sound principles more firmly established. At times he had thought
                  they were like modern democratic rights, linked to huge comprehending faculties,
                  such as was his good fortune to use when expounding state rights and federal
                  obligations.
               Deacon Rosebrook is a comely, fair-faced man, a moderate thinker, a charitable
                  Christian, a very good man, who lets his deeds of kindness speak of him. He is not
                  a politician—no! he is a better quality of man, has filled higher stations. Nor is
                  he of the modernly pious—that is, as piety professes itself in our democratic
                  world, where men use it more as a necessary appliance to subdue the mind than a
                  means to improve civilization. But he was always cautious in giving expression to
                  his sentiments, knowing the delicate sensibilities of those he had to deal with,
                  and fearing lest he might spring a democratic mine of very illiberal
                  indignation.
               "Come, gentlemen guests, you are as welcome as the showers," says Marston, in a
                  stentorious voice: "Be seated; you are at home under my roof. Yes, the hospitality
                  of my plantation is at your service." The yellow man removes a table that stood in
                  the centre of the room, places chairs around it, and each takes his seat.
               "Pardon me, my dear Marston, you live with the comfort of a nabob. Wealth seems to
                  spring up on all sides," returns the Deacon, good-naturedly.
               
               "And so I think," joins the Elder: "the pleasures of the plantation are manifold,
                  swimming along from day to day; but I fear there is one thing our friend has not
                  yet considered."
               "Pray what is that? Let us hear it; let us hear it. Perhaps it is the very piety
                  of nonsense," rejoined Marston, quickly. "Dead men and devils are always haunting
                  us." The Elder draws his spectacles from his pocket, wipes them with his silk
                  handkerchief, adjusts them on his nose, and replies with some effort, "The
                  Future."
               "Nothing more?" Marston inquires, quaintly: "Never contented; riches all around
                  us, favourable prospects for the next crop, prices stiff, markets good, advices
                  from abroad exciting. Let the future take care of itself; you are like all
                  preachers, Elder, borrowing darkness when you can't see light."
               "The Elder, so full of allegory!" whispers the Deacon. "He means a moral
                  condition, which we all esteem as a source of riches laid up in store for the
                  future."
               "I discover; but it never troubles me while I take care of others. I pray for my
                  negro property—pray loudly and long. And then, their piety is a charge of great
                  magnitude; but when I need your assistance in looking after it, be assured you
                  will receive an extra fee."
               "That's personal—personal, decidedly personal."
               "Quite the reverse," returns Marston, suddenly smiling, and, placing his elbows on
                  the table, rests his face on his hands. "Religion is well in its place, good on
                  simple minds; just the thing to keep vassals in their places: that's why I pay to
                  have it talked to my property. Elder, I get the worth of my money in seeing the
                  excitement my fellows get into by hearing you preach that old worn-out sermon.
                  You've preached it to them so long, they have got it by heart. Only impress the
                  rascals that it's God's will they should labour for a life, and they'll stick to
                  it like Trojans: they are just like pigs, sir."
               "You don't comprehend me, my friend Marston: I mean that you should prepare—it's a
                  rule applicable to all—to meet the terrible that may come upon us at any moment."
                  The Elder is fearful that he is not quite explicit enough. He continues: "Well,
                  there is something to be considered;"—he is not quite certain that we should
                  curtail the pleasures of this life by binding ourselves with the dread of what is
                  to come. "Seems as if we owed a common duty to ourselves," he ejaculates.
               The conversation became more exciting, Marston facetiously attempting to be
                  humorous at the Elder's expense: "It isn't the pleasure, my dear fellow, it's the
                  contentment. We were all born to an end; and if that end be to labour through life
                  for others, it must be right. Everything is right that custom has established
                  right."
               "Marston, give us your hand, my friend. 'Twould do to plead so if we had no
                  enemies, but enemies are upon us, watching our movements through partizans' eyes,
                  full of fierceness, and evil to misconstruct."
               "I care not," interrupts Marston. "My slaves are my property—I shall do with them
                  as it pleases me; no insinuations about morality, or I shall mark you on an old
                  score. Do you sound? Good Elders should be good men; but they, as well as
                  planters, have their frailties; it would not do to tell them all, lest high heaven
                  should cry out." Marston points his finger, and laughs heartily. "I wish we had
                  seven lives to live, and they were all as happy as most of our planters could
                  desire to make them."
               The Elder understood the delicate hint, but desiring to avoid placing himself in
                  an awkward position before the Deacon, began to change the conversation,
                  criticising the merits of several old pictures hung upon the walls. They were much
                  valued by Marston, as mementoes of his ancestry: of this the Elder attempted in
                  vain to make a point. During this conversation, so disguised in meaning, the
                  mulatto servant stood at the door waiting Marston's commands. Soon, wine and
                  refreshments were brought in, and spread out in old plantation style. The company
                  had scarcely filled glasses, when a rap sounded at the hall door: a servant
                  hastened to announce a carriage; and in another minute was ushered into the room
                  the graceful figure of a young lady whose sweet and joyous countenance bespoke the
                  absence of care. She was followed by a genteelly-dressed young man of straight
                  person and placid features.
               "Oh! Franconia," said Marston, rising from his seat, grasping her hand
                  affectionately, and bestowing a kiss on her fair cheek, for it was fair
                  indeed.
               Taking her right hand in his left, he added, "My niece, gentlemen; my brother's only daughter, and nearly
                  spoiled with attentions." A pleasant smile stole over her face, as gracefully she
                  acknowledged the compliment. In another minute three or four old negroes, moved by
                  the exuberance of their affection for her, gathered about her, contending with
                  anxious faces for the honour of seeing her comfortable.
               "I love her!" continued Marston; "and, as well as she could a father, she loves
                  me, making time pass pleasantly with her cheerfulness." She was the child of his
                  affections; and as he spoke his face glowed with animation. Scarce seventeen
                  summers had bloomed upon his fair niece, who, though well developed in form, was
                  of a delicate constitution, and had inherited that sensitiveness so peculiar to
                  the child of the South, especially she who has been cradled in the nursery of ease
                  and refinement. As she spoke, smiled, and raised her jewelled fingers, the grace
                  accompanying the words was expressive of love and tenderness. Turning to the
                  gentleman who accompanied her, "My friend!" she added, simply, with a frolicsome
                  laugh. A dozen anxious black faces were now watching in the hall, ready to scamper
                  round her ere she made her appearance to say, "How de'h!" to young Missus, and get
                  a glimpse at her stranger friend. After receiving a happy salute from the old
                  servants, she re-enters the room. "Uncle's always drinking wine when I come;—but
                  Uncle forgets me; he has not so much as once asked me to join him!" She lays her
                  hand on his arm playfully, smiles cunningly, points reproachfully at the Elder,
                  and takes a seat at her uncle's side. The wine has seized the Elder's mind; he
                  stares at her through his spectacles, and holds his glass with his left hand.
               "Come, Dandy," said Marston, addressing himself to the mulatto attendant, "bring a
                  glass; she shall join us." The glass is brought, Marston fills it, she bows, they
                  drink to her and to the buoyant spirits of the noble southern lady. "I don't
                  admire the habit; but I do like to please so," she whispers, and, excusing
                  herself, skips into the parlour on the right, where she is again beset by the old
                  servants, who rush to her, shake her hand, cling playfully to her dress: some
                  present various new-plucked flowers others are become noisy with their chattering
                  jargon. At length she is so beset with the display of their affection as to be
                  compelled to break away from them, and call for Clotilda. "I must have Clotilda!"
                  she says: "Tell her to come soon, Dandy: she alone can arrange my dress." Thus
                  saying, she disappeared up a winding stair leading from the hall into the second
                  story.
               We were anxious to know who Clotilda was, and why Franconia should summon her with
                  so much solicitude. Presently a door opened: Franconia appeared at the top of the
                  stairs, her face glowing with vivacity, her hair dishevelled waving in beautiful
                  confusion, giving a fascination to her person. "I do wish she would come, I do!"
                  she mutters, resting her hands upon the banisters, and looking intently into the
                  passage: "she thinks more of fussing over Annette's hair, than she does about
                  taking care of mine. Well, I won't get cross—I won't! Poor Clotilda, I do like
                  her; I can't help it; it is no more than natural that she should evince so much
                  solicitude for her child: we would do the same." Scarcely had she uttered these
                  words, when the beautiful female we have described in the foregoing chapter ran
                  from her cabin, across the yard, into the mansion. "Where is young Miss
                  Franconia?" she inquires; looks hastily around, ascends the stairs, greets
                  Franconia with a fervent shake of the hand, commences adjusting her hair. There is
                  a marked similarity in their countenances: it awakens our reflections. Had
                  Clotilda exhibited that exactness of toilet for which Franconia is become
                  celebrated, she would excel in her attractions. There was the same oval face, the
                  same arched brows; there was the same Grecian contour of features, the same
                  sharply lined nose; there was the same delicately cut mouth, disclosing white,
                  pearly teeth; the same eyes, now glowing with sentiment, and again pensive,
                  indicating thought and tenderness; there was the same classically moulded bust, a
                  shoulder slightly converging, of beautiful olive, enriched by a dark mole.
               Clotilda would fain have kissed Franconia, but she dare not. "Clotilda, you must
                  take good care of me while I make my visit. Only do my hair nicely, and I will see
                  that Uncle gets a new dress for you when he goes to the city. If Uncle would only
                  get married, how much happier it would be," says Franconia, looking at Clotilda
                  the while.
               "And me, too,—I would be happier!" Clotilda replies, resting her arms on the back of Franconia's lolling
                  chair, as her eyes assumed a melancholy glare. She heaved a sigh.
               "You could not be happier than you are; you are well cared for; Uncle will never
                  see you want; but you must be cheerful when I come, Clotilda,—you must! To see you
                  unhappy makes me feel unhappy."
               "Cheerful!—its better said than felt. Can he or she be cheerful who is forced to
                  sin against God and himself? There is little to be cheerful with, where the nature
                  is not its own. Why should I be the despised wretch at your Uncle's feet: did God,
                  the great God, make me a slave to his licentiousness?"
               "Suppress such feelings, Clotilda; do not let them get the better of you. God
                  ordains all things: it is well to abide by His will, for it is sinful to be
                  discontented, especially where everything is so well provided. Why, Uncle has
                  learned you to read, and even to write."
               "Ah! that's just what gave me light; through it I knew that I had a life, and a
                  soul beyond that, as valuable to me as yours is to you."
               "Be careful, Clotilda," she interrupts; "remember there is a wide difference
                  between us. Do not cross Uncle; he is kind, but he may get a freak into his head,
                  and sell you."
               Clotilda's cheeks brightened; she frowned at the word, and, giving her black hair
                  a toss from her shoulder, muttered, "To sell me!—Had you measured the depth of
                  pain in that word, Franconia, your lips had never given it utterance. To sell
                  me!—'tis that. The difference is wide indeed, but the point is sharpest. Was it my
                  mother who made that point so sharp? It could not! a mother would not entail such
                  misery on her offspring. That name, so full of associations dear to me—so full of
                  a mother's love and tenderness,—could not reflect pain. Nay; her affections were
                  bestowed upon me,—I love to treasure them, I do. To tell me that a mother would
                  entail misery without an end, is to tell me that the spirit of love is without
                  good!"
               "Do not make yourself unhappy, Clotilda. Perhaps you are as well with us as you
                  would be elsewhere. Even at the free north, in happy New England, ladies would not
                  take the notice of you we do: many of your class have died there, poor and
                  wretched, among the most miserable creatures ever born to a sad end. And you are
                  not black—"
               "All is not truth that is told for such," Clotilda interrupts Franconia. "If I
                  were black, my life would have but one stream: now it is terrible with
                  uncertainty. As I am, my hopes and affections are blasted."
               "Sit down, Clotilda," rejoins Franconia, quickly.
               Clotilda, having lavished her skill on Franconia's hair, seats herself by her
                  side. Franconia affectionately takes her tapering hand and presses it with her
                  jewelled fingers. "Remember, Clotilda," she continues, "all the negroes on the
                  plantation become unhappy at seeing you fretful. It is well to seem happy, for its
                  influence on others. Uncle will always provide for Annette and you; and he is
                  kind. If he pays more attention to Ellen at times, take no notice of it. Ellen
                  Juvarna is Indian, moved to peculiarities by the instincts of her race. Uncle is
                  imprudent, I admit; but society is not with us as it is elsewhere!"
               "I care not so much for myself," speaks the woman, in a desponding voice; "it is
                  Annette; and when you spoke of her you touched the chord of all my troubles. I can
                  endure the sin forced upon myself; but, O heavens! how can I butcher my very
                  thoughts with the unhappy life that is before her? My poor mother's words haunt
                  me. I know her feelings now, because I can judge them by my own—can see how her
                  broken heart was crushed into the grave! She kissed my hand, and said, 'Clotilda,
                  my child, you are born to a cruel death. Give me but a heart to meet my friends in
                  judgment!'"
               The child with the flaxen hair, humming a tune, came scampering up the stairs into
                  the room. It recognises Franconia, and, with a sportive laugh, runs to her and
                  fondles in her lap; then, turning to its mother, seems anxious to divide its
                  affections between them. Its features resembled Franconia's—the similarity was
                  unmistakeable; and although she fondled it, talked with it, and smoothed its
                  little locks, she resisted its attempts to climb on her knee: she was cold.
               "Mother says I look like you, and so does old Aunt Rachel, Miss Franconia—they
                  do," whispers the child, shyly, as it twisted its fingers round the rings on
                     Franconia's conia's hand. Franconia
                  blushed, and cast an inquiring look at Clotilda.
               "You must not be naughty," she says; "those black imps you play with
                  around Aunt Rachel's cabin teach you wrong. You must be careful with her,
                  Clotilda; never allow her to such things to white people: she may use such
                  expressions before strangers,—which would be extremely painful—"
               "It seems too plain: if there be no social sin, why fear the degradation?" she
                  quietly interrupts. "You cannot keep it from the child. O, how I should like to
                  know my strange history, Franconia,—to know if it can be that I was born to such
                  cruel misfortunes, such bitter heart-achings, such gloomy forebodings. If I were,
                  then am I content with my lot."
               Franconia listened attentively, saw the anguish that was bursting the bounds of
                  the unhappy woman's feelings, and interrupted by saying, "Speak of it no more,
                  Clotilda. Take your child; go to your cabin. I shall stay a few days: to-morrow I
                  will visit you there." As she spoke, she waved her hand, bid Clotilda good night,
                  kissing Annette as she was led down stairs. Now alone, she begins to contemplate
                  the subject more deeply. It must be wrong, she says to herself: but few are
                  brought to feel it who have the power to remove it. The poor creature seems so
                  unhappy; and my feelings are pained when they tell me how much she looks like
                  me—and it must be so; for when she sat by my side, looking in the glass the
                  portrait of similarity touched my feelings deeply. 'Tis not the thing for Uncle to
                  live in this way. Here am I, loved and beloved, with the luxury of wealth, and
                  friends at my pleasure; I am caressed: she is but born a wretch to serve my
                  Uncle's vanity; and, too, were I to reproach him, he would laugh at what he calls
                  our folly, our sickly sensitiveness; he would tell me of the pleasures of southern
                  life, southern scenery, southern chivalry, southern refinement;—yes, he would tell
                  me how it were best to credit the whole to southern liberality of custom:—so it
                  continues! There is a principle to be served after all: he says we are not sent
                  into the world to excommune ourselves from its pleasures. This may be good logic,
                  for I own I don't believe with those who want the world screwed up into a
                  religious vice; but pleasure is divided into so many different qualities, one
                  hardly knows which suits best now-a-days. Philosophers say we should avoid making
                  pleasure of that which can give pain to others; but philosophers say so many
                  things, and give so much advice that we never think of following. Uncle has a
                  standard of his own. I do, however, wish southern society would be more
                  circumspect, looking upon morality in its proper light. Its all doubtful!
                  doubtful! doubtful! There is Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy; he preaches, preaches,
                  preaches!—his preaching is to live, not to die by. I do pity those poor negroes,
                  who, notwithstanding their impenetrable heads, are bored to death every Sunday
                  with that selfsame sermon. Such preaching, such strained effort, such machinery to
                  make men pious,—it's as soulless as a well. I don't wonder the world has got to be
                  so very wicked, when the wickedness of the slavery church has become so sublime.
                  And there's Uncle, too,—he's been affected just in that way; hearing pious
                  discourses to uphold that which in his soul he knew to be the heaviest wickedness
                  the world groaned under, he has come to look upon religion as if it were a
                  commodity too stale for him. He sees the minister of God's Word a mere machine of
                  task, paid to do a certain amount of talking to negroes, endeavouring to impress
                  their simple minds with the belief that it is God's will they should be
                     slaves. And this is all for necessity's sake!" In this musing mood
                  she sits rocking in her chair, until at length, overcome with the heat, she
                  reclines her head against the cushion, resigning herself to the soothing embrace
                  of sweet sleep.
               The moon's silver rays were playing on the calm surface of the river, the foliage
                  on its banks seemed bathed in quiet repose, the gentle breeze, bearing its balmy
                  odours, wafted through the arbour of oaks, as if to fan her crimson cheeks; the
                  azalia and magnolia combined their fragrance, impregnating the dew falling over
                  the scene, as if to mantle it with beauty. She slept, a picture of southern
                  beauty; her auburn tresses in undulating richness playing to and fro upon her
                  swelling bosom,—how developed in all its delicacy!—her sensitive nature made more
                  lovely by the warmth and generosity of her heart. Still she slept, her youthful
                  mind overflowing with joy and buoyancy:
                  about her there was a ravishing simplicity more than earthly: a blush upon her
                  cheek became deeper,—it was the blush of love flashing in a dream, that tells its
                  tale in nervous vibrations, adding enchantment to sleeping voluptuousness;—and yet
                  all was sacred, an envied object no rude hand dare touch!
               Franconia had been educated at the north, in a land where—God bless the
                  name—Puritanism is not quite extinct; and through the force of principles there
                  inculcated had outgrown much of that feeling which at the south admits to be right
                  what is basely wrong. She hesitated to reproach Marston with the bad effect of his
                  life, but resolved on endeavouring to enlist Clotilda's confidence, and learn how
                  far her degraded condition affected her feelings. She saw her with the same proud
                  spirit that burned in her own bosom; the same tenderness, the same affection for
                  her child, the same hopes and expectations for the future, and its rewards. The
                  question was, what could be done for Clotilda? Was it better to reason with
                  her,—to, if possible, make her happy in her condition? Custom had sanctioned many
                  unrighteous inconsistencies: they were southern, nothing more! She would intercede
                  with her Uncle, she would have him sign free papers for Clotilda and her child;
                  she saw a relationship which the law could not disguise, though it might crush out
                  the natural affections. With these thoughts passing in her mind, her imagination
                  wandered until she dropped into the sleep we have described.
               There she slept, the blushes suffusing her cheeks, until old Aunt Rachel, puffing
                  and blowing like an exhausting engine, entered the room. Aunty is the pink of a
                  plantation mother: she is as black as the blackest, has a face embodying all the
                  good-nature of the plantation, boasts of her dimensions, which she says are six
                  feet, well as anybody proportioned. Her head is done up in a flashy bandana, the
                  points nicely crosslain,, and extending an elaborate distance beyond her ears,
                  nearly covering the immense circular rings that hang from them. Her gingham dress,
                  starched just so, her whitest white apron, never worn before missus
                  come, sets her off to great advantage. Aunty is a good piece of property—tells us
                  how many hundred dollars there is in her—feels that she has been promoted because
                  Mas'r told somebody he would not take a dollar
                  
                     FRANCONIA SLEEPING. "If young missus aint nappin' just so nice! I likes
                        to cotch 'em just so."
                   less for her. She can superintend the domestic affairs of the mansion
                  just as well as anybody. In one hand she bears a cup of orange-grove coffee, in
                  the other a fan, made of palmetto-leaves.
               "Gi'h—e—you!" she exclaimed. "If young missus aint nappin' just so nice! I likes
                  to cotch 'em just so;" and setting her tray upon a stand, she views Franconia
                  intently, and in the exuberance of her feelings seats herself in front of her
                  chair, fanning her with the palmetto. The inquisitive and affectionate nature of
                  the good old slave was here presented in its purity. Nothing can be stronger,
                  nothing show the existence of happy associations more forcibly. The old servant's
                  attachment is proverbial,—his enthusiasm knows no bounds,—Mas'r's comfort absorbs
                  all his thoughts. Here, Aunt Rachel's feelings rose beyond her power of restraint:
                  she gazed on her young missus with admiration, laughed, fanned her more and more;
                  then grasping her little jewelled hand, pressed it to her spacious mouth and
                  kissed it. "Young Missus! Franconia, I does lub ye so!" she whispers.
               "Why, Aunt Rachel!" ejaculated Franconia, starting suddenly: "I am glad you
                  wakened me, for I dreamed of trouble: it made me weak—nervous. Where is Clotilda?"
                  And she stared vacantly round the room, as if unconscious of her position. "Guess
                  'e aint 'bout nowhere. Ye see, Miss, how she don't take no care on ye,—takes dis
                  child to stir up de old cook, when ye comes to see us." And stepping to the stand
                  she brings the salver; and in her excitement to serve Missus, forgets that the
                  coffee is cold. "Da'h he is; just as nice as 'em get in de city. Rachel made
                  'em!"
               "I want Clotilda, Rachel; you must bring her to me. I was dreaming of her and
                  Annette; and she can tell dreams—"
               The old slave interrupts her. "If Miss Franconia hab had dream, 'e bad, sartin.
                  Old Mas'r spoil dat gal, Clotilda,—make her tink she lady, anyhow. She mos' white,
                  fo'h true; but aint no better den oder nigger on de plantation," she returns.
                  Franconia sips her coffee, takes a waf from the plate as the old servant holds it
                  before her, and orders Dandy to summon Clotilda.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               THINGS ARE NOT SO BRIGHT AS THEY SEEM.
               THE following morning broke forth bright and serene. Marston and his guests, after
                  passing a pleasant night, were early at breakfast. When over, they joined him for
                  a stroll over the plantation, to hear him descant upon the prospects of the coming
                  crop. Nothing could be more certain, to his mind, than a bountiful harvest. The
                  rice, cotton, and corn grounds had been well prepared, the weather was most
                  favourable, he had plenty of help, a good overseer, and faithful drivers. "We have
                  plenty,—we live easy, you see, and our people are contented," he says, directing
                  his conversation to the young Englishman, who was suspected of being Franconia's
                  friend. "We do things different from what you do in your country. Your countrymen
                  will not learn to grow cotton: they manufacture it, and hence we are connected in
                  firm bonds. Cotton connects many things, even men's minds and souls. You would
                  like to be a planter, I know you would: who would not, seeing how we live? Here is
                  the Elder, as happy a fellow as you'll find in forty. He can be as jolly as an
                  Englishman over a good dinner: he can think with anybody, preach with anybody!"
                  Touching the Elder on the shoulder, he smiles, and with an insinuating leer,
                  smooths his beard. "I am at your service," replies the Elder, folding his
                  arms.
               "I pay him to preach for my nigger property,—I pay him to teach them to be good.
                  He preaches just as I wants him to. My boys think him a little man,
                  but a great divine. You would like to hear the Elder on Sunday; he's
                  funny then, and has a very funny sermon, which you may get by heart without much
                  exertion." The young man seems indifferent to the conversation. He had not been
                  taught to realise how easy it was to bring religion into contempt.
               "Make no grave charges against me, Marston; you carry your practical jokes a
                  little too far, Sir. I am a quiet man, but the feelings of quiet men may be
                  disturbed." The Elder speaks moodily, as if considering whether it were best to
                  resent Marston's trifling sarcasm. Deacon Rosebrook now interceded by saying, with
                  unruffled countenance, that the Elder had but one thing funny about him,—his
                  dignity on Sundays: that he was, at times, half inclined to believe it the dignity
                  of cogniac, instead of pious sentiment.
               "I preach my sermon,—who can do more?" the Elder rejoins, with seeming concern for
                  his honour. "I thought we came to view the plantation?"
               "Yes, true; but our little repartee cannot stop
                  our sight. You preach your sermon, Elder,—that is, you preach what there is left
                  of it. It is one of the best-used sermons ever manufactured. It would serve as a
                  model for the most stale Oxonian. Do you think you could write another like it? It
                  has lasted seven years, and served the means of propitiating the gospel on seven
                  manors. Can they beat that in your country?" says Marston, again turning to the
                  young 
                     Englishmam
                     Englishman
                  , and laughing at the Elder, who was deliberately taking off his glasses
                  to wipe the perspiration from his forehead.
               "Our ministers have a different way of patching up old sermons; but I'm not quite
                  sure about their mode of getting them," the young man replies, takes Deacon
                  Rosebrook's arm, and walks ahead.
               "The Elder must conform to the doctrines of the South; but they say he bets at the
                  race-course, which is not an uncommon thing for our divines," rejoins the Deacon,
                  facetiously.
               The Elder, becoming seriously inclined, thinks gentlemen had better avoid
                  personalities. Personalities are not tolerated in the South, where gentlemen are
                  removed far above common people, and protect themselves by the code duello. He
                  will expose Marston.
               Marston's good capon sides are proof against jokes. He may crack on, that
                  individual says.
               "My friend," interposed the Elder, "you desired me to preach to your niggers in
                  one style and for one purpose,—according to the rule of labour and submission.
                  Just such an one as your niggers would think the right stripe, I preached, and it
                  made your niggers wonder and gape. I'll pledge you my religious faith I can preach
                  a different—"
               
               "Oh! oh! oh! Elder," interrupted Marston, "pledge something valuable."
               "To me, my faith is the most sacred thing in the world. I will—as I was going to
                  say—preach to your moulding and necessities. Pay for it, and, on my word, it shall
                  be in the cause of the South! With the landmarks from my planter customers, I will
                  follow to their liking," continues Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy, not a smile on
                  his hard face.
               Deacon Rosebrook thinks it is well said. Pay is the great desideratum in
                  everything. The Elder, though not an uncommon southern clergyman, is the most
                  versatile preacher to be met with in a day's walk. Having a wonderful opinion of
                  nigger knowledge, he preaches to it in accordance, receiving good pay and having
                  no objection to the wine.
               "Well, Gentlemen," Marston remarks, coolly, "I think the Elder has borne our jokes
                  well; we will now go and moisten our lips. The elder likes my old Madeira—always
                  passes the highest compliments upon it." Having sallied about the plantation, we
                  return to the mansion, where Dandy, Enoch, and Sam—three well-dressed
                  mulattoes—their hair frizzed and their white aprons looking so bright, meet us at
                  the veranda, and bow us back into the parlour, as we bear our willing testimony of
                  the prospects of the crop. With scraping of feet, grins, and bows, they welcome us
                  back, smother us with compliments, and seem overwilling to lavish their kindness.
                  From the parlour they bow us into a long room in the right wing, its walls being
                  plain boarded, and well ventilated with open seams. A table is spread with
                  substantial edibles,—such as ham, bacon, mutton, and fish. These represent the
                  southern planter's fare, to which he seldom adds those pastry delicacies with
                  which the New Englander is prone to decorate his table. The party become seated as
                  Franconia graces the festive board with her presence, which, being an incentive of
                  gallantry, preserves the nicest decorum, smooths the conversation. The wine-cup
                  flows freely; the Elder dips deeply—as he declares it choice. Temperance being
                  unpopular in the south, it is little regarded at Marston's mansion. As for Marston
                  himself, he is merely preparing the way to play facetious jokes on the Elder,
                  whose arm he touches every few minutes, reminding him how backward he is in
                  replenishing his glass.
               Not at all backward in such matters, the Elder fills up, asks the pleasure of
                  drinking his very good health, and empties the liquid into the safest place
                  nearest at hand. Repeated courses have their effect; Marston is pleased, the Elder
                  is mellow. With muddled sensibilities his eyes glare wildly about the table, and
                  at every fresh invitation to drink he begs pardon for having neglected his duty,
                  fingers the ends of his cravat, and deposits another glass,—certainly the very
                  last. Franconia, perceiving her uncle's motive, begs to be excused, and is
                  escorted out of the room. Mr. Praiseworthy, attempting to get a last glass of wine
                  to his lips without spilling, is quite surprised that the lady should leave. He
                  commences descanting on his own fierce enmity to infidelity and catholicism. He
                  would that everybody rose up and trampled them into the dust; both are ruinous to
                  negro property.
               Marston coolly suggests that the Elder is decidedly uncatholicised.
               "Elder," interrupted Deacon Rosebrook, touching him on the shoulder, "you are
                  modestly undone—that is, very respectably sold to your wine."
               "Yes," rejoined Marston; "I would give an extra ten dollars to hear him preach a
                  sermon to my niggers at this moment."
               "Villainous inconsistency!" exclaimed the Elder, in an indistinct voice, his eyes
                  half closed, and the spectacles gradually falling from his nose. "You are
                  scandalising my excellent character, which can't be replaced with gold." Making
                  another attempt to raise a glass of wine to his lips, as he concluded, he
                  unconsciously let the contents flow into his bosom, instead of his mouth.
               "Well, my opinion is, Elder, that if you get my nigger property into heaven with
                  your preaching, there'll be a chance for the likes of me," said Marston, watching
                  the Elder intently. It was now evident the party were all becoming pretty deeply
                  tinctured. Rosebrook thought a minister of the gospel, to get in such a condition,
                  and then refer to religious matters, must have a soul empty to the very core.
                  There could be no better proof of how easily true religion could be brought into
                  contempt. The Elder foreclosed with the
                  spirit, considered himself unsafe in the chair, and was about to relieve it, when
                  Dandy caught him in his arms like a lifeless mass, and carried him to a settee,
                  upon which he spread him, like a substance to be bleached in the sun.
               "Gentlemen! the Elder is completely unreverenced,—he is the most versatile
                  individual that ever wore black cloth. I reverence him for his qualities," says
                  Marston: then, turning to Maxwell, he continued, "you must excuse this little
                  joviality; it occurs but seldom, and the southern people take it for what it is
                  worth, excusing, or forgetting its effects."
               "Don't speak of it—it's not unlike our English do at times—nor do our ministers
                  form exceptions; but they do such things under a monster protection, without
                  reckoning the effect," the Englishman replied, looking round as if he missed the
                  presence of Franconia.
               The Elder, soon in a profound sleep, was beset by swarms of mosquitoes preying
                  upon his haggard face, as if it were good food. "He's a pretty picture," says
                  Marston, looking upon the sleeping Elder with a frown, and then working his
                  fingers through his crispy red hair. "A hard subject for the student's knife he'll
                  make, won't he?" To add to the comical appearance of the reverend gentleman,
                  Marston, rising from his seat, approached him, drew the spectacles from his
                  pocket, and placed them on the tip of his nose, adding piquancy to his already
                  indescribable physiognomy.
               "Don't you think this is carrying the joke a point too far?" asked Deacon
                  Rosebrook, who had been some time silently watching the prostrate condition of
                  Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy.
               Marston shrugs his shoulders, whispers a word or two in the ear of his friend
                  Maxwell, twirls his glass upon the table. He is somewhat cautious how he gives an
                  opinion on such matters, having previously read one or two law books; but believes
                  it does'nt portray all things just right. He has studied ideal good—at least he
                  tells us so—if he never practises it; finally, he is constrained to admit that
                  this 'ere's all very well once in a while, but becomes tiresome—especially when
                  kept up as strong as the Elder does it. He is free to confess that southern
                  mankind is curiously constituted, too often giving license to revelries, but
                  condemning those who fall by them. He feels quite right about the Elder's
                  preaching being just the chime for his nigger property; but, were he a professing
                  Christian, it would'nt suit him by fifty per cent. There is something between the
                  mind of a "nigger" and the mind of a white man,—something he can't exactly
                  analyse, though he is certain it is wonderfully different; and though such
                  preaching can do niggers no harm, he would just as soon think of listening to
                  Infidelity. Painful as it was to acknowledge the fact, he only appeared at the
                  "Meet'n House" on Sundays for the looks of the thing, and in the hope that it
                  might have some influence with his nigger property. Several times he had been
                  heard to say it was mere machine-preaching—made according to pattern, delivered
                  according to price, by persons whose heads and hearts had no sympathy with the
                  downcast.
               "There's my prime fellow Harry; a right good fellow, worth nine
                  hundred, nothing short, and he is a Christian in conscience. He has got a kind of
                  a notion into his head about being a divine. He thinks, in the consequence of his
                  black noddle, that he can preach just as well as anybody; and, believe me, he
                  can't read a letter in the book,—at least, I don't see how he can. True, he has
                  heard the Elder's sermon so often that he has committed every word of it to
                  memory,—can say it off like a plantation song, and no mistake." Thus Marston
                  discoursed. And yet he declared that nobody could fool him with the idea of
                  "niggers" having souls: they were only mortal,—he would produce abundant proof, if
                  required.
               Deacon Rosebrook listened attentively to this part of Marston's discourse. "The
                  task of proving your theory would be rendered difficult if you were to transcend
                  upon the scale of blood," he replied, getting up and spreading his handkerchief
                  over the Elder's face, to keep off the mosquitoes.
               "When our most learned divines and philosophers are the stringent supporters of
                  the principle, what should make the task difficult? Nevertheless, I admit, if my
                  fellow Harry could do the preaching for our plantation, no objections would be
                  interposed by me; on the contrary, I could make a good speculation by it. Harry
                  would be worth two common niggers then. Nigger property, christianised, is the
                  most valuable of property. You may distinguish a christianised nigger in a moment; and piety takes
                  the stubborn out of their composition better than all the cowhides you can employ;
                  and, too, it's a saving of time, considering that it subdues so much quicker,"
                  says Marston, stretching back in his chair, as he orders Dandy to bring Harry into
                  his presence. He will tell them what he knows about preaching, the Elder's sermon,
                  and the Bible!
               Maxwell smiles at such singularly out of place remarks on religion. They are not
                  uncommon in the south, notwithstanding.
               A few minutes elapsed, when Dandy opened the door, and entered the room, followed
                  by a creature—a piece of property!—in which the right of a soul had been disputed,
                  not alone by Marston, but by southern ministers and southern philosophers. The
                     thing was very good-looking, very black;—it had straight features,
                  differing from the common African, and stood very erect. We have said he differed
                  from the common African—we mean, as he is recognised through our prejudices. His
                  forehead was bold and well-developed—his hair short, thick and crispy, eyes keen
                  and piercing, cheeks regularly declining into a well-shaped mouth and chin.
                  Dejected and forlorn, the wretch of chance stood before them, the fires of a
                  burning soul glaring forth from his quick, wandering eyes. "There!" exclaimed
                  Marston. "See that," pointing at his extremes; "he has foot enough for a
                  brick-maker, and a head equal to a deacon—no insinuation, my friend," bowing to
                  Deacon Rosebrook. "They say it takes a big head to get into Congress; but I'm
                  afraid, Harry, I'd never get there."
               The door again opened, and another clever-looking old negro, anxious to say "how de do" to mas'r and his visitors, made his appearance, bowing,
                  and keeping time with his foot. "Oh, here's my old daddy—old Daddy Bob, one of the
                  best old niggers on the plantation; Harry and Bob are my deacons. There,—stand
                  there, Harry; tell these gentlemen,—they are right glad to see you,—what you know
                  about Elder Praiseworthy's sermon, and what you can do in the way of preaching,"
                  says Marston, laughing good-naturedly.
               "Rather a rough piece of property to make a preacher of," muttered Maxwell.
               The poor fellow's feet were encrusted as hard as an alligator's back; and there he
                  stood, a picture upon which the sympathies of Christendom were enlisted—a human
                  object without the rights of man, in a free republic. He held a red cap in his
                  left hand, a pair of coarse osnaburg trousers reached a few inches below his
                  knees, and, together with a ragged shirt of the same material, constituted his
                  covering.
               "You might have dressed yourself before you appeared before gentlemen from
                  abroad—at least, put on your new jacket," said Marston.
               "Why, mas'r, t'ant de clothes. God neber make Christian wid'e his clothes on;—den,
                  mas'r, I gin' my new jacket to Daddy Bob. But neber mind him, mas'r—you wants I to
                  tell you what I tinks ob de Lor. I tink great site ob the Bible, mas'r, but me
                  don' tink much ob Elder's sermon, mas'r."
               "How is that, Harry?" interrupted the deacon.
               "Why, Mas'r Deacon, ye sees how when ye preaches de good tings ob de Lor', ye
                  mus'nt 'dulge in 'e wicked tings on 'arth. A'h done want say Mas'r Elder do dem
                  tings—but 'e seem to me t' warn't right wen 'e join de wickedness ob de world, and
                  preach so ebery Sunday. He may know de varse, and de chapter, but 'e done preach
                  what de Lor' say, nohow."
               "Then you don't believe in a one-sided sermon, Harry?" returned the deacon, while
                  Marston and Maxwell sat enjoying the negro's simple opinion of the Elder's
                  sermon.
               "No, mas'r. What the Bible teach me is to lob de Lor'—be good myself, and set
                  example fo'h oders. I an't what big white Christian say must be good, wen 'e neber
                  practice him,—but I good in me heart when me tink what de Lor' say be good. Why,
                  mas'r, Elder preach dat sarmon so many Sundays, dat a' forgot him three times,
                  since me know 'im ebery word," said Harry; and his face began to fill with
                  animation and fervency.
               "Well, now, Harry, I think you are a little too severe on the Elder's sermon; but
                  if you know so much about it, give these gentlemen a small portion of it, just to
                  amuse them while the Elder is taking a nap," said Marston.
               "Ay, mas'r, be nap dat way too often for pious man what say he lobe de Lor',"
                  replied Harry; and drawing himself into a
                  tragic attitude, making sundry gesticulations, and putting his hand to his
                  forehead, commenced with the opening portion of the Elder's sermon. "And it was
                  said—Servants obey your masters, for that is right in the sight of the Lord," and
                  with a style of native eloquence, and rich cantation, he continued for about ten
                  minutes, giving every word, seriatim, of the
                  Elder's sermon; and would have kept it up, in word and action, to the end, had he
                  not been stopped by Marston. All seemed astonished at his power of memory. Maxwell
                  begged that he might be allowed to proceed.
               "He's a valuable fellow, that—eh?" said Marston. "He'll be worth three-sixteenths
                  of a rise on cotton to all the planters in the neighbourhood, by-and-by. He's
                  larned to read, somehow, on the sly—isn't it so, Harry? come, talk up!"
               "Yes, mas'r, I larn dat when you sleepin'; do Lor' tell me his spirit warn't in
                  dat sarmon what de Elder preach,—dat me must sarch de good book, and make me own
                  tinking valuable. Mas'r tink ignorant nigger lob him best, but t'ant so, mas'r.
                  Good book make heart good, and make nigger love de Lor', and love mas'r too."
               "I'll bet the rascal's got a Bible, or a Prayer-book, hid up somewhere. He and old
                  Daddy Bob are worse on religion than two old coons on a fowl-yard," said Marston.
                  Here old Aunt Rachel entered the room to fuss around a little, and have a pleasant
                  meeting with mas'r's guests. Harry smiled at Marston's remark, and turned his eyes
                  upward, as much as to say, "a day will come when God's Word will not thus be
                  turned into ridicule!"
               "And he's made such a good old Christian of this dark sinner, Aunt Rachel, that I
                  wouldn't take two thousand dollars for her. I expect she'll be turning preacher
                  next, and going north to join the abolitionists."
               "Mas'r," said Rachel, "'t wouldn't do to mind what you say. Neber mind, you get
                  old one ob dese days; den you don't make so much fun ob old Rachel."
               "Shut up your corn-trap," Marston says, smiling; and turning to his guests,
                  continues—"You hear that, gentlemen; she talks just as she pleases, directs my
                  household as if she were governor." Again, Aunt Rachel, summoning her dignity,
                  retorts,
               "Not so, Mas'r Deacon, (turning to Deacon Rosebrook,) "'t won't square t' believe
                  all old Boss tell, dat it won't! Mas'r take care ob de two cabins in de yard
                  yonder, while I tends de big house." Rachel was more than a match for Marston; she
                  could beat him in quick retort. The party, recognising Aunt Rachel's insinuation,
                  joined in a hearty laugh. The conversation was a little too pointed for Marston,
                  who, changing the subject, turned to Harry, saying, "now, my old boy, we'll have a
                  little more of your wisdom on religious matters." Harry had been standing the
                  while like a forlorn image, with a red cap in his hand.
               "I can preach, mas'r; I can do dat, fo'h true," he replied quickly. "But mas'r,
                  nigger got to preach against his colour; Buckra tink nigger
                  preachin' ain't good, cus he black."
               "Never mind that, Harry," interrupts Marston: "We'll forget the nigger, and listen
                  just as if it were all white. Give us the very best specimen of it. Daddy Bob, my
                  old patriarch, must help you; and after you get through, he must lift out by
                  telling us all about the time when General Washington landed in the city; and how
                  the people spread carpets, at the landing, for him to walk upon." The
                  entertainment was, in Marston's estimation, quite a recherché concern: that his guests should be the better pleased, the
                  venerable old Daddy Bob, his head white with goodly years of toil, and full of
                  genuine negro humour, steps forward to perform his part. He makes his best bows,
                  his best scrapes, his best laughs; and says, "Bob ready to do anything to please
                  mas'r." He pulls the sleeves of his jacket, looks vacantly at Harry, is proud to
                  be in the presence of mas'r's guests. He tells them he is a better nigger "den"
                  Harry, points to his extremes, which are decorated with a pair of new russet
                  broghans.
               "Daddy's worth his weight in gold," continues Marston, "and can do as much work as
                  any nigger on the plantation, if he is old."
               "No, no, mas'r; I ain't so good what I was. Bob can't tote so much wid de hoe now.
                  I work first-rate once, mas'r, but 'a done gone now!"
               "Now, Bob, I want you to tell me the truth,—niggers will lie, but you are an
                  exception, Bob; and can tell the truth when there's no bacon in the way."
               "Gih! Mas'r, I do dat sartin," replied Bob, laughing heartily, and pulling up the little piece of shirt
                  that peeped out above the collar of his jacket.
               "How did Harry and you come by so much knowledge of the Bible? you got one
                  somewhere, hav'n't you?" enquired Marston, laconically.
               This was rather a "poser" on Bob; and, after stammering and mumbling for some
                  time—looking at Harry slyly, then at Marston, and again dropping his eyes on the
                  floor, he ejaculated,
               "Well, mas'r, 'spose I might as well own 'im. Harry and me got one, for
                  sartin!"
               "Ah, you black rascals, I knew you had one somewhere. Where did you get it? That's
                  some of Miss Franconia's doings."
               "Can't tell you, mas'r, whar I got him; but he don't stop my hoein' corn, for'
                  true."
               Franconia had observed Harry's tractableness, and heard him wish for a Bible, that
                  he might learn to read from it,—and she had secretly supplied him with one. Two
                  years Harry and Daddy Bob had spent hours of the night in communion over it; the
                  latter had learned to read from it, the former had imbibed its great truths. The
                  artless girl had given it to them in confidence, knowing its consolatory
                  influences and that they, with a peculiar firmness in such cases, would never
                  betray her trust. Bob would not have refused his master any other request; but he
                  would never disclose the secret of Miss Franconia giving it.
               Well, my old faithful," said Marston, "we want you to put the 
                     sprit
                     spirit
                   into Harry; we want to hear a sample of his preaching. Now, Harry, you
                  can begin; give it big eloquence, none of the new fashion preaching, give us the
                  old plantation break-down style."
               The negro's countenance assumed a look indicative of more than his lips dare
                  speak. Looking upward pensively, he replied,—"Can't do dat, mas'r; he ain't what
                  do God justice; but there is something in de text,—where shall I take 'em
                  from?"
               "Ministers should choose their own; I always do," interrupted Deacon
                  Rosebrook.
               Daddy Bob, touching Harry on the arm, looks up innocently, interposes his
                  knowledge of Scripture. "D'ar, Harry, I tells you what text to gin 'em. Gin 'em
                  dat one from de fourt' chapter of Ephes: dat one whar de Lor' say:—'Great mas'r
                  led captivity captive, and gin gifts unto men.' And whar he say, 'Till we come
                  unto a unity of the faith of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man,
                  unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; that we be no more
                  children tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the
                  slight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lay in wait to deceive.'"
               "And you tink dat 'll do,—eh, Daddy?" Harry replies, looking at the old man, as if
                  to say, were he anything but a slave he would follow the advice.
               "Den, dars t' oder one, away 'long yonder, where 'e say in Isaiah, fifty-eight
                  chapter—'Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?
                  Wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold ye fast
                  for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness." The old man
                  seemed perfectly at home on matters of Scripture; he had studied it in stolen
                  moments.
               The young Englishman seemed surprised at such a show of talent. He saw the humble
                  position of the old man, his want of early instruction, and his anxiety to be
                  enlightened. "How singular!" he ejaculated, "to hear property preach, and know so
                  much of the Bible, too! People in my country would open their eyes with surprise."
                  The young man had been educated in an atmosphere where religion was prized—where
                  it was held as a sacred element for the good of man. His feelings were tenderly
                  susceptible; the scene before him awakened his better nature, struck deep into his
                  mind. He viewed it as a cruel mockery of Christianity, a torture of innocent
                  nature, for which man had no shame. He saw the struggling spirit of the old negro
                  contending against wrong,—his yearnings for the teachings of Christianity, his
                  solicitude for Marston's good. And he saw how man had cut down the unoffending
                  image of himself—how Christian ministers had become the tyrant's hand-fellow in
                  the work of oppression. It incited him to resolution; a project sprung up in his
                  mind, which, from that day forward, as if it had been a new discovery in the
                  rights of man, he determined to carry out in future, for the freedom of his
                  fellows.
               Harry, in accordance with Bob's advice, chose the latter text. For some minutes he expounded the power of
                  divine inspiration, in his simple but impressive manner, being several times
                  interrupted by the Deacon, who assumed the right of correcting his philosophy. At
                  length, Marston interrupted, reminding him that he had lost the "plantation
                  gauge." "You must preach according to the Elder's rule," said he.
               With a submissive stare, Harry replied: "Mas'r, a man what lives fo'h dis world
                  only is a slave to himself; but God says, he dat lives fo'h de world to come, is
                  the light of life coming forth to enjoy the pleasures of eternity;" and again he
                  burst into a rhapsody of eloquence, to the astonishment and admiration of Maxwell,
                  and even touching the feelings of Marston, who was seldom moved by such displays.
                  Seeing the man in the thing of merchandise, he inclined to look upon him as a
                  being worthy of immortality; and yet it seemed next to impossible that he should
                  bring his natural feelings to realise the simple nobleness that stood before
                  him,—the man beyond the increase of dollars and cents in his person!
                  The coloured winter's hand leaned against the mantel-piece, watching the changes
                  in Marston's countenance, as Daddy stood at Harry's side, in patriarchal muteness.
                  A tear stealing down Maxwell's cheek told of the sensation produced; while
                  Marston, setting his elbow on the table, supported his head in his hands, and
                  listened. The Deacon, good man that he was, filled his glass,—as if to say, "I
                  don't stand nigger preaching." As for the Elder, his pishes and
                  painful gurglings, while he slept, were a source of much annoyance. Awaking
                  suddenly—raising himself to a half-bent position—he rubs his little eyes, adjusts
                  his spectacles on his nose, stares at Harry with surprise, and then, with
                  quizzical demeanour, leaves us to infer what sort of a protest he is about to
                  enter. He, however, thinks it better to say nothing.
               "Stop, Harry," says Marston, interrupting him in a point of his discourse: then
                  turning to his guests, he inquired, with a look of ridicule, "Gentlemen, what have
                  you got to say against such preaching? Elder, you old snoring Christian, you have
                  lost all the best of it. Why didn't you wake up before?"
               "Verri-ly, truly! ah, indeed: you have been giving us a monkey-show with your
                  nigger, I suppose. I thought I'd lost nothing; you should remember, Marston,
                  there's a future," said the Elder, winking and blinking sardonically.
               "Yes, old boosey," Marston replies, with an air of indifference, "and you should
                  remember there's a present, which you may lose your way in. That venerable sermon
                  won't keep you straight—"
               The Elder is extremely sensitive on this particular point—anything but speak
                  disparagingly of that sermon. It has been his stock in trade for numerous years.
                  He begs they will listen to him for a minute, excuse this little trifling
                  variation, charge it to the susceptibility of his constitution. He is willing to
                  admit there is capital in his example which may be used for bad purposes, and
                  says, "Somehow, when I take a little, it don't seem to go right." Again he gives a
                  vacant look at his friends, gets up, resting his hands on the table, endeavours to
                  keep a perpendicular, but declares himself so debilitated by his sleep that he
                  must wait a little longer. Sinking back upon the settee, he exclaims, "You had
                  better send that nigger to his cabin." This was carrying the amusement a little
                  beyond Marston's own "gauge," and it being declared time to adjourn, preparations
                  were made to take care of the Elder, who was soon placed horizontally in a waggon
                  and driven away for his home. "The Elder is gone beyond himself, beyond
                  everything," said Marston, as they carried him out of the door. "You can go,
                  Harry, I like your preaching; bring it down to the right system for my property,
                  and I'll make a dollar or two out of it yet," he whispers, shaking his head, as
                  Harry, bowing submissively, leaves the door.
               Just as they were making preparations to retire, a carriage drove to the gate, and
                  in the next minute a dashing young fellow came rushing into the house, apparently
                  in great anxiety. He was followed by a well-dressed man, whose countenance and
                  sharp features, full of sternness, indicated much mechanical study. He hesitated
                  as the young man advanced, took Marston by the hand, nervously, led him aside,
                  whispered something in his ear. Taking a few steps towards a window, the intruder,
                  for such he seemed, stood almost motionless, with his eyes firmly and watchfully
                  fixed upon them, a paper in his right hand. "It is too often, Lorenzo; these
                  things may prove fatal," said Marston,
                  giving an inquiring glance at the man, still standing at the window.
               "I pledge you my honour, uncle, it shall be the last time," said the young
                  stranger. "Uncle, I have not forgotten your advice." Marston, much excited,
                  exhibited changes of countenance peculiar to a man labouring under the effect of
                  sudden disappointment. Apologising to his guests, he dismissed them—with the
                  exception of Maxwell—ordered pen and ink, drew a chair to the table, and without
                  asking the stranger to be seated, signed his name to a paper. While this was being
                  done, the man who had waited in silence stepped to the door and admitted two
                  gentlemanly-looking men, who approached Marston and authenticated the instrument.
                  It was evident there was something of deep importance associated with Marston's
                  signature. No sooner had his pen fulfilled the mission, than Lorenzo's face, which
                  had just before exhibited the most watchful anxiety, lighted up with joy, as if it
                  had dismantled its care for some new scene of worldly prosperity.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               AN UNEXPECTED CONFESSION.
               HAVING executed the document, Marston ordered one of the servants to show Maxwell
                  his room. The persons who had acted the part of justices, authenticating the
                  instrument, withdrew without further conversation; while the person who had
                  followed Lorenzo, for such was the young man's name, remained as if requiring some
                  further negotiation with Marston. He approached the table sullenly, and with one
                  hand resting upon it, and the other adjusted in his vest, deliberately waited the
                  moment to interrupt the conversation. This man, reader, is Marco Graspum, an
                  immense dealer in human flesh,—great in that dealing in the flesh and blood of
                  mankind which brings with it all the wickedness of the demon. It is almost
                  impossible to conceive the suddenness with which that species of trade changes man
                  into a craving creature, restless for the dross of the world. There he was, the
                  heartless dealer in human flesh, dressed in the garb of a gentleman, and by many
                  would have been taken as such. Care and anxiety sat upon his countenance; he
                  watched the chances of the flesh market, stood ready to ensnare the careless
                  youth, to take advantage of the frailer portions of a Southerner's noble nature.
                  "A word or two with you, Mr. Marston," said he.
               "Sit down, Graspum, sit down," Marston rejoined, ordering Dandy to give him a
                  chair; which being done he seats himself in front of Marston, and commences
                  dilating upon his leniency. "You may take me for an importune feller, in coming
                  this time o'night, but the fact is I've been—you know my feelings for helpin'
                  everybody—good-naturedly drawn into a very bad scrape with this careless young
                  nephew of yourn: he's a dashing devil, and you don't know it, he is. But I've
                  stood it so long that I was compelled to make myself sure. This nephew of yourn,"
                  said he, turning to Lorenzo, "thinks my money is made for his gambling propensities, and if he has used your
                  name improperly, you should have known of it before." At this Lorenzo's fine open
                  countenance assumed a glow of indignation, and turning to his uncle, with a
                  nervous tremor, he said, "Uncle, he has led me into this trouble. You know not the
                  snares of city life; and were I to tell you him—this monster—yea, I say monster,
                  for he has drawn me into a snare like one who was seeking to devour my life—that
                  document, uncle, which he now holds in his hand saves me from a shame and disgrace
                  which I never could have withstood before the world."
               "Ah! you are just like all gamblers: never consider yourself in the light of
                  bringing yourself into trouble. Take my advice, young man; there is a step in a
                  gambler's life to which it is dangerous to descend, and if you have brought your
                  father and uncle into trouble, blame neither me nor my money," returned
                  Graspum.
               "You do not say that there is forgery connected with this affair, do you?"
                  inquired Marston, grasping Lorenzo by the arm.
               "I wish it were otherwise, uncle," replied Lorenzo, leaning forward upon the table
                  and covering his face with his hands. "It was my folly, and the flattery of this
                  man, which have driven me to it," he continued.
               "Oh! cursed inconsistency: and you have now fallen back upon the last resource, to
                  save a name that, once gone, cannot reinstate itself. Tell me, Marco Graspum; are
                  you not implicated in this affair? Your name stands full of dark implications; are
                  you not following up one of those avenues through which you make so many victims?
                  What is the amount?" returned Marston.
               "You will know that to-morrow. He has given paper in your name to an uncertain
                  extent. You should have known this before. Your nephew has been leading a reckless
                  gambler's life—spending whatsoever money came into his possession, and at length
                  giving bills purporting to be drawn by you and his father. You must now honour
                  them, or dishonour him. You see, I am straightforward in business: all my
                  transactions are conducted with promptness; but I must have what is due to me. I
                  have a purpose in all my transactions, and I pursue them to the end. You know the
                  purport of this document, Marston; save yourself trouble, and do not allow me to
                  call too often." Thus saying, he took his hat and left the room.
               Uncle," said Lorenzo, as soon as Graspum had left, "I have been led into
                  difficulty. First led away by fashionable associations, into the allurements with
                  which our city is filled, from small vices I have been hurried onward, step by
                  step, deeper and deeper, until now I have arrived at the dark abyss. Those who
                  have watched me through each sin, been my supposed friends, and hurried me onwards
                  to this sad climax, have proved my worst enemies. I have but just learned the
                  great virtue of human nature,—mistrust him who would make pleasure of vice. I have
                  ruined my father, and have involved you by the very act which you have committed
                  for my relief to-night. In my vain struggle to relieve myself from the odium which
                  must attach to my transactions, I have only added to your sorrows. I cannot ask
                  you to forgive me, nor can I disclose all my errors—they are manifold."
               "This is an unexpected blow—one which I was not prepared to meet. I am ready to
                  save your honour, but there is something beyond this which the voice of rumour
                  will soon spread. You know our society, and the strange manner in which it
                  countenances certain things, yet shuts out those who fall by them. But what is to
                  be done? Although we may discharge the obligation with Graspum, it does not follow
                  that he retains the stigma in his own breast. Tell me, Lorenzo, what is the
                  amount?" inquired Marston, anxiously.
               "My father has already discharged a secret debt of fourteen thousand dollars for
                  me, and there cannot be less than thirty thousand remaining. Uncle, do not let it
                  worry you; I will leave the country, bear the stigma with me, and you can
                  repudiate the obligation," said he, pleading nervously, as he grasped his uncle's
                  hand firmer and firmer.
               Among the many vices of the south, spreading their corrupting influence through
                  the social body, that of gambling stands first. Confined to no one grade of
                  society, it may be found working ruin among rich and poor, old and young. Labour
                  being disreputable, one class of men affect to consider themselves born gentlemen,
                  while the planter is ever ready to indulge his sons with some profession they
                  seldom practise, and which too often results in idleness and its attendants. This, coupled to a want of proper
                  society with which the young may mix for social elevation, finds gratification in
                  drinking saloons, fashionable billiard rooms, and at the card table. In the first,
                  gentlemen of all professions meet and revel away the night in suppers and wine.
                  They must keep up appearances, or fall doubtful visitors of these fashionable
                  stepping-stones to ruin. Like a furnace to devour its victims, the drinking saloon
                  first opens its gorgeous doors, and when the burning liquid has inflamed the
                  mental and physical man, soon hurries him onward into those fascinating
                  habitations where vice and voluptuousness mingle their degrading powers. Once in
                  these whirlpools of sin, the young man finds himself borne away by every species
                  of vicious allurement—his feelings become unrestrained, until at length that last
                  spark of filial advice which had hovered round his consciousness dies out. When
                  this is gone, vice becomes the great charmer, and with its thousand snares and
                  resplendent workers never fails to hold out a hope with each temptation; but while
                  the victim now and then asks hope to be his guardian, he seldom thinks how surely
                  he is sinking faster and faster to an irretrievable depth.
               Through this combination of snares—all having their life-springs in
                  slavery—Lorenzo brought ruin upon his father, and involved his uncle. With an
                  excellent education, a fine person, frank and gentle demeanour, he made his way
                  into the city, and soon attracted the attention of those who affect to grace
                  polished society. Had society laid its restraints upon character and personal
                  worth, it would have been well for Lorenzo; but the neglect to found this moral
                  conservator only serves to increase the avenues to vice, and to bring men from
                  high places into the lowest moral scale. This is the lamentable fault of southern
                  society; and through the want of that moral bulwark, so protective of society in
                  the New England States—personal worth—estates are squandered, families brought to
                  poverty, young men degraded, and persons once happy driven from those homes they
                  can only look back upon with pain and regret. The associations of birth,
                  education, and polished society—so much valued by the southerner—all become as
                  nothing when poverty sets its seal upon the victim.
               And yet, among some classes in the south there exists a religious sentiment
                  apparently grateful; but what credit for sincerity shall we accord to it when the
                  result proves that no part of the organisation itself works for the elevation of a
                  degraded class? How much this is to be regretted we leave to the reader's
                  discrimination. The want of a greater effort to make religious influence
                  predominant has been, and yet is, a source of great evil. But let us continue our
                  narrative, and beg the reader's indulgence for having thus transgressed.
               Flattered and caressed among gay assemblages, Lorenzo soon found himself drawn
                  beyond their social pleasantries into deeper and more alluring excitements. His
                  frequent visits at the saloon and gambling-tables did not detract, for a time,
                  from the social position society had conferred upon him.
               His parents, instead of restraining, fostered these associations, prided
                  themselves on his reception, providing means of maintaining him in this style of
                  living. Vanity and passion led him captive in their gratifications; they were
                  inseparable from the whirlpool of confused society that triumphs at the
                  south,—that leads the proud heart writhing in the agony of its follies. He cast
                  himself upon this, like a frail thing upon a rapid stream, and—forgetting the
                  voyage was short—found his pleasures soon ended in the troubled waters of misery
                  and disgrace.
               There is no fundamental morality in the south, nor is education invested with the
                  material qualities of social good; in this it differs from the north, against
                  which it is fast building up a political and social organisation totally at
                  variance. Instead of maintaining those great principles upon which the true
                  foundation of the republic stands, the south allows itself to run into a
                  hyper-aristocratic vagueness, coupled with an arbitrary determination to
                  perpetuate its follies for the guidance of the whole Union. And the effect of this
                  becomes still more dangerous, when it is attempted to carry it out under the name
                  of democracy,—American democracy! In this manner it serves the despotic ends of
                  European despots: they point to the freest government in the world for examples of
                  their own absolutism, shield their autocracy beneath its democracy, and with it
                  annihilate the rights of the commoner.
               Heedlessly wending his way, the man of rank and station at one side, the courtesan with 
                     hre
                     her
                   bland smiles at the other, Lorenzo had not seen the black poniard that
                  was to cut the cord of his downfall,—it had remained gilded. He drank copious
                  draughts at the house of licentiousness, became infatuated with the soft music
                  that leads the way of the unwary, until at length, he, unconsciously at it were,
                  found himself in the midst of a clan who are forming a plot to put the black seal
                  upon his dishonour. Monto Graspum, his money playing through the hands of his
                  minions in the gambling rooms, had professed to be his friend. He had watched his
                  pliable nature, had studied the resources of his parents, knew their kindness,
                  felt sure of his prey while abetting the downfall. Causing him to perpetrate the
                  crime, from time to time, he would incite him with prospects of retrieve, guide
                  his hand to consummate the crime again, and watch the moment when he might reap
                  the harvest of his own infamy. Thus, when he had brought the young man to that
                  last pitiless issue, where the proud heart quickens with a sense of its
                  wrongs—when the mind recurs painfully to the past, imploring that forgiveness
                  which seems beyond the power of mankind to grant, he left him a poor outcast,
                  whose errors would be first condemned by his professed friends. That which seemed
                  worthy of praise was forgotten, his errors were magnified; and the seducer made
                  himself secure by crushing his victim, compromising the respectability of his
                  parents, making the disgrace a forfeiture for life.
               Unexpected as the shock was to Marston, he bore it with seeming coolness, as if
                  dreading the appearance of the man who had taken advantage of the moment to bring
                  him under obligations, more than he did the amount to be discharged. Arising from
                  the table, he took Lorenzo by the hand, saying:—"Veil your trouble, Lorenzo! Let
                  the past be forgotten, bury the stigma in your own bosom; let it be an example to
                  your feelings and your actions. Go not upon the world to wrestle with its
                  ingratitude; if you do, misfortune will befall you—you will stumble through it the
                  remainder of your life. With me, I fear the very presence of the man who has found
                  means of engrafting his avarice upon our misfortunes; he deals with those in his
                  grasp like one who would cut the flesh and blood of mankind into fragments of
                  gain. Be firm, Lorenzo; be firm! Remember, it is not the province of youth to
                  despair; be manly—manliness even in crime lends its virtue to the falling." At
                  which he bid him good night, and retired to rest.
               The young man, more pained at his uncle's kindness,—kindness stronger in its
                  effects than reproof,—still lingered, as if to watch some change of expression on
                  his uncle's countenance, as he left the door. His face changed into pallid
                  gloominess, and again, as if by magic influence, filled with the impress of
                  passion; it was despair holding conflict with a bending spirit. He felt himself a
                  criminal, marked by the whispers of society; he might not hear the charges against
                  him, nor be within the sound of scandal's tongue, but he would see it outlined in
                  faces that once smiled at his seeming prosperity. He would feel it in the cold
                  hand that had welcomed him,—that had warmly embraced him; his name would no longer
                  be respected. The circle of refined society that had kindly received him, had made
                  him one of its attractions, would now shun him as if he were contagion. Beyond
                  this he saw the fate that hovered over his father's and his uncle's estates;—all
                  the filial affection they had bestowed upon him, blasted; the caresses of his
                  beloved and beautiful sister; the shame the exposure would bring upon her; the
                  knave who held him in his grasp, while dragging the last remnants of their
                  property away to appease dishonest demands, haunted him to despair. And, yet, to
                  sink under them—to leave all behind him and be an outcast, homeless and friendless
                  upon the world, where he could only look back upon the familiar scenes of his
                  boyhood with regret, would be to carry a greater amount of anguish to his destiny.
                  The destroyer was upon him; his grasp was firm and painful. He might live a life
                  of rectitude; but his principles and affections would be unfixed. It would be like
                  an infectious robe encircling him,—a disease which he never could eradicate, so
                  that he might feel he was not an empty vessel among honourable men. When men
                  depicted their villains, moving in the grateful spheres of life, he would be one
                  of their models; and though the thoughtlessness of youth had made him the type
                  haunting himself by day and night, the world never made a distinction. Right and
                  wrong were things that to him only murmured in distrust; they would be blemishes
                  exaggerated from simple error; but the judgment of society would never overlook
                  them. He must now choose between a
                  resolution to bear the consequences at home, or turn his back upon all that had
                  been near and dear to him,—be a wanderer struggling with the eventful trials of
                  life in a distant land! Turning pale, as if frantic with the thought of what was
                  before him, the struggle to choose between the two extremes, and the only seeming
                  alternative, he grasped the candle that flickered before him, gave a glance round
                  the room, as if taking a last look at each familiar object that met his eyes, and
                  retired.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     THE MAROONING PARTY. "It is a pretty shaded retreat—a spot breathing of
                        romance."
                  
               
               CHAPTER V.
               THE MAROONING PARTY.
               A MAROONING pic-nic had been proposed and arranged by the young beaux and belles
                  of the neighbouring plantations. The day proposed for the festive event was that
                  following the disclosure of Lorenzo's difficulties. Every negro on the plantation
                  was agog long before daylight: the morning ushered forth bright and balmy, with
                  bustle and confusion reigning throughout the plantation,—the rendezvous being
                  Marston's mansion, from which the gay party would be conveyed in a barge,
                  overspread with an awning, to a romantic spot, overshaded with luxuriant pines,
                  some ten miles up the stream. Here gay fêtes, mirth and joy, the mingling of happy
                  spirits, were to make the time pass pleasantly. The night passed without producing
                  any decision in Lorenzo's mind; and when he made his appearance on the veranda an
                  unusual thoughtfulness pervaded his countenance; all his attempts to be joyous
                  failed to conceal his trouble. Marston, too, was moody and reserved even to
                  coldness; that frank, happy, and careless expression of a genial nature, which had
                  so long marked him in social gatherings, was departed. When Maxwell, the young
                  Englishman, with quiet demeanour, attempted to draw him into conversation about
                  the prospects of the day, his answers were measured, cold, beyond his power of
                  comprehending, yet inciting.
               To appreciate those pleasant scenes—those scenes so apparently happy, at times
                  adding a charm to plantation life—those innocent merry-makings in spring time—one
                  must live among them, be born to the recreations of the soil. Not a negro on the
                  plantation, old or young, who does not think himself part and parcel of the
                  scene—that he is indispensably necessary to make Mas'r's enjoyment complete! In
                  this instance, the lawn, decked in resplendent verdure, the foliage tinged by the
                  mellow rays of the rising sun, presented a pastoral loveliness that can only be
                  appreciated by those who have contemplated that soft beauty which pervades a southern landscape at
                  morning and evening. The arbour of old oaks, their branches twined into a panoply
                  of thick foliage, stretching from the mansion to the landing, seemed like a
                  sleeping battlement, its dark clusters soaring above redolent brakes and spreading
                  water-leaks. Beneath their fretted branches hung the bedewed moss like a veil of
                  sparkling crystals, moving gently to and fro as if touched by some unseen power.
                  The rice fields, stretching far in the distance, present the appearance of a
                  mirror decked with shadows of fleecy clouds, transparent and sublime. Around the
                  cabins of the plantation people—the human property—the dark sons and daughters of
                  promiscuous families—are in "heyday glee:" they laughed, chattered, contended, and
                  sported over the presence of the party;—the overseer had given them an hour or two
                  to see the party "gwine so;" and they were overjoyed. Even the dogs, as if incited
                  by an instinctive sense of some gay scene in which they were to take part, joined
                  their barking with the jargon of the negroes, while the mules claimed a right to
                  do likewise. In the cabins near the mansion another scene of fixing, fussing,
                  toddling, chattering, running here and there with sun-slouches, white aprons,
                  fans, shades, baskets, and tin pans, presented itself; any sort of vessel that
                  would hold provender for the day was being brought forth. Clotilda, her face more
                  cheerful, is dressed in a nice drab merino, a plain white stomacher, a little
                  collar neatly turned over: with her plain bodice, her white ruffles round her
                  wrists, she presents the embodiment of neatness. She is pretty, very pretty; and
                  yet her beauty has made her the worst slave—a slave in the sight of Heaven and
                  earth! Her large, meaning eyes, glow beneath her arched brows, while her auburn
                  hair, laid in smooth folds over her ears and braided into a heavy circle at the
                  back of her head, gives her the fascinating beauty of a Norman peasant. Annette
                  plays around her, is dressed in her very best,—for Marston is proud of the child's
                  beauty, and nothing is withheld that can gratify the ambition of the mother, so
                  characteristic, to dress with fantastic colours: the child gambols at her feet,
                  views its many-coloured dress, keeps asking various unanswerable questions about
                  Daddy Bob, Harry, and the pic-nic. Again it scrambles pettishly, sings snatches of
                  some merry plantation song, pulls its braided hat about the floor, climbs upon the
                  table to see what is in the basket.
               Passing to the cabin of Ellen Juvarna, we see her in the same confusion which
                  seems to have beset the plantation: her dark, piercing eyes, display more of that
                  melancholy which marks Clotilda's; nor does thoughtfulness pervade her
                  countenance, and yet there is the restlessness of an Indian about her,—she is
                  Indian by blood and birth; her look calls up all the sad associations of her
                  forefathers; her black glossy hair, in heavy folds, hangs carelessly about her
                  olive shoulders, contrasting strangely with the other.
               "And you, Nicholas! remember what your father will say: but you must not call him
                  such," she says, taking by the hand a child we have described, who is impatient to
                  join the gay group.
               "That ain't no harm, mother! Father always is fondling about me when nobody's
                  lookin'," the child answers, with a pertness indicating a knowledge of his
                  parentage rather in advance of his years.
               We pass to the kitchen,—a little, dingy cabin, presenting the most indescribable
                  portion of the scene, the smoke issuing from every crevice. Here old Peggy, the
                  cook,—an enveloped representative of smoke and grease,—as if emerging from the
                  regions of Vulcan, moves her fat sides with the independence of a sovereign. In
                  this miniature smoke-pit she sweats and frets, runs to the door every few minutes,
                  adjusts the points of her flashy bandana, and takes a wistful look at the
                  movements without. Sal, Suke, Rose, and Beck, young members of Peggy's family, are
                  working at the top of their energy among stew-pans, griddles, pots and pails,
                  baskets, bottles and jugs. Wafs, fritters, donjohns and hominy flap-jacks, fine
                  doused hams, savoury meats, ices, and fruit-cakes, are being prepared and packed
                  up for the occasion. Negro faces of every shade seem full of interest and
                  freshness, newly brightened for the pleasures of the day. Now and then broke upon
                  our ear that plaintive melody with the words, "Down on the Old Plantation;" and
                  again, "Jim crack corn, an' I don't care, for Mas'r's gone away." Then came Aunt
                  Rachel, always persisting in her right to be master of ceremonies, dressed in her
                  Sunday bombazine, puffed and flounced, her gingham apron so clean, her head "did
                  up" with the flashiest bandana in her
                  wardrobe; it's just the colour for her taste—real yellow, red, and blue, tied with
                  that knot which is the height of plantation toilet: there is as little restraint
                  in her familiarity with the gentry of the mansion as there is in her control over
                  the denizens of the kitchen. Even Dandy and Enoch, dressed in their best black
                  coats, white pantaloons, ruffled shirts, with collars endangering their ears, hair
                  crisped with an extra nicety, stand aside at her bidding. The height of her
                  ambition is to direct the affairs of the mansion: sometimes she extends it to the
                  overseer. The trait is amiably exercised: she is the best nigger on the
                  plantation, and Marston allows her to indulge her feelings, while his guests laugh
                  at her native pomposity, so generously carried out in all her commands. She is
                  preparing an elegant breakfast, which "her friends" must partake of before
                  starting. Everything must be in her nicest: she runs from the ante-room to the
                  hall, and from thence to the yard, gathering plates and dishes; she hurries Old
                  Peggy the cook, and again scolds the waiters.
               Daddy Bob and Harry have come into the yard to ask Marston's permission to join
                  the party as boatmen. They are in Aunt Rachel's way, and she rushes past them,
                  pushing them aside, and calling Mas'r to come and attend to their wants. Marston
                  comes forward, greets them with a familiar shake of the hand, granting their
                  request without further ceremony. Breakfast is ready; but, anxious for the
                  amusement of the day, their appetites are despoiled. Franconia, more lovely than
                  ever, presenting that ease, elegance, and reserve of the southern lady, makes her
                  appearance in the hall, is escorted to the table leaning on the arm of Maxwell.
                  Delicacy, sensitiveness, womanly character full of genial goodness, are traits
                  with which the true southern lady is blessed:—would she were blessed with another,
                  an energy to work for the good of the enslaved! Could she add that to the poetry
                  of her nature, how much greater would be her charm—how much more fascinating that
                  quiet current of thought with which she seems blessed! There is a gentleness in
                  her impulses—a pensiveness in her smile—a softness in her emotions—a grace in her
                  movements—an ardent soul in her love! She is gay and lightsome in her youth; she
                  values her beauty, is capricious with her admirers, and yet becomes the most
                  affectionate mother; she can level her frowns, play with the feelings, make her
                  mercurial sympathy touching, knows the power of her smiles: but once her feelings
                  are enlisted, she is sincere and ardent in her responses. If she cannot boast of
                  the bright carnatic cheek, she can swell the painter's ideal with her fine
                  features, her classic face, the glow of her impassioned eyes. But she seldom
                  carries this fresh picture into the ordinary years of womanhood: the bloom
                  enlivening her face is but transient; she loses the freshness of girlhood, and in
                  riper years, fades like a sensitive flower, withering, unhappy with herself,
                  unadmired by others.
               Franconia sat at the table, a pensiveness pervading her countenance that bespoke
                  melancholy: as she glanced inquiringly round, her eyes rested upon Lorenzo
                  fixedly, as if she detected something in his manner at variance with his natural
                  deportment. She addressed him; but his cold reply only excited her more: she
                  resolved upon knowing the cause ere they embarked. Breakfast was scarcely over
                  before the guests of the party from the neighbouring plantations began to assemble
                  in the veranda, leaving their servants in charge of the viands grouped together
                  upon the grass, under a clump of oaks a few rods from the mansion. Soon the
                  merry-makers, about forty in number, old and young, their servants following,
                  repaired to the landing, where a long barge, surrounded by brakes and
                  water-lilies, presented another picture.
               "Him all straight, Mas'r—him all straight, jus so!" said Daddy Bob, as he strode
                  off ahead, singing "Dis is de way to de jim crack corn."
               Servants of all ages and colour, mammies and daddies, young 'uns and prime
                  fellows,—"wenches" that had just become hand-maids,—brought up the train, dancing,
                  singing, hopping, laughing, and sporting: some discuss the looks of their young
                  mistresses, others are criticising their dress. Arrived at the landing, Daddy Bob
                  and Harry, full of cares, are hurrying several prime fellows, giving orders to
                  subordinate boatmen about getting the substantial on board,—the baskets of
                  champagne, the demijohns, the sparkling nectar. The young beaux and belles,
                  mingling with their dark sons and daughters of servitude, present a motley group indeed—a scene from which the
                  different issues of southern life may be faithfully drawn.
               A band of five musicians, engaged to enliven the sports of the day with their
                  music, announce, "All on board!" and give the signal for starting by striking up
                  "Life on the Ocean Wave." Away they speed, drawn by horses on the bank, amidst the
                  waving of handkerchiefs, the soft notes of the music reverberating over the
                  pine-clad hills. Smoothly and gently, onward they speed upon the still bosom of
                  the Ashly;—the deep, dark stream, its banks bedecked with blossoms and richest
                  verdure, is indeed enough to excite the romantic of one's nature. Wild, yet serene
                  with rural beauty, if ever sensations of love steal upon us, it is while mingling
                  in the simple convivialities so expressive of southern life. On, on, the barge
                  moved, as lovers gathered together, the music dancing upon the waters. Another
                  party sing the waterman's merry song, still another trail for lilies, and a third
                  gather into the prow to test champagne and ice, or regale with choice Havannas.
                  Marston, and a few of the older members, seated at midships, discuss the
                  all-absorbing question of State-rights; while the negroes are as merry as larks in
                  May, their deep jargon sounding high above the clarion notes of the music. Now it
                  subsides into stillness, broken only by the splashing of an alligator, whose
                  sports call forth a rapturous shout.
               After some three hours' sailing the barge nears a jut of rising ground on the left
                  bank. Close by it is a grove of noble old pines, in the centre of which stands a
                  dilapidated brick building, deserted for some cause not set forth on the door: it
                  is a pretty, shaded retreat—a spot breathing of romance. To the right are broad
                  lagoons stretching far into the distance; their dark waters, beneath thick
                  cypress, presenting the appearance of an inundated grove. The cypress-trees hang
                  their tufted tops over the water's surface, opening an area beneath studded with
                  their trunks, like rude columns supporting a panoply of foliage.
               The barge stops, the party land; the shrill music, still dancing through the thick
                  forest, re-echoes in soft chimes as it steals back upon the scene. Another minute,
                  and we hear the voices of Daddy Bob and Harry, Dandy and Enoch: they are
                  exchanging merry laughs, shouting in great good-nature nature, directing the
                  smaller fry, who are fagging away at the larder, sucking the ice, and pocketing
                  the lemons. "Dat ain't just straight, nohow: got de tings ashore, an' ye get 'e
                  share whin de white folk done! Don' make 'e nigger ob yourse'f, now, old Boss,
                  doing the ting up so nice," Daddy says, frowning on his minions. A vanguard have
                  proceeded in advance to take possession of the deserted house; while Aunt Rachel,
                  with her cortège of feminines, is fussing over
                  "young missus." Here, a group are adjusting their sun-shades; there, another are
                  preparing their fans and nets. Then they follow the train, Clotilda and Ellen
                  leading their young representatives by the hand, bringing up the rear among a
                  cluster of smaller fry. Taking peaceable possession of the house, they commence to
                  clear the rooms, the back ones being reserved for the sumptuous collation which
                  Rachel and her juniors are preparing. The musicians are mustered,—the young
                     belles and beaux, and not a few old bachelors, gather into the front room,
                  commence the fêtes with country dances, and
                  conclude with the polka and schottische.
               Rachel's department presents a bustling picture; she is master of ceremonies,
                  making her sombre minions move at her bidding, adjusting the various dishes upon
                  the table. None, not even the most favoured guests, dare intrude themselves into
                  her apartments until she announces the completion of her tables, her readiness to
                  receive friends. And yet, amidst all this interest of character, this happy
                  pleasantry, this seeming contentment, there is one group pauses ere it arrives at
                  the house,—dare not enter. The distinction seems undefinable to us; but they, poor
                  wretches, feel it deeply. Shame rankles deep, to their very heart's core. They
                  doubt their position, hesitate at the door, and, after several nervous attempts to
                  enter, fall back,—gather round a pine-tree, where they enjoy the day, separated
                  from the rest. There is a simplicity—a forlornness, about this little group, which
                  attracts our attention, excites our sympathies, unbends our curiosity: we would
                  relieve the burden it labours under. They are Ellen Juvarna, Clotilda, and their
                  children. Socially, they are disowned; they are not allowed to join the
                  festivities with those in the dance, and their feelings revolt at being compelled
                  to associate with the negroes. They are as white as many of the whitest, have the same outlines of interest upon
                  their faces; but their lives are sealed with the black seal of slavery. Sensible
                  of the injustice that has stripped them of their rights, they value their
                  whiteness; the blood of birth tinges their face, and through it they find
                  themselves mere dregs of human kind,—objects of sensualism in its vilest
                  associations.
               Maxwell has taken a deep interest in Clotilda; and the solicitude she manifests
                  for her child has drawn him still further in her favour; he is determined to solve
                  the mystery that shrouds her history. Drawing near to them, he seats himself upon
                  the ground at their side, inquires why they did not come into the house. "There's
                  no place there for us,—none for me," Clotilda modestly replies, holding down her
                  head, placing her arm around Annette's waist.
               "You would enjoy it much better, and there is no restraint upon anyone."
               "We know not why the day was not for us to enjoy as well as others; but it is
                  ordained so. Where life is a dreary pain, pleasure is no recompense for disgrace
                  enforced upon us. They tell us we are not what God made us to be; but it is the
                  worst torture to be told so. There is nothing in it—it is the curse only that
                  remains to enforce wrong. Those who have gifts to enjoy life, and those who move
                  to make others happy, can enjoy their separate pleasures; our lives are between
                  the two, hence there is little pleasure for us," she answered, her eyes moistening
                  with tears.
               "If you will but come with me—"
               "Oh, I will go anywhere," she rejoined, quickly; "anywhere from this; that I may
                  know who I am—may bear my child with me—may lead a virtuous life, instead of
                  suffering the pangs of shame through a life of unholy trouble."
               "She never knows when she's well off. If Marston was to hear her talk in that way,
                  I wouldn't stand in her shoes," interrupted Ellen, with a significant air.
               Touched by this anxious reply, Maxwell determined to know more of her feelings—to
                  solve the anxiety that was hanging upon her mind, and, if possible, to carry her
                  beyond the power that held her and her child in such an uncertain position.
               "I meant into the house," said he, observing that Ellen was not inclined to favour
                  Clotilda's feelings; and just at that moment the shrill sounds of a bugle summoned
                  the party to the collation. Here another scene was enacted, which is beyond the
                  power of pen to describe. The tables, decorated with wild flowers, were spread
                  with meats of all descriptions,—fowl, game, pastry, and fruit, wines, and cool
                  drinks. Faces wearing the blandest smiles, grave matrons, and cheerful
                  planters,—all dressed in rustic style and neatness—gathered around to partake of
                  the feast, while servants were running hither and thither to serve mas'r and
                  missus with the choicest bits. Toasts, compliments, and piquant squibs, follow the
                  wine-cup. Then came that picture of southern life which would be more worthy of
                  praise if it were carried out in the purity of motive:—as soon as the party had
                  finished, the older members, in their turn, set about preparing a repast for the
                  servants. This seemed to elate the negroes, who sat down to their meal with great
                  pomp, and were not restrained in the free use of the choicest beverage. While this
                  was going on, Marston ordered Rachel to prepare fruit and pastry for Ellen and
                  Clotilda. "See to them; and they must have wine too," whispered Marston.
               "I know's dat, old Boss," returned Rachel, with a knowing wink.
               After the collation, the party divided into different sections. Some enjoyed the
                  dance, others strolled through the pine-grove, whispering tales of love. Anglers
                  repaired to the deep pond in quest of trout, but more likely to find water-snakes
                  and snapping turtles. Far in the distance, on the right, moving like fairy
                  gondolas through the cypress-covered lagoon, little barks skim the dark surface.
                  They move like spectres, carrying their fair freight, fanned by the gentle breeze
                  pregnant with the magnolia' sweet perfume. The fair ones in those tiny barks are
                  fishing; they move from tree to tree trailing their lines to tempt the finny tribe
                  here, and there breaking the surface with their gambols.
               Lorenzo, as we have before informed the reader, exhibited signs of melancholy
                  during the day. So evident were they that Franconia's sympathies became enlisted
                  in his behalf, and even carried so far, that Maxwell mistook her manner for
                  indifference toward himself. And, as if to confirm his apprehensions, no sooner had the collation ended
                  than she took Lorenzo's arm and retired to the remains of an old mill, a few rods
                  above the landing. It was a quiet, sequestered spot—just such an one as would
                  inspire the emotions of a sensitive heart, recall the associations of childhood,
                  and give life to our pent-up enthusiasm. There they seated themselves, the one
                  waiting for the other to speak.
               "Tell me, Lorenzo," said Franconia, laying her hand on his arm, and watching with
                  nervous anxiety each change of his countenance, "why are you not joyous? you are
                  gloomy to-day. I speak as a sister—you are nervous, faltering with trouble—"
               "Trouble!" he interrupted, raising his eyes, and accompanying an affected
                  indifference with a sigh. It is something he hesitates to disclose. He has erred!
                  his heart speaks, it is high-handed crime! He looks upon her affectionately, a
                  forced smile spreads itself over his face. How forcibly it tells its tale. "Speak
                  out," she continues, tremulously: "I am a sister; a sister cannot betray a
                  brother's secrets." She removes her hand and lays it gently upon his shoulder.
               Looking imploringly in her face for a few minutes, he replies as if it were an
                  effort of great magnitude. "Something you must not know—nor must the world! Many
                  things are buried in the secrets of time that would make great commotion if the
                  world knew them. It were well they passed unknown, for the world is like a great
                  stream with a surface of busy life moving on its way above a troubled current,
                  lashing and foaming beneath, but only breaking here and there as if to mark the
                  smothered conflict. And yet with me it is nothing, a moment of disappointment
                  creeping into my contemplations, transplanting them with melancholy—"
               "Something more!" interrupted Franconia, "something more; it is a step beyond
                  melancholy, more than disappointment. Uncle feels it sensibly—it pains him, it
                  wears upon him. I have seen it foremost in his thoughts." Her anxiety increases,
                  her soft meaning eyes look upon him imploringly, she fondles him with a sister's
                  tenderness, the tears trickling down her cheeks as she beholds him downcast and in
                  sorrow. His reluctance to disclose the secret becomes more painful to her.
               "You may know it soon enough," he replies. "I have erred, and my errors have
                  brought me to a sad brink. My friends—those who have indulged my follies—have
                  quickened the canker that will destroy themselves. Indulgence too often hastens
                  the cup of sorrow, and when it poisons most, we are least conscious. It is an
                  alluring charmer, betraying in the gayest livery—"
               "Lorenzo," she interrupts, wiping the tears from her eyes. "Tell me all; remember
                  woman's influence—she can relieve others when she cannot relieve herself. Make me
                  your confidant—relieve your feelings."
               "This night, Franconia, I shall bid a painful good-bye to those familiar scenes
                  which have surrounded my life,—to you, my sister, to those faithful old friends of
                  the plantation, Daddy Bob and Harry. They have fondled me, protected me, played
                  with me in my childhood, led me to my boyish sports when all was bright and
                  pleasant, when the plantation had its merry scenes for slave and master. I must go
                  upon the world, mingle with strange life, make experience my guardian. I have
                  committed a crime—one which for ever disgraces the honourable—"
               Crime, crime, crime! weighed itself in her mind. "And what of that?" she rejoined,
                  suddenly; "a sister can forgive a brother any crime; and even a lover, if she love
                  truly, can forget them in her affections. Do not go upon the world; be a man above
                  crime, above the bar of scandal. Have confidence in yourself; do not let the
                  injustice overcome you. Once on the world a wanderer, remember the untold tale of
                  misery, speeding its victims to that death of conscience burning unseen."
               "Nay, Franconia, you mean well; but you have not learned the world. Take this as
                  my advice, remember it when I am gone, and in years to come you will acknowledge
                  its truth—Fortune at the south rests on an unsound foundation! We are lofty in
                  feelings, but poor in principle, poor in government,—poor in that which has built
                  our great republic. Uncertainty hangs over us at every step; but, whatever befall
                  you, stand firm through adversity. Never chide others for the evils that may
                  befall you; bear your burdens without casting reflections on others,—it is nobler!
                  Befriend those who have no power to befriend themselves; and when the world
                  forgets you, do not forget yourself.
                  There is no step of return for those who falter in poverty. To-night I shall leave
                  for the city; in a few days you will know all." Thus saying, he conducted
                  Franconia back to rejoin the party, already making preparations to return.
               He gave her an insight of his troubles, in such a manner as to create deep
                  agitation; and, although satisfied that an event of more than ordinary magnitude
                  was at hand, she could not associate it with the commission of crime. The day,
                  spent with all the conviviality of southern life, ended amidst the clang of merry
                  voices, and soft music: a gay group assembled at the bank, ready to return under
                  the cheering influence of music and moonlight.
               The bugle sounded,—the soft notes of "Home, sweet Home!" followed: the party,
                  forming into double file, gay and grotesque, marched through the grove to the
                  barge. Servants, old and young, were in high glee; some joining in chorus with the
                  music; some preparing the barge, others strewing branches and flowers in the
                  pathway, to the delight of young "mas'r" and "missus,"—all singing. Aunt Rachel,
                  high above her minions in authority, is poised on the bank, giving directions at
                  the very top of her voice. Daddy Bob, Harry, and Dandy—the latter named after
                  "mas'r's" fleetest horse—are freighting their young "missusses" in their arms to
                  the boat, shielding their feet from the damp.
               "Now, mas'r, Old Boss," Bob says, directing himself to Marston, after completing
                  his charge with the young ladies, "Jus' lef' 'um tote, old mas'r safe da'? So 'e
                  don' mus e' foot." And forthwith he shoulders Marston, lands him like a bale of
                  cotton on one of the seats, much to the amusement of those on board, sending forth
                  shouts of applause. The party are on board; all is quiet for a minute; again the
                  music strikes up, the barge is gliding over the still bosom of the fairy-like
                  stream.
               The sun has just sunk into a fiery cloud that hangs its crimson curtains high in
                  the heavens, shedding refulgent beauty over the dark jungle lining the river's
                  banks. And then, twilight, as if stealing its way across the hills, follows,
                  softening the scene. Soon it has gone, the landscape sleeps, tranquilly arched by
                  the serene vault of a southern sky. Everything seems peaceful, reposing, and
                  serene; the air breathes warm and balmy, distributing its invigorating influence.
                  The music has ceased, nothing but the ripple of the water is heard; then the
                  stars, like pearls suspended over the dark surface, begin to glimmer and shine.
                  Above all is the moon, like a silver goddess, rising stealthily and shedding her
                  pale light upon the calm glow.
               Onward, onward, onward, over the still stream, winding its way to the great deep,
                  they move; and again the music echoes and re-echoes through the forest, over the
                  lawn; dying away in chimes that faintly play around us. The sudden changes in the
                  heavens,—monitor of things divine,—call up in Lorenzo's feelings the reverses of
                  fortune that will soon take place on the plantation. He had never before
                  recognised the lesson conveyed by heavenly bodies; and such was the effect at that
                  moment that it proved a guardian to him in his future career.
               It was near midnight when the barge reached the plantation. Fires were lighted on
                  the bank, negroes were here and there stretched upon the ground, sleeping with
                  such superlative comfort that it landed ere they awoke. One by one the parties
                  returned for their homes; and, after shaking hands with Marston, taking an
                  affectionate adieu of Franconia (telling her he would call on the morrow), lisping
                  a kind word to the old negroes, Lorenzo ordered a horse, and left for the city. He
                  took leave of the plantation, of its dearest associations, like one who had the
                  conflict of battle before him, and the light of friendship behind.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               ANOTHER SCENE IN SOUTHERN LIFE.
               IN the city, a few miles from the plantation, a scene which too often affords
                  those degrading pictures that disgrace a free and happy country, was being
                  enacted. A low brick building, standing in an area protected by a high fence,
                  surmounted with spikes and other dangerous projectiles, formed the place. The
                  upper and lower windows of this building were strongly secured with iron gratings,
                  and emitted the morbid air from cells scarcely large enough to contain human
                  beings of ordinary size. In the rear, a sort of triangular area opened, along
                  which was a line of low buildings, displaying single and double cells. Some had
                  iron rings in the floor; some had rings in the walls; and, again, others had rings
                  over head. Some of these confines of misery—for here men's souls were goaded by
                  the avarice of our natures—were solitary; and at night, when the turmoil of the
                  day had ceased, human wailings and the clank of chains might be heard breaking
                  through the walls of this charnel-house. These narrow confines were filled with
                  living beings—beings with souls, souls sold according to the privileges of a free
                  and happy country,—a country that fills us with admiration of its greatness. It is
                  here, O man, the tyrant sways his hand most! it is here the flesh and blood of the
                  same Maker, in chains of death, yearns for freedom.
               We walk through the corridor, between narrow arches containing the abodes of
                  misery, while our ears drink the sad melancholy that sounds in agitated throbs,
                  made painful by the gloom and darkness. Touching an iron latch, the door of a cell
                  opens, cold and damp, as if death sat upon its walls; but it discloses no part of
                  the inmate's person, and excites our sympathies still more. We know the
                  unfortunate is there,—we hear the murmuring, like a death-bell in our ears; it is
                  mingled with a dismal chaos of sound, piercing deep into our feelings. It tells us
                  in terror how gold blasts the very soul of man—what a dark monster of cruelty he
                  can become,—how he can forget the grave, and think only of his living self,—how he
                  can strip reason of its right, making himself an animal with man for his food. See
                  the monster seeking only for the things that can serve him on earth—see him
                  stripping man of his best birth-right, see him the raving fiend, unconscious of
                  his hell-born practices, dissevering the hope that by a fibre hangs over the ruins
                  of those beings who will stand in judgment against him. His soul, like their
                  faces, will be black, when theirs has been whitened for judgment in the world to
                  come!
               Ascending a few steps, leading into a centre building—where the slave merchant is
                  polished into respectability—we enter a small room at the right hand. Several men,
                  some having the appearance of respectable merchants, some dressed in a coarse,
                  red-mixed homespun, others smoking cigars very leisurely, are seated at a table,
                  upon which are several bottles and tumblers. They drank every few minutes, touched
                  glasses, uttered the vilest imprecations. Conspicuous among them is Marco Graspum:
                  it is enough that we have before introduced him to the reader at Marston's
                  mansion. His dark peering eyes glisten as he sits holding a glass of liquor in one
                  hand, and runs his fingers through his bristly hair with the other. "The depths of
                  trade are beyond some men," he says, striking his hand on the table; then,
                  catching up a paper, tears it into pieces. "Only follow my directions; and there
                  can be no missing your man," he continued, addressing one who sat opposite to him;
                  and who up to that time had been puffing his cigar with great unconcern. His whole
                  energies seemed roused to action at the word. After keeping his eyes fixed upon
                  Graspum for more than a minute, he replied, at the same time replenishing his
                  cigar with a fresh one—
               "Yee'h sees, Marco,—you'r just got to take that ar' say back, or stand an
                  all-fired chaffing. You don't scar' this 'un, on a point a' business. If I hain't
                  larned to put in the big pins, no fellow has. When ye wants to 'sap' a tall 'un,
                  like Marston, ye stands shy until ye thinks he's right for pulling, and then ye'll
                  make a muffin on him, quicker. But, ye likes to have yer own way in gettin' round
                  things, so that a fellow can't stick a pinte to make a hundred or two unless he weaves his way clean through the
                  law—unless he understands Mr. Justice, and puts a double blinder on
                  his eye. There's nothing like getting on the right side of a fellow what knows how
                  to get on the wrong side of the law; and seeing how I've studied Mr.
                     Justice a little bit better than he's studied his books, I knows just
                  what can be done with him when a feller's got chink in his pocket. You can't buy
                  'em, sir, they're so modest; but you can coax 'em at a mighty cheaper rate—you can
                  do that!" "And ye can make him feel as if law and his business warn't two and
                  two," rejoined Anthony Romescos, a lean, wiry man, whose small indescribable face,
                  very much sun-scorched, is covered with bright sandy hair, matted and uncombed.
                  His forehead is low, the hair grows nearly to his eyebrows, profuse and red; his
                  eyes wander and glisten with desperation; he is a merciless character. Men fear
                  him, dread him; he sets the law at defiance, laughs when he is told he is the
                  cunningest rogue in the county. He owns to the fearful; says it has served him
                  through many a hard squeeze; but now that he finds law so necessary to carry out
                  villainy, he's taken to studying it himself. His dress is of yellow cotton, of
                  which he has a short roundabout and loose pantaloons. His shirt bosom is open, the
                  collar secured at the neck with a short black ribbon; he is much bedaubed with
                  tobacco-juice, which he has deposited over his clothes for the want of a more
                  convenient place. A gray, slouch hat usually adorns his head, which, in
                  consequence of the thinking it does, needs a deal of scratching. Reminding us how
                  careful he is of his feet, he shows them ensconced in a pair of Indian moccasins
                  ornamented with bead-work; and, as if we had not become fully conscious of his
                  power, he draws aside his roundabout, and there, beneath the waist of his
                  pantaloons, is a girdle, to which a large hunting-knife is attached, some five
                  inches of the handle protruding above the belt. "Now, fellers, I tell ye what's
                  what, ye'r point-up at bragin'; but ye don't come square up to the line when
                  there's anything to put through what wants pluck. 'Tain't what a knowin' 'un like
                  I can do; it's just what he can larn to be with a little training in things
                  requiring spunk. I'm a going to have a square horse, or no horse; if I don't, by
                  the great Davy, I'll back out and do business on my own account,—Anthony Romescos
                  always makes his mark and then masters it. If ye don't give Anthony a fair
                  showin', he'll set up business on his own account, and pocket the comins in. Now!
                  thar's Dan Bengal and his dogs; they can do a thing or two in the way of trade now
                  and then; but it requires the cunnin as well as the plucky part of a feller. It
                  makes a great go when they're combined, though,—they ala's makes sure game and
                  slap-up profit."
               "Hold a stave, Anthony," interrupted a grim-visaged individual who had just filled
                  his glass with whiskey, which he declared was only to counteract the effect of
                  what he had already taken. He begs they will not think him half so stupid as he
                  seems, says he is always well behaved in genteel society, and is fully convinced
                  from the appearance of things that they are all gentlemen. He wears a
                  semi-bandittical garb, which, with his craven features, presents his character in
                  all its repulsiveness. "You needn't reckon on that courage o' yourn, old fellow;
                  this citizen can go two pins above it. If you wants a showin', just name the mark.
                  I've seed ye times enough,—how ye would not stand ramrod when a nigger looked
                  lightning at ye. Twice I seed a nigger make ye show flum; and ye darn't make the
                  cussed critter toe the line trim up, nohow," he mumbles out, dropping his tumbler
                  on the table, spilling his liquor. They are Graspum's "men;" they move as he
                  directs—carry out his plans of trade in human flesh. Through these promulgators of
                  his plans, his plots, his desperate games, he has become a mighty man of trade.
                  They are all his good fellows—they are worth their weight in gold; but he can
                  purchase their souls for any purpose, at any price! "Ah, yes, I see—the best I can
                  do don't satisfy. My good fellows, you are plum up on business, do the square
                  thing; but you're becomin' a little too familiar. Doing the nigger business is one
                  thing, and choosing company's another. Remember, gentlemen, I hold a position in
                  society, I do," says Graspum, all the dignity of his dear self glowing in his
                  countenance.
               "I see! There's no spoilin' a gentleman what's got to be one by his merits in
                  trade. Thar's whar ye takes the shine out of us. Y'er gentleman gives ye a right
                  smart chance to walk into them ar' big bugs what's careless,—don't think yer
                  comin' it over 'em with a sort o' dignity what don't 'tract no s'picion." rejoined Romescos,
                  taking up his hat, and placing it carelessly on his head, as if to assure Graspum
                  that he is no better than the rest.
               "Comprehend me, comprehend me, gentlemen! There can, and must be, dignity in
                  nigger trading; it can be made as honourable as any other branch of business. For
                  there is an intricacy about our business requiring more dignity and ability than
                  general folks know. You fellers couldn't carry out the schemes, run the law down,
                  keep your finger on people's opinion, and them sort o' things, if I didn't take a
                  position in society what 'ud ensure puttin' ye straight through. South's the place
                  where position's worth somethin'; and then, when we acts independent, and don't
                  look as if we cared two toss-ups, ah!"
               "I wonder you don't set up a dignity shop, and go to selling the article;—might
                  have it manufactured to sell down south."
               "Ah, Romescos," continued Graspum, "you may play the fool; but you must play it
                  wisely to make it profitable. Here, position puts law at defiance!—here it puts
                  croakers over humanity to rest—here, when it has money, it makes lawyers talk
                  round the points, get fat among themselves, fills the old judge's head with
                  anything; so that he laughs and thinks he don't know nothin'. Listen to what I'm
                  goin' to say, because you'll all make somethin' out on't. I've just got the
                  dignity to do all; and with the coin to back her up, can safe every chance. When
                  you fellers get into a snarl running off a white 'un, or a free nigger, I has to
                  bring out the big talk to make it seem how you didn't understand the thing.
                  'Tain't the putting the big on, but it's the keepin' on it on. You'd laugh to see
                  how I does it; it's the way I keeps you out of limbo, though."
               We have said these men were Graspum's "men;" they are more—they are a band of
                  outlaws, who boast of living in a free country, where its institutions may be
                  turned into despotism. They carry on a system of trade in human bodies; they stain
                  the fairest spots of earth with their crimes. They set law at defiance—they scoff
                  at the depths of hell that yawn for them,—the blackness of their villainy is known
                  only in heaven. Earth cares little for it; and those familiar with the devices of
                  dealers in human bodies shrink from the shame of making them known to the world.
                  There was a discontent in the party, a clashing of interests, occasioned by the
                  meagre manner in which Graspum had divided the spoils of their degradation. He had
                  set his dignity and position in society at a much higher value than they were
                  willing to recognise,—especially when it was to share the spoils in proportion.
                  Dan Bengal, so called from his ferocity of character, was a celebrated dog-trainer
                  and negro-hunter, "was great in doing the savager portion of negro business."
                  This, Romescos contended, did not require so much cunning as his branch of the
                  business—which was to find "loose places," where doubtful whites see
                  out remnants of the Indian race, and free negroes could be found easy objects of
                  prey; to lay plots, do the "sharp," carry out plans for running all free rubbish down south, where they would sell for something.
               "True! it's all true as sunshine," says Romescos; "we understand Mr. Graspum
                  inside and out. But ye ain't paid a dime to get me out of any scrape. I was larned
                  to nigger business afore I got into the 'tarnal thing; and when I just gits me eye
                  on a nigger what nobody don't own, I comes the sly over him—puts him through a
                  course of nigger diplomacy. The way he goes down to the Mississippi is a caution
                  to nigger property!"
               He has enlisted their attention, all eyes are set upon him, every voice calls out
                  to know his process. He begs they will drink round; they fill their glasses, and
                  demand that he will continue the interest of his story.
               "My plans are worth a fortune to those who follow the business," he says, giving
                  his glass a twirl as he sets it upon the table, and commences—
               "Born 'cute, you see; trade comes natural. Afore a free 'un don't know it, I has
                  him bonded and tucked off for eight or nine hundred dollars, slap-up, cash and
                  all. And then, ye sees, it's worth somethin' in knowin' who to sell such criturs
                  too—so that the brute don't git a chance to talk about it without getting his back
                  troubled. And then, it requires as much knowin' as a senator's got just to fix
                  things as smooth so nobody won't know it; and just like ye can jingle the coin in
                  yer pocket, for the nigger, what everybody's wonderin' where he can be gone to. I
                  tell ye what, it takes some stameny to keep the price of a prime feller in your
                  pocket, and wonder along with the rest
                  where the rascal can be. If you'd just see Bob Osmand doe it up, you'd think his
                  face was made for a methodist deacon in camp meeting-time. The way he comes it
                  when he wants to prove a free nigger's a runaway, would beat all the disciples of
                  Blackstone between here and old Kentuck. And then, Bob's any sort of a gentleman,
                  what you don't get in town every day, and wouldn't make a bad senator, if he'd bin
                  in Congress when the compromise was settled upon,—'cos he can reason right into
                  just nothin' at all. Ye see it ain't the feelings that makes a feller a gentleman
                  in our business, it's knowing the human natur o' things; how to be a statesman,
                  when ye meets the like, how to be a gentleman, and talk polite things, and sich
                  like; how to be a jolly fellow, an' put the tall sayings into the things of life;
                  and when ye gets among the lawyers, to know all about the pintes of the law, and
                  how to cut off the corners, so they'll think ye're bin a parish judge. And then,
                  when ye comes before the squire, just to talk dignity to him—tell him where the
                  law is what he don't seem to comprehend. You've got to make a right good feller of
                  the squire by sticking a fee under his vest-pocket when he don't obsarve it. And
                  then, ye know, when ye make the squire a right good feller, you must keep him to
                  the point; and when there's any swarin' to be done, he's just as easily satisfied
                  as the law. It's all business, you see; and thar's just the same kind a thing in
                  it; because profit rules principle, and puts a right smart chance o' business into
                  their hands without troubling their consciences. But then, Bob ain't got the
                  cunnin' in him like I—nor he can't "rope-in on the sly,"—knock down
                  and drag out, and just tell a whole possee to come on, as I do. And that's what ye
                  don't seem to come at, Graspum," said Romescos, again filling his glass, and
                  drawing a long black pipe from his pocket prepares it for a smoke.
               "Now, the trouble is, you all think you can carry out these matters on your own
                  hook; but it's no go, and you'll find it so. It's a scheme that must have larger
                  means at the head of it; and each man's rights must be stipulated, and paid
                  according to his own enterprise. But this discontent is monstrous and injurious,
                  and if continued will prove unprofitable. You see, fellers, you've no
                  responsibility, and my position is your protection, and if you don't get rich you
                  must not charge the blame to me; and then just see how you live now to what you
                  did when ranging the piny woods and catching a stray nigger here and there, what
                  didn't hardly pay dog money. There's a good deal in the sport of the thing, too;
                  and ye know it amounts to a good deal to do the gentleman and associate with big
                  folks, who puts the business into one's hands, by finding out who's got lean
                  purses and prime niggers," rejoined Graspum, very coolly.
               "Ah, yes; that's the way ye comes it over these haristocrats, by doin' the modest.
                  Now, Graspum, 'tain't no trouble to leak a sap like that Lorenzo, and make his
                  friends stand the blunt after we've roped him into your fixings," replied
                  Romescos.
               "No, no; not a bit of it," resounded several voices. "We do all the dragwork with
                  the niggers, and Graspum gets the tin."
               "But he pays for the drink. Come, none of this bickering; we must agree upon
                  business, and do the thing up brown under the old system," interrupted
                  another.
               "Hold! close that bread trap o' yourn," Romescos shouts at the top of his voice.
                  "You're only a green croaker from the piny woods, where gophers crawl independent;
                  you ain't seen life on the borders of Texas. Fellers, I can whip any man in the
                  crowd,—can maker the best stump speech, can bring up the best logic; and can prove
                  that the best frightenin' man is the best man in the nigger business. Now, if you
                  wants a brief sketch of this child's history, ye can have it." Here Romescos
                  entered into an interesting account of himself. He was the descendant of a good
                  family, living in the city of Charleston; his parents, when a youth, had
                  encouraged his propensities for bravery. Without protecting them with that medium
                  of education which assimilates courage with gentlemanly conduct, carrying out the
                  nobler impulses of our nature, they allowed him to roam in that sphere which
                  produces its ruffians. At the age of fifteen he entered a counting-room, when his
                  quick mercurial temperament soon rendered him expert at its minor functions. Three
                  years had hardly elapsed when, in a moment of passion, he drew his dirk, (a weapon
                  he always carried) and, in making a plunge at his antagonist, inflicted a wound in
                  the breast of a near friend. The wound was deep, and proved fatal. For this he was
                  arraigned before a jury, tried for his
                  life. He proved the accident by an existing friendship—he was honourably
                  acquitted. His employer, after reproaching him for his proceedings, again admitted
                  him into his employment. Such, however, was his inclination to display the
                  desperado, that before the expiration of another year he killed a negro, shot two
                  balls at one of his fellows, one of which was well nigh proving fatal, and left
                  the state. His recklessness, his previous acts of malignity, his want of position,
                  all left him little hope of escaping the confines of a prison. Fleeing to parts
                  unknown, his absence relieved the neighbourhood of a responsibility. For a time,
                  he roamed among farmers and drovers in the mountains of Tennessee; again he did
                  menial labour, often forced to the direst necessity to live. One day, when nearly
                  famished, he met a slave-driver, conducting his coffle towards the
                  Mississippi, to whom he proffered his services. The coarse driver readily accepted
                  them; they proceeded on together, and it was not long before they found themselves
                  fitting companions. The one was desperate—the other traded in desperation. An
                  ardent nature, full of courage and adventure, was a valuable acquisition to the
                  dealer, who found that he had enlisted a youngster capable of relieving him of
                  inflicting that cruelty so necessary to his profession. With a passion for
                  inflicting torture, this youth could now gratify it upon those unfortunate beings
                  of merchandise who were being driven to the shambles: he could gloat in the
                  exercise of those natural propensities which made the infliction of pain a
                  pleasant recreation. In the trade of human flesh all these cruel traits became
                  valuable; they enabled him to demand a good price for his services. Initiated in
                  all the mysteries of the trade, he was soon entrusted with gangs of very
                  considerable extent; then he made purchases, laid plans to entrap free negroes,
                  performed the various intricacies of procuring affidavits with which to make slave
                  property out of free flesh. Nature was nature, and what was hard in him soon
                  became harder; he could crib "doubtful white stuff" that was a nuisance among
                  folks, and sell it for something he could put in his pocket. In this way Romescos
                  accumulated several hundred dollars; but avarice increased, and with it his
                  ferocity. It belonged to the trade, a trade of wanton depravity. He became the
                  terror of those who assumed to look upon a negro's sufferings ings with sympathy,
                  scoffing at the finer feelings of mankind. Twice had his rapacity been let
                  loose—twice had it nearly brought him to the gallows, or to the tribunal of Judge
                  Lynch. And now, when completely inured in the traffic of human flesh,—that traffic
                  which transposes man into a demon, his progress is checked for a while by a false
                  step.
               It was this; and this only to the deep disgrace of the freest and happiest country
                  on earth. A poor orphan girl, like many of her class in our hospitable slave
                  world, had been a mere cast-off upon the community. She knew nothing of the world,
                  was ignorant, could neither read nor write,—something quite common
                  in the south, but seldom known in New England. Thus she became the associate of
                  depraved negroes, and again, served Romescos as a victim. Not content with this,
                  after becoming tired of her, he secured her in the slave-pen of one of his fellow
                  traders. Here he kept her for several weeks, closely confined, feeding her with
                  grits. Eventually "running" her to Vicksburg, he found an accomplice to sign a
                  bill of sale, by which he sold her to a notorious planter, who carried her into
                  the interior. The wretched girl had qualities which the planter saw might, with a
                  little care, be made extremely valuable in the New Orleans market,—one was natural
                  beauty. She was not suitable property for the agricultural department of either a
                  cotton or sugar plantation, nor was she "the stripe" to increase prime stock;
                  hence she must be prepared for the general market. When qualified according to
                  what the planter knew would suit the fancy market, she was conveyed to New
                  Orleans, a piece of property bright as the very brightest, very handsome, not very
                  intelligent,—just suited to the wants of bidders.
               Here, at the shambles in the crescent city, she remained guarded, and for several
                  weeks was not allowed to go beyond the door-sill; after which a sale was effected
                  of her with the keeper of a brothel, for the good price of thirteen hundred
                  dollars. In this sink of iniquity she remained nearly two years. Fearing the
                  ulterior consequences, she dared not assert her rights to freedom, she dared not
                  say she was born free in a free country. Her disappearance from the village in
                  which she had been reared caused some excitement; but it soon reduced itself to a
                  very trifling affair. Indeed, white trash like this was considered little else than rubbish, not worth bringing up
                  respectably. And while suspicion pointed to Romescos, as the person who could
                  account for her mysterious disappearance, such was the fear of his revenge that no
                  one dared be the accuser. Quietly matters rested, poor virtue was mean
                  merchandise, had its value, could be bought and sold—could be turned to various
                  uses, except enlisting the sympathies of those who study it as a market commodity.
                  A few days passed and all was hushed; no one enquired about the poor orphan,
                  Martha Johnson. In the hands of her creole owner, who held her as a price for
                  licentious purposes, she associated with gentlemen of polite
                  manners—of wealth and position. Even this, though profane, had advantages, which
                  she employed for the best of purposes; she learned to read and to write,—to
                  assimilate her feelings with those of a higher class. Society had degraded her,
                  she had not degraded herself. One night, as the promiscuous company gathered into
                  the drawing-room, she recognised a young man from her native village; the familiar
                  face inspired her with joy, her heart leaped with gladness; he had befriended her
                  poor mother—she knew he had kind feelings, and would be her friend once her story
                  was told. The moments passed painfully; she watched him restlessly through the
                  dance,—sat at his side. Still he did not recognise her,—toilet had changed her for
                  another being; but she had courted self-respect rather than yielded to
                  degradation. Again she made signs to attract his attention; she passed and
                  repassed him, and failed. Have I thus changed, she thought to herself.
               At length she succeeded in attracting his attention; she drew him aside, then to
                  her chamber. In it she disclosed her touching narrative, unfolded her sorrows,
                  appealed to him with tears in her eyes to procure her freedom and restore her to
                  her rights. Her story enlisted the better feelings of a man, while her
                  self-respect, the earnestness with which she pleaded her deliverance, and the
                  heartlessness of the act, strongly rebuked the levity of those who had made her an
                  orphan outcast in her own village. She was then in the theatre of vice, surrounded
                  by its allurements, consigned to its degradation, a prey to libertinism—yet
                  respecting herself. The object of his visit among the denizens was changed to a
                  higher mission, a duty which he owed to his moral life,—to his own manliness. He
                  promised his mediation to better her eventful and mysterious life, to be a friend
                  to her; and nobly did he keep his promise. On the following day he took measures
                  for her rescue, and though several attempts were made to wrest her from him, and
                  the mendacity of slave-dealers summoned to effect it, he had the satisfaction of
                  seeing her restored to her native village,—to freedom, to respectability.*
               
               Proceedings were after some delay commenced against Romescos, but,—we trust it was
                  not through collusion with officials—he escaped the merited punishment that would
                  have been inflicted upon him by a New England tribunal. Again he left the state,
                  and during his absence it is supposed he was engaged in nefarious practices with
                  the notorious Murrel, who carried rapine and death into the unoffending villages
                  of the far west. However, be this as it may, little was known of him for several
                  years, except in some desperate encounter. The next step in his career of
                  desperation known, was joining a band of guerillos led by one of the most intrepid captains that infested the
                  borders of Mexico, during the internal warfare by which her Texan provinces
                  struggled for independence. Freebooters, they espoused the Texan cause because it
                  offered food for their rapacity, and through it they became formidable and
                  desperate foes to the enemy. They were the terror of the ranchoes, the inhabitants fled at their approach; their pillage,
                  rapine, and slaughtering, would stain the annals of barbarous Africa. They are
                  buried, let us hope for the name of a great nation, that they may remain beneath
                  the pale of oblivion.
               In their incursions, as mounted riflemen, they besieged villages, slaughtered the
                  inhabitants, plundered churches, and burned dwellings; they carried off captive
                  females, drove herds of cattle to distant markets. Through the auspices of this
                  band, as is now well known, many young females were carried off and sold into
                  slavery, where they and their offspring yet remain. While pursuing this 
                     *We withhold the details of this too true
                        transaction, lest we should be classed among those who are endeavouring to
                        create undue excitement. The orphan girl we here refer to was married to a
                        respectable mechanic, who afterwards removed to Cincinnati, and with his
                        wife became much respected citizens.
                  
                   nefarious course of life, Romescos
                  accumulated more than twenty thousand dollars; and yet,—though ferocity increased
                  with the daring of his profession,—there was one impulse of his nature, deeply
                  buried, directing his ambition. Amid the dangers of war, the tumult of conflict,
                  the passion for daring—this impulse kept alive the associations of home,—it was
                  love! In early life he had formed an attachment for a beautiful young lady of his
                  native town; it had ripened with his years; the thoughts of her, and the hope of
                  regaining her love if he gained wealth, so worked upon his mind that he resolved
                  to abandon the life of a guerillo, and return
                  home. After an absence of fourteen years he found the object of his early
                  love,—that woman who had refused to requite his affection,—a widow, having buried
                  her husband, a gentleman of position, some months previous.
               Romescos had money,—the man was not considered; he is not considered where slavery
                  spreads its vices to corrupt social life. He had been careful to keep his business
                  a profound secret, and pressing his affections, soon found the object of his
                  ambition keenly sensitive to his advances. Rumour recounted his character with
                  mystery and suspicion; friends remonstrated, but in vain; they were united despite
                  all opposition, all appeals. For a time he seemed a better man, the business he
                  had followed harassed his mind, seeming to haunt him, and poison his progress. He
                  purchased a plantation on the banks of the Santee; for once resolved to pursue an
                  honest course, to be a respectable citizen, and enjoy the quiet of home.
               A year passed: he might have enjoyed the felicity of domestic life, the affections
                  of a beautiful bride; but the change was too sudden for his restless spirit. He
                  was not made to enjoy the quiet of life, the task stood before him like a mountain
                  without a pass, he could not wean himself from the vices of a marauder. He had
                  abused the free offerings of a free country, had set law at defiance; he had dealt
                  in human flesh, and the task of resistance was more than the moral element in his
                  nature could effect. Violations of human laws were mere speculations to him; they
                  had beguiled him, body and soul. He had no apology for violating personal feeling;
                  what cared he for that small consideration, when the bodies of men, women, and
                  children could be sacrificed for that gold which would give him position among the
                  men of the south. If he carried off poor whites, and sold them into slavery, he
                  saw no enormity in the performance; the law invested him with power he made
                  absolute. Society was chargeable with all his wrongs, with all his crimes, all his
                  enormities. He had repeatedly told it so, pointing for proof to that literal
                  observance of the rule by which man is made mere merchandise. Society had
                  continued in its pedantic folly, disregarding legal rights, imposing no restraints
                  on the holder of human property, violating its spirit and pride by neglecting to
                  enforce the great principles of justice whereby we are bound to protect the lives
                  of those unjustly considered inferior beings. Thus ends a sketch of what Romescos
                  gave of his own career.
               We now find him associated with the desperadoes of slave-dealing, in the scene we
                  have presented. After Romescos had related what he called the romance of his
                  life,—intended, no doubt, to impress the party with his power and intrepidity, and
                  enable him to set a higher value upon his services,—he lighted a pipe, threw his
                  hat upon the floor, commenced pacing up and down the room, as if labouring under
                  deep excitement. And while each one seemed watching him intently, a loud knocking
                  was heard at the door,—then the baying of blood-hounds, the yelps of curs, mingling with the murmurs of those poor wretches confined in the cells
                  beneath. Then followed the clanking of chains, cries, and wailings, startling and
                  fearful.
               Dan Bengal sprang to the door, as if conscious of its import. A voice demanded
                  admittance; and as the door opened Bengal exclaimed, "Halloo!—here's Nath Nimrod:
                  what's the tune of the adventure?"
               A short, stout man entered, dressed in a coarse homespun hunting dress, a profuse
                  black beard and moustache nearly covering his face. "I is'nt so bad a feller a'ter
                  all—is I?" he says, rushing forward into the centre of the room, followed by four
                  huge hounds. They were noble animals, had more instinctive gentleness than their
                  masters, displayed a knowledge of the importance of the prize they had just
                  gained.
               "Hurrah for Nath! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah, for Nath! You got him, Nath—did'nt ye?"
                  resounded from several tongues, and was
                  followed by a variety of expressions highly complimentary to his efficiency.
               Romescos, however, remained silent, pacing the floor unconcerned, except in his
                  own anxiety—as if nothing had occurred to disturb him. Advancing to the table, the
                  new visitor, his face glowing with exultation, held forth, by the crispy hair, the
                  blanched and bloody head of an unfortunate negro who had paid the penalty of the
                  State's allowance for outlaws. "There: beat that, who can? Four hundred dollars
                  made since breakfast;" he cries out at the top of his voice. They cast a measured
                  look at the ghastly object, as if it were a precious ornament, much valued for the
                  price it would bring, according to law. The demon expresses his joy, descants on
                  his expertness and skill, holds up his prize again, turns it round, smiles upon it
                  as his offering, then throws it into the fire place, carelessly, like a piece of
                  fuel. The dogs spring upon it, as if the trophy was for their feast; but he
                  repulses them; dogs are not so bad after all—the canine is often the better of the
                  two—the morsel is too precious for canine dogs,—human dogs must devour it. "There
                  is nothing like a free country, nothing; and good business, when it's well
                  protected by law," says Nimrod, seating himself at the table, filling a glass,
                  bowing to his companions, drinking to the health of his friends. He imagines
                  himself the best fellow of the lot. Taking Graspum by the hand, he says, "there is
                  a clear hundred for you, old patron!" pulls an Executive proclamation from his
                  pocket, and points to where it sets forth the amount of reward for the outlaw—dead
                  or alive. "I know'd whar the brute had his hole in the swamp," he continues: "and
                  I summed up the resolution to bring him out. And then the gal o' Ginral Brinkle's,
                  if I could pin her, would be a clear fifty more, provided I could catch her
                  without damage, and twenty-five if the dogs havocked her shins. There was no
                  trouble in getting the fifty, seeing how my dogs were trained to the point and
                  call. Taste or no taste, they come square off at the word. To see the critters
                  trace a nigger, you'd think they had human in them; they understands it so! But, I
                  tell you what, it's one thing to hunt a gal nigger, and another to run down an
                  outlaw what has had two or three years in the swamp. The catching him's not much,
                  but when ye have to slide the head off, all the pious in yer natur comes right up
                  to make yer feelings feel kind a' softish. However, the law protects ye, and the
                  game being only a nigger, different rules and things govern one's feelings."
               Bengal interrupts by laconically insinuating—raising his moody face, and winking
                  at Graspum—that it was all moonshine to talk about trouble in that kind of
                  business; "It's the very highest of exhilarating sport!" he concludes
                  emphatically.
               "Dan!" returns the other, with a fierce stare, as he seizes the bottle and is
                  about to enjoy a glass of whisky uninvited; "let your liquor stop your mouth. I
                  set the whole pack upon the trail at daylight, and in less than two hours they
                  came upon him, bolted him, and put him to the river. The leader nabbed him about
                  half way across, but the chap, instead of giving in, turned and fought like a
                  hero. Twice I thought he would whip the whole pack, but the way they made the rags
                  fly warn't nobody's business. Well, I just come up with him as he plunged into the
                  stream, lifts old sure mark, as gives him about a dozen plugs; and then the old
                  feller begged just so, you'd thought he was a Christian pleadin' forgiveness at
                  the last moment. But, when I seizes him and gives him three or four levellers with
                  the butt of the rifle, ye never saw a sarpent plunge, and struggle, and warp so.
                  Says I, 'It's no use, old feller,—yer might as well give her up ;' and the way his
                  eyes popped, just as if he expected I war'nt goin to finish him. I tell ye, boys,
                  it required some spunk about then, for the critter got his claws upon me with a
                  death grip, and the dogs ripped him like an old corn stalk, and would'nt keep off.
                  And then there was no fracturin his skull; and seeing how he was overpowering me,
                  I just seizes him by the throat and pops his head off quicker than a Chinese
                     executioner.*
                  
               
               "Now, thar' war'nt so much in takin' the gal, cos jist when she seed the dogs
                  comin', the critter took to tree and gin right up: but when I went to muzlin' on
                  her, so she could'nt scream, then she gets saucy; and I promised to gin her
                  bricks,—which, fellers, I reckon yer must take a hand in so the brute won't wake
                  the neighbours; and I'll do'e it afore I sleeps," said Nimrod, getting up from
                     the

                   table and playfully touching
                  Romescos upon the arm. "I see ye ain't brightened to-day—Graspum's share don't
                  seem to suit yer, old feller; ah! ah!!" he continued.
               "Just put another ten per cent. upon the out-lining, and running free 'uns, and
                  I'll stand flint," said Romescos, seeming to be acted upon by a sudden change of
                  feelings, as he turned to Graspum, with a look of anxiety.
               "Very well," returned Graspum. "Yer see, there's that Marston affair to be brought
                  to a point; and his affairs are just in such a fix that he don't know what's what,
                  nor who's who. Ther'll have to be some tall swearing done in that case afore it's
                  brought to the hammer. That cunning of yours, Romescos, will just come into play
                  in this case. It'll be just the thing to do the crooked and get round the legal
                  points." Thus Graspum, with the dignity and assurance of a gentleman, gave his
                  opinion, drank with his companions, and withdrew for the night.
               Romescos, Bengal, and Nimrod, soon after descended into the vaults below, followed
                  by a negro bearing a lantern. Here they unbolted one of the cells, dragged forth a
                  dejected-looking mulatto woman, her rags scarcely covering her nakedness. The poor
                  wretch, a child born to degradation and torture, whose cries were heard in heaven,
                  heaved a deep sigh, then gave vent to a flood of tears. They told how deep was her
                  anguish, how she struggled against injustice, how sorrow was burning her very
                  soul. The outpourings of her feelings might have aroused the sympathies of savage
                  hearts; but the slave monsters were unmoved. Humbleness, despair, and even death,
                  sat upon her very countenance; hope had fled her, left her a wreck for whom man
                  had no pity. And though her prayers ascended to heaven, the God of mercy seemed to
                  have abandoned her to her tormentors. She came forward trembling and reluctantly,
                  her countenance changed; she gave a frowning look at her tormentors, wild and
                  gloomy, shrank back into the cell, the folds of straight, black hair hanging about
                  her shoulders.
               "Come out here!" Nimrod commands in an angry tone; then, seizing her by the arm,
                  dragged her forth, and jerked her prostrate on the ground. Here, like as many
                  fiends in human form, the rest fell upon her, held her flat to the floor by the
                  hands and feet, her face downwards, while Nimrod, with a raw hide, inflicted
                  thirty lashes on her bare back. Her cries and groans, as she lay writhing, the
                  flesh hanging in quivering shreds, and lifting with the lash,—her appeals for
                  mercy, her prayers to heaven, her fainting moans as the agony of her torture stung
                  into her very soul, would have touched a heart of stone. But, though her skin had
                  not defiled her in the eyes of the righteous, there was none to take pity on her,
                  nor to break the galling chains; no! the punishment was inflicted with the
                  measured coolness of men engaged in an every-day vocation. It was simply the right
                  which a democratic law gave men to become lawless, fierce in the conspiracy of
                  wrong, and where the legal excitement of trafficking in the flesh and blood of one
                  another sinks them unconsciously into demons.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               "BUCKRA-MAN VERY UNCERTAIN."
               THE caption, a common saying among negroes at the south, had its origin in a
                  consciousness, on the part of the negro, of the many liabilities to which his
                  master's affairs are subject, and his own dependence on the ulterior consequences.
                  It carries with it a deep significance, opens a field for reflection, comprehends
                  the negro's knowledge of his own uncertain state, his being a piece of property
                  the good or evil of which is effected by his master's caprices, the binding force
                  of the law that makes him merchandise. Nevertheless, while the negro feels them in
                  all their force, the master values them only in an abstract light. Ask the negro
                  whose master is kind to him, if he would prefer his freedom and go north?—At first
                  he will hesitate, dilate upon his master's goodness, his affection for him, the
                  kindly feeling evinced for him by the family—they often look upon him with a
                  patriarchal tenderness—and, finally, he will conclude by telling you he wishes
                  master and missus would live for ever. He tells you, in the very simplicity of his
                  nature, that "Eve' ting so unsartin! and mas'r don't know if he die when he gwine
                  to." That when he is dying he does not realise it; and though his intention be
                  good, death may blot out his desires, and he, the dependent, being only a chattel,
                  must sink into the uncertain stream of slave-life. Marston's plantation might have
                  been taken as an illustration of the truth of this saying. Long had it been
                  considered one of eminent profit; his field slaves were well cared for; his
                  favourite house servants had every reasonable indulgence granted them. And, too,
                  Marston's mansion was the pleasant retreat of many a neighbour, whose visits were
                  welcomed by the kindly attention he had taught his domestics to bestow. Marston's
                  fault lay in his belonging to that class of planters who repose too much
                  confidence in others.
               The morning following Lorenzo's departure ushered forth bright and balmy. A quiet
                  aspect reigned in and about the plantation, servants moved sluggishly about, the
                  incidents of the preceding night oppressed Marston's mind; his feelings broke
                  beyond his power of restraint. Like contagion, the effect seized each member of
                  his household,—forcibly it spoke in word and action! Marston had bestowed much
                  care upon Lorenzo and Franconia; he had indulged and idolised the latter, and
                  given the former some good advice. But advice without example seldom produces
                  lasting good; in truth, precept had the very worst effect upon Lorenzo,—it had
                  proved his ruin! His singular and mysterious departure might for a time be
                  excused,—even accounted for in some plausible manner, but suspicion was a stealing
                  monster that would play upon the deeply tinctured surface, and soar above in
                  disgrace. That the Rovero family were among the first of the State would not be
                  received as a palliation; they had suffered reverses of fortune, and, with the
                  addition of Lorenzo's profligacy, which had been secretly drawing upon their
                  resources, were themselves well nigh in discredit. And now that this sudden and
                  unexpected reverse had befallen Marston, he could do nothing for their relief.
                  Involved, perplexed, and distrusted—with ever-slaying suspicion staring him in the
                  face—he was a victim pursued by one who never failed to lay low his object. That
                  man moved with unerring method, could look around him upon the destitution made by
                  his avarice, without evincing a shadow of sympathy. Yes! he was in the grasp of a
                  living Shylock, whose soul, worn out in the love of gold, had forgotten that there
                  existed a distinction between right and wrong.
               Surrounded by all these dark forebodings, Marston begins to reflect on his past
                  life. He sees that mercy which overlooks the sins of man when repentance is pure;
                  but his life is full of moral blemishes; he has sinned against the innocent,
                  against the God of forgiveness. The inert of his nature is unfolding itself,—he
                  has lived according to the tolerated vices of society—he has done no more than the
                  law gave him a right to do! And yet, that very society, overlooking its own
                  wrongs, would now strip him of its associations. He lives in a State where it is
                  difficult to tell what society will approve or reprobate; where a rich man may do
                  with impunity what would consign a poor man to the gallows.*
                   The creatures whom he had made mere objects to serve his sensuality were
                  before him; he traced the gloomy history of their unfortunate sires; he knew that
                  Ellen and Clotilda were born free. The cordon that had bound his feelings to the
                  system of slavery relaxed. For the first time, he saw that which he could not
                  recognise in his better nature—himself the medium of keeping human beings in
                  slavery who were the rightful heirs of freedom. The blackness of the crime—its
                  cruelty, its injustice—haunted him; they were at that very moment held by
                  Graspum's caprice. He might doom the poor wretches to irretrievable slavery, to
                  torture and death! Then his mind wandered to Annette and Nicholas; he saw them of
                  his own flesh and blood; his natural affections bounded forth; how could he disown
                  them? The creations of love and right were upon him, misfortune had unbound his
                  sensations; his own offspring stood before him clothed in trouble thick and
                  dangerous. His follies have entailed a life-rent of misery upon others; the
                  fathomless depth of the future opens its yawning jaws to swallow up those upon
                  whom the fondness of a father should have been bestowed for their moral and
                  physical good.
               As he sits contemplating this painful picture, Aunt Rachel enters the room to
                  inquire if Lorenzo breakfasts with them. "Why! old mas'r, what ail ye dis mornin'?
                  Ye don't seems nohow. Not a stripe like what ye was yesterday; somethin' gi 'h de
                  wrong way, and mas'r done know what i' is," she mutters to herself, looking
                  seriously at Marston.
               "Nothing! old bustler; nothing that concerns you. Do not mention Lorenzo's name
                  again; he has gone on a journey. Send my old faithful Daddy Bob to me." Rachel
                  hastened to fulfil the command; soon brought the old servant to the door. His
                  countenance lighted up with smiles as he stood at the doorway, bowing and
                  scraping, working his red 
                  
                     *If we examine the many rencontres that take place in the south, especially
                        those proving fatal, we will find that the perpetrator, if he be a rich man,
                        invariably receives an "honourable acquittal." Again, when the
                        man of position shoots down his victim in the streets of a
                        city, he is esteemed brave; but a singular reversion takes place if the
                        rencontre be between poor men. It is then a diabolical act, a murder, which
                        nothing short of the gallows can serve for punishment.
                  
                  cap in his hand. There stood the old man, a picture of
                  attachment.
               "Come in, Bob, come in!" Marston says, motioning his hand, "I wish the world was
                  as faithful as you are. You are worthy the indulgence I have bestowed upon you;
                  let me hope there is something better in prospect for you. My life reproves me;
                  and when I turn and review its crooked path—when I behold each inconsistency
                  chiding me—I lament what I cannot recall." Taking the old man by the hand, the
                  tears glistening in his eyes, he looks upon him as a father would his child.
               "In a short time, Bob, you shall be free to go where you please, on the plantation
                  or off it. But remember, Bob, you are old—you have grown grey in faithfulness,—the
                  good southerner is the true friend of the negro! I mean he is the true friend of
                  the negro, because he has associated with him from childhood, assimilated with his
                  feelings, made his nature a study. He welcomes him without reserve, approaches him
                  without that sensitiveness and prejudice which the northerner too often manifests
                  towards him. You shall be free, Bob! you shall be free!—free to go where you
                  please; but you must remain among southerners, southerners are your friends."
               "Yes, mas'r, 'im all just so good, if t'warn't dat I so old. Free nigger, when 'e
                  old, don't gwane to get along much. Old Bob tink on dat mighty much, he do dat!
                  Lef Bob free win 'e young, den 'e get tru' de world like Buckra, only lef 'im de
                  chance what Buckra hab. Freedom ain't wof much ven old Bob worn out, mas'r; and
                  Buckra what sell nigger,—what make 'e trade on him, run 'im off sartin. He sell
                  old nigger what got five dollar wof' a work in 'e old bones. Mas'r set 'um free,
                  bad Buckra catch 'um, old Bob get used up afo' he know nofin," quaintly replied
                  the old man, seeming to have an instinctive knowledge of the "nigger trade," but
                  with so much attachment for his master that he could not be induced to accept his
                  freedom.
               "It's not the leaving me, Bob; you may be taken from me. You are worth but little,
                  'tis true, and yet you may be sold from me to a bad master. If the slave-dealers
                  run you off, you can let me know, and I will prosecute them," returned
                  Marston.
               "Ah! mas'r; dat's just whar de blunt is—in de unsartainty tainty! How I gwane to let mas'r know, when mas'r
                  no larn nigger to read," he quickly responded. There is something in his simple
                  remark that Marston has never before condescended to contemplate,—something the
                  simple nature of the negro has just disclosed; it lies deeply rooted at the
                  foundation of all the wrongs of slavery. Education would be valuable to the negro,
                  especially in his old age; it would soften his impulses rather than impair his
                  attachment, unless the master be a tyrant fearing the results of his own
                  oppression. Marston, a good master, had deprived the old man of the means of
                  protecting himself against the avarice of those who would snatch him from freedom,
                  and while his flesh and blood contained dollars and cents, sell him into slavery.
                  Freedom, under the best circumstances, could do him little good in his old age;
                  and yet, a knowledge of the wrong rankled deep in Marston's feelings: he could
                  relieve it only by giving Daddy Bob and Harry their freedom if they would accept
                  it.
               Relinquishing Daddy's hand, he commanded him to go and bring him Annette and
                  Nicholas. "Bring them," he says, "without the knowledge of their mothers." Bob
                  withdrew, hastened to the cabins in the yard to fulfil the mission. Poor things,
                  thought Marston; they are mine, how can I disown them? Ah, there's the point to
                  conquer—I cannot! It is like the mad torrents of hell, stretched out before me to
                  consume my very soul, to bid me defiance. Misfortune is truly a great purifier, a
                  great regenerator of our moral being; but how can I make the wrong right?—how can
                  I live to hope for something beyond the caprice of this alluring world? My
                  frailties have stamped their future with shame.
               Thus he mused as the children came scampering into the room. Annette, her flaxen
                  curls dangling about her neck, looking as tidy and bright as the skill of Clotilda
                  could make her, runs to Marston, throws herself on his knee, fondles about his
                  bosom, kisses his hand again and again. She loves him,—she knows no other father.
                  Nicholas, more shy, moves slowly behind a chair, his fingers in his mouth the
                  while. Looking through its rounds wistfully, he shakes his head enviously, moves
                  the chair backwards and forwards, and is too bashful to approach Annette's
                  position.
               Marston has taken Annette in his arms, he caresses her; she twirls her tiny
                  fingers through his whiskers, as if to play with him in the toying recognition of
                  a father. He is deeply immersed in thought, smooths her hair, walks to the glass
                  with her in his arms, holds her before it as if to detect his own features in the
                  countenance of the child. Resuming his seat, he sets her on one knee, calls
                  Nicholas to him, takes him on the other, and fondles them with an air of kindness
                  it had never before been their good fortune to receive at his hands. He looked
                  upon them again, and again caressed them, parted their hair with his fingers. And
                  as Annette would open her eyes and gaze in his, with an air of sweetest
                  acknowledgment, his thoughts seemed contending with something fearful. He was in
                  trouble; he saw the enemy brooding over the future; he heaved a sigh, a convulsive
                  motion followed, a tear stealing down his cheek told the tale of his
                  reflections.
               "Now, Daddy;" he speaks, directing himself to old Bob, who stands at the door
                  surprised at Marston's singular movements, "you are my confidant, what do you
                  think the world—I mean the people about the district, about the city—would say if
                  they knew these were mine? You know, Bob,—you must tell me straight out, do they
                  look like me?—have they features like mine?" he inquires with rapid utterance.
               "Mas'r, Bob don' like to say all he feels," meekly muttered the old man.
               "There is the spot on which we lay the most unholy blot; and yet, it recoils upon
                  us when we least think. Unfortunate wretches bear them unto us; yet we dare not
                  make them our own; we blast their lives for selfish ends, yield them to others,
                  shield ourselves by a misnomer called right! We sell the most interesting beings
                  for a price,—beings that should be nearest and dearest to our hearts."
               The old slave's eyes glistened with excitement; he looked on astonished, as if
                  some extraordinary scene had surprised him. As his agitation subsided, he
                  continued, "Mas'r, I bin watch 'im dis long time. Reckon how nobody wouldn't take
                  'em fo'h nobody else's—fo'h true! Dar ain't no spozin' bout 'em, 'e so right smart
                  twarn't no use to guise 'em: da'h just like old Boss. Mas'r, nigger watch dem tings mighty close; more close den
                  Buckra, cos' Buckra tink 'e all right when nigger tink 'e all wrong."
               Marston is not quite content with this: he must needs put another question to the
                  old man. "You are sure there can be no mistaking them for mine?" he rejoins,
                  fixing his eyes upon the children with an almost death-like stare, as Daddy leads
                  them out of the room. The door closes after them, he paces the room for a time,
                  seats himself in his chair again, and is soon absorbed in contemplation. "I must
                  do something for them—I must snatch them from the jaws of danger. They are full of
                  interest—they are mine; there is not a drop of negro blood in their veins, and yet
                  the world asks who are their mothers, what is their history? Ah! yes;
                  in that history lies the canker that has eaten out the living springs of many
                  lives. It is that which cuts deepest. Had I known myself, done what I might have
                  done before it was too late, kindness would have its rewards; but I am fettered,
                  and the more I move the worse for them. Custom has laid the foundation of wrong,
                  the law protects it, and a free government tolerates a law that shields iniquities
                  blackening earth." In this train of thought his mind wandered. He would send the
                  children into a free state, there to be educated; that they may live in the
                  enjoyment of those rights with which nature had blest them. The obstacles of the
                  law again stared him in the face; the wrong by which they were first enslaved, now
                  forgotten, had brought its climax.
               Suddenly arousing from his reverie, he started to his feet, and walking across the
                  floor, exclaimed in an audible voice, "I will surmount all difficulties,—I will
                  recognise them as my children; I will send them where they may become ornaments of
                  society, instead of living in shame and licentiousness. This is my resolve, and I
                  will carry it out, or die!"
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               A CLOUD OF MISFORTUNE HANGS OVER THE PLANTATION.
               THE document Marston signed for Lorenzo—to release him from the difficulties into
                  which he had been drawn by Graspum—guaranteed the holder against all loss. This,
                  in the absence of Lorenzo, and under such stranger circumstances, implied an
                  amount which might be increased according to the will of the man into whose hands
                  he had so unfortunately fallen.
               Nearly twelve months had now elapsed since the disclosure of the crime. Maxwell,
                  our young Englishman, had spent the time among the neighbouring plantations; and
                  failing to enlist more than friendly considerations from Franconia, resolved to
                  return to Bermuda and join his family. He had, however, taken a deep interest in
                  Clotilda and Annette,—had gone to their apartment unobserved, and in secret
                  interviews listened to Clotilda's tale of trouble. Its recital enlisted his
                  sympathies; and being of an ardent and impressible temper, he determined to carry
                  out a design for her relief. He realised her silent suffering,—saw how her
                  degraded condition wrangled with her noble feelings,—how the true character of a
                  woman loathed at being the slave of one who claimed her as his property. And this,
                  too, without the hope of redeeming herself, except by some desperate effort. And,
                  too, he saw but little difference between the blood of Franconia and the blood of
                  Clotilda; the same outline of person was there,—her delicate countenance, finely
                  moulded bust, smoothly converging shoulders. There was the same Grecian cast of
                  face, the same soft, reflective eyes,—filling a smile with sweetness, and again
                  with deep-felt sorrow. The same sensitive nature, ready to yield forth love and
                  tenderness, or to press onward the more impassioned affections, was visible in
                  both. And yet, what art had done for Franconia nature had replenished for
                  Clotilda. But, the servile hand was upon her, she crouched beneath its grasp; it branded her life, and that of
                  her child, with ignominy and death.
               During these interviews he would watch her emotions as she looked upon her child;
                  when she would clasp it to her bosom, weeping, until from the slightest emotion
                  her feelings would become frantic with anguish.
               "And you, my child, a mother's hope when all other pleasures are gone! Are you
                  some day to be torn from me, and, like myself, sent to writhe under the coarse
                  hand of a slave-dealer, to be stung with shame enforced while asking God's
                  forgiveness? Sometimes I think it cannot be so; I think it must all be a dream.
                  But it is so, and we might as well submit, say as little of the hardship as
                  possible, and think it's all as they tell us—according to God's will," she would
                  say, pressing the child closer and closer to her bosom, the agitation of her
                  feelings rising into convulsions as the tears coursed down her cheeks. Then she
                  would roll her soft eyes upwards, her countenance filling with despair. The
                  preservation of her child was pictured in the depth of her imploring look. For a
                  time her emotions would recede into quiet,—she would smile placidly upon Annette,
                  forget the realities that had just swept her mind into such a train of
                  trouble.
               One night, as Maxwell entered her apartment, he found her kneeling at her
                  bed-side, supplicating in prayer. The word, "Oh, God; not me, but my child—guide
                  her through the perils that are before her, and receive her into heaven at last,"
                  fell upon his ear. He paused, gazed upon her as if some angel spirit had touched
                  the tenderest chord of his feelings—listened unmoved. A lovely woman, an
                  affectionate mother, the offspring of a noble race,—herself forced by relentless
                  injustice to become an instrument of licentiousness—stood before him in all that
                  can make woman an ornament to her sex. What to Ellen Juvarna seemed the happiness
                  of her lot, was pain and remorse to Clotilda; and when she arose there was a
                  nervousness, a shrinking in her manner, betokening apprehension. "It is not now;
                  it is hereafter. And yet there is no glimmer of hope!" she whispers, as she seats
                  herself in a chair, pulls the little curtain around the bed, and prepares to
                  retire.
               The scene so worked upon Maxwell's feelings that he could withstand the effect no
                  longer; he approached her, held out his hand, greeted her with a smile: "Clotilda,
                  I am your friend," he whispers, "come, sit down and tell me what troubles
                  you!"
               "If what I say be told in confidence?" she replied, as if questioning his
                  advance.
               "You may trust me with any secret; I am ready to serve you, if it be with my
                  life!"
               Clasping her arms round her child, again she wept in silence. The moment was
                  propitious—the summer sun had just set beneath dark foliage in the west, its
                  refulgent curtains now fading into mellow tints; night was closing rapidly over
                  the scene, the serene moon shone softly through the arbour into the little window
                  at her bedside. Again she took him by the hand, invited him to sit down at her
                  side, and, looking imploringly in his face, continued,—"If you are a friend, you
                  can be a friend in confidence, in purpose. I am a slave! yes, a slave; there is
                  much in the word, more than most men are disposed to analyse. It may seem simple
                  to you, but follow it to its degraded depths—follow it to where it sows the seeds
                  of sorrow, and there you will find it spreading poison and death, uprooting all
                  that is good in nature. Worse than that, my child is a slave too. It is that which
                  makes the wrong more cruel, that mantles the polished vice, that holds us in that
                  fearful grasp by which we dare not seek our rights.
               "My mother, ah! yes, my mother"—Clotilda shakes her head in sorrow. "How strange
                  that, by her misfortune, all, all, is misfortune for ever! from one generation to
                  another, sinking each life down, down, down, into misery and woe. How oft she
                  clasped my hand and whispered in my ear: 'If we could but have our rights.' And
                  she, my mother,—as by that sacred name I called her—was fair; fairer than those
                  who held her for a hideous purpose, made her existence loathsome to herself, who
                  knew the right but forced the wrong. She once had rights, but was stripped of
                  them; and once in slavery who can ask that right be done?"
               "What rights have you beyond these?" he interrupted, suddenly. "There is mystery
                  in what you have said, in what I have seen; something I want to solve. The same
                  ardent devotion, tenderness, affection,—the same touching chasteness, that
                  characterises Franconia, assimilates in you. You are a slave, a menial—she is
                  courted and caressed by persons of rank
                  and station. Heavens! here is the curse confounding the flesh and blood of those
                  in high places, making slaves of their own kinsmen, crushing out the spirit of
                  life, rearing up those broken flowers whose heads droop with shame. And you want
                  your freedom?"
               "For my child first," she replied, quickly: "I rest my hopes of her in the
                  future."
               Maxwell hesitated for a moment, as if contemplating some plan for her escape, ran
                  his fingers through his hair again and again, then rested his forehead in his
                  hand, as the perspiration stood in heavy drops upon it. "My child!" There was
                  something inexpressibly touching in the words of a mother ready to sacrifice her
                  own happiness for the freedom of her child. And yet an awful responsibility hung
                  over him; should he attempt to gain their freedom, and fail in carrying out the
                  project, notwithstanding he was in a free country, the act might cost him his
                  life. But there was the mother, her pride beaming forth in every action, a wounded
                  spirit stung with the knowledge of being a slave, the remorse of her suffering
                  soul—the vicissitudes of that sin thus forced upon her. The temptation became
                  irresistible.
               "You are English!"—northerners and Englishmen know what liberty is.*
                   Northerners could do great things for us, if they would but know us as we
                  are, study our feelings, cast aside selfish motives, and sustain our rights!"
                  Clotilda now commenced giving Maxwell a history of her mother,—which, however, we
                  must reserve for another chapter. "And my mother gave me this!" she said, drawing
                  from her pocket a paper written over in Greek characters, but so defaced as to be
                  almost unintelligible. "Some day you will find a friend who will secure your
                  freedom through that," she would say. "But freedom—that which is such a boon to
                  us—is so much feared by others that you must mark that friend cautiously, know him
                  well, and be sure he will not betray the liberty you attempt to gain." And she
                  handed him the defaced paper, telling him to put it in his pocket.
               
                  *Negroes at the South have a very high opinion of Northern cleverness in
                     devising means of procuring their liberty. The Author here uses the language
                     employed by a slave girl who frequently implored aid to devise some plan by
                     which she would be enabled to make her escape.
               
               "And where is your mother?"
               "There would be a store of balm in that, if I did but know. Her beauty doomed her
                  to a creature life, which, when she had worn out, she was sold, as I may be, God
                  knows how soon. Though far away from me, she is my mother still, in all that
                  recollection can make her; her countenance seems like a wreath decorating our past
                  associations. Shrink not when I tell it, for few shrink at such things now,-I saw
                  her chained; I didn't think much of it then, for I was too young. And she took me
                  in her arms and kissed me, the tears rolled down her cheeks; and she
                  said—'Clotilda, Clotilda, farewell! There is a world beyond this, a God who knows
                  our hearts, who records our sorrows;' and her image impressed me with feelings I
                  cannot banish. To look back upon it seems like a rough pilgrimage; and then when I
                  think of seeing her again my mind gets lost in hopeless expectations"—
               "You saw her chained?" interrupted Maxwell.
               "Yes, even chained with strong irons. It need not surprise you. Slavery is a
                  crime; and they chain the innocent lest the wrong should break forth upon
                  themselves." And she raised her hands to her face, shook her head, and laid
                  Annette in the little bed at the foot of her own.
               What is it that in chaining a woman, whether she be black as ebony or white as
                  snow, degrades all the traits of the southerner's character, which he would have
                  the world think noble? It is fear! The monster which the southerner sees by day,
                  tolerates in his silence, protects as part and parcel of a legal trade, only
                  clothes him with the disgrace that menials who make themselves mere fiends are
                  guilty of, Maxwell thought to himself.
               "I will set you free, if it cost my life!" he exclaimed.
               "Hush, hush!" rejoined Clotilda: "remember those wretches on the plantation. They,
                  through their ignorance, have learned to wield the tyranny of petty power; they
                  look upon us with suspicious eyes. They know we are negroes (white negroes, who
                  are despicable in their eyes), and feeling that we are more favoured, their envy
                  is excited. They, with the hope of gaining favour, are first to disclose a secret.
                  Save my child first, and then save me"—
               "I will save you first; rest assured, I will save you;" he responded, shaking her hand, bidding her good
                  night. On returning to the mansion he found Marston seated at the table in the
                  drawing-room, in a meditative mood. Good night, my friend!" he accosted him.
               "Ah, good night!" was the sudden response.
               "You seem cast down?"
               "No!—all's not as it seems with a man in trouble. How misfortune quickens our
                  sense of right! O! how it unfolds political and moral wrongs! how it purges the
                  understanding, and turns the good of our natures to thoughts of justice. But when
                  the power to correct is beyond our reach we feel the wrong most painfully,"
                  Marston coldly replied.
               "It never is too late to do good; my word for it, friend Marston, good is always
                  worth its services. I am young and may serve you yet; rise above trouble, never
                  let trifles trouble a man like you. The world seems wagging pleasantly for you;
                  everybody on the plantation is happy; Lorenzo has gone into the world to
                  distinguish himself; grief should never lay its scalpel in your feelings. Remember
                  the motto—peace, pleasantry, and plenty; they are things which should always
                  dispel the foreshadowing of unhappiness," says Maxwell, jocularly, taking a chair
                  at Marston's request, and seating himself by the table.
               Marston declares such consolation to be refreshing, but too easily conceived to
                  effect his purpose. The ripest fruits of vice often produce the best moral
                  reflections: he feels convinced of this truth; but here the consequences are
                  entailed upon others. The degradation is sunk too deep for recovery by him,—his
                  reflections are only a burden to him. The principle that moves him to atone is
                  crushed by the very perplexity of the law that compels him to do wrong. "There's
                  what goads me," he says: "it is the system, the forced condition making one man
                  merchandise, and giving another power to continue him as such." He arises from the
                  table, his face flushed with excitement, and in silence paces the room to and fro
                  for several minutes. Every now and then he watches at the window,—looks out
                  towards the river, and again at the pine-woods forming a belt in the background,
                  as if he expected some one from that direction. The serene scene without, calm and
                  beautiful, contrasting with the perplexity that surrounded rounded him within,
                  brought the reality of the change which must soon take place in his affairs more
                  vividly to his mind.
               "Your feelings have been stimulated and modified by education; they are keenly
                  sensitive to right,—to justice between man and man. Those are the beautiful
                  results of early instruction. New England education! It founds a principle for
                  doing good; it needs no contingencies to rouse it to action. You can view slavery
                  with the unprejudiced eye of a philosopher. Listen to what I am about to say: but
                  a few months have passed since I thought myself a man of affluence, and now
                  nothing but the inroads of penury are upon me. The cholera (that scourge of a
                  southern plantation) is again sweeping the district: I cannot expect to escape it,
                  and I am in the hands of a greater scourge than the cholera,—a slow death-broker.
                  He will take from you that which the cholera would not deign to touch: he has no
                  more conscience than a cotton-press," says Marston, reclining back in his chair,
                  and calling the negro waiter.
               The word conscience fell upon Maxwell's ear with strange effect. He had esteemed
                  Marston according to his habits—not a good test when society is so remiss of its
                  duties: he could not reconcile the touch of conscience in such a person, nor could
                  he realise the impulse through which some sudden event was working a moral
                  regeneration in his mind. There was something he struggled to keep from notice.
                  The season had been unpropitious, bad crops had resulted; the cholera made its
                  appearance, swept off many of the best negroes, spread consternation, nearly
                  suspended discipline and labour. One by one his negroes fell victims to its
                  ravages, until it became imperatively necessary to remove the remainder to the
                  pine-woods.
               Families might be seen here and there making their little preparations to leave
                  for the hills: the direful scourge to them was an evil spirit, sent as a
                  visitation upon their bad deeds. This they sincerely believe, coupling it with all
                  the superstition their ignorance gives rise to. A few miles from the mansion,
                  among the pines, rude camps are spread out, fires burn to absorb the malaria, to
                  war against mosquitoes, to cook the evening meal; while, up lonely paths, ragged
                  and forlorn-looking negroes are quietly wending their way to take possession. The
                  stranger might view this forest bivouac as a picture of humble life pleasantly domiciled; but it is one of those
                  unfortunate scenes, fruitful of evil, which beset the planter when he is least
                  able to contend against them. Such events develope the sin of an unrighteous
                  institution, bring its supporters to the portals of poverty, consign harmless
                  hundreds to the slave-marts.
               In this instance, however, we must give Marston credit for all that was good in
                  his intentions, and separate him from the system. Repentance, however produced, is
                  valuable for its example, and if too late for present utility, seldom fails to
                  have an ultimate influence. Thus it was with Marston; and now that all these
                  inevitable disasters were upon him, he resolved to be a father to Annette and
                  Nicholas,—those unfortunates whom law and custom had hitherto compelled him to
                  disown.
               Drawing his chair close to Maxwell, he lighted a cigar, and resumed the disclosure
                  his feelings had apparently interrupted a few minutes before. "Now, my good
                  friend, all these things are upon me; there is no escaping the issue. My people
                  will soon be separated from me; my old, faithful servants, Bob and Harry, will
                  regret me, and if they fall into the hands of a knave, will die thinking of the
                  old plantation. As for Harry, I have made him a preacher,—his knowledge is
                  wonderfully up on Scripture; he has demonstrated to me that niggers are more than
                  mortal, or transitory things. My conscience was touched while listening to one of
                  his sermons; and then, to think how I had leased him to preach upon a neighbouring
                  plantation, just as a man would an ox to do a day's work! Planters paid me so much
                  per sermon, as if the gospel were merchandise, and he a mere thing falsifying all
                  my arguments against his knowledge of the Word of God. Well, it makes me feel as
                  if I were half buried in my own degradation and blindness. And then, again, they
                  are our property, and are bestowed upon us by a legal—"
               "If that be wrong," interrupted Maxwell, "you have no excuse for continuing
                  it."
               "True! That's just what I was coming at. The evil in its broadest expanse is
                  there. We look calmly on the external objects of the system without solving its
                  internal grievances,—we build a right upon the ruins of ancient wrongs, and we
                  swathe our thoughts with inconsistency that we may make the curse of a system
                  invulnerable. It is not that we cannot do good under a bad system, but that we
                  cannot ameliorate it, lest we weaken the foundation. And yet all this seems as
                  nothing when I recall a sin of greater magnitude—a sin that is upon me—a hideous
                  blot, goading my very soul, rising up against me like a mountain, over which I can
                  see no pass. Again the impelling force of conscience incites me to make a
                  desperate effort; but conscience rebukes me for not preparing the way in time. I
                  could translate my feelings further, but, in doing so, the remedy seems still
                  further from me—"
               "Is it ever too late to try a remedy—to make an effort to surmount great
                  impediments—to render justice to those who have suffered from such acts?" inquired
                  Maxwell, interrupting Marston as he proceeded.
               "If I could do it without sacrificing my honour, without exposing myself to the
                  vengeance of the law. We are great sticklers for constitutional law, while we care
                  little for constitutional justice. There is Clotilda; you see her, but you don't
                  know her history: if it were told it would resound through the broad expanse of
                  our land. Yes, it would disclose a wrong, perpetrated under the smiles of liberty,
                  against which the vengeance of high Heaven would be invoked. I know the secret,
                  and yet I dare not disclose it; the curse handed down from her forefathers has
                  been perpetuated by me. She seems happy, and yet she is unhappy; the secret
                  recesses of her soul are poisoned. And what more natural? for, by some unlucky
                  incident, she has got an inkling of the foul means by which she was made a slave.
                  To him who knows the right, the wrong is most painful; but I bought her of him
                  whose trade it was to sell such flesh and blood! And yet that does not relieve me
                  from the curse: there's the stain; it hangs upon me, it involves my inclinations,
                  it gloats over my downfall—"
               "You bought her!" again interrupts Maxwell.
               "True," rejoins the other, quickly, "'tis a trade well protected by our democracy.
                  Once bought, we cannot relieve ourselves by giving them rights in conflict with
                  the claims of creditors. Our will may be good, but the will without the means
                  falls hopeless. My heart breaks under the knowledge that those children are mine.
                  It is a sad revelation to make,—sad in the eyes of heaven and earth. My participation in wrong has proved sorrow to
                  them: how can I look to the pains and struggles they must endure in life, when
                  stung with the knowledge that I am the cause of it? I shall wither under the
                  torture of my own conscience. And there is even an interest about them that makes
                  my feelings bound joyfully when I recur them. Can it be aught but the fruit of
                  natural affection? I think not; and yet I am compelled to disown them, and even to
                  smother with falsehood the rancour that might find a place in Franconia's bosom.
                  Clotilda loves Annette with a mother's fondness; but with all her fondness for her
                  child she dare not love me, nor I the child."
               Maxwell suggests that his not having bought the child would certainly give him the
                  right to control his own flesh and blood: but he knows little of slave law, and
                  less of its customs. He, however, was anxious to draw from Marston full
                  particulars of the secret that would disclose Clotilda's history, over which the
                  partial exposition had thrown the charm of mystery. Several times he was on the
                  eve of proffering his services to relieve the burden working upon Marston's mind;
                  but his sympathies were enlisted toward the two unfortunate women, for whom he was
                  ready to render good service, to relieve them and their children. Again, he
                  remembered how singularly sensitive Southerners were on matters concerning the
                  peculiar institution, especially when approached by persons from abroad. Perhaps
                  it was a plot laid by Marston to ascertain his feelings on the subject, or, under
                  that peculiar jealousy of Southerners who live in this manner, he might have
                  discovered his interview with Clotilda, and, in forming a plan to thwart his
                  project, adopted this singular course for disarming apprehensions.
               At this stage of the proceedings a whispering noise was heard, as if coming from
                  another part of the room. They stopped at the moment, looked round with surprise,
                  but not seeing anything, resumed the conversation.
               "Of whom did you purchase?" inquired Maxwell, anxiously.
               "One Silenus; a trader who trades in this quality of property only, and has become
                  rich by the traffic. He is associated with Anthony Romescos, once a desperado on
                  the Texan frontier. These two coveys would sell their mossmates without a scruple,
                  and think it no harm so long as they turned a dime. They know every justice of the
                  peace from Texas to Fort M'Henry. Romescos is turned the desperado again, shoots,
                  kills, and otherwise commits fell deeds upon his neighbour's negroes; he even
                  threatens them with death when they approach him for reparation. He snaps his
                  fingers at law, lawyers, and judges: slave law is moonshine to those who have no
                  rights in common law—"
               "And he escapes? Then you institute laws, and substitute custom to make them null.
                  It is a poor apology for a namesake. But do you assert that in the freest and
                  happiest country—a country that boasts the observance of its statute laws—a man is
                  privileged to shoot, maim, and torture a fellow-being, and that public opinion
                  fails to bring him to justice?" ejaculated Maxwell.
               "Yes," returns Marston, seriously; "it is no less shameful than true. Three of my
                  negroes has he killed very good-naturedly, and yet I have no proof to convict him.
                  Even were I to seek redress, it would be against that prejudice which makes the
                  rights of the enslaved unpopular."
               The trouble exists in making the man merchandise, reducing him to an abject being,
                  without the protection of common law. Presently the tears began to flow down
                  Marston's cheeks, as he unbuttoned his shirt-collar with an air of restlessness,
                  approached a desk that stood in one corner of the room, and drew from it a
                  somewhat defaced bill of sale. There was something connected with that bit of
                  paper, which, apart from anything else, seemed to harass him most. "But a minute
                  before you entered I looked upon that paper," he spoke, throwing it upon the
                  table, "and thought how much trouble it had brought me, how through it I had left
                  a curse upon innocent life. I paid fifteen hundred dollars for the souls and
                  bodies of those two women, creatures of sense, delicacy, and tenderness. But I am
                  not a bad man, after all. No, there are worse men than me in the world."
               "Gather, gather, ye incubus of misfortune, bearing to me the light of heaven, with
                  which to see my sins. May it come to turn my heart in the right way, to seek its
                  retribution on the wrong!" Thus concluding, Marston covers his face in his hands,
                  and for several minutes weeps like a
                  child. Again rising from his seat, he throws the paper on a table near an open
                  window, and himself upon a couch near by.
               Maxwell attempts to quiet him by drawing his attention from the subject. There is
                  little use, however,—it is a terrible conflict,—the conflict of conscience
                  awakening to a sense of its errors; the fate of regrets when it is too late to
                  make amends.
               While this was going on, a brawny hand reached into the window, and quickly
                  withdrew the paper from the table. Neither observed it.
               And at the moment, Marston ejaculated, "I will! I will! let it cost what it may. I
                  will do justice to Clotilda and her child,—to Ellen and her child; I will free
                  them, send them into a free country to be educated." In his excitement he forgot
                  the bill of sale.
               "Like enough you will!" responds a gruff voice; and a loud rap at the hall-door
                  followed. Dandy was summoned, opened the door, bowed Romescos into the room. He
                  pretends to be under the influence of liquor, which he hopes will excuse his
                  extraordinary familiarity at such a late hour. Touching the hilt of his knife, he
                  swaggers into the presence of Marston, looks at him fixedly, impertinently demands
                  something to drink. He cares not what it be, waits for no ceremony, tips the
                  decanter, gulps his glass, and deliberately takes a seat.
               The reader will perhaps detect the object of his presence; but, beyond that, there
                  is something deep and desperate in the appearance of the man, rendering his
                  familiarity exceedingly disagreeable. That he should present himself at such an
                  untimely hour was strange, beyond Marston's comprehension. It was, indeed, most
                  inopportune; but knowing him, he feared him. He could not treat him with
                  indifference,—there was his connection with Graspum, his power over the poor
                  servile whites; he must be courteous—so, summoning his suavity, he orders Dandy to
                  wait upon him.
               Romescos amuses himself with sundry rude expressions about the etiquette of
                  gentlemen,—their rights and associations,—the glorious freedom of a glorious land.
                  Not heeding Dandy's attention, he fills another glass copiously, twirls it upon
                  the table, eyes Marston, and then Maxwell, playfully—drinks his beverage with the
                  air of one quite at home.
               "Marston, old feller," he says, winking at Maxwell, "things don't jibe so straight
                  as they use't—do they? I wants a stave o' conversation on matters o' business with
                  ye to-morrow. It's a smart little property arrangement; but I ain't in the right
                  fix just now; I can't make the marks straight so we can understand two and two. Ye
                  take, don't ye? Somethin' touching a genteel business with your fast young nephew,
                  Lorenzo. Caution to the wise." Romescos, making several vain attempts, rises,
                  laughing with a half-independent air, puts his slouch hat on his head, staggers to
                  the door, makes passes at Dandy, who waits his egress, and bidding them good
                  night, disappears.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               WHO IS SAFE AGAINST THE POWER?
               THE cholera raging on Marston's plantation, had excited Graspum's fears. His
                  pecuniary interests were above every other consideration—he knew no higher object
                  than the accumulation of wealth; and to ascertain the precise nature and extent of
                  the malady he had sent Romescos to reconnoitre.
               Returning to the long-room at Graspum's slave-pen, we must introduce the reader to
                  scenes which take place on the night following that upon which Romescos secured
                  the bill of sale at Marston's mansion.
               Around the table we have before described sit Graspum and some dozen of his clan.
                  Conspicuous among them is Dan Bengal, and Nath Nimrod, whom we described as
                  running into the room unceremoniously, holding by the hair the head of a negro,
                  and exulting over it as a prize of much value. They are relating their adventures,
                  speculating over the prospects of trade, comparing notes on the result of making
                  free trash human property worth something! They all manifest the happiest of
                  feelings, have a language of their own, converse freely; at times sprinkle their
                  conversation with pointed oaths. They are conversant with the business affairs of
                  every planter in the State, know his liabilities, the condition of his negroes,
                  his hard cases, his bad cases, his runaways, and his prime property. Their
                  dilations on the development of wenches, shades of colour, qualities of stock
                  suited to the various markets—from Richmond to New Orleans—disclose a singular
                  foresight into the article of poor human nature.
               "There's nothing like pushing our kind of business, specially whin ye gits it
                  where ye can push profitably," speaks Bengal, his fiery red eyes glaring over the
                  table as he droops his head sluggishly, and, sipping his whiskey, lets it drip
                  over his beard upon his bosom; "if 't warn't for
                     A DROVE OF VERY MARKETABLE PEOPLE
                     "Ye see, now, Graspum," he quaintly remarks, as he takes up the candle to
                        light his cigar, "whatever ye do is right, so long as the law gives a feller
                        a right to do it. 'Tisn't a bit o' use to think how a man can be too nice in
                        his feelings, when a hundred or two's to be made on nigger property what's
                        delicate, 'taint! A feller feels sore, once in a while, a' cos his
                        conscience is a little touchy, now and then; but it won't do to give way to
                        it—conscience don't bring cash!"
                  
                   Anthony's cunnin' we'd have a pesky deal
                  of crooked law to stumble through afore we'd get them rich uns upset."
               My reader must know that southern law and justice for the poor succumb to popular
                  feeling in all slave atmospheres; and happy is the fellow who can work his way
                  through slavedom without being dependent upon the one or brought under the
                  influence of the other.
               Graspum, in reply to Bengal, feels that gentlemen in the "nigger business" should
                  respect themselves. He well knows there exists not the best feeling in the world
                  between them and the more exclusive aristocracy, whose feelings must inevitably be
                  modified to suit the democratic spirit of the age. He himself enjoys that most
                  refined society, which he asserts to be strong proof of the manner in which
                  democracy is working its way to distinction. Our business, he says, hath so many
                  avenues that it has become positively necessary that some of them should be
                  guarded by men of honour, dignity, and irreproachable conduct. Now, he has sent
                  Anthony Romescos to do some watching on the sly, at Marston's plantation; but
                  there is nothing dishonourable in that, inasmuch as the victim is safe in his
                  claws. Contented with these considerations, Graspum puffs his cigar very
                  composedly. From slave nature, slave-seeking adventures, and the intricacies of
                  the human-property-market, they turn to the discussion of state rights, of freedom
                  in its broadest and most practical sense. And, upon the principle of the greatest
                  despot being foremost to discuss what really constitutes freedom, which, however,
                  he always argues in an abstract sense, Nimrod was loudest and most lavish in his
                  praises of a protective government— a government that would grant great good
                  justice to the white man only. It matters little to Nimrod which is the greater
                  nigger; he believes in the straight principles of right in the white man. It is
                  not so much how justice is carried out when menial beings form a glorious
                  merchandise; but it is the true essence of liberty, giving men power to keep
                  society all straight, to practice liberty very liberally. "Ye see, now, Graspum,"
                  he quaintly remarks, as he takes up the candle to light his cigar, "whatever ye do
                  is right, so long as the law gives a feller a right to do it. 'Tisn't a bit o' use
                  to think how a man can be too nice in his feelings when a hundred or two's to be
                  made on nigger property what's
                  delicate, t'aint! A feller feels sore once in a while, a' cos his conscience is a
                  little touchy now and then; but it won't do to give way to it—conscience don't
                  bring cash. When ye launches out in the nigger-trading business ye must feel
                  vengeance agin the brutes, and think how it's only trade; how it's
                  perfectly legal—and how it's encouraged by the Governor's proclamations. Human
                  natur's human natur'; and when ye can turn a penny at it, sink all the in'ard
                  inclinations. Just let the shiners slide in, it don't matter a tenpence where ye
                  got 'em. Trade's everything! you might as well talk about patriotism among crowned
                  heads,—about the chivalry of commerce: cash makes consequence, and them's what
                  makes gentlemen, south."
               They welcome the spirits, although it has already made them soulless. The negro
                  listens to a dialogue of singular import to himself; his eyes glistened with
                  interest, as one by one they sported over the ignorance enforced upon the weak.
                  One by one they threw their slouch hats upon the floor, drew closer in conclave,
                  forming a grotesque picture of fiendish faces. "Now, gentlemen," Graspum deigns to
                  say, after a moment's pause, motioning to the decanter, "pass it along round when
                  ye gets a turn about." He fills his glass and drinks, as if drink were a necessary
                  accompaniment of the project before them. "This case of Marston's is a regular
                  plumper; there's a spec to be made in that stock of stuff; and them bright bits of
                  his own—they look like him—'ll make right smart fancy. Ther' developing just in
                  the right sort of way to be valuable for market."
               "There's movin' o' the shrewdest kind to be done there, Graspum! Where's the
                  dockerment what 'll make 'um property, eh?" interrupted Nimrod, twisting the hair
                  with which his face is covered into fantastic points.
               "Oh, my good fellows, public opinion's the dockerment; with the bright side of
                  public opinion! Public opinion whispers about Clotilda: it says she looks so much
                  like that niece of Marston's, that you couldn't tell them apart. And they are like
                  two pins, gentlemen; but then one's property and t'other's anything but property.
                  One will bring something substantial in the market: I wouldn't say much about the
                  other. But there's pride in the whole family, and where it's got into the niggers
                  it's worth a few extra dollars. The Marstons and Roveros don't think much of we
                  dealers when they don't want our money; but when they do we are cousins of the
                  right stripe. However, these ere little aristocratic notions don't mount to much;
                  they are bin generous blood-mixers, and now they may wince over it—"
               Graspum is interrupted again. Bengal has been analysing his logic, and rises to
                  dispute the logic of his arguments. He is ready to stake his political faith, and
                  all his common sense—of which he never fails to boast—that mixing the blood of the
                  two races destroys the purity of the nigger, spiles the gauge of the market,
                  detracts from real plantation property, and will just upset the growin' of young
                  niggers. He is sure he knows just as much about the thing as anybody else, has
                  never missed his guess, although folks say he aint no way clever at selection;
                  and, rubbing his eyes after adjusting the long black hair that hangs down over his
                  shoulders, he folds his arms with an independent air, and waits the rejoinder.
               The dingy room breathes thick of deleterious fumes; a gloom hangs over their
                  meditations, deep and treacherous: it excites fear, not of the men, but of the
                  horrors of their trade. A dim light hangs suspended from the ceiling: even the
                  sickly shade contrasts strangely with their black purpose.
               "Variety of shade, my dear Bengal, is none of our business. If you make a division
                  you destroy the property and the principle. We don't represent the South: if we
                  did, my stars! how the abolitionists would start up,—eh! Now, there's a right
                  smart chance of big aristocrat folks in the district, and they think something of
                  their niggers, and some are fools enough to think niggers have souls just as white
                  as we. That's where the thing don't strike our morals alike. It's all right to let
                  such folks represent us—that it is! It tells down north."
               "I goes in for that! It puts a polished face on the brown side of things. That's
                  the way I puts it on when I gets among the big 'uns on 'Change. I talks to one,
                  shakes hands with another, touches my hat to the president of the bank; and then
                  them what don't know thinks how I do a little in the taking a corner of notes
                  line!" "In the same sly way that directors of banks do," interrupts a voice,
                  sullenly and slow. It was long Joe Morphet, the constable's sponge, who did a little in the line of nigger trailing,
                  and now and then acted as a contingent of Graspum. Joe had, silently and with
                  great attention, listened to their consultations, expecting to get a hook on at
                  some point where his services would play at a profit; but it all seemed beyond his
                  comprehension—amounted to nothing.
               "There's something in Joe, gentlemen! But our genteelest folks don't alway do the
                  genteelest things, arter all. Right—right! Joe's right!" Graspum has suddenly
                  comprehended Joe's logic, and brightens up with the possession of a new idea, that
                  at first was inclined to get crosswise in his mind, which he has drilled in the
                  minor details of human nature rather than the political dignity of the state.
                  Joe's ideas are ranging over the necessity of keeping up a good outside for the
                  state; Graspum thinks only of keeping up the dignity of himself. "Well, give in,
                  fellers; Joe's right clever. He's got head enough to get into Congress, and if
                  polished up wouldn't make the worst feller that ever was sent: he wouldn't, to my
                  certain knowledge. Joe's clever! What great men do with impunity little men have
                  no scruples in following; what the state tolerates, knaves may play upon to their
                  own advantage. To keep up the dignity of a slave state, slave dealers must keep up
                  dignity among themselves: the one cannot live without the other. They must affect,
                  and the state must put on, the dignity; and northerners what aint gentlemen must
                  be taught to know that they aint gentlemen." This is the conclusion to which
                  Graspum has arrived on the maturest reflection of a few minutes: it conforms with
                  the opinion and dignity of slaveocracy—must be right, else the glorious Union,
                  with the free-thinking north unfortunately attached, could never be preserved.
                  It's the nut of a glorious compact which the south only must crack, and will
                  crack. Graspum apologised for the thing having escaped his memory so long. He
                  remembered that southerners left no stone unturned that could serve the policy of
                  concentrating slave power; and he remembered that it was equally necessary to keep
                  an eye to the feeling abroad. There were in America none but southern nobles,—no
                  affable gentlemen who could do the grace of polite circles except themselves,—none
                  who, through their bland manners, could do more to repel the awful
                  descriptions given of southern society, nor who could not make strangers believe
                  slaves were happy mortals, happily created to live in all the happiness of slave
                  life. "There's nothing like putting our learned folks ahead—they're polished down
                  for the purpose, you see—and letting them represent us when abroad; they puts a
                  different sort of shine on things what our institution makes profitable. They
                  don't always set good examples at home, but we can't control their tastes on small
                  matters of that kind: and then, what a valuable offset it is, just to have the
                  power of doing the free and easy gentleman, to be the brilliant companion, to put
                  on the smooth when you go among nobility what don't understand the thing!" Graspum
                  adds, with a cunning wink.
               "Pooh! pooh! such talk don't jingle. You can't separate our aristocracy from
                  mistress-keeping. It's a matter of romance with them,—a matter of romance,
                  gentlemen, that's all. The south couldn't live without romance, she couldn't!"
                  adds Nimrod, stretching back in his chair.
               "And where did you get that broad idea from, Jakey? I kind o' likes
                  that sort of philosophy," adds another.
               "Philosophy! I reckon how there is deep and strong philosophy in that ar; but ye
                  can't calc'late much on't when ye haint talents to bring it out. That point where
                  the soul comes in is a puzzler on Yankees; but it takes our editors and parsons to
                  put the arguments where the Yankees can't demolish them. Read the Richmond——, my
                  grandmother of the day, if ye want to see the philosophy of niggers, and their
                  souls. That editor is a philosopher; the world's got to learn his philosophy. Just
                  take that preacher from New Jersey, what preaches in All Saints; if he don't prove
                  niggers aint no souls I'm a Dutchman, and dead at that! He gives 'em broadside
                  logic, gentlemen; and if he hadn't been raised north he wouldn't bin so up on
                  niggers when he cum south," was the quick rejoinder of our knowing expounder, who,
                  looking Graspum in the face, demanded to know if he was not correct. Graspum
                  thinks it better to waste no more time in words, but to get at the particular
                  piece of business for which they have been called together. He is a man of
                  money,—a man of trade, ever willing to admit the philosophy of the man-market, but
                  don't see the difference of honour between the aristocrat who sells his bits in the market, and the honourable dealer who gets but a commission for selling them. And
                  there's something about the parson who, forgetting the sanctity of his calling,
                  sanctifies everything pertaining to slavery. Conscience, he admits, is a wonderful
                  thing fixed somewhere about the heart, and, in spite of all he can do, will
                  trouble it once in a while. Marston—poor Marston!—he declares to be foolishly
                  troubled with it, and it makes him commit grievous errors. And then, there's no
                  understandin' it, because Marston has a funny way of keeping it under such a
                  knotty-looking exterior. Graspum declares he had nothing to do with the breaking
                  out of the cholera, is very sorry for it,—only wants his own, just like any other
                  honest man. He kind o' likes Marston, admits he is a sort of good fellow in his
                  way; mighty careless though, wouldn't cheat anybody if he knew it, and never gave
                  half a minute's thinking about how uncertain the world was. But the cholera—a dire
                  disease among niggers—has broke out in all the fury of its ravages; and it makes
                  him think of his sick niggers and paying his debts. "You see, gentlemen—we are all
                  gentlemen here," Graspum continues,—"a man must pay the penalty of his folly once
                  in a while. It's the fate of great men as well as smaller ones; all are liable to
                  it. That isn't the thing, though; it don't do to be chicken-hearted afore niggers,
                  nor when yer dealing in niggers, nor in any kind o' business what ye want to make
                  coin at. Marston 'll stick on that point, he will; see if he don't. His feelins'
                  are troubling him: he knows I've got the assignment; and if he don't put them ar'
                  white 'uns of his in the schedule, I'll snap him up for fraud,—I will—"
               The conversation is here interrupted by a loud rap at the door, which is opened by
                  the negro, who stands with his finger on the latch. Romescos, in his slovenly
                  garb, presents himself with an air of self-assurance that marks the result of his
                  enterprise. He is a prominent feature in all Graspum's great operations; he is
                  desperate in serving his interests. Drawing a handkerchief from his pocket—it is
                  printed with the stars and stripes of freedom—he calls it a New England rag,
                  disdainfully denounces that area of unbelievers in slaveocracy, wipes his
                  blistered face with it, advances to the table—every eye intently watching him—and
                  pauses for breath.
               "What success, Anthony? Tell us quickly," Graspum demands, extending his hand
                  nervously. "Anthony never fails! It's a fool who fails in our business," was the
                  reply, delivered with great unconcern, and responded to with unanimous applause. A
                  warrior returned from victory was Anthony,—a victory of villainy recorded in
                  heaven, where the rewards will, at some day, be measured out with a just but awful
                  retribution.
               The bosom of his shirt lays broadly open: one by one they shake his hand, as he
                  hastily unties the chequered cloth about his neck, pours out his drink of whiskey,
                  seats himself in a chair, and deliberately places his feet upon the table. "Ther's
                  nothin' like making a triangle of oneself when ye wants to feel so ye can blow
                  comfortable," he says. "I done nothin' shorter than put all straight at Marston's
                  last night. It was science, ye see, gents; and I done it up strictly according to
                  science. A feller what aint cunnin', and don't know the nice work o' the law,
                  can't do nothin' in the way o' science. It's just as you said"—addressing his
                  remarks to Graspum,—"Marston's slackin' out his conscience because he sees how
                  things are goin' down hill with him. If that old hoss cholera don't clar off the
                  nigger property, I'm no prophet. It'll carry 'em into glory; and glory, I reckon,
                  isn't what you calls good pay, eh, Graspum? I overheard his intentions: he sees
                  the black page before him; it troubles the chicken part of his heart. Feels mighty
                  meek and gentle all at once; and, it's no lie, he begins to see sin in what he has
                  done; and to make repentance good he's goin' to shove off that nabob stock of his,
                  so the creditors can't lay paws upon it. Ye got to spring; Marston 'll get ahead
                  of ye if he don't, old feller. This child 'll show him how he can't cum some o'
                  them things while Squire Hobble and I'm on hand." Thus quaintly he speaks, pulling
                  the bill of sale from a side-pocket, throwing it upon the table with an air of
                  satisfaction amounting to exultation. "Take that ar; put it where ye can put yer
                  finger on't when the 'mergency comes." And he smiles to see how gratefully and
                  anxiously Graspum receives it, reviews it, re-reviews it,—how it excites the joy
                  of his nature. He has no soul beyond the love of gold, and the system of his
                  bloody trade. It was that fatal instrument, great in the atmosphere of ungrateful
                  law, bending some of nature's noblest beneath its seal of crimes. "It's from
                  Silenus to Marston; rather old, but
                  just the thing! Ah, you're a valuable fellow, Anthony." Mr. Graspum manifests his
                  approbation by certain smiles, grimaces, and shakes of the hand, while word by
                  word he reads it, as if eagerly relishing its worth. "It's a little thing for a
                  great purpose; it'll tell a tale in its time;" and he puts the precious scrip
                  safely in his pocket, and rubbing his hands together, declares "that
                  deserves a bumper!" They fill up at Graspum's request, drink with social cheers,
                  followed by a song from Nimrod, who pitches his tune to the words, "Come,
                  landlord, fill the flowing bowl."
               Nimrod finishes his song: Romescos takes the floor to tell a story about the old
                  judge what hung the nigger a'cos he didn't want to spend his patience listening to
                  the testimony, and adjourned the court to go and take a drink at Sal Stiles's
                  grocery. His description of the court, its high jurisdiction, the dignity of the
                  squire what sits as judge, how he drinks the three jurymen—freeholders—what are
                  going to try a nigger, how they goes out and takes three drinks when the case gets
                  about half way through, how the nigger winks and blinks when he sees the jury
                  drunk, and hears the judge say there's only two things he likes to hang,—niggers
                  and schoolmasters. But as it's no harm to kill schoolmasters—speaking in a
                  southern sense—so Romescos thinks the squire who got the jury inebriated afore he
                  sent the "nigger" to be hung doesn't mean the least harm when he evinces an
                  abhorrence to the whole clan of schoolmaster trash. He turns to the old story of
                  doing everything by system; ends by describing his method of drinking a whole
                  jury. He has surprised Marston, got him on the hip, where he can feather him or
                  sciver him, and where things must be done sly. Public opinion, he whispers, may
                  set folks moving, and then they'll all be down upon him like hawks after chickens.
                  In his mind, the feller what pulls first comes off first best—if the
                  law hounds are not too soon let loose! If they are, there will be a long drag, a
                  small cage for the flock, and very few birds with feathers on. Romescos cares for
                  nobody but the judge: he tells us how the judge and he are right good cronies, and
                  how it's telling a good many dollars at the end of the year to keep on the best of
                  terms with him, always taking him to drink when they meet. The judge is a
                  wonderfully clever fellow, in Romescos' opinion; ranks among first-class drinkers;
                  can do most anything, from hanging a nigger to clearing the fellow that killed the
                  schoolmaster, and said he'd clear a dozen in two two's, if they'd kill off ever so
                  many of the rubbish. It is well to make his favour a point of interest. The
                  company are become tired of this sort of cantation; they have heard enough of high
                  functionaries, know quite enough of judges:—such things are in their line of
                  business. Romescos must needs turn the conversation. "Well, taking it how I can
                  entertain ye to most anything, I'll give ye a story on the secrets of how I used
                  to run off Ingin remnants of the old tribes. 'Taint but a few years ago, ye know,
                  when ther was a lot of Ingin and white, mixed stuff—some called it beautiful—down
                  in Beaufort district. It was temptin' though, I reckon, and made a feller feel
                  just as if he was runnin' it off to sell, every time it come in his way. Ye see,
                  most on't was gal property, and that kind, ollers keeps the whole district in a
                  hubbub; everybody's offended, and there's so much delicacy about the ladies what
                  come in contact with it. Yes, gentlemen! the ladies—I means the aristocracy's
                  ladies—hate these copper-coloured Ingins as they would female devils. It didn't do
                  to offend the delicacy of our ladies, ye see; so something must be done, but it
                  was all for charity's sake. Squire Hornblower and me fixes a plan a'tween us: it
                  was just the plan to do good for the town—we must always be kind, ye know, and try
                  to do good—and save the dear good ladies a great deal of unnecessary pain.
               "Now, the squire had law larnin', and I had cunnin'; and both put together made
                  the thing work to a point. The scheme worked so nicely that we put twelve out of
                  fifteen of 'em right into pocket-money in less than three years—"
               "Hold a second, Romescos; how did you play the game so adroitly, when they were
                  all members of families living in the town? You're a remarkable fellow," Graspum
                  interposes, stretching his arms, and twisting his sturdy figure over the side of
                  his chair.
               "That's what I was coming at. Ye see, whenever ye makes white trash what ain't
                  slaved a nuisance, you makes it mightily unpopular; and when folks is unpopular
                  the nuisance is easily removed, especially when ye can get pay for removing it. The law will be as tame as a
                  mouse—nobody 'll say nothin'? Ingin and white rubbish is just alike—one's worth as
                  little as t'other. Both's only fit to sell, sir!—worthless for any other purpose.
                  Ye see, gentlemen, I'm something of a philosopher, and has strong faith in the
                  doctrine of our popular governor, who believes it better to sell all poor whites
                  into slavery. 'Tain't a free country where ye don't have the right to sell folks
                  what don't provide for number one. I likes to hear our big folks talk
                  so"—Anthony's face brightens—"'cause it gives a feller a chance for a free
                  speculation in them lank, lean rascals; and, too, it would stop their
                  rifle-shooting and corn-stealing—"
               "You never try your hand at such hits—do you, Nathe?" Bengal interrupts, his
                  fore-finger poised on his nose.
               "Now, Dan," Anthony quaintly replies, "none o' yer pointed insinuations.
                  'Twouldn't be much harm if the varmin would only keep its mouth shut along the
                  road. But when the critturs ar' got schoolmaster gumption it's mighty
                  apt to get a feller into a tarnation snarl. Schoolmaster gumption
                  makes d—d bad niggers; and there's why I say it's best to hang schoolmasters. It's
                  dangerous, 'cos it larns the critturs to writin' a scrawl now and then; and,
                  unless ye knows just how much talent he's got, and can whitewash him yaller, it's
                  plaguy ticklish. When the brutes have larnin', and can write a little, they won't
                  stay sold when ye sell 'em—that is, I mean, white riff-raff stuff; they ain't a
                  bit like niggers and Ingins. And there's just as much difference a'tween the human
                  natur of a white nigger and a poverty-bloated white as there is a'twixt philosophy
                  and water-melons."
               "You're drawing a long bow, Anthony," interrupts Graspum, with a suggestion that
                  it were better to come to the point; and concludes by saying: "We don't care
                  sevenpence about the worthless whites all over the State. They can't read nor
                  write—except a few on 'em—and everybody knows it wouldn't do to give them
                  learning—that wouldn't do! We want the way you cleared that nuisance out of
                  Beaufort district so quick—that's what we want to hear."
               "Well, ye'h sees, it took some keen play, some sly play, some dignity, and some
                  talent; but the best thing of the whole was the squire's honour. He and me, ye
                  see, joined partners—that is, he gets places for 'em away out o' town—you
                  understand—places where I keeps a couple of the very best nags that ever stepped
                  turf. And then he puts on the soft sauder, an' is so friendly to the critturs—gets
                  'em to come out with him to where he will make 'um nice house servants, and such
                  things. He is good at planin', as all justices is, and would time it to arrive at
                  midnight. I, havin' got a start, has all ready to meet him; so when he gives me
                  the papers, I makes a bolt at full speed, and has 'um nowhere afore they knows it.
                  And then, when they sees who it is, it don't do to make a fuss about it—don't! And
                  then, they're so handsome, it ain't no trouble finding a market for 'em down
                  Memphis way. It only takes forty-eight hours—the way things is done up by
                  steam—from the time I clears the line until Timothy Portman signs
                  the bond—that's five per cent. for him—and Ned Sturm does the swearin', and
                  they're sold for a slap-up price—sent to where there's no muttering about it.
                  That's one way we does it; and then, there's another. But, all in all, there's a
                  right smart lot of other ways that will work their way into a talented mind. And
                  when a feller gets the hang on it, and knows lawyer gumption, he can do it up
                  smooth. You must strap 'em down, chain 'em, look vengeance at 'em; and now and
                  then, when the varmin will squeal, spite of all the thrashin' ye can give 'em, box
                  'em up like rats, and put yer horses like Jehu until ye cl'ar the State. The more
                  ye scars 'em the better—make 'em as whist as mice, and ye can run 'em through the
                  rail-road, and sell 'um just as easy.
               "There was another way I used to do the thing—it was a sort of an honourable way;
                  but it used to take the talents of a senator to do it up square, so the dignity
                  didn't suffer. Then the gals got shy of squire, 'cos them he got places for never
                  cum back; and I know'd how 'twas best to leave two or three for a nest-egg. It was
                  the way to do, in case some green should raise a fuss. But connected
                  with these Ingin gals was one of the likleest yaller fellers that ever shined on a
                  stand. Thar' was about twelve hundred dollars in him, I saw it just as straight,
                  and felt it just as safe in my pocket; and then it made a feller's eyes glisten
                  afore it was got out of him. I tell you what, boys, it's rather hard when ye comes to think on't." Anthony
                  pauses for a moment, sharpens his eloquence with another drop of whiskey, and
                  resumes his discourse. "The feller shined all outside, but he hadn't head
                  talents—though he was as cunnin' as a fox—and every time the squire tried an
                  experiment to get him out o'town, the nigger would dodge like a wounded raccoon.
                  'Twarn't a bit of use for the squire—so he just gin it up. Then I trys a hand, ye
                  see, comes the soft soap over him, in a Sam Slick kind of a way. I'se a private
                  gentleman, and gets the fellers round to call me a sort of an aristocrat. Doing
                  this 'ere makes me a nabob in the town—another time I'm from New York, and has
                  monstrous letters of introduction to the squire. Then I goes among the niggers and
                  comes it over their stupid; tells 'em how I'm an abolitionist in a kind of secret
                  way—gets their confidence. And then I larns a right smart deal of sayings from the
                  Bible—a nigger's curious on Christianity, ye see—and it makes him think ye belong
                  to that school, sartin! All the deviltry in his black natur' 'll cum out then; and
                  he'll do just what ye tells him. So, ye see, I just draws the pious over him, and
                  then—like all niggers—I gets him to jine in what he calculates to be a nice little
                  bit of roguery—running off."
               Graspum becomes interested in the fine qualities of the prospective property, and
                  must needs ask if he is bright and trim.
               "Bright! I reckon he warn't nothin' else in a money sense—brighter nor most
                  niggers, but mighty Inginy. Had the fierce of one and the cunnin' of t'other. Tom
                  Pridgeon and me has an understandin' about the thing; and Tom's such a ripper for
                  tradin' in nigger property—he is about the only devil niggers can imagine; and
                  they delight to play tricks on Tom. Well, the nigger and me's good friends, right
                  to the point; a good trick is to be played off on Tom, who buys the nigger in
                  confidence; the nigger is to run off when he gets to Savannah, and Tom is to be
                  indicted for running off 'free niggers.' I'se a great Christian, and joins heart
                  and hand with the darkey; we takes our walks together, reads together, prays
                  together. And then 'tain't long afore I becomes just the best white man in his
                  estimation. Knowing when Tom makes up his gang, I proposes a walk in the grove to
                  the nigger. 'Thank ye, sir,' says he, in an Ingin kind of way, and out we goes,
                  sits down, talks pious, sings hymns, and waits to see the rascally nigger-trader
                  come along. Presently Tom makes his appearance, with a right smart lot of extra
                  prime property. The nigger and me marches down the road just like master and
                  servant, and stops just when we meets Tom. You'd laughed to see Tom and me do the
                  stranger, 'Well, mister,' says I, 'how's trade in your line?—there's mighty good
                  prices for cotton just now; an' I 'spose 't keeps the market stiff up in your
                  line!'
               'Well, no,' says Tom: 'a feller can turn a good penny in the way o' fancy
                  articles, just now; but 'tain't the time for prime plantation-stock. Planters are
                  all buying, and breeders down Virginia way won't give a feller a chance to make a
                  shaving. It drives a feller hard up, ye see, and forces more business in running
                  the free 'uns.'
               'Why, stranger! what on 'arth do you mean by that 'ar;—wouldn't ye get
                  straightened if you'd git catched at that business?'
               'Oh, nothing, nothing! I forgot what I was saying,' says Tom, just as if he was
                  scared at what he had let slip.
               'I say, trader, ye got the brightest assortment of property thar' I seen for many
                  a day: you don't call them gals slaves, do you? Down where I cum from, our folks
                  wouldn't know 'em from white folks.' I tell you, boys, he had some bits that would
                  o' made yer heart cum straight up.
               'But I say, mister, I kind 'a like yer horse property—somehow he's full blood,'
                  says I.
               'Yes,' says Tom; 'he's one o' the best critturs to drive niggers with that ye ever
                  did see; and he's beat the best horse on the Columbia course, twice.'
               'Well, now; seein' how I likes the animal, about how much do ye'h set him at?'
                  says I.
               'Well! can't part with the nag nohow; seems as if he knowed a nigger, and
                  understands the business right up.'
               'But, you see, I'se got a bit of nigger property here what ye'h don't pick up
                  every day for the Memphis trade,' says I, looking at the feller, who played his
                  part right up to the hilt.
               
               'Well, I don't mind strikin' a trade,' says Tom: 'but you see my nag's worth a
                  little risin' a thousand dollars.'
               'I don't doubt that, stranger,' says I: 'but ye'h sees this 'ar piece of property
                  o' mine is worth more 'an twelve hundred. You don't come across such a looking
                  chap every day. There's a spec. in him, in any market down south,' says I; and I
                  puts my hands on the nigger and makes him show out, just as if Tom and me was
                  striking for a trade. So Tom examines him, as if he was green in nigger business,
                  and he and me strangers just come from t'other side of moon shadows.
               'Well, now,' says Tom, 'it's mighty likely property, and seeing it's you, jist
                  name a trade.'
               'Put down the nag and two hundred dollars, and I'll sign the bill of sale, for a
                  swap.' And Tom plants down the dimes, and takes the nigger. When Tom gets him to
                  Savannah, he plunks him into jail, and keeps him locked up in a cell until he is
                  ready to start south. I promises the nigger half of the spiles; but I slips an
                     X*
                   into his hand, and promises him the rest when he gets back—when he
                     does! And ye see how Tom just tryced him up to the cross and put
                  thirty-nine to his bare skin when he talked about being free, in Savannah; and
                  gagged him when he got his Ingin up. Warn't that doing the thing up slick,
                  fellers?" exclaimed Romescos, chuckling over the sport.
               "It warn't nothing else. That's what I calls catching a nigger in his own trap,"
                  said one. "That's sarvin' him right; I go for sellin' all niggers and Ingins,"
                  said another. "Free niggers have no souls, and are impediments to personal rights
                  in a free country," said a third.
               "Ye'h see, there's such an infernal lot of loose corners about our business, that
                  it takes a feller what has got a big head to do all the things smooth, in a legal
                  way; and it's so profitable all round that it kind o' tempts a feller, once in a
                  while, to do things he don't feel just right in; but then a glass of old
                  monongahela brings ye'h all straight in yer feelins again, a'ter a few minutes,"
                  said Romescos.
               "It's an amusing business; a man's got to have nerve and 
                     
                     *Ten dollars.
                  maxim, if he wants to
                  make a fortune at it. But—now, gentlemen, we'll take another round," said Graspum,
                  stopping short. "Anthony, tell us how you work it when you want to run a free
                  nigger down Maryland way."
               "There ain't no trouble about that," replied Romescos, quickly. "You see," he
                  continued, squinting his eye, and holding his glass between his face and the
                  light. "Shut out all hope first, and then prime legal gentlemen along the road,
                  and yer sartin to make safe business. I has chaps what keeps their eye on all the
                     free bits, and makes good fellers with 'em; niggers think they'r
                  the right stripe friends; and then they gives 'em jobs once in a while, and
                  tobacco, and whiskey. So when I gets all fixed for a run, some on 'm
                  gets the nigger into a sly spot, and then we pounces upon him like a hawk on a
                  chicken—gags him, and screws him up in the chains, head and feet,—boxes him up,
                  too, and drives him like lightning until I meets Tilman at the cross-roads; and
                  then I just has a document*
                   all ready, which I gives to Till., and he puts his nags in—a
                  pair what can take the road from anything about—and the way he drives, just to
                  make the nigger forget where he's going, and think he's riding in a balloon on his
                  way to glory. Just afore Til. gets to the boat, ye see, he takes the headchains
                  off—so the delicate-hearted passengers won't let their feelins get kind-a out o'
                  sorts. Once in a while the nigger makes a blubber about being free, to the
                  captain,—and if he's fool enough t' take any notice on't then there's a fuss; but
                  that's just the easiest thing to get over, if ye only know the squire, and how to
                  manage him. You must know the pintes of the law, and ye must do the clean thing in
                  the 'tin' way with the squire; and then ye can cut 'em right off by makin' t'other
                  pintes make 'em mean nothing. Once in a while t'll do to make the nigger a
                  criminal, and then there's no trouble in't, 'cos ye can ollers git the swearin'
                  done cheap. Old Captain Smith used to get himself into a scrape a heap o' times by
                  listenin' to free nigger stories, till he gets sick and would kick every nigger
                  what came to him about being free. He takes the law in his hands with a nigger o'
                  mine once, and hands him over to a city policeman as soon as we lands. He didn't
                  understand the thing,
                  
                     
                     *A forged bill of sale.
                  
                   ye see, and I
                  jist puts an X*
                  into the pole's hand, what he takes the hint at. 'Now, ye'll
                  take good care on the feller," says I, giving him a wink. And he just keeps broad
                  off from the old hard-faced mayor, and runs up to the squire's, who commits him on
                  his own committimus. Then I gets Bob Blanker to stand 'all right' with the squire, who's got all the say in the matter, when it's done
                  so. I cuts like lightenin' on to far down Mississippi, and there gets Sam Slang,
                  just one o' the keenest fellers in that line, about. Sam's a hotel-keeper all at
                  once, and I gets him up afore the Mississippi squire; and as Sam don't think much
                  about the swearin' and the squire ain't particular, so he makes a
                     five: we proves straight off how the crittur's Sam's runaway, gets the dockerment
                  and sends to Bob Blanker, who puts a blinder on the squire's eye, and gets an
                  order to the old jailor, who must give him up, when he sees the squire's order. You see, it's larnin' the secret, that's the thing, and the
                  difference between common law and nigger law; and the way to work the matter so
                  the squire will have it all in his own fingers, and don't let the old judge get a
                  pick. Squire makes it square, hands the nigger over to Bob, Bob puts fifty cuts on
                  his hide, makes him as clever as a kitten, and ships him off down south afore he
                  has time to wink. Then, ye sees, I goes back as independent as a senator from
                  Arkansas, and sues Captain Smith for damages in detainin' the property, and I
                  makes him pay a right round sum, what larns him never to try that agin."
               Thus Romescos concludes the details of his nefarious trade, amid cheers and
                  bravos. The party are in ecstasies, evincing a singular merriment at the issue.
                  There is nothing like liberty—liberty to do what you please, to turn freedom into
                  barbarity! They gloat over the privileges of a free country; and, as Romescos
                  recounts each proceeding,—tracing it into the lowest depths of human villainy,
                  they sing songs to right, justice, freedom—they praise the bounties of a great
                  country. How different is the picture below! Beneath this plotting conclave,
                  devising schemes to defraud human nature of its rights, to bring poverty and
                  disgrace upon happy families—all in accordance with the 
                  
                      *Ten dollars.
                  law—are chained in narrow
                  cells poor mortals, hoping for an end to their dreary existence, pining under the
                  weight of pinions dashing their very souls into endless despair. A tale of freedom
                  is being told above, but their chains of death clank in solemn music as the
                  midnight revelry sports with the very agony of their sorrows. Oh! who has made
                  their lives a wanton jest?—can it be the will of heaven, or is it the birthright
                  of a downtrodden race? They look for to-morrow, hope reverberates one happy
                  thought, it may bring some tidings of joy; but again they sink, as that endless
                  gloom rises before them. Hope fades from their feelings, from the bleeding heart
                  for which compassion is dead. The tyrant's heart is of stone; what cares he for
                  their supplications, their cries, their pleadings to heaven; such things have no
                  dollars for him!
               Arranging the preliminaries necessary for proceeding with Marston's affairs, they
                  agreed to the plans, received orders from Graspum in reference to their
                  proceedings on the following day, and retired to their homes, singing praises to
                  great good laws, and the freedom of a free country.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               ANOTHER SHADE OF THE PICTURE.
               WHILE the proceedings we have detailed in the foregoing chapter were progressing
                  at Graspum's slave-pen, a different phase of the system was being discussed by
                  several persons who had assembled at the house of Deacon Rosebrook. Rumour had
                  been busy spreading its many-sided tales about Marston—his difficulties, his
                  connection with Graspum, his sudden downfall. All agreed that Marston was a
                  noble-minded fellow, generous to a fault—generous in his worst errors; and, like
                  many other southerners, who meant well, though personally kind to his slaves,
                  never set a good example in his own person. Religion was indispensably necessary
                  to preserve submission; and, with a view to that end, he had made the Church a
                  means of producing it.
               Now, if the southerner resorted to the Church in the purity of Christian motives,
                  he would merit that praise which many are so willing to bestow. Or, if
                  Christianity were embraced by the southerner with heartfelt purity and faith, it
                  would undoubtedly have a beneficial influence, elevate the character of the slave,
                  promote kindly feelings between him and his master, and ultimately prove
                  profitable to both. But where Christianity, used by irreligious persons, whose
                  very acts destroy the vitality of the means, is made the medium of enforcing
                  superstition, and of debasing the mind of the person it degrades into submission,
                  its application becomes nothing less than criminal. It is criminal because it
                  brings true religion into contempt, perverts Christianity—makes it a mockery, and
                  gives to the degraded whites of the South a plea for discarding its precepts.
                  Religion—were it not used as a mechanical agency—would elevate the degraded white
                  population of the South; they would, through its influence, become valuable
                  citizens.
               These remarks have been forced upon us by observation. Frequently have we lamented
                  its application, and grieved that its holy mission were made to serve the vilest
                  purposes poses in a land of liberty, of Christian love. Religion a means of
                  degrading the masses—a subservient agent! It is so, nevertheless; and men use it
                  whose only desire it is to make it serve a property interest—the interest of
                  making men, women, and children, more valuable in the market. God ordained it for
                  a higher purpose,—man applies it for his benefit in the man-market. Hence, where
                  the means for exercising the mind upon the right is forbidden—where ignorance
                  becomes the necessary part of the maintenance of a system, and religion is applied
                  to that end, it becomes farcical; and while it must combine all the imperfections
                  of the performer, necessarily tends to confine the ignorance of those it seeks to
                  degrade, within the narrowest boundary. There are different ways of destroying the
                  rights of different classes; and as many different ways, after they are destroyed,
                  of wiping out the knowledge of their ever having had rights. But, we regret to
                  say, that most resorted to by the South, in the face of civilisation, is the Holy
                  Scriptures, which are made the medium of blotting out all knowledge of the rights
                  a people once possessed. The wrong-doer thus fears the result of natural laws; if
                  they be allowed to produce results through the cultivation of a slave's mind, such
                  may prove fatal to his immediate interests. And to maintain a system which is
                  based on force, the southern minister of the gospel is doubly culpable in the
                  sight of heaven; for while he stimulates ignorance by degrading the man, he
                  mystifies the Word of God, that he may remain for ever and ever degraded.
               What a deplorable process of stealing—nay, gently taking away the knowledge which
                  an all-wise Providence has given to man as his inheritance; how it reduces his
                  natural immunities to sensual misery! And, too, it forbids all legitimate
                  influences that could possibly give the menial a link to elevation, to the
                  formation of a society of his own. We would fain shrink from such a system of
                  debasing mankind—even more, from the hideous crimes of those who would make
                  Scripture the means to such an end. And yet, the Church defender of slavery—the
                  Christian little one—his neck-cloth as white as the crimes he defends are
                  black—must distinguish his arguments; and that the world may not suspect his
                  devotion, his honesty, his serious intention, he points us to the many blessings
                  of the plantation-service.
               
               Heavenly divinity! Let us have faith in the little ones sent to teach it; they
                  tell us slavery enforces Christianity! The management of ignorance under the
                  direction of ministers of the gospel is certainly becoming well-defined; while
                  statesmen more energetically legalise it. The one devises, the other carries out a
                  law to make man ignorant of everything but labour. But while the statesman moulds
                  the theory, the preacher manufactures Scripture texts, that the menial may believe
                  God has ordained him the pliable victim.
               Under the apparent necessity of the slave world, Marston had regularly paid Elder
                  Pemberton Praiseworthy for preaching to his property on Sundays; and to the
                  requisite end the good Elder felt himself in duty bound to inculcate humility in
                  all things that would promote obedience to a master's will. Of course, one sermon
                  was quite sufficient; and this the credulous property had listened to for more
                  than three years. The effect was entirely satisfactory, the result being that the
                  honest property were really impressed with a belief, that to evince Christian
                  fortitude under suffering and punishment was the best means of cleansing
                  themselves of the sins they were born to. This formality was misnamed
                  Christianity—it was! And through the force of this one sermon the
                  Elder became indolent; and indolence led him to its natural
                  yoke-fellow—intemperance. His indulgent mood, such as we have described him
                  enjoying in a previous chapter, became too frequent, leading to serious
                  annoyances. They had been especially serious for Marston, whom they placed in an
                  awkward situation before his property, and he resolved to tolerate them no longer.
                  Probably this resolution was hastened by the sudden discovery of Harry's singular
                  knowledge of Scripture; be that as it may, the only difficulty in the way was to
                  know if Harry could be so trained, that he would preach the "right
                  stripe" doctrine. This, however, was soon settled, and Marston not only suspended
                  his engagement with the Elder, but entered into a contract with the neighbouring
                  planters, by the terms of which Harry will fill their pulpit, and preach extempore—the Elder has brought written sermons into
                  contempt with Harry—at a stipulated price per Sunday. In this new avocation—this
                  leap from the plantation to the pulpit,
                  
                     ROSEBROOK VILLA. "Two years have passed—how changed!
                   Harry, as a piece of property, became extremely valuable; while, through
                  the charm of his new black coat, he rose a great man in the estimation of the
                  common property. Here was a valuable incentive of submission, a lesson for all bad
                  niggers, a chance for them to improve under the peculiar institution. It proved to
                  niggerdom what a good nigger could be if he only fear God and obey his master in
                  all things.
               Here was proof that a nigger could be something more than a nigger, in spite of
                  southern philosophy. The Elder—good, pious man that he was—found himself out of
                  pocket and out of preaching. Thrown upon the resources of his ingenuity, he had,
                  in order to save the dictates of his conscience, while taking advantage of the
                  many opportunities of making money afforded by the peculiar institution, entered
                  upon another branch of business, having for its object the advancement of
                  humanity. He resolved to go forth purchasing the sick and the dying; to reclaim
                  sinking humanity and make it marketable.
               But, before describing the vicissitudes through which Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy
                  passes in his new mission of humanity, we must introduce the reader to the
                  precincts of a neat little villa, situated at the outskirts of the city of C——. It
                  is a small cottage surrounded with verandas and trellis-work, over which are
                  creeping numerous woodbines and multafloras, spreading their fragrant blossoms,
                  giving it an air of sequestered beauty. An arbour of grapevines extends from a
                  little portico at the front to a wicker fence that separates the embankment of a
                  well-arranged garden, in which are pots of rare plants, beds and walks decorated
                  with flowers, presenting great care and taste. A few paces in the rear of the
                  cottage are several "negro cabins" nicely white-washed without, and an air of
                  cheerfulness and comfort reigning within. The house-servants are trimly dressed;
                  they look and act as if their thoughts and affections were with "mas'r and
                  missus." Their white aprons and clean bright frocks—some bombazine, and some
                  gingham—give them an appearance of exactness, which, whether it be voluntary or
                  force of discipline, bears evidence of attention in the slave, and encouragement
                  on the part of the master. This is the Villa of Deacon Rosebrook; they call him
                  deacon, by courtesy; in the same sense that Georgia majors and South Carolina generals are honoured
                  with those far-famed titles which so distinguish them when abroad. Perhaps we
                  should be doing the deacon no more than justice if we were to admit that he had
                  preached in very respectable spheres; but, feeling that he was wanting in the
                  purity of divine love—that he could not do justice to his conscience while setting
                  forth teachings he did not follow, he laid the profession aside for the more
                  genial associations of plantation life. Indeed, he was what many called a very
                  easy backslider; and at times was recognised by the somewhat singular soubriquet
                  of Deacon Pious-proof. But he was kind to his slaves, and had projected a system
                  singularly at variance with that of his neighbours—a system of mildness,
                  amelioration, freedom.
               His plantation, a small one, some few miles from the Villa, presented the same
                  neatness and comfort, the same cheerfulness among the negroes, and the same kindly
                  feeling between master and slave, which characterised the Villa.
               We enter a neatly-furnished parlour, where the deacon and a friend are seated on a
                  sofa; various pictures are suspended from the wall,—everything betokens New
                  England neatness. The old-fashioned dog-irons and fender are polished to exquisite
                  brightness, a Brussels carpet spreads the floor, a bright surbase encircles the
                  room; upon the flossy hearth-rug lies crouched the little canine pet, which Aunt
                  Dolly has washed to snowy whiteness. Aunt Dolly enters the room with a low curtsy,
                  gently raises the poodle, then lays him down as carefully as if he were an heir to
                  the estate. Master is happy, "missus" is happy, and Aunt Dolly is happy; and the
                  large bookcase, filled with well-selected volumes, adds to the air of contentment
                  everywhere apparent. In a niche stands a large pier-table, upon which are sundry
                  volumes with gilt edges, nets of cross-work, porcelain ornaments, and card-cases
                  inlaid with mosaic. Antique tables with massive carved feet, in imitation of
                  lions' paws, chairs of curious patterns, reclines and ottomans of softest
                  material, and covered with satin damask, are arranged round the room in harmony
                  and good taste.
               "Now, Mr. Scranton," the deacon says to his friend, who is a tall, prim,
                  sedate-looking man, apparently about forty, "I pity Marston; I pity him because he
                  is a noble-hearted fellow. But, after all, this whispering about the city may be
                  only mother Rumour distributing her false tales. Let us hope it is all rumour and
                  scandal. Come, tell me—what do you think of our negroes?"
               "Nigger character has not changed a bit in my mind, since I came south. Inferior
                  race of mortals, sir!—without principles, and fit only for service and submission.
                  A southern man knows their composition, but it takes a northern to study the
                  philosophy—it does," replies Mr. Scranton, running his left hand over his
                  forehead, and then his right over the crown of his head, as if to cover a bald
                  spot with the scanty remnant of hair that projected from the sides.
               The deacon smiles at the quaint reply. He knows Mr. Scranton's northern tenacity,
                  and begs to differ with him. "You are ultra, a little ultra, in all things, Mr.
                  Scranton. I fear it is that, carried out in morals as well as politics, that is
                  fast reducing our system to degradation and tyranny. You northern gentlemen have a
                  sort of pedantic solicitude for our rights, but you underrate our feelings upon
                  the slavery question. I'm one among the few southerners who hold what are
                  considered strange views: we are subjected to ridicule for our views; but it is
                  only by those who see nothing but servitude in the negro,—nothing but dollars and
                  cents in the institution of slavery.
               Mr. Scranton is struck with astonishment, interrupts the argument by insisting
                  upon the great superiority of the gentlemen whites, and the Bible philosophy which
                  he can bring to sustain his argument.
               "Stop one moment, my philosophic friend," the deacon interposes, earnestly. "Upon
                  that you northerners who come out here to sustain the cause of slavery for the
                  south, all make fools of yourselves. This continual reasoning upon Bible
                  philosophy has lost its life, funeral dirges have been played over it, the
                  instruments are worn out. And yet, the subject of the philosophy lives,—he belies
                  it with his physical vigour and moral action. We doubt the sincerity of
                  northerners; we have reasons for so doing; they know little of the negro, and care
                  less. Instead of assisting southerners who are inclined to do justice to the
                  wretch—to be his friend—to improve his condition—to protect him against a tyrant's wrong, you bring us
                  into contempt by your proclaiming virtue over the vice we acknowledge belongs to
                  the institution. We know its defects—we fear them; but, in the name of heaven, do
                  not defend them at the cost of virtue, truth, honesty. Do not debase us by
                  proclaiming its glories over our heads;—do not take advantage of us by attempting
                  to make wrong right." The deacon's feelings have become earnest; his face glows
                  with animation.
               Mr. Scranton seems discomfited. "That's just like all you southerners: you never
                  appreciate anything we do for you. What is the good of our love, if you always
                  doubt it?"
               "Such love!" says the deacon, with a sarcastic curl on his lip. "It's cotton-bag
                  love, as full of self as a pressed bale—"
               "But, deacon; you're getting up on the question."
               "Up as high as northern sincerity is low. Nothing personal," is the cool
                  rejoinder.
               Mr. Scranton inquires very seriously—wishing it particularly to be understood that
                  he is not a fighting-man—if Deacon Rosebrook considers all northerners
                  white-washed, ready to deceive through the dim shadows of self. The deacon's frank
                  and manly opinion of northern editors and preachers disturbs Scranton's serious
                  philosophy. "Cotton-bag love!" there's something in it, and contempt at the
                  bottom, he declares within himself. And he gives a serious look, as much as to
                  say—"go on."
               "I do! He who maketh right, what those most interested in know to be wrong,
                  cherishes a bad motive. When a philosopher teaches doctrines that become doubtful
                  in their ultraness, the weakness carries the insincerity,—the effort becomes
                  stagnant. Never sell yourself to any class of evils for popularity's sake. If you
                  attempt it you mistake the end, and sell yourself to the obscurity of a political
                  trickster, 
                     flatttered
                     flattered
                   by a few, believed by none."
               "Deacon! a little more moderate. Give us credit for the good we do. Don't get
                  excited, don't. These are ticklish times, and we northerners are quick to
                  observe—"
               "Yes, when it will turn a penny on a nigger or a bale of cotton."
               "Allow me; one minute if you please!" returned Scranton, with a nasal twang
                  peculiar to his class, as he began to work himself up into a declamatory attitude.
                  "You southerners don't understand what a force them northern abolitionists are
                  bringing against you; and you know how slow you are to do things, and to let your
                  property all go to waste while you might make a good speculation on it. There's
                  just the difference of things: we study political economy so as to apply it to
                  trade and such like; you let things go to waste, just thinking over it. And, you
                  see, it's our nature to be restless and searching out the best avenues for
                  developing trade. Why, deacon, your political philosophy would die out if the New
                  Englander didn't edit your papers and keep your nigger principles straight."
               "Nigger principles straight! Ah, indeed! Only another evidence of that cotton bag
                  love that has caused the banns of matrimony to be published between tyrants who
                  disgrace us and northern speculators. The book-publisher—poor servile tool—fears
                  to publish Mrs. Johnson's book, lest it should contain something to offend Mrs.
                  Colonel Sportington, at the south. Mr. Stevens, the grocer, dare not put his vote
                  into the ballot-box for somebody, because he fears one of his customers at the
                  south will hear of it. Parson Munson dare not speak what he thinks in a New
                  England village, because Mrs. Bruce and Deacon Donaldson have yearly interests in
                  slaves at the south; and old Mattock, the boot-maker, thinks it aint right for
                  niggers to be in church with white folks, and declares, if they do go, they should
                  sit away back in one corner, up stairs. He thinks about the combination that
                  brings wealth, old age, and the grave, into one vortex,—feels little misgiving
                  upon humanity, but loves the union, and wants nothing said about niggers. We
                  understand what it all means, Mr. Scranton; and we can credit it for what it's
                  worth, without making any account for its sincerity and independence. I am one
                  among the few who go for educating the negroes, and in that education to cultivate
                  affections between slave and master, to make encouragement perform the part of
                  discipline, and inspire energy through proper rewards."
               "What!—educate a nigger! These are pretty principles for a southerner to maintain!
                  Why, sir, if such doctrines were advocated in the body politic they would be
                  incendiary to southern institutions. Just educate the niggers, and I wouldn't be
                  an editor in the south two days. You'd
                  see me tramping, bag and baggage, for the north, much as I dislike it! It would
                  never do to educate such a miserable set of wretches as they are. You may depend
                  what I say is true, sir. Their condition is perfectly hopeless at the north, and
                  the more you try to teach them, the greater nuisance they become."
               "Now, my good northern friend, not so fast, if you please; I can see the evil of
                  all this, and so can you, if you will but study the negro's character a little
                  deeper. The menial man who has passed through generations of oppression, and whose
                  life and soul are blotted from the right of manhood, is sensitive of the power
                  that crushes him. He has been robbed of the means of elevating himself by those
                  who now accuse him of the crime of degradation: and, wherever the chance is
                  afforded him of elevation, as that increases so does a tenacious knowledge of his
                  rights; yet, he feels the prejudice that cuts and slights him in his progress,
                  that charges him with the impudence of a negro, that calls his attempts to be a
                  man mere pompous foolery."
               "And it is so! To see a nigger setting himself up among white folks—it's perfectly
                  ridiculous!"
               "Mark me, Mr. Scranton: there's where you northerners mistake yourselves. The
                  negro seldom desires to mix with whites, and I hold it better they should keep
                  together; but that two races cannot live together without the one enslaving the
                  other is a fallacy popular only with those who will not see the future, and
                  obstinately refuse to review the past. You must lessen your delicate
                  sensibilities; and when you make them less painful to the man of colour at the
                  north, believe me, the south will respond to the feeling. Experience has changed
                  my feelings,—experience has been my teacher. I have based my new system upon
                  experience; and its working justifies me in all I have said. Let us set about
                  extracting the poison from our institutions, instead of losing ourselves in
                  contemplating an abstract theory for its government."
               "Remember, deacon, men are not all born to see alike. There are rights and
                  privileges belonging to the southerner: he holds the trade in men right, and he
                  would see the Union sundered to atoms before he would permit the intervention of
                  the federal government on that subject," Mr. Scranton seriously remarks, placing
                  his two thumbs in the armpits of his vest, and assuming an air of confidence, as
                  if to say, "I shall outsouthern the southerner yet, I shall."
               "That's just the point upon which all the villainy of our institution rests: the
                  simple word man!—man a progressive being; man a
                  chattel,—a thing upon which the sordid appetite of every
                  wretch may feed. Why cannot Africa give up men? She has been the victim of
                  Christendom—her flesh and blood have served its traffic, have enriched its
                  coffers, and even built its churches; but like a ferocious wolf that preys upon
                  the fold in spite of watchers, she yet steals Afric's bleeding victims, and frowns
                  upon them because they are not white, nor live as white men
                  live."
               "Mercy on me!" says Mr. Scranton, with a sigh, "you can't ameliorate the system as
                  it stands: that's out of the question. Begin to loosen the props, and the whole
                  fabric will tumble down. And then, niggers won't be encouraged to work at a price
                  for their labour; and how are you going to get along in this climate, and with
                  such an enormous population of vagabonds?"
               "Remember, Mr. Scranton," ejaculated the deacon, "there's where you mistake the
                  man in the negro; and through these arguments, set forth in your journal, we
                  suffer. You must have contracted them by association with bad slave-owners. Mark
                  ye! the negro has been sunk to the depths where we yet curse him; and is it right
                  that we should keep him cursed?—to say nothing of the semi-barbarous position in
                  which it finds our poor whites. He feels that his curse is for
                     life-time; his hopes vibrate with its knowledge, and through it he falls
                  from that holy inspiration that could make him a man, enjoying manhood's rights.
                  Would not our energy yield itself a sacrifice to the same sacrificer? Had we been
                  loaded with chains of tyranny, what would have been our condition? Would not that
                  passion which has led the Saxon on to conquest, and spread his energy through the
                  western world, have yielded when he saw the last shadow of hope die out, and
                  realised that his degradation was for life-time? Would not the
                  yearnings of such a consummation have recoiled to blast every action of the being
                  who found himself a chattel? And yet this very chattel, thus yoked in death, toils
                  on in doubts and fears, in humbleness and submission, with unrequited fortitude and affection. And still all is doubted
                  that he does, even crushed in the prejudice against his colour!"
               "Well, deacon, you perfectly startle me, to hear a southerner talk that way at the
                  south. If you keep on, you'll soon have an abolition society without sending north
                  for it."
               "That's just what I want. I want our southerners to look upon the matter properly,
                  and to take such steps as will set us right in the eyes of the world. Humanity is
                  progressing with rapid strides—slavery cannot exist before it! It must fall; and
                  we should prepare to meet it, and not be so ungrateful, at least, that we cannot
                  reflect upon its worth, and give merit to whom merit is due." Thus were presented
                  the north and south; the former loses her interests in humanity by seeking to
                  serve the political ends of the latter.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               MRS. ROSEBROOK'S PROJECT.
               AT this juncture of the conversation, a sprightly, well-dressed servant opens the
                  parlour-door, announces missus! The deacon's good lady enters. She is a perfect
                  pattern of neatness,—a finely-developed woman of more than ordinary height, with
                  blonde features, and a countenance as full of cheerfulness as a bright May
                  morning. She bows gracefully; her soft eyes kindle with intelligence as she
                  approaches Mr. Scranton, who rises with the coldness of an iceberg.
               "Be seated, Mr. Scranton," she says, with a voice so full of gentleness,—"be
                  seated." Her form is well-rounded, her features exquisite. Mr. Scranton views her
                  seriously, as if he found something of great interest in that marble forehead,
                  those fine features moulding a countenance full of soul, love, and sweetness. Her
                  dress is of plain black brocade, made high at the neck, where it is secured with a
                  small diamond pin, the front opening and disclosing a lace stomacher set with
                  undressed pearls. Rufflets and diamond bracelets, of chaste workmanship, clasp her
                  wrists; while her light auburn hair, neatly laid in plain folds, and gathered into
                  a plait on the back of her head, where it is delicately secured with gold and
                  silver cord, forms a soft contrast. There is chasteness and simplicity combined to
                  represent character, sense, and refinement. She is the mother of the plantation:
                  old negroes call her mother, young ones clamour with joy when she visits their
                  abodes: her very soul is in their wants; they look to her for guidance. Their
                  happiness is her pleasure, and by sharing the good fortune that has followed them
                  she has fostered the energy of their negroes, formed them into families,
                  encouraged their morality, impressed them with the necessity of preserving family
                  relations. Against the stern mandates of the law, she has taught them to read the
                  Bible, reading and explaining it to them herself. Indeed, she has risen above
                     the law: she has taught the more
                  tractable ones to write; she has supplied the younger with little story-books,
                  attractive and containing good moral lessons. She rejoices over her system: it is
                  honest, kind, generous,—it will serve the future, and is not unprofitable at
                  present. It is different from that pursued by those who would, through the
                  instrumentality of bad laws, enforce ignorance. Nay, to her there is something
                  abhorrent in using the Word of God as an excuse for the existence of slavery. Her
                  system is practicable, enlightening first, and then enforcing that which gives
                  encouragement to the inert faculties of our nature. Punishments were scarcely
                  known upon her plantation; the lash never used. Old and young were made to feel
                  themselves part and parcel of a family compact, to know they had an interest in
                  the crop, to gather hopes for the future, to make home on the old plantation
                  pleasant. There was something refreshing in the pride and protection evinced in
                  the solicitation of this gentle creature for her negroes. In early life she had
                  listened to their fables, had mixed with them as children, had enjoyed their hours
                  of play, had studied their sympathies, and entered with delight into the very soul
                  of their jargon merriment. She felt their wants, and knew their grievances; she
                  had come forward to be their protector, their mother! "Why, Mr. Scranton," she
                  exclaims, laughingly, in reply to that gentleman's remarks, as she interrupted the
                  conversation between him and the deacon, "we would sooner suffer than sell one of
                  our boys or girls—even if the worst came to the worst. I know the value of family
                  ties; I know how to manage negroes. I would just as soon think of selling our
                  Matilda, I would! If some of you good northern folks could only see how
                  comfortable my negroes are!—"
               "Oh, yes!" interrupts the deacon, "she takes it all out of my hands; I'm going to
                  give her the reins altogether one of these days. She has got a nice way of
                  touching a negro's feelings so that anything can be done with him: it tells
                  largely at times." Mr. Scranton's face becomes more serious; he doesn't seem to
                  understand this new "nigger philosophy." "Poor creatures!" the deacon continues,
                  "how wonderful is the power of encouragement;—how much may be done if proper means
                  are applied—"
               "The trouble is in the means," Mr. Scranton interposes, scratching his head, as if
                  ideas were scarce, and valuable for the distance they had to be transported.
               Our good lady smiles. "I cannot help smiling, Mr. Scranton." She speaks softly.
                  "There are two things I want done—done quickly: I want southern philosophers to
                  consider, and I want southern ladies to act—to put on energy—to take less care of
                  themselves and more of the poor negro!" She lays her hand gently upon Mr.
                  Scranton's arm, her soft blue eyes staring him in the face. "When they do this,"
                  she continues, "all will be well. We can soon show the north how much can be done
                  without their assistance. I don't believe in women's rights meetings,—not I; but I
                  hold there should be some combination of southern ladies, to take the moral
                  elevation of the slave into consideration,—to set about the work in good earnest,
                  to see what can be done. It's a monster work; but monster evils can be removed if
                  females will give their hands and hearts to the task. This separating families to
                  serve the interests of traders in human beings must be stopped: females know the
                  pains it inflicts on suffering wretches; they are best suited to stop that heinous
                  offence in the sight of God and man. They must rise to the work; they must devise
                  means to stay the waste of fortune now progressing through dissipation; and, above
                  all other things, they must rise up and drive these frightful
                  slave-dealers from their doors."
               Mr. Scranton admits there is something in all this, but suggests that it were
                  better to let the future take care of itself; there's no knowing what the future
                  may do; and to let those who come in it enjoy our labours "aint just the policy."
                  He contends—willing to admit how much the ladies could do if they would—it would
                  not be consistent with the times to put forth such experiments, especially when
                  there is so much opposition. "It wouldn't do!" he whispers.
               The deacon here interrupts Mr. Scranton, by stepping to the door and ordering one
                  of the servants to prepare refreshments.
               "'It must do! It won't do!' keeps us where we are, and where we are always
                  complaining that we never have done. You know I speak frankly, Mr. Scranton—women
                  may say what they please;—and let me tell you, that when you do your duty it will do. Hard times never were
                  harder than when everybody thought them hard. We must infuse principle into our
                  poor people; we must make them earnest in agricultural pursuits; we must elevate
                  the character of labour; we must encourage the mechanic, and give tone to his
                  pursuits; and, more than all, we must arrest the spread of conventional nonsense,
                  and develope our natural resources by establishing a system of paid labour, and
                  removing the odium which attaches itself to those who pursue such avocations as
                  the slave may be engaged in. My word for it, Mr. Scranton, there's where the
                  trouble lies. Nature has been lavish in her good gifts to the south; but we must
                  lend Nature a helping hand,—we must be the women of the south for the south's
                  good; and we must break down those social barriers clogging our progress. Nature
                  wants good government to go along with her, to be her handfellow in regeneration;
                  but good government must give Nature her rights. This done, slavery will cease to
                  spread its loathsome diseases through the body politic, virtue will be protected
                  and receive its rewards, and the buds of prosperity will be nourished with energy
                  and ripen into greatness."
               Mr. Scranton suggests that the nigger question was forced upon him, and thinks it
                  better to change the conversation. Mr. Scranton was once in Congress, thinks a
                  deal of his Congressional experience, and declares, with great seriousness, that
                  the nigger question will come to something one of these days. "Ah! bless me,
                  madam," he says, adjusting his arms, "you talk—very—like—a—statesman. Southerners
                  better leave all this regenerating of slaves to you. But let me say, whatever you
                  may see in perspective, it's mighty dangerous when you move such principles to
                  practice. Mark me! you'll have to pull down the iron walls of the south, make
                  planters of different minds, drive self out of mankind, and overthrow the northern
                  speculator's cotton-bag love. You've got a great work before you, my dear madam,—a
                  work that'll want an extended lease of your life-time. Remember how hard it is to
                  convince man of the wrong of anything that's profitable. A paid system, even
                  emancipation, would have been a small affair in 1824 or 1827. Old niggers and
                  prime fellows were then of little value; now it is different. You may see the
                  obstacle to your project in the Nashville Convention or Georgia platform—"
               "Nashville Convention, indeed!" exclaims Mrs. Rosebrook, her face infused with
                  animation, and a curl of disdain on her lip. "Such things! Mere happy
                  illustrations of the folly of our political affairs. The one was an exotic
                  do-nothing got up by Mister Wanting-to-say-something, who soon gets ashamed of his
                  mission; the other was a mixture of political log-rolling, got up by those who
                  wanted to tell the Union not to mind the Nashville Convention. What a
                  pity they did not tell the Union to be patient with us! We must have no more
                  Nashville Conventions; we must change Georgia platforms for individual
                  enterprise,—southern conventions for moral regeneration. Give us these changes,
                  and we shall show you what can be done without the aid of the north." Several
                  servants in tidy dresses, their white aprons looking so clean, come bustling into
                  the room and invite missus and her guest into an airy ante-room, where a table is
                  bountifully spread with cake, fruit, fine old Madeira, and lemonade. Mr. Scranton
                  bows and asks "the pleasure;" Mrs. Rosebrook acknowledgingly takes his arm, while
                  the negroes bow and scrape as they enter the room. Mr. Scranton stands a few
                  moments gazing at the set-out. "I hope Mr. Scranton will make himself quite at
                  home," the good lady interposes. Everything was so exquisitely arranged, so set
                  off with fresh-plucked flowers, as if some magic hand had just touched the
                  whole.
               "Now!" continued Mrs. Rosebrook, motioning her head as she points to the table:
                  "you'll admit my negroes can do something? Poor helpless wretches,
                  we say continually: perhaps they are worse when bad owners can make the world look
                  upon them through northern prejudice. They are just like children; nobody gives
                  them credit for being anything else; and yet they can do much for our good. It
                  would trouble some persons to arrange a table so neatly; my boys did it all, you
                  see!" And she exults over the efficiency of her negroes, who stand at her side
                  acknowledging the compliment with broad grins. The deacon helps Mr. Scranton, who
                  commences stowing away the sweetmeats with great gusto. "It is truly surprising
                  what charming nigger property you have got. They don't seem a bit like niggers" he
                  concludes deliberately taking a mouthful. Mrs. Rosebrook, pleased at the honest
                  remark, reminds him that the deacon carries out her views most charmingly, that she studies negro character, and
                  knows that by stimulating it with little things she promotes good. She studies
                  character while the deacon studies politics. At the same time, she rather
                  ironically reminds Mr. Scranton that the deacon is not guilty of reading any
                  long-winded articles on "state rights and secession." "Not he!" she says,
                  laughingly; "you don't catch him with such cast-iron material in his head. They
                  call him pious-proof now and then, but he's progress all over."
               Mr. Scranton, attentive to his appetite, draws a serious face, gives a side
                  glance, begs a negro to supply his plate anew, and reckons he may soon make a new
                  discovery in southern political economy. But he fears Mrs. Rosebrook's plan will
                  make a mongrel, the specific nature of which it would be difficult to define in
                  philosophy. Perhaps it will not be acceptable to the north as a thinking people,
                  nor will it please the generosity of southern ladies.
               "There is where the trouble lies!" exclaimed the deacon, who had until then
                  yielded up the discussion to his good lady. "They look upon our system with
                  distrust, as if it were something they could not understand."
               "I move we don't say another word about it, but take our part quietly," says Mrs.
                  Rosebrook, insinuating that Mr. Scranton had better be left to take his
                  refreshment comfortably; that he is a little misanthropic; that he must be cheered
                  up. "Come, my boys"—directing her conversation to the negroes—"see that Mr.
                  Scranton is cared for. And you must summon Daddy; tell him to get the carriage
                  ready, to put on his best blue coat,—that we are going to take Mr. Scranton over
                  the plantation, to show him how things can prosper when we ladies take a hand in
                  the management." The negro leaves to execute the order: Mr. Scranton remains mute,
                  now and then sipping his wine. He imagines himself in a small paradise, but
                  "hadn't the least idea how it was made such a place by niggers." Why, they are
                  just the smartest things in the shape of property that could be started up.
                  Regular dandy niggers, dressed up to "shine so," they set him thinking there was
                  something in his politics not just straight. And then, there was so much
                  intelligence, so much politeness about the critters! Why, if it had not been for
                  the doctrines he had so long held, he would have felt bashful at his want of ease
                  and suavity, —things seldom taught in the New England village where our
                  pro-slavery advocate was born and educated.
               Presently servants are seen outside, running here and there, their eyes glistening
                  with anxiety, as if preparing for a May-day festival. Old Dolly, the cook, shining
                  with the importance of her profession, stands her greasy portions in the kitchen
                  door, scolds away at old Dad, whose face smiles with good-nature as he fusses over
                  the carriage, wipes it, rubs it, and brushes it, every now and then stopping to
                  see if it will reflect his full black face. Little woolly-headed urchins are
                  toddling round old Maum Dolly, pulling the folds of her frock, teasing for cakes
                  and fritters. One, more expert in mischief, has perched himself in an aperture
                  over the door, substituting himself for the old black hat with which it is usually
                  filled. Here, his face like a full moon in a cloud, he twists his moving fingers
                  into the ingeniously-tied knot of Dolly's bandana, which he cunningly draws from
                  her head. Ben and Loblolly, two minor sprats of the race, are seated in the centre
                  of the yard, contending for the leaves of a picture-book, which, to appease their
                  characteristic inquisitiveness, they have dissected. Daddy has the horses ready
                  and the carriage waiting; and Uncle Bradshaw, the coachman, and Cæsar, the likely
                  fellow, wait at the door with as much satisfaction expressed in their faces as if
                  it were all for them. Missus is not to be outdone in expertness: a few minutes ago
                  she was "snaring" Mr. Scranton with his own philosophy; now she is ready to take
                  her seat.
               "Missus! I wants t' go down yander wid ye, I doe," says Daddy, approaching her
                  with hand extended, and working his black face up into a broad grin as he detects
                  Mr. Scranton's awkwardness in getting into the carriage.
               "Certainly, Daddy, certainly: you shall go. Daddy knows how to get alongside of
                  Aunt Rachel when he gets down on the plantation. He knows where to get a good cup
                  of coffee and a waff." And she pats the old negro on the head as he clambers up on
                  the box. "No, him aint dat. Daddy want t' go wid missus—ya'h, ya! dat him, tis.
                  Missus want somebody down da'h what spry, so'e take care on 'em round de old
                  plantation. Takes my missus to know what nigger is," says Daddy, taking off his
                  cap, and bowing missus into the carriage.
               
               "Not one word for mas'r, eh, Daddy?" rejoins the deacon, looking playfully at
                  Daddy. "Why, Boss, you aint nofin whin missus about," returns Daddy, tauntingly,
                  as he buttons his grey coat, and tells Bradshaw to "go ahead!" Away they go,
                  galloping over the plain, through the swamp, for the plantation,—that model
                  experiment doubted by so many. Major Sprag, the politician, and Judge Snow, the
                  statesman, had declared publicly it never would do any good. With them it was not
                  practical,—it gave negroes too much liberty; and they declared the system must be
                  kept within the narrowest sphere of law, or it would be destroyed for ever.
               Onward the carriage bounded, and long before it reached the plantation gate was
                  espied by the negroes, who came sallying forth from their white cabins, crying out
                  at the top of their voices—"Missus comin'! Missus comin! Da'h missus—dat she! I
                  know'd missus wa' comin' t' day!" and the music of their voices re-echoed through
                  the arbour of oaks that lined the road. Their tongues seemed to have taken new
                  impulse for the occasion. The dogs, at full run, came barking to the gate; old
                  daddies and mammas, with faces "all over smiles," followed in the train. And they
                  were dressed so tidily, looked so cheerful, and gave such expressions of their
                  exuberant feelings, that Mr. Scranton seemed quite at a loss how to account for
                  it. He had never before witnessed such a mingling of fondness for owners,—the
                  welcome sounds of "God bless good missus!" They were at variance with the
                  misanthropic ideas he had imbibed at the north. And then there was a regular
                  retinue of the "small-fry property" bringing up the rear, with curious faces, and
                  making the jargon more confounding with the music of their voices. They toddled,
                  screamed, and shouted, clustered around the gate, and before Daddy had time to
                  dismount, had it wide open, and were contending for the palm of shaking missus by
                  the hand "fust."
               The carriage drives to the plantation house, followed by the train of moving
                  darkness, flocking around it like as many devotees before an object of
                  superstitious worship. Mas'r is only a secondary consideration, Missus is the
                  angel of their thoughts; her kindness and perseverance in their behalf has
                  softened their feelings—stimulated their energy. How touching is the fondness and
                  tenderness of these degraded graded mortals! They love their benefactor. And, too,
                  there is a lesson in it worthy the statesman's consideration,—it shows a knowledge
                  of right, and a deep sense of gratitude for kindness bestowed. Mrs. Rosebrook
                  alights from the carriage, receives their warm congratulations, and, turning to
                  Mr. Scranton, touches him on the arm, and remarks:—"Now, here they are. Poor old
                  bodies,"—taking them by the hand in rotation—just like as many children. "What do
                  you think of them, Mr. Scranton? do you not find a softening sympathy creeping
                  upon you? I forgot, though, your political responsibility! Ah! that is the point
                  with statesmen. You feel a touch of conscience once in a while, but cannot speak
                  for fear of the consequences." And she laughs heartily at Mr. Scranton, who draws
                  his face into a very serious length. "Pest the niggers!" he says, as they gather
                  at his feet, asking all sorts of importune questions.
               "My good lady is a regular reformer, you see, Mr. Scranton," rejoins the deacon,
                  as he follows that gentleman into the hall.
               Mr. Scranton remarks, in reply, that such does not become caste, and two
                  pompous-looking servants set upon him brushing the dirt from his clothes with
                  great earnestness. The negroes understand Mr. Scranton at a glance; he is an
                  amiable stoic!
               Mrs. Rosebrook disappears for a few minutes, and returns minus her bonnet and
                  mantle. She delights to have the old and the young around her,—to study their
                  characters, to hear their stories, their grievances, and to relieve their wants.
                  "These little black imps," she says, patting them on the head as they toddle
                  around her, "They're just as full of interest as their shiny black skins are full
                  of mischief;" and one after another, with hand extended, they seek a recognition;
                  and she takes them in her arms, fondling them with the affection of a nurse.
               "Here's Toby, too; the little cunning rascal! He is as sleek as a mole, a young
                  coon," she ejaculates, stooping down and playfully working her fingers over Toby's
                  crispy hair, as he sits upon the grass in front of the house, feasting on a huge
                  sweet potato, with which he has so bedaubed his face that it looks like a mask
                  with the terrific portrayed in the rolling of two immense white eyes. "And here is
                     Nichol Garvio!" and she turns to
                  another, pats him on the head, and shakes his hand. "We mean to make a great man
                  of him, you see,—he has head enough to make a Congress man; who knows but that
                  he'll get there when he grows up?"
               "Congress, happily, is beyond niggers," replies Mr. Scranton, approving the lady:
                  "Congress is pure yet!" Turning round, she recommends Mr. Scranton to put his
                  northern prejudices in his pocket, where they will be safe when required for the
                  purposes of the south. "A nigger 's a nigger all over the world," rejoins Mr.
                  Scranton, significantly shrugging his shoulders and casting a doubtful glance at
                  the young type.
               "True! true!" she returns, giving Mr. Scranton a look of pity. "God give us sight
                  to see! We praise our forefathers—honest praise!—but we forget what they did. They
                  brought them here, poor wretches; decoyed them, deceived them,—and now we wish
                  them back at the very time it would be impossible to live without them. How happy
                  is the mind that believes a 'nigger' must be a nigger for ever and ever; and that
                  we must do all in our power to keep him from being anything else!" And her soft
                  blue eyes glowed with sympathy; it was the soul of a noble woman intent on doing
                  good. She had stepped from the darkness of a political error into the airy height
                  of light and love.
               Daddy and Bradshaw had taken care of the horses; the deacon greeted his negroes as
                  one by one they came to welcome him; and for each he had a kind word, a joke, a
                  shake of the hand, or an enquiry about some missing member of a family. The scene
                  presented an interesting picture—the interest, policy, and good faith between
                  master and slave. No sooner were the horses cared for, than Daddy and Bradshaw
                  started for the "cabins," to say welcome to the old folks, "a heap a' how de" to
                  the gals, and tell de boys, down yander, in de tater patch, dat
                     Missus come. They must have their touching congratulations,
                  interchange the news of the city for the gossip of the plantation, and drink the
                  cup of tea Mamma makes for the occasion. Soon the plantation is all agog; and the
                  homely, but neat cabins, swarm with negroes of all ages, bustling here and there,
                  and making preparations for the evening supper, which Aunt Peggy, the cook, has
                  been instructed to prepare in her very best style.
               The deacon joins his good lady, and, with Mr. Scranton, they prepare to walk over
                  and view the plantation. They are followed by a retinue of old and young property,
                  giving vent to their thoughts in expressions of gratitude to Missus and Mas'r. A
                  broad expanse of rural beauty stretches towards the west, soft and enchanting. The
                  sun is sinking into the curtains of a refulgent cloud; its crimson light casts a
                  mellow shade over the broad landscape; the evening breeze is wafting coolly over
                  the foliage, a welcome relief to the scorching heat of mid-day; the balmy
                  atmosphere breathes sweetness over the whole. To the north stands a clump of fine
                  old oaks, high above the distant "bottom," reflecting in all their richness the
                  warm tints of the setting sun. The leaves rustle as they pass along; long lines of
                  cotton plants, with their healthy blossoms, brighten in the evening shade; the
                  corn bends under its fruit; the potato field looks fresh and luxuriant, and
                  negroes are gathering from the slip-beds supplies of market gardening. There is
                  but one appearance among the workers—cheerfulness! They welcome Mas'r as he passes
                  along; and again busily employ themselves, hoeing, weeding, and working at the
                  roots of vines in search of destructive insects.
               "My overseers are all black, every one! I would'nt have a white one; they are
                  mostly tyrants," says the deacon, looking at his fields, exultingly. "And my
                  overseers plan out the very best mode of planting. They get through a heap of
                  work, with a little kindness and a little management. Those two things do a deal,
                  Sir! Five years ago, I projected this new system of managing negroes—or, rather my
                  lady planned it,—she is a great manager, you see,—and I adopted it. You see how it
                  has worked, Mr. Scranton." The deacon takes Mr. Scranton by the arm, pointing over
                  the broad expanse of cultivated land, bending under the harvest. I make all my
                  negroes marry when they have arrived at a specific age; I assure them I never will
                  sell one unless he or she commits a heinous crime; and I never have. There is a
                  great deal in keeping faith with a negro; he is of mankind, and moved by natural
                  laws mentally and physically, and feels deeply the want of what we rarely regard
                  of much consequence—confidence in his master's word. Wife encourages their moral
                  energy; I encourage their physical by filling their bellies with as much corn and
                     bacon as they can eat; and then I
                  give them five cents per day (the heads of families) to get those little
                  necessaries which are so essential to their comfort and encouragement. I call it
                  our paid-labour system; and I give them tasks, too, and when they have finished
                  them I allow a small stipend for extra work. It's a small mite for a great end;
                  and it's such an encouragement with them that I get about thirty per cent. more
                  work done. And then I allow them to read just as much as they please—what do I
                  care about law? I don't want to live where learning to read is dangerous to the
                  State, I don't. Their learning to read never can destroy their affections for me
                  and wife; and kindness to them will make them less dangerous in case of
                  insurrection. It's not the education we've got to fear; our fears increase with
                  the knowledge of our oppression. They know these things—they feel them; and if by
                  educating them one can cultivate their confidence, had we not better do it with a
                  view to contingencies? Now, as the result of our system, we have promised to give
                  all our negroes their freedom at the expiration of ten years, and send such as
                  wish to go, to Liberia; but, I hold that they can do as much for us at home, work
                  for us if properly encouraged, and be good free citizens, obedient to the laws of
                  the State, serving the general good of a great country."
               "Yes!" the good lady interposes; "I want to see those things carried out; they
                  will yet work for the regeneration of their own race. Heaven will some day reward
                  the hand that drags the cursed mantle from off poor Africa; and Africa herself
                  will breathe a prayer to Heaven in grateful acknowledgment of the act that frees
                  her from the stain of being the world's bonded warehouse for human flesh and
                  blood."
               The deacon interrupts,—suggests "that it were better to move practically; and that
                  small streams may yet direct how a mountain may be removed. Our Union is a great
                  monument of what a Republic may be,—a happy combination of life, freshness, and
                  greatness, upon which the Old World looks with distrust. The people have founded
                  its happiness—its greatness! God alone knows its destiny; crowned heads would not
                  weep over its downfall! It were better each citizen felt his heart beating to the
                     words—It is my country; cursed be the hand raised to sever its
                  members!" The lady tells Mr. Scranton that their produce has increased every year;
                  that last year they planted one hundred and twenty acres with cotton, ninety with
                  corn, forty with sweet potatoes, as many more with slips and roots; and three
                  acres of water-melons for the boys, which they may eat or sell. She assures him
                  that by encouraging the pay system they get a double profit, besides preparing the
                  way for something that must come.
               "Come!" Mr. Scranton interrupts: "let the south be true to herself, and there's no
                  fear of that. But I confess, deacon, there is something good as well as curious
                  about your way of treating niggers." And Mr. Scranton shakes his head, as if the
                  practicability yet remained the great obstacle in his mind. "Your niggers ain't
                  every body's," he concludes.
               "Try it, try it!" Mrs. Rosebrook rejoins: "Go home and propound something that
                  will relieve us from fear—something that will prepare us for any crisis that may
                  occur!"
               It was six o'clock, the plantation bell struck, and the cry sounded "All hands
                  quit work, and repair to supper!" Scarcely had the echoes resounded over the woods
                  when the labourers were seen scampering for their cabins, in great glee. They
                  jumped, danced, jostled one another, and sang the cheering melodies, "Sally put
                  da' hoe cake down!" and "Down in Old Tennessee."
               Reaching their cabins they gathered into a conclave around Daddy and Bradshaw,
                  making the very air resound with their merry jargon. Such a happy meeting—such
                  social congratulations, pouring forth of the heart's affections, warm and true,—it
                  had never been before Mr. Scranton's fortune to witness. Indeed, when he listened
                  to the ready flashes of dialogue accompanying their animation, and saw the strange
                  contortions of their fresh, shining faces, he began to "reckon" there was
                     something about niggers that might, by a process not yet
                  discovered, be turned into something.
               Old "Mammies" strive for the honour of having Daddy and Bradshaw sup at
                     their cabins, taunting each other on the spareness of their meal.
                  Fires are soon lit, the stew-pans brought into requisition, and the smoke, curling
                  upward among a myriad of mosquitoes, is dispersing them like a band of unwelcome
                  intruders; while the corn-mills rattle
                  and rumble, making the din and clatter more confounding. Daddy and Bradshaw being
                  "aristocratic darkies from the city"—caste being tenaciously kept up among
                  negroes—were, of course, recipients of the choicest delicacies the plantation
                  afforded, not excepting fresh eggs poached, and possum. Bradshaw is particularly
                  fond of ghost stories; and as old Maum Nancy deals largely in this article, as
                  well as being the best believer in spectres on the plantation, he concludes to sup
                  with her, in her hospitable cabin, when she will relate all that she has seen
                  since she last saw him. Maum Nancy is as black as a crow, has a rich store of
                  tales on hand; she will please the old man, more particularly when she tells him
                  about the very bad ghost seen about the mansion for more than "three weeks of
                  nights." He has got two sarpents' heads; Maum Nancy declares the statement true,
                  for uncle Enoch "seen him,"—he is a grey ghost—and might a' knocked him over with
                  his wattle, only he darn't lest he should reek his vengeance at some unexpected
                  moment. And then he was the very worst kind of a ghost, for he stole all the
                  chickens, not even leaving the feathers. They said he had a tail like the thing
                  Mas'r Sluck whipped his "niggers" with. Bradshaw sups of Maum Nancy's best,
                  listening to her stories with great concern. The story of the ghost with two heads
                  startles him; his black picture, frame fills with excitement; he has never before
                  heard that ghosts were guilty of predatory crimes. So enchained and excited is he
                  with her story, that the party at the house having finished supper, have made
                  preparations to leave for the city. A finger touches him on the shoulder; he
                  startles, recognises Daddy, who is in search of him, and suddenly becomes
                  conscious that his absence has caused great anxiety. Daddy has found him quietly
                  eating Maum Nancy's cakes, while intently listening to the story about the ghost
                     "what" steals all her chickens. He is quite unconcerned about
                  Mas'r, Missus—anything but the ghost! He catches his cap, gives Nancy's hand a
                  warm shake, says God bless 'em, hastens for the mansion, finds the carriage
                  waiting at the door, for Mas'r and Missus, who take their seats as he arrives.
                  Bradshaw mounts the box again, and away it rolls down the oak avenue. The happy
                  party leave for home; the plantation people are turned out en masse to say good bye to Missus, and "hope Mas'r get safe home."
                  Their greetings sound forth as the carriage disappears in the distance; fainter
                  and fainter the good wish falls upon their ears. They are well on the road; Mr.
                  Scranton, who sits at the side of the good lady, on the back seat, has not deigned
                  to say a word: the evening grows dark, and his mind seems correspondingly gloomy.
                  "I tell you, I feel so pleased, so overjoyed, and so happy when I visit the
                  plantation, to see those poor creatures so happy and so full of fondness! It's
                  worth all the riches to know that one is loved by the poor. Did you ever see such
                  happiness, Mr. Scranton?" Mrs. Rosebrook enquires, coolly.
               "It requires a great deal of thinking, a great deal of caution, a great deal of
                  political foresight, before answering such questions. You'll pardon me, my dear
                  madam, I know you will; I always speak square on questions, you know. It's hard to
                  reconcile oneself to niggers being free."
               "Ah! yes—it's very amiable to think; but how much more praiseworthy to act! If we
                  southern ladies set ourselves about it we can do a great deal; we can save the
                  poor creatures being sold, like cows and calves, in this free country. We must
                  save ourselves from the moral degradation that is upon us. What a pity Marston's
                  friends did not make an effort to change his course! If they had he would not now
                  be in the hands of that Graspum. We are surrounded by a world of temptation; and
                  yet our planters yield to them; they think everything a certainty, forgetting that
                  the moment they fall into Graspum's hands they are gone."
               Mr. Scranton acknowledges he likes the look of things on the plantation, but
                  suggests that it will be considered an innovation,—an innovation too dangerous to
                  be considered. Innovations are dangerous with him,—unpopular, cannot amount to
                  much practical good. He gives these insinuations merely as happy expressions of
                  his own profound opinion. The carriage approaches the villa, which, seen from the
                  distance, seems sleeping in the calm of night. Mr. Scranton is like those among us
                  who are always fearing, but never make an effort to remove the cause; they, too,
                  are doggedly attached to political inconsistency, and, though at times led to see
                  the evil, never can be made to acknowledge the wrong. They reach the garden gate;
                  Mr. Scranton begs to be excused from entering the Villa,—takes a formal leave of his
                  friend, and wends his way home, thinking. "There's something in it!" he says to
                  himself, as he passes the old bridge that separates the city from the suburb.
                  "It's not so much for the present as it is for the hereafter. Nobody thinks of
                  repairing this old bridge, and yet it has been decaying under our eyes for years.
                  Some day it will suddenly fall,—a dozen people will be precipitated into the water
                  below, some killed; the city will then resound with lamentations; every body knows
                  it must take place one of these days, everybody is to blame, but no special
                  criminal can be found. There's something in the comparison!" he says, looking over
                  the old railing into the water. And then his thoughts wandered to the plantation.
                  There the germs of an enlightened policy were growing up; the purity of a noble
                  woman's heart was spreading blessings among a downcast race, cultivating their
                  minds, raising them up to do good for themselves, to reward the efforts of the
                  benefactor. Her motto was:—Let us through simple means seek the elevation of a
                  class of beings whose degradation has distracted the political wisdom of our happy
                  country, from its conquest to the present day. "There's something in it," again
                  mutters Mr. Scranton, as he enters his room, lights his taper, and with his elbow
                  resting on the table, his head supported in his hand, sits musing over the
                  subject.
               
                  
                     THE PLANTATION CHURCH. "Peace reigns at Rosebrook's plantation. How vivid
                        of happiness was the scene presented in that plantation church."
                  
               
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               ELDER PEMBERTON PRAISEWORTHY CHANGES HIS BUSINESS.
               LET us beg the reader's indulgence for a few moments, while we say that Mr.
                  Scranton belonged to that large class of servile flatterers who too often come
                  from the New England States—men, who, having no direct interest in slaves, make no
                  scruple of sacrificing their independence that they may appear true to the south
                  and slavery. Such men not unfrequently do the political vampirism of the south
                  without receiving its thanks, but look for the respect of political factions for
                  being loudest supporters of inconsistency. They never receive the thanks of the
                  southerner; frequently and deservedly do they sink into contempt!
               A few days after the visit to the plantation we have described in the foregoing
                  chapter, Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy, divested of his pastoral occupation, and
                  seriously anxious to keep up his friendly associations with those who had taken a
                  part in furthering the cause of humanity, calls on his old acquaintance, Mrs.
                  Rosebrook. He has always found a welcome under her hospitable roof,—a good meal,
                  over which he could discourse the benefits he bestowed, through his spiritual
                  mission, upon a fallen race; never leaving without kindly asking permission to
                  offer up a prayer, in which he invoked the mercy of the Supreme Ruler over all
                  things. In this instance he seems somewhat downcast, forlorn; he has changed his
                  business; his brown, lean face, small peering eyes, and low forehead, with bristly
                  black hair standing erect, give his features a careworn air. He apologises for the
                  unceremonious call, and says he always forgets etiquette in his fervour to do
                  good; to serve his fellow-creatures, to be a Christian among the living, and serve
                  the dying and the dead—if such have wants—is his motto. And that his motives may
                  not be misconstrued he has come to report the peculiar phases of the business he
                  found it actually necessary to turn his hand to. That he will gain a complete
                  mastery over the devil he has not the fraction of a doubt; and as he has always—deeming him less
                  harmless than many citizens of the south—had strong prejudices against that
                  gentleman, he now has strong expectations of carrying his point against him. Elder
                  Praiseworthy once heard a great statesman—who said singular things as well in as
                  out of Congress—say that he did'nt believe the devil was a bad fellow after all;
                  and that with a little more schooling he might make a very useful gentleman to
                  prevent duelling—in a word, that there was no knowing how we'd get along at the
                  south without such an all-important personage. He has had several spells of deep
                  thinking on this point, which, though he cannot exactly agree with it, he holds
                  firmly to the belief that, so far as it affects duelling, the devil should be one
                  of the principals, and he, being specially ordained, the great antagonist to
                  demolish him with his chosen weapon—humanity.
               "They tell me you have gone back into the world," says Mrs. Rosebrook, as the
                  waiter hands Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy a chair. "It's only the duty of love, of
                  Christian goodness, he humbly replies, and takes his seat as Mrs. Rosebrook
                  says—"pray be seated!"
               "I'm somewhat fatigued; but it's the fatigue of loving to do good," he says,
                  rubbing his hands very piously, and giving a look of great ministerial seriousness
                  at the good lady. We will omit several minor portions of the Elder's cautious
                  introduction of his humane occupation, commencing where he sets forth the kind
                  reasons for such a virtuous policy. "You honestly think you are serving the Lord,
                  do you?" enquires the lady, as she takes her seat.
               The Elder evinces surprise at such a question. Hath he moved among Christians so
                  many years, ministering to spiritual wants, and yet the purity of his motives be
                  questioned? "Good madam! we must have faith to believe. All that is meant well
                  should be accepted in the greatness of the intention. You will observe, I am
                  neither a lawyer nor a politician; I would'nt be for the world! We must always be
                  doing something for the good of others; and we must not forget, whilst we are
                  doing it, to serve the Allwise one; and while we are effecting the good of one we
                  are serving the designs of the other." Thus emphatically spoke the Elder,
                  fingering a book that lay on the table. "I buy sick people, I save the dying, and
                  I instruct them in the ways of the Lord as soon as they are cured, and—" And here
                  the Elder suddenly stops.
               "Add, Mr. Praiseworthy, that when you have cured them, and instructed them in the
                  way of the Lord, you sell them!" interrupts the lady, watching the sudden changes
                  that pass over his craven features.
               "I always get them good masters; I never fail in that. Nor do I stand upon the
                  profit—it's the humanity I takes into the balance." He conceives good under the
                  motley garb of his new mission.
               "Humanity—strange humanity, with self coiled beneath. Why, Mr. Praiseworthy!" the
                  lady starts from her seat, and speaks with emphasis, "do you tell me that you have
                  become a resurrection man, standing at the platform of death, interposing with it
                  for a speculation?"
               "It's no uncommon business, Madam; hundreds follow it; some have got rich at
                  it."
               "Got rich at it!" Mrs. Rosebrook interrupts, as a sagacious looking cat bounds on
                  the table, much to the discomfiture of the Elder, who jumps up in a great
                  fright,—"What irresistible natures we have; may heaven save us from the cravings
                  of avarice!"
               The Elder very methodically puts the interrupting cat upon the floor, and resumes
                  his seat. "Why, bless us, good madam, we must have something to keep our
                  consciences clear; there's nothing like living a straightforward life."
               "What a horrible inconsistency! Buying the sick and the dying. May the dead not
                  come in for a portion of your singular generosity? If you can speculate in the
                  dying why exclude the dead? the principle would serve the same faith in
                  Christianity. The heart that can purchase the dying must be full of sad coldness,
                  dragging the woes and pains of mortality down to a tortuous death. Save us from
                  the feelings of speculation,—call them Christian, if you will,—that makes man look
                  upon a dying mortal, valuing but the dollars and cents that are passing away with
                  his life," she interrupts, giving vent to her pent-up feelings.
               Mr. Praiseworthy suggests that the good lady does not comprehend the virtue lying
                  beneath his motives; that it takes a philosophical mind to analyse the good that
                  can be done to human nature, especially poor black human nature. And he asserts, with great sincerity, that saving
                  the lives of those about to die miserable deaths is a wonderful thing for the
                  cause of humanity. Buying them saves their hopeless lives; and if that isn't
                  praiseworthy nothing can be, and when the act is good the motive should not be
                  questioned.
               "Do you save their lives for a Christian purpose, or is it lucre you seek, Mr.
                  Praiseworthy?" she enquires, giving the Elder a significant look, and waiting for
                  a reply.
               The Elder rises sedately, and walks across the room, considering his reply. "The
                  question's so kind of round about," he mutters, as she continues:—
               "Sick when you purchase, your Christianity consists in the art of healing; but you
                  sell them, and consequently save their lives for a profit. There is no cholera in
                  our plantation, thank God! you cannot speculate on our sick. You outshine the
                  London street Jews; they deal in old clothes, you deal in human oddities,
                  tottering infirmity, sick negroes." Mrs. Rosebrook suggests that such a business
                  in a great and happy country should be consigned to its grave-digger and
                  executioner, or made to pay a killing income tax.
               The humane Elder views his clothes; they have become somewhat threadbare since he
                  entered upon his new profession. He, as may be supposed, feels the force of the
                  lady's remarks, and yet cannot bring his mind to believe himself actuated by
                  anything but a love to do good. Kindness, he contends, was always the most
                  inherent thing in his nature: it is an insult to insinuate anything degrading
                  connected with his calling. And, too, there is another consolation which soars
                  above all,—it is legal, and there is a respectability connected with all legal
                  callings.
               "To be upright is my motto, madam," the Elder says, drawing his hand modestly over
                  his mouth, and again adjusting the tie of his white neck-cloth. "I'm trying to
                  save them, and a penny with them. You see—the Lord forgive him!—my dear madam,
                  Marston didn't do the clean thing with me; and, the worst of all was, he made a
                  preacher of that nigger of his. The principle is a very bad one for nigger
                  property to contend for; and when their masters permit it, our profession is
                  upset; for, whenever a nigger becomes a preacher, he's sure to be a profitable
                  investment for his owner. There is where it injures us; and we have no redress,
                  because the nigger preacher is his master's property, and his master can make him
                  preach, or do what he pleases with him," says Mr. Praiseworthy, becoming extremely
                  serious.
               "Ah! yes,—self pinches the principles; I see where it is, Elder," says the lady.
                  "But you were indiscreet, given to taking at times; and the boy
                  Harry, proving himself quite as good at preaching, destroyed your practice. I wish
                  every negro knew as much of the Bible as that boy Harry. There would be no fear of
                  insurrections; it would be the greatest blessing that ever befell the South. It
                  would make some of your Christians blush,—perhaps ashamed."
               "Ashamed! ashamed! a thing little used the way times are," he mutters, fretting
                  his fingers through his bristly hair, until it stands erect like quills on a
                  porcupine's back. This done, he measuredly adjusts his glasses on the tip of his
                  nose, giving his tawny visage an appearance at once strange and indicative of all
                  the peculiarities of his peculiar character. "It wasn't that," he says, "Marston
                  did'nt get dissatisfied with my spiritual conditions; it was the saving made by
                  the negro's preaching. But, to my new business, which so touches your sensitive
                  feelings. If you will honour me, my dear madam, with a visit at my hospital, I am
                  certain your impressions will change, and you will do justice to my motives."
               "Indeed!" interrupts the lady, quickly, "nothing would give me more
                  gratification,—I esteem any person engaged in a laudable pursuit; but if
                  philanthropy be expressed through the frailties of speculation,—especially where
                  it is carried out in the buying and selling of afflicted men and women,—I am
                  willing to admit the age of progress to have got ahead of me. However, Elder, I
                  suppose you go upon the principle of what is not lost to sin being gained to the
                  Lord: and if your sick property die pious, the knowledge of it is a sufficient
                  recompense for the loss." Thus saying, she readily accepted the Elder's kind
                  invitation, and, ordering a basket of prepared nourishment, which, together with
                  the carriage, was soon ready, she accompanied him to his infirmary. They drove
                  through narrow lanes and streets lined with small dilapidated cottages, and
                  reached a wooden tenement near the suburb of the city of C——. It was surrounded by a lattice fence, the approach
                  being through a gate, on which was inscribed, "Mr. Praiseworthy's Infirmary;" and
                  immediately below this, in small letters, was the significant notice, "Planters
                  having the cholera and other prevailing diseases upon their plantations will
                  please take notice that I am prepared to pay the highest price for the infirm and
                  other negroes attacked with the disease. Offers will be made for the most doubtful
                  cases!"
               "Elder Praiseworthy!" ejaculates the lady, starting back, and stopping to read the
                  strange sign. "'Offers will be made for the most doubtful cases!'" she mutters,
                  turning towards him with a look of melancholy. "What thoughts, feelings,
                  sentiments! That means, that unto death you have a pecuniary interest in their
                  bodies; and, for a price, you will interpose between their owners and death. The
                  mind so grotesque as to conceive such a purpose should be restrained, lest it
                  trifle with life unconsciously."
               "You see," interrupts Mr. Praiseworthy, looking more serious than ever, "It's the
                  life saved to the nigger; he's grateful for it; and if they ain't pious just then,
                  it gives them time to consider, to prepare themselves. My little per centage is
                  small—it's a mean commission; and if it were not for the satisfaction of knowing
                  how much good I do, it wouldn't begin to pay a professional gentleman." As the
                  Elder concludes his remarks, melancholy sounds are breaking forth in frightful
                  discord. From strange murmurings it rises into loud wailings and implorings. "Take
                  me, good Lord, to a world of peace!" sounds in her ears, as they approach through
                  a garden and enter a door that opens into a long room, a store-house of human
                  infirmity, where moans, cries, and groans are made a medium of traffic. The room,
                  about thirty feet long and twenty wide, is rough-boarded, contains three tiers of
                  narrow berths, one above the other, encircling its walls. Here and there on the
                  floor are cots, which Mr. Praiseworthy informs us are for those whose cases he
                  would not give much for. Black nurses are busily attending the sick property; some
                  are carrying bowls of gruel, others rubbing limbs and quieting the cries of the
                  frantic, and again supplying water to quench thirst. On a round table that stands
                  in the centre of the room is a large medicine-chest, disclosing papers, pills,
                  powders, phials, and plasters, strewn about in great disorder. A bedlam of ghastly
                  faces presents itself,—dark, haggard, and frantic with the pains of the malady
                  preying upon the victims. One poor wretch springs from his couch, crying, "Oh,
                  death! death! come soon!" and his features glare with terror. Again he utters a
                  wild shriek, and bounds round the room, looking madly at one and another, as if
                  chased by some furious animal. The figure of a female, whose elongated body seems
                  ready to sink under its disease, sits on a little box in the corner, humming a
                  dolorous air, and looking with glassy eyes pensively around the room at those
                  stretched in their berths. For a few seconds she is quiet; then, contorting her
                  face into a deep scowl, she gives vent to the most violent bursts of
                  passion,—holds her long black hair above her head, assumes a tragic attitude,
                  threatens to distort it from the scalp. "That one's lost her mind—she's fitty; but
                  I think the devil has something to do with her fits. And, though you wouldn't
                  think it, she's just as harmless as can be," Mr. Praiseworthy coolly remarks,
                  looking at Mrs. Rosebrook, hoping she will say something encouraging in reply. The
                  lady only replies by asking him if he purchased her from her owner?
               Mr. Praiseworthy responds in the affirmative, adding that she doesn't seem to like
                  it much. He, however, has strong hopes of curing her mind, getting it "in fix"
                  again, and making a good penny on her. "She's a'most white, and, unfortunately,
                  took a liking to a young man down town. Marston owned her then, and, being a
                  friend of hers, wouldn't allow it, and it took away her senses; he thought her
                  malady incurable, and sold her to me for a little or nothing," he continues, with
                  great complacency.
               This poor broken flower of misfortune holds down her head as the lady approaches,
                  gives a look of melancholy expressive of shame and remorse. "She's sensitive for a
                  nigger, and the only one that has said anything about being put among men," Mr.
                  Praiseworthy remarks, advancing a few steps, and then going from berth to berth,
                  descanting on the prospects of his sick, explaining their various diseases, their
                  improvements, and his doubts of the dying. The lady watches all his movements, as
                  if more intently interested in Mr. Praiseworthy's strange character. "And here's
                  one," he says, "I fear I shall lose; and if I do, there's fifty dollars gone, slap!" and he points to an
                  emaciated yellow man, whose body is literally a crust of sores, and whose painful
                  implorings for water and nourishment are deep and touching.
               "Poor wretch!" Mr. Praiseworthy exclaims, "I wish I'd never bought him—it's pained
                  my feelings so; but I did it to save his life when he was most dead with the
                  rheumatics, and was drawn up as crooked as branch cord-wood. And then, after I had
                  got the cinques out of him—after nearly getting
                  him straight for a 'prime fellow' (good care did the thing), he took the water on
                  the chest, and is grown out like that." He points coolly to the sufferer's breast,
                  which is fearfully distended with disease; saying that, "as if that wasn't enough,
                  he took the lepors, and it's a squeak if they don't end him." He pities the
                  "crittur," but has done all he can for him, which he would have done if he hadn't
                  expected a copper for selling him when cured. "So you see, madam," he reiterates,
                  "it isn't all profit. I paid a good price for the poor skeleton, have had all ny
                  trouble, and shall have no gain—except the recompense of feeling. There was a time
                  when I might have shared one hundred and fifty dollars by him, but I felt humane
                  towards him; didn't want him to slide until he was a No. 1." Thus the Elder sets
                  forth his own goodness of heart.
               "Pray, what do you pay a head for them, Mr. Praiseworthy?" enquires the lady,
                  smoothing her hand over the feverish head of the poor victim, as the carnatic of
                  her cheek changed to pallid languor. Pursuing her object with calmness, she
                  determined not to display her emotions until fully satisfied how far the Elder
                  would go.
               "That, madam, depends on cases; cripples are not worth much. But, now and then, we
                  get a legless fellow what's sound in body, can get round sprightly, and such like;
                  and, seeing how we can make him answer a sight of purposes, he'll bring
                  something," he sedately replies, with muscles unmoved. "Cases what doctors give up
                  as 'done gone,' we gets for ten and twenty dollars; cases not hanging under other
                  diseases, we give from thirty to fifty—and so on! Remember, however, you must
                  deduct thirty per cent. for death. At times, where you would make two or three
                  hundred dollars by curing one, and saving his life, you lose three, sometimes
                  half-a-dozen head." The Elder consoles his feelings with the fact that it is not
                  all profit, looks highly gratified, puts a large cut of tobacco in his mouth,
                  thanks God that the common school-bill didn't pass in the legislature, and that
                  his business is more humane than people generally admit.
               "How many have you in all?"
               "The number of head, I suppose? Well, there's about thirty sick, and ten well ones
                  what I sent to market last week. Did-n-'t-make—a—good market, though," he drawls
                  out.
               "You are alone in the business?"
               "Well, no; I've a partner—Jones; there's a good many phases in the business, you
                  see, and one can't get along. Jones was a nigger-broker, and Jones and me went
                  into partnership to do the thing smooth up, on joint account. I does the curing,
                  and he does the selling, and we both turns a dollar or two—"
               "Oh, horrors!" interrupts the lady, looking at Mr. Praiseworthy sarcastically.
                  "Murder will out, men's sentiments will betray them, selfishness will get above
                  them all; ornament them as you will, their ornaments will drop,—naked self will
                  uncover herself and be the deceiver."
               "Not at all!" the Elder exclaims, in his confidence. "The Lord's will is in
                  everything; without it we could not battle with the devil; we relieve suffering
                  humanity, and the end justifies the means."
               "You should have left out the means: it is only the end you aim at."
               "That's like accusing Deacon Seabury of impious motives, because he shaves notes at an illegal interest. It's worse—because what the law makes legal
                  the church should not make sinful." This is Praiseworthy's philosophy, which he
                  proclaims while forgetting the existence of a law of conscience having higher
                  claims than the technicalities of statutes. We must look to that to modify our
                  selfishness, to strengthen our love for human laws when founded in justice.
               "And who is this poor girl?" enquires Mrs. Rosebrook, stepping softly forward, and
                  taking her by the hand.
               "Marston's once; some Indian in her, they say. She's right fair looks when she's
                  herself. Marston's in trouble now, and
                  the cholera has made sad havoc of his niggers," Mr. Praiseworthy replies, placing
                  a chair, and motioning his hand for the lady to be seated. The lady seats herself
                  beside the girl,—takes her hand.
               "Yes, missus; God bless good missus. Ye don't know me now," mutters the poor girl,
                  raising her wild glassy eyes, as she parts the long black hair from her forehead:
                  "you don't know me; I'm changed so!"
               "My child, who has made you this wretch?" says the good lady, pressing her tawny
                  hand.
               My child!" she exclaims, with emphasis: "My child Nicholas,—my child! Missus, save
                  Nicholas; he is my child. Oh! do save him!" and, as if terrified, she grasps
                  tighter the lady's hand, while her emotions swell into a frantic outburst of
                  grief. "Nicholas, my child!" she shrieks.
               "She will come to, soon: it's only one of her strange fits of aberration.
                  Sometimes I fling cold water over her; and, if it's very cold, she soon comes to,"
                  Mr. Praiseworthy remarks, as he stands unmoved, probably contemplating the
                  goodness of a forgiving God. What magic simplicity lies concealed in his nature;
                  and yet it is his trade, sanctioned by the law of a generous state. Let us bless
                  the land that has given us power to discover the depths to which human nature can
                  reduce itself, and what man can make himself when human flesh and blood become
                  mere things of traffic.
               "That gal's name is Ellen. I wish I knew all that has turned up at Marston's,"
                  remarks the Elder.
               "Ellen!" ejaculates the lady, looking at her more intently, placing her left hand
                  under her chin. "Not Ellen Juvarna?"
               "Yes, good missus—the lady has distributed her nourishment among the sick—that's
                  my name," she says, raising her eyes with a look of melancholy that tells the tale
                  of her troubles. Again her feelings subside into quiet; she seems in meditation.
                  "I knowed you once, good missus, but you don't know me now, I'm changed so!" she
                  whispers, the good lady holding her hand, as a tear courses down her cheek—"I'm
                  changed so!" she whispers, shaking her head.
            
            
               CHAPTER 
                     XII.
                     XIII.
                  
               
               A FATHER TRIES TO BE A FATHER.
               WE have conducted the reader through scenes perhaps unnecessary to our narration,
                  nevertheless associated with and appertaining to the object of our work. And, in
                  this sense, the reader cannot fail to draw from them lessons developing the
                  corrupting influences of a body politic that gives one man power to sell another.
                  They go to prove how soon a man may forget himself,—how soon he may become a demon
                  in the practice of abominations, how soon he can reconcile himself to things that
                  outrage the most sacred ties of our social being. And, too, consoling himself with
                  the usages of society, making it right, gives himself up to the most barbarous
                  practices.
               When we left Marston in a former chapter, he had become sensible of the wrong he
                  so long assisted to inflict upon innocent and defenceless persons; and, stung with
                  remorse made painful by the weight of misfortune, had avowed his object of saving
                  his children. Yet, strange as it may seem, so inured were his feelings to those
                  arbitrary customs which slave-owners are educated to view as privileges guaranteed
                  in the rights of a peculiar institution—the rights of property in the being
                  slave—that, although conscious of his duty toward the children, no sooner had the
                  mother of Nicholas been attacked with cholera, than he sold her to the Elder
                  Pemberton Praiseworthy, in whose infirmary we have just left her. The Elder, since
                  his discharge from parochial life,—from ministering the gospel, has transferred
                  his mission to that of being the partner in a firm, the ostensible business of
                  which is purchasing the sick, the living, and the dying.
               Do not blush, reader; you know not how elastic dealing in human kind makes man's
                  feelings. Gold is the beacon-light of avarice; for it man will climb over a
                  catacomb of the dead. In this instance the very man—Marston—who, touched by misfortune, began to cherish a father's
                  natural feelings, could see nothing but property in the mother, though he knew
                  that mother to be born free. Perhaps it was not without some compunction of
                  feelings—perhaps it was done to soften the separation at that moment so necessary
                  to the preservation of the children. But we must leave this phase of the picture,
                  and turn to another.
               Graspum had diligently watched Marston's affairs, and through the cunning and
                  perseverance of Romescos, carefully noted every movement on the plantation. Each
                  death from cholera was reported,—the change in Marston's feelings observed and
                  provided against,—every stage of the crop carefully watched. Graspum, however, had
                  secured himself in the real estate, and gave little heed to the epidemic that was
                  carrying off the negro property. Finally, to pass over several stages in the
                  decline of Marston's affairs, the ravages of the disease continued until but
                  forty-three negroes, old and young, were left on the old homestead. The
                  culminating point had arrived. He was in the grasp of Graspum, and nothing could
                  save him from utter ruin. It had lately been proved that the Rovero family,
                  instead of being rich, were extremely poor, their plantation having long been
                  under a mortgage, the holder of which was threatening foreclosure.
               With Marston, an amount of promiscuous debts had accumulated so far beyond his
                  expectation that he was without means of discharging them. His affairs became more
                  and more confused, while the amount of his liabilities remained a perfect
                  obscurity to the community. Rumour began to disseminate his troubles, suspicion
                  summoned her charges, and town-talk left little unadded; while those of his
                  creditors who had been least suspicious of his wealth and honour became the most
                  importunate applicants for their claims. At length, driven by the pressure of the
                  times, he calls Clotilda to him, and tells her that he is resolved to send Annette
                  and Nicholas into the city, where they will remain in the care of a coloured
                  woman, until an opportunity offers of sending them to the north. He is fond of
                  Clotilda,—tells her of the excitement concerning his business affairs, and
                  impresses her with the necessity of preserving calmness; it is requisite to the
                  evasion of any ulterior consequence that may be brought upon him. everything thing
                  hangs upon a thread—a political thread, a lawful thread—a thread that holds the
                  fate of thirty, forty, or fifty human beings—that separates them from that verge
                  of uncertainty upon which a straw may turn the weal or woe of their lives. "When I
                  get them comfortably cared for, Clotilda, I will send for you. Nicholas's mother
                  has gone, but you shall be a mother to them both," he says, looking upon her
                  seriously, as if contemplating the trouble before him in the attempt to rescue his
                  children.
               "You will not send Annette away without me?" she inquires, quickly, falling on her
                  knees at his side, and reiterating, "Don't send Annette away without me,—don't,
                  mas'r!"
               "The separation will only be for a few days. Annette shall be educated—I care not
                  for the laws of our free land against it—and together you shall go where your
                  parentage will not shame you,—where you may ornament society," he replies, as
                  Clotilda's face lights up with satisfaction. With such an assurance—she does not
                  comprehend the tenour of his troubles—her freedom seems at hand: it excites her to
                  joy. Marston retires and she takes his seat, writes a note to Maxwell, who is then
                  in the city, relating what has transpired, and concluding with a request that he
                  will call and see her.
               A few days passed, and the two children were sent into the city and placed in the
                  charge of a free woman, with instructions to keep them secreted for several weeks.
                  This movement being discovered by Romescos, was the first signal for an onset of
                  creditors. Graspum, always first to secure himself, in this instance compelled
                  Marston to succumb to his demands by threatening to disclose the crime Lorenzo had
                  committed. Forcing him to fulfil the obligation in the bond, he took formal
                  possession of the plantation. This increased the suspicion of fraud; there was a
                  mystery somewhere,—nobody could solve it. Marston, even his former friends
                  declared, was a swindler. He could not be honestly indebted in so large an amount
                  to Graspum; nor could he be so connected with such persons without something being
                  wrong somewhere. Friends began to insinuate that they had been misled; and not a
                  few among those who had enjoyed his hospitality were first inclined to scandalise
                  his integrity. Graspum had foreseen all this, and, with Romescos, who had purloined the bill of sale, was
                  prepared to do any amount of swearing. Marston is a victim of circumstances; his
                  proud spirit prompts him to preserve from disgrace the name of his family, and
                  thus he the more easily yielded to the demands of the betrayer. Hence, Graspum,
                  secure in his ill-gotten booty, leaves his victim to struggle with those who come
                  after him.
               A few weeks pass over, and the equity of Graspum's claim is questioned: his
                  character for honour being doubted, gives rise to much comment. The whole thing is
                  denounced—proclaimed a concerted movement to defraud the rightful creditors. And
                  yet, knowing the supremacy of money over law in a slave state, Graspum's power,
                  the revenge his followers inflict, and their desperate character, not one dare
                  come forward to test the validity of the debt. They know and fear the fierce
                  penalty: they are forced to fall back,—to seize his person, his property, his
                  personal effects.
               In this dilemma, Marston repairs to the city, attempts to make an arrangement with
                  his creditors, singularly fails; he can effect nothing. Wherever he goes his
                  salutation meets a cold, measured response; whisper marks him a swindler. The
                  knife stabs deep into the already festered wound. Misfortune bears heavily upon a
                  sensitive mind; but accusation of wrong, when struggling under trials, stabs
                  deepest into the heart, and bears its victim suffering to the very depths of
                  despair.
               To add to this combination of misfortunes, on his return to the plantation he
                  found it deserted,—a sheriff's keeper guarding his personal effects, his few
                  remaining negroes seized upon and marched into the city for the satisfaction of
                  his debts. Clotilda has been seized upon, manacled, driven to the city, committed
                  to prison. Another creditor has found out the hiding-place of the children;
                  directs the sheriff, who seizes upon them, like property of their kind, and drags
                  them to prison. Oh, that prison walls were made for torturing the innocent!
               Marston is left poor upon the world; Ellen Juvarna is in the hands of a
                  resurrectionist; Nicholas—a bright boy he has grown—is within the dark confines of
                  a prison cell, along with Clotilda and Annette. Melancholy broods over the
                  plantation now. The act of justice,—the right which Marston saw through wrong, and
                  which he had intended to carry out,—is now beyond his power. Stripped of those
                  comforts he had enjoyed, his offspring carried off as trophies of avarice,—perhaps
                  for sale to some ruffian who would set a price upon their beauty,—he sits down,
                  sick at heart, and weeps a child's tears. The mansion, so long the scene of
                  pleasure and hospitality, is like a deserted barrack;—still, gloomy, cold, in the
                  absence of familiar faces. No servant comes to call him master,—Dandy and Enoch
                  are gone; and those familiar words, so significant of affection between master and
                  slave, "Glad to see ye home, mas'r," no longer sounded in his ears. Even his
                  overseer has become alarmed, and like the rest levied for arrears of wages.
               There is nothing for Marston but to give up all,—to leave the home of his
                  childhood, his manhood, his happier days. He is suddenly reminded that there is
                  virtue in fortitude; and, as he gazes round the room, the relics of happier days
                  redouble his conviction of the evil he has brought upon himself by straying from
                  the paths of rectitude. Indeed, so sudden was his fall from distinction, that the
                  scene around him seemed like a dream, from which he had just awoke to question its
                  precipitancy. "A sheriff is here now, and I am a mere being of sufferance," he
                  says, casting a moody glance around the room, as if contemplating the dark
                  prospect before him. A few moments' pause, and he rises, walks to the window,
                  looks out upon the serene scene spread out before the mansion. There is the river,
                  on which he has spent so many pleasant hours, calmly winding its way through deep
                  green foliage mellowed by the moonlight. Its beauties only remind him of the past.
                  He walks away,—struggles to forget, to look above his trials. He goes to the old
                  side-board that has so long given forth its cheer; that, too, is locked! "Locked
                  to me!" he says, attempting to open its doors. A sheriff's lock hangs upon them.
                  Accustomed to every indulgence, each check indicated a doubt of his honour,
                  wounding his feelings. The smaller the restraint the deeper did it pierce his
                  heart. While in this desponding mood, vainly endeavouring to gain resolution to
                  carry him through, a gentle rap is heard at the door. Who can it be at this hour?
                  he questions to himself. No servant is near him; servants have all been led into
                  captivity for the satisfaction of debts. He approaches the door and opens it
                  himself, looking cautiously into the corridor. There, crouched in a niche, alternately presenting fear
                  and joy,—fear lest he be seen by the enemy, and joy to see his master,—is a dark
                  figure with the familiar face of Daddy Bob,—Bob of the old plantation. The old,
                  faithful servant puts out his wrinkled hand nervously, saying, "Oh, good mas'r!"
                  He has looked up to Marston with the same love that an affectionate child does to
                  a kind parent; he has enjoyed mas'r's warm welcome, nurtured his confidence, had
                  his say in directing the affairs of the plantation, and watched the frailties that
                  threatened it.
               "Why, Daddy Bob! Can it be you?" Marston says, modulating his voice, as a change
                  comes over his feelings.
               "Dis is me, mas'r; it is me," again says the old man. He is wet with the night
                  dew, but his heart is warm and affectionate. Marston seizes his hand as if to
                  return the old man's gratitude, and leads him into the room, smiling. "Sit down,
                  Bob, sit down!" he says, handing him a chair. The old servant stands at the chair
                  hesitatingly, doubting his position. "Fear nothing, Bob; sit down. You are my best
                  friend," Marston continues. Bob takes a seat, lays his cap quietly upon the floor,
                  smiles to see old mas'r, but don't feel just right because there's something
                  wrong: he draws the laps of his jacket together, covers the remnant of a shirt.
                  "Mas'r, what be da' gwine to do wid de old plantation? Tings, Bob reckon, b'nt
                  gwine straight," he speaks, looking at Marston shyly. The old slave knew his
                  master's heart, and had waited for him to unfold its beatings; but the kind heart
                  of the master yielded to the burden that was upon it, and never more so than when
                  moved by the strong attachment evinced by the old man. There was mutual sympathy
                  pourtrayed in the tenderest emotions. The one was full of grief, and, if touched
                  by the word of a friend, would overflow; the other was susceptible of kindness,
                  knew something had befallen his master, and was ready to present the best proofs
                  of his attachment.
               "And how did you get here, my old faithful?" inquires Marston, drawing nearer to
                  him.
               "Well, mas'r, ye see, t'ant just so wid nigger what don' know how tings is! But,
                  Bob up t' dese tings. I sees Buckra, what look as if he hab no rights on dis
                  plantation, grab'n up all de folks. And Lor,' mas'r, old Bob could'nt leave mas'r
                  no how. An, den, when da' begins to chain de folks up—da' chain up old Rachel,
                  mas'r!—Old Bob feel so de plantation war'nt no-whare; and him time t'be gwine.
                  Da'h an't gwine t' cotch old Bob, and carry 'm way from mas'r, so I jist cum
                  possum ober dem—stows away yander, down close in de old corn crib,—"
               "And you eluded the sheriff to take care of me, did you, Daddy?" interrupts
                  Marston, and again takes the old man's hand.
               "Oh, mas'r, Bob ain't white, but 'is feeling get so fo' h mas'r, he can't speak
                  'em," the old slave replies, pearls glistening in his eyes. "My feelings feel so,
                  I can't speak 'em!" And with a brother's fondness he shakes his master's hand.
               We must beg the reader's indulgence here for the purpose of making a few remarks
                  upon the negro's power of observation. From the many strange disquisitions that
                  have been put forward on the mental qualities of the man of colour—more
                  particularly the African—few can be selected which have not had for their object
                  his disqualification. His power of observation has been much undervalued; but it
                  has been chiefly by those who judge him by a superficial scale, or from a selfish
                  motive. In the position of mere property, he is, of necessity, compelled to yield
                  all claims to mental elevation. And yet, forced to degradation, there are few
                  negroes on the plantation, or in the spheres of labour, who do not note the rise
                  and fall of their master's fortunes, study the nature and prospects of the crop,
                  make enquiries about the market, concoct the best economy in managing lands, and
                  consult among themselves as to what would promote the interests of the whole. So
                  far is this carried out, that in many districts a rivalry for the largest amount
                  of crop on a given space is carried on among the slaves, who not unfrequently
                  "chafe" each other upon the superior wealth and talent of their masters. It is a
                  well-known fact, that John C. Calhoun's slaves, in addition to being extremely
                  fond of him, were proud and boastful of his talent.
               Daddy Bob is an exemplification. The faithful old slave had become sensible of
                  something wrong on the plantation: he saw the sheriff seizing upon the families,
                  secreted himself in the corn crib, and fled to the woods when they were out of
                  sight. Here, sheltered by the myrtle, he remained until midnight, intently
                  watching the mansion for signs of old
                  mas'r. Suddenly a light glimmers from the window; the old slave's feelings bound
                  with joy; he feels it an invitation for him to return, and, leaving his
                  hiding-place, approaches the house stealthily, and descries his master at the
                  window. Confidence returns, his joy is complete, his hopes have not misled him.
                  Hungry and wet, he has found his way back to master, whose face at the window
                  gladdens his heart,—carries him beyond the bounds of caution. Hence the cordial
                  greeting between the old slave and his indulgent master. We hear the oft-expressed
                  words—"Master! I love ye, I do!" Marston gets a candle, lights the old man to a
                  bed in the attic, bids him good night, and retires.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               IN WHICH THE EXTREMES ARE PRESENTED.
               WHILE the gloomy prospect we have just presented hovered over Marston's
                  plantation, proceedings of no minor importance, and having reference to this
                  particular case, are going on in and about the city. Maxwell, moved by Clotilda's
                  implorings, had promised to gain her freedom for her; but he knew the penalty,
                  feared the result of a failure, and had hesitated to make the attempt. The
                  consequences were upon him, he saw the want of prompt action, and regretted that
                  the time for carrying his resolution into effect had passed. The result harassed
                  him; he saw this daughter of misfortune, on her bended knees, breathing a prayer
                  to Omnipotence for the deliverance of her child; he remembered her appeal to him,
                  imploring him to deliver her from the grasp of slavery, from that licentiousness
                  which the female slave is compelled to bear. He saw her confiding in him as a
                  deliverer,—the sight haunted him unto madness! Her child! her child! Yes, that
                  offspring in which her hopes were centered! For it she pleaded and pleaded; for it
                  she offered to sacrifice her own happiness; for it she invoked the all-protecting
                  hand. That child, doomed to a life of chattel misery; to serve the lusts of modern
                  barbarism in a country where freedom and civilization sound praises from ocean to
                  ocean; to be obscured in the darkness and cruelty of an institution in which
                  justice is scoffed, where distress has no listeners, and the trap-keepers of men's
                  souls scorn to make honest recompense while human flesh and blood are weighed in
                  the scale of dollars and cents! He trembles before the sad picture; remonstrances
                  and entreaties from him will be in vain; nor can he seize them and carry them off.
                  His life might be forfeited in the attempt, even were they without prison walls.
                  No! it is almost hopeless. In the narrow confines of a securely grated cell, where
                  thoughts and anxieties waste the soul in disappointment, and where hopes only come
                  and go to spread time with grief, he
                  could only see her and her child as they suffered. The spectacle had no charm; and
                  those who carried them into captivity for the satisfaction of paltry debts could
                  not be made to divest themselves of the self in nature. Cries and sobs were
                  nothing,—such were poor stock for "niggers" to have; pains and anxieties were at a
                  discount, chivalry proclaimed its rule, and nothing was thought well of that
                  lessened the market value of body and soul. Among great, generous, hospitable, and
                  chivalrous men, such things could only be weighed in the common scale of
                  trade.
               Again, Maxwell remembered that Marston had unfolded his troubles to him, and being
                  a mere stranger the confidence warranted mutual reciprocity. If it were merely an
                  act dictated by the impulse of his feelings at that moment, the secret was now
                  laid broadly open. He was father of the children, and, sensible of their critical
                  situation, the sting was goading him to their rescue. The question was—would he
                  interpose and declare them as such? Ah, he forgot it was not the father's
                  assertion,—it was the law. The crime of being property was inherited from the
                  mother. Acknowledging them his children would neither satisfy law nor the
                  creditors. What honourable—we except the modernly chivalrous—man would see his
                  children jostled by the ruffian trader? What man, with feelings less sensitive
                  than iron, would see his child sold to the man-vender for purposes so
                  impious that heaven and earth frowned upon them? And yet the scene was no uncommon
                  one; slavery affords the medium, and men, laying their hearts aside, make it serve
                  their pockets. Those whom it would insult to call less than gentlemen have covered
                  their scruples with the law, while consigning their own offspring to the hand of
                  an auctioneer. Man property is 
                     subvervient
                     subservient
                   material,—woman is even more; for where her virtue forms its tissues,
                  and can be sold, the issue is indeed deplorable. Again, where vice is made a
                  pleasure, and the offspring of it become a burden on our hands, slavery affords
                  the most convenient medium of getting rid of the incumbrance. They sell it,
                  perhaps profitably, and console themselves with the happy recollection of what a
                  great thing it is to live in a free country, where one may get rid of such things
                  profitably. It may save our shame in the eyes of man, but God sees all,—records
                  the wrong!
               Thus Maxwell contemplated the prospects before him. At length he resolved to visit
                  Marston upon his plantation, impress him with the necessity of asserting their
                  freedom, in order to save them from being sold with the effects of the estate.
               He visits Marston's mansion,—finds the picture sadly changed; his generous friend,
                  who has entertained him so hospitably, sits in a little ante-chamber, pensively,
                  as if something of importance has absorbed his attention. No well-dressed servants
                  welcome him with their smiles and grimaces; no Franconia greets him with her
                  vivacity, her pleasing conversation, her frankness and fondness for the old
                  servants. No table is decked out with the viands of the season—Marston's viands
                  have turned into troubles,—loneliness reigns throughout. It is night, and nothing
                  but the dull sound of the keeper's tread breaks the silence. His (Maxwell's)
                  mission is a delicate one. It may be construed as intrusive, he thinks. But its
                  importance outweighs the doubt, and, though he approaches with caution, is
                  received with that embrace of friendship which a gentleman can claim as his own
                  when he feels the justice of the mission of him who approaches, even though its
                  tenor be painful. Maxwell hesitated for a few moments, looked silently upon the
                  scene. Trouble had already left its prints of sadness upon Marston's countenance;
                  the past, full of happy associations, floated in his mind; the future—ah! that
                  was—. Happily, at that moment, he had been contemplating the means by which he
                  could save Clotilda and the children. He rises, approaches Maxwell, hands him a
                  chair, listens to his proposal. "If I can assist you, we will save them,"
                  concludes Maxwell.
               "That," he replies, doubtingly, "my good friend, has engaged my thoughts by night
                  and day—has made me most uneasy. Misfortune likes sympathy; your words are as
                  soothing as praiseworthy. I will defend my children if every creditor call me
                  swindler. I will destroy the infernal bill of sale,—I will crush the hell-born
                  paper that gives life to deeds so bloody,—I will free them from the shame!" Thus,
                  his feelings excited to the uttermost, he rises from his seat, approaches a
                  cupboard, draws forth the small trunk we have before described, unlocks it. "That
                  fatal document is here, I put it here, I will destroy it now; I will save them
                     through its destruction. There shall
                  be no evidence of Clotilda's mother being a slave, oh no!" he mutters rapidly,
                  running his fingers over packages, papers, and documents. Again he glances
                  vacantly over the whole file, examining paper after paper, carefully. He looks in
                  vain. It is not there; there is no document so fatal. Sharper men have taken
                  better care of it. "It is not here!" he whispers, his countenance becoming pallid
                  and death-like. "Not here!"—and they will swear to suit their purposes. Oaths are
                  only worth what they bring in the market, among slave dealers. But, who can have
                  taken it?" he continues, looking wildly at Maxwell. Consternation is pictured on
                  his countenance; he feels there is intrigue at work, and that the want of that
                  paper will prove fatal to his resolution. A man in trouble always confides in
                  others, sometimes those whom he would scarce have trusted before. He throws the
                  paper aside, takes a seat at Maxwell's side, grasps him by the hand, saying, "My
                  friend! save them! save them! save them! Use what stratagem you please; make it
                  the experiment of your life. Consummate it, and a penitent's prayer will bless
                  you! I see the impending catastrophe—"
               "We may do without it; be quiet. Let your feelings calm. I have consulted
                  Franconia on the same subject. Woman can do much if she will; and she has promised
                  me she will. My knowledge of her womanly nature tells me she will be true to
                  Clotilda!" Maxwell speaks assuringly, and his words seem as balm to a wounded
                  spirit.
               The bill of sale was among the things intended for a more profitable use. Marston
                  has satisfied Graspum's claim; but he knew that slavery deadened the sensibilities
                  of men. Yet, could it have so deadened Graspum's feeling that he would have been
                  found in a plot against him? No! he could not believe it. He would not look for
                  foul play from that quarter. It might have been mislaid—if lost, all the better. A
                  second thought, and he begins to quiet himself with the belief that it had become
                  extinct; that, there not being evidence to prove them property, his word would be
                  sufficient to procure their release. Somewhat relieved of the force of parental
                  anxiety—we can call it by no other name—the troubled planter, with his troubles
                  inherited, promises Maxwell, who has postponed his departure that he may aid in
                  saving Clotilda and her child, that he will proceed direct to the sheriff's
                  office, give notice of their freedom to that functionary, and forbid the sale.
                  Upon this resolution they part for the night, and on the following morning,
                  Marston, sick at heart, leaves for the city, hoping to make arrangements with his
                  attorney, who will serve notice of freedom with all the expense and legality of
                  form.
               The reader will excuse us for passing over many things of minor importance which
                  take place during the progress of arrangements between Marston and the attorney,
                  Mr. Dyson—commonly called Thomas Dyson, Esq., wonderfully clever in the practice
                  of slave law—and proceeding to where we find the notice formally served. The
                  document forbids the sale of certain persons, physically and mentally described,
                  according to the nicest rules of law and tenour of trade; and is, with the dignity
                  of legal proceedings, served on the honourable sheriff. We give a portion of it,
                  for those who are not informed on such curious matters: it runs thus:—"'The girl
                  Clotilda—aged 27 years; her child Annette—aged 7 years, and a remarkable boy,
                  Nicholas, 6 years old, all negroes, levied upon at the suit of ——, to satisfy a
                     fi fa issued from the ——, and set forth to be
                  the property of Hugh Marston of ——, &c. &c.;'" as set forth in the writ of
                  attachment. Thus runs the curious law, based on privilege, not principle.
               The document served on the sheriff, Marston resolved to remain a few days in the
                  city and watch its effect. The sheriff, who is seldom supposed to evince sympathy
                  in his duties, conforms with the ordinary routine of law in nigger cases; and, in
                  his turn, gives notice to the plaintiff, who is required to enter security for the
                  purpose of testing the point of freedom. Freedom here is a slender commodity; it
                  can be sworn away for a small compensation. Mr. Anthony Romescos has peculiar
                  talent that way, and his services are always in the market. The point, however,
                  has not resolved itself into that peculiar position where it must be either a
                  matter of compromise, or a question for the court and jury to decide.
               If Marston, now sensible of his position as father of the children, will yield
                  them a sacrifice to the man trader, it is in his power; the creditors will make it
                  their profit. Who, then, can solve the perplexity for him? The custom of society,
                  pointing the finger of shame, denies him the right to acknowledge them his
                  children. Society has established the
                  licentious wrong,—the law protects it, custom enforces it. He can only proceed by
                  declaring the mother to be a free woman, and leaving the producing proof to
                  convict her of being slave property to the plaintiff. In doing this, his judgment
                  wars with his softer feelings. Custom—though it has nothing to give him—is goading
                  him with its advice; it tells him to abandon the unfashionable, unpolite scheme.
                  Natural laws have given birth to natural feelings—natural affections are stronger
                  than bad laws. They burn with our nature,—they warm the gentle, inspire the noble,
                  and awake the daring that lies unmoved until it be called into action for the
                  rescue of those for whom our affections have taken life.
               Things had arrived at that particular point where law-lovers—we mean lawyers—look
                  on with happy consciences and pleasing expectations; that is, they had arrived at
                  that certain hinge of slave law the turn of which sends men, women, and children,
                  into the vortex of slavery, where their hopes are for ever crushed. One day
                  Marston had strong hopes of saving them; but his hopes vanished on the next. The
                  fair creature, by him made a wretch, seemed before him, on her bended knees,
                  clasping his hand while imploring him to save her child. The very thought would
                  have doubly nerved him to action; and yet, what mattered such action against the
                  force of slavery injustice? All his exertions, all his pleadings, all his
                  protestations, in a land where liberty boasts its greatness, would sink to nothing
                  under the power he had placed in their possession for his overthrow.
               With this fatal scene before him, this indecision, he walked the streets,
                  resolving and re-resolving, weighing and re-weighing the consequences, hoping
                  without a chance for hope. He would be a father as he has been a kind master; but
                  the law says, no! no! Society forbids right, the law crushes justice,—the justice
                  of heaven! Marston is like one driven from his home, from the scene of his happy
                  childhood, upon which he can now only look back to make the present more painful.
                  He has fallen from the full flow of pleasure and wealth to the low ebb of poverty
                  clothed in suspicion; he is homeless, and fast becoming friendless. A few days
                  after, as he takes his morning walk, he is pointed to the painful fact, made known
                  through certain legal documents, posted at certain corners of streets, that his
                  "negro property" is advertised for sale by the sheriff. He fears his legal notice
                  has done little legal good, except to the legal gentlemen who receive the costs.
                  He retires to a saloon, finds the morning paper, commences glancing over its legal
                  columns. The waiter is surprised to see him at that hour, is ignorant of the war
                  of trouble that is waging within him, knows him only as a great man, a rice
                  planter of wealth in negroes, treats him with becoming civility, and enquires,
                  with a polite bow, what he will be served with. He wants nothing that will supply
                  the physical man. He has supped on trouble,—the following, painful as it is, will
                  serve him for breakfast; it meets his eye as he traces down the column:— 
                     
                        
                           
                              "SHERIFF'S SALE.

               The description of the negro property continues until it reaches the last and most
                  touching point, which Marston reads with tears coursing down his cheeks. But, it
                  is only trade, and it is refreshing to see how much talent the auctionee—himself a
                  distinguished politician,—exhibits in displaying his bill. It is that which has
                  worked itself so deep into Marston's feelings.

                     handsomest bright woman in the county."
               
               We acknowledge the italics to be ours. The list, displaying great competency in
                  the trade of human beings, concludes with warranting them sound and healthy,
                  informing all those in want of such property of the wonderful opportunity of
                  purchasing, and offering to guarantee its qualities. The above being "levied on to
                  satisfy three fi fas," &c. &c.
               Poor Clotilda! her beauty has betrayed her: her mother was made a slave, and she
                  has inherited the sin which the enlightened of the western world say shall be
                  handed down from generation to generation until time itself has an end. She is
                  within the damp walls of a narrow cell; the cold stones give forth their moisture
                  to chill her bleeding heart; the rust of oppression cuts into her very soul. The
                  warm sunlight of heaven, once so cheering, has now turned black and cold to her.
                  She sits in that cold confine, filled with sorrow, hope, and expectation, awaiting
                  her doom, like a culprit who measures the chances of escape between him and the
                  gallows. She thinks of Marston. "He was a kind friend to me—he was a good master,"
                  she says, little thinking that at that very moment he sits in the saloon reading
                  that southern death-warrant which dooms so many to a life of woe. In it fathers
                  were not mentioned—Marston's feelings were spared that pain; mothers' tears, too,
                  were omitted, lest the sensitiveness of the fashionable world should be touched.
                  Pained, and sick at heart—stung by remorse at finding himself without power to
                  relieve Clotilda—he rises from his seat, and makes arrangement to return to his
                  plantation.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XV.
               A SCENE OF MANY LIGHTS.
               WE must leave Marston wending his way for the old plantation, and pass to another
                  phase of this complicated affair. In doing this, we must leave the reader to draw
                  from his own imagination much that must have transpired previous to the present
                  incidents.
               The Rovero family—old and distinguished—had struggled against the misfortunes
                  brought upon them by their son Lorenzo. Deeply involved, they had allowed their
                  difficulties to go on till they had found themselves living by the favour of
                  courtesy and indulgence. Lorenzo and Franconia were only children; and since the
                  departure of the former the latter had been the idol of their indulgence. She was,
                  as we have before said, delicate, sensitive, endowed with generous impulses, and
                  admired for her gentleness, grace, and vivacity. To these she added firmness, and,
                  when once resolved upon any object, could not be moved from her purpose. Nor was
                  she—as is the popular fallacy of the South—susceptible to the influence of wealth.
                  Her love and tenderness soared above it; she prized wealth less than moral worth.
                  But she could not appease the pride of her parents with her feelings. They,
                  labouring under the influence of their reduced fortunes, had favoured and insisted
                  upon the advances of the very wealthy Colonel M'Carstrow, a rice-planter, who had
                  a few years before inherited a large estate. The colonel is a sturdy specimen of
                  the Southern gentleman, which combines a singular mixture of qualities, some of
                  which are represented by a love of good living, good drinking, good horse-racing,
                  good gambling, and fast company. He lives on the fat of the land, because the fat
                  of the land was made for him to enjoy. He has no particular objection to anybody
                  in the world, providing they believe in slavery, and live according to his notions
                  of a gentleman. His soul's delight is faro,
                  which he would not exchange for all the religion in the world; he has strong
                  doubts about the good of religion, which, he says, should be boxed up with modern
                  morality.
               Laying these things aside, however, he is anything but what would have been
                  properly selected as a partner for Franconia; and, while she is only eighteen, he
                  has turned the corner of his forty-third year. In a word, his manners are
                  unmodelled, his feelings coarse, his associations of the worst kind; nor is he
                  adapted to make the happiness of domestic life lasting. He is one of those persons
                  so often met with, whose affections—if they may be supposed to have any—are held
                  in a sort of compromise between an incitement to love, and their natural
                  inclination to revel in voluptuous pleasures. The two being antagonistic at times,
                  the latter is sure to be the stronger, and not unfrequently carries its victim
                  into dissolute extremes. Riches, however, will always weigh heavy in the scale;
                  their possession sways,—the charm of gold is precious and powerful. And, too, the
                  colonel had another attraction—very much esteemed among slave-dealers and
                  owners—he had a military title, though no one knew how he came by it.
               Franconia must be the affianced bride of the supposed wealthy Colonel M'Carstrow;
                  so say her parents, who feel they are being crushed out by misfortune. It is their
                  desire; and, however repulsive it may be to Franconia's feelings, she must accept
                  the man: she must forget his years, his habits, his associations, for the wealth
                  he can bring to the relief of the family.
               To add éclat to the event, it is arranged that
                  the nuptial ceremony shall take place in the spacious old mansion of General P——,
                  in the city. General P—— is a distant relation of the Rovero family. His mansion
                  is one of those noble old edifices, met here and there in the South—especially in
                  South Carolina—which strongly mark the grandeur of their ancient occupants. It is
                  a massive pile of marble, of mixed style of Grecian and Doric architecture, with
                  three stories divided by projecting trellised arbours, and ornamented with fluted
                  columns surmounted with ingeniously-worked and sculptured capitals, set off with
                  grotesque figures. The front is ornamented with tablets of bas-relief, variegated
                  and chaste. These are bordered with scroll-work, chases of flowers, graces, and historical designs. Around the lower
                  story, palisades and curvatures project here and there between the divisions,
                  forming bowers shaded by vines and sweet-scented blossoms. These are diffusing
                  their fragrance through the spacious halls and corridors beneath. The stately old
                  pile wears a romantic appearance; but it has grown brown with decay, and stands in
                  dumb testimony of that taste and feeling which prevailed among its British
                  founders. The garden in which it stands, once rich with the choicest flowers of
                  every clime, now presents an area overgrown with rank weeds, decaying hedges,
                  dilapidated walks, and sickly shrubbery. The hand that once nurtured this pretty
                  scene of buds and blossoms with so much care has passed away. Dull inertness now
                  hangs its lifeless festoons over the whole, from the vaulted hall to the iron
                  railing enclosing the whole.
               The day for consummating the nuptial ceremony has arrived; many years have passed
                  since the old mansion witnessed such a scene. The gay, wealthy, and intelligent of
                  the little fashionable world will be here. The spell of loneliness in which the
                  old walls have so long slept will be broken. Sparkling jewels, bland smiles, the
                  rich decorations of former years, are to again enhance the scene. Exhausted nature
                  is to shake off its monotony, to be enlivened with the happiness of a seemingly
                  happy assemblage. A lovely bride is to be showered with smiles, congratulations,
                  tokens of love. Southern gallantry will doff its cares, put on its smiling face.
                  Whatever may smoulder beneath, pleasure and gaiety will adorn the surface.
               Franconia sits in her spacious chamber. She is arrayed in flowing négligé; a pensive smile invades her countenance; she
                  supports her head on her left hand, the jewels on her tiny fingers sparkling
                  though her hair. Everything round her bears evidence of comfort and luxury; the
                  gentle breeze, as it sweeps through the window to fan her blushing cheek,is
                  impregnated with sweetest odours. She contemplates the meeting of him who is to be
                  the partner of her life; can she reconcile it? Nay, there is something forcing
                  itself against her will. Her bridesmaids,—young, gay, and accomplished,—gather
                  around her. The fierce conflict raging in her bosom discloses itself; the attempt
                  to cheer her up, under the impression that it arises from want of vigour to buoy
                  up her sensitive system, fails. Again she seems labouring under excitement.
               "Franconia!" exclaims one, taking her by the hand, "is not the time
                  approaching?"
               "Time always approaches," she speaks: her mind has been wandering, picturing the
                  gloomy spectacle that presents itself in Clotilda's cell. She moves her right hand
                  slowly across her brow, casts an enquiring glance around the room, then at those
                  beside her, and changes her position in the chair. "The time to have your toilet
                  prepared—the servants await you," is the reply. Franconia gathers strength, sits
                  erect in her chair, seems to have just resolved upon something. A servant hastens
                  into her presence bearing a delicately-enveloped note. She breaks the seal, reads
                  it and re-reads it, holds it carelessly in her hand for a minute, then puts it in
                  her bosom. There is something important in the contents, something she must keep
                  secret. It is from Maxwell. Her friend evinced some surprise, while waiting a
                  reply as she read the letter.
               "No! not yet," she says, rising from her chair and sallying across the room. "That
                  which is forced upon me—ah! I cannot love him. To me there is no loving wealth.
                  Money may shelter; but it never moves hearts to love truly. How I have struggled
                  against it!" Again she resumes her chair, weeps. Her tears gush from the parent
                  fountain—woman's heart. "My noble uncle in trouble, my dear brother gone; yes! to
                  where, and for what, I dare not think; and yet it has preyed upon me through the
                  struggle of pride against love. My father may soon follow; but I am to be
                  consigned to the arms of one whom it would be folly to say I respect."
               Her friend, Miss Alice Latel, reminds her that it were well not to let such
                  melancholy wanderings trouble her. She suggests that the colonel, being rich, will
                  fill the place of father as well as husband; that she will be surrounded by the
                  pleasures which wealth only can bring, and in this world what more can be
                  desired?
               "Such fathers seldom make affectionate husbands; nor do I want the father without
                  the husband; his wealth would not make me respect him." Franconia becomes excited,
                  giving rapid utterance to her language. "Can I suppress my melancholy—can I enjoy such pleasure, and my
                  dear Clotilda in a prison, looking through those galling gratings? Can I be happy
                  when the anguish of despair pierces deep into her heart? No! oh, no! Never, while
                  I think of her, can I summon resolution to put on a bridal robe. Nay! I will not
                  put them on without her. I will not dissemble joy while she sinks in her prison
                  solitude!"
               "Can you mean that—at this hour?" enquires Miss Alice, looking upon her with
                  anxiety pictured in her face. One gives the other a look of surprise. Miss Alice
                  must needs call older counsel.
               "Yes!" replies Franconia, more calm; "even at this hour! It is never too late to
                  serve our sisters. Could I smile—could I seem happy, and so many things to
                  contemplate? We cannot disguise them now; we cannot smother scandal with a silken
                  mantle. Clotilda must be with me. Negro as she is by law, she is no less dear to
                  me. Nor can I yield to those feelings so prominent in southern breasts,—I cannot
                  disclaim her rights, leave her the mere chattel subject of brute force, and then
                  ask forgiveness of heaven!" This declaration, made in a positive tone, at once
                  disclosed her resolution. We need not tell the reader with what surprise it took
                  the household; nor, when she as suddenly went into a violent paroxysm of
                  hysterics, the alarm it spread.
               The quiet of the mansion has changed for uproar and confusion. Servants are
                  running here and there, getting in each other's way, blocking the passages, and
                  making the confusion more intense. Colonel M'Carstrow is sent for, reaches the
                  mansion in great consternation, expects to find Franconia a corpse, for the negro
                  messenger told him such a crooked story, and seemed so frightened, that he can't
                  make anything straight of it—except that there is something very alarming.
               She has been carried to one of the ante-chambers, reclines on a couch of softest
                  tapestry, a physician at one side, and Alice, bathing her temples with aromatic
                  liquid, on the other. She presents a ravishing picture of delicacy, modesty, and
                  simplicity,—of all that is calmly beautiful in woman. "I can scarcely account for
                  it; but, she's coming to," says the man of medicine, looking on mechanically. Her
                  white bosom swells gently, like a newly-waked zephyr playing among virgin leaves;
                  while her eyes, like melancholy stars, glimmer with the lustre of her soul. "Ah
                  me!" she sighs, raising her hand over her head and resting it upon the cushion, as
                  her auburn hair floats, calm and beautiful, down her pearly shoulder.
               The colonel touches her hand; and, as if it had been too rudely, she draws it to
                  her side, then places it upon her bosom. Again raising her eyes till they meet
                  his, she blushes. It is the blush of innocence, that brightens beneath the spirit
                  of calm resolution. She extends her hand again, slowly, and accepts his. "You will
                  gratify me—will you not?" she mutters, attempting to gain a recumbent position.
                  They raise her as she intimates a desire; she seems herself again.
               "Whatever your wish may be, you have but to intimate it," replies the colonel,
                  kissing her hand.
               "Then, I want Clotilda. Go, bring her to me; she only can wait on me; and I am
                  fond of her. With her I shall be well soon; she will dress me. Uncle will be
                  happy, and we shall all be happy."
               "But," the colonel interrupts, suddenly, "where is she to be found?"
               "In the prison. You'll find her there!" There is little time to lose,—a carriage
                  is ordered, the colonel drives to the prison, and there finds the object of
                  Franconia's trouble. She, the two children at her side, sits in a cell seven by
                  five feet; the strong grasp of slave power fears itself, its tyranny glares forth
                  in the emaciated appearance of its female victim. The cell is lighted through a
                  small aperture in the door, which hangs with heavy bolts and bars, as if torturing
                  the innocent served the power of injustice. The prison-keeper led the way through
                  a narrow passage between stone walls. His tap on the door startles her; she moves
                  from her position, where she had been seated on a coarse blanket. It is all they
                  (the hospitable southern world, with its generous laws) can afford her; she makes
                  it a bed for three. A people less boastful of hospitality may give her more. She
                  holds a prayer-book in her hand, and motions to the children as they crouch at her
                  feet.
               "Come, girl! somebody's here to see you," says the keeper, looking in at the
                  aperture, as the sickly stench escapes from the dark cavern-like place.
               Nervously, the poor victim approaches, lays her trembling hand on the grating, gives a doubting glance at the
                  stranger, seems surprised, anxious to know the purport of his mission.
               "Am I wanted?" she enquires eagerly, as if fearing some rude dealer has
                  come—perhaps to examine her person, that he may be the better able to judge of her
                  market value.
               Notwithstanding the coldness of M'Carstrow's nature, his feelings are moved by the
                  womanly appearance of the wench, as he calls her, when addressing the warden.
                  There is something in the means by which so fair a creature is reduced to
                  merchandise he cannot altogether reconcile. Were it not for what habit and
                  education can do, it would be repulsive to nature in its crudest state. But it is
                  according to law, that inhuman law which is tolerated in a free country.
               "I want you to go with me, and you will see your young missis," says M'Carstrow,
                  shrugging his shoulders. He is half inclined to let his better feelings give way
                  to sympathy. But custom and commerce forbid it; they carry off the spoil, just as
                  the sagacious pumpkin philosopher of England admits slavery a great evil, while
                  delivering an essay for the purpose of ridiculing emancipation.
               M'Carstrow soon changes his feelings,—addresses himself to business. "Are you in
                  here for sale?" he enquires, attempting to whistle an air, and preserve an
                  unaffected appearance.
               The question touches a tender chord of her feelings; her bosom swells with
                  emotions of grief; he has wounded that sensitive chord upon which the knowledge of
                  her degradation hangs. She draws a handkerchief from her pocket, wipes the tear
                  that glistens in her eye, clasps Annette in her arms—while Nicholas, frightened,
                  hangs by the skirts of her dress,—buries her face in her bosom, retires a few
                  steps, and again seats herself on the blanket.
               "The question is pending. If I'm right about it—and I believe I'm generally so on
                  such cases—it comes on before the next session, fall term," says the gaoler,
                  turning to M'Carstrow with a look of wonderful importance. The gaoler, who, with
                  his keys, lets loose the anxieties of men, continues his learned remarks. "Notice
                  has been served how she's free. But that kind o' twisting things to make slave
                  property free never amounts to much, especially when a man gets where they say
                  Marston is! Anthony Romescos has been quizzing about, and it don't take much to
                  make such things property when he's round." The man of keys again looks very wise,
                  runs his hand deep into the pocket of his coat, and says something about this
                  being a great country.
               "How much do you reckon her worth, my friend?" enquires M'Carstrow, exchanging a
                  significant glance.
               "Well, now you've got me. It's a point of judgment, you see. The article's rather
                  questionable—been spoiled. There's a doubt about such property when you put it up,
                  except a gentleman wants it; and then, I reckon, it'll bring a smart price.
                  There's this to be considered, I reckon, though they haven't set a price on her
                  yet, she's excellent good looking; and the young un's a perfect cherry. It'll
                  bring a big heap one of these days."
               "We won't mind that, just now, gaoler," M'Carstrow says, very complacently;
                  "you'll let me have her tonight, and I'll return her safe in the morning."
               "No, no," interposes Clotilda, mistaking M'Carstrow's object. She crouches down on
                  the blanket, as if shrinking from a deadly assault: "let me remain, even in my
                  cell." She draws the children to her side.
               "Don't mistake me, my girl: I am a friend. I want you for Franconia Rovero. She is
                  fond of you, you know."
               "Franconia!" she exclaims with joy, starting to her feet at the sound of the name.
                  "I do know her, dear Franconia! I know her, I love her, she loves me—I wish she
                  was my mother. But she is to be the angel of my freedom—" Here she suddenly
                  stopped, as if she had betrayed something.
               "We must lose no time," M'Carstrow says, informing her that Franconia is that
                  night to be his bride, and cannot be happy without seeing her.
               "Bride! and cannot prepare without me," mutters the woman, seeming to doubt the
                  reality of his statement. A thought flashes in her mind: "Franconia has not
                  forgotten me; I will go and be Franconia's friend." And with a child-like
                  simplicity she takes Annette by the hand, as if they were inseparable. "Can't
                  Nicholas go, too?" she inquires.
               
               "You must leave the child," is the cool reply. M'Carstrow attempts to draw the
                  heavy bolt that fastens the door.
               "Not so fast, if you please," the warden speaks. "I cannot permit her to leave
                  without an order from the sheriff." He puts his hand against the door.
               "She will surely be returned in the morning; I'm good for a hundred such pieces of
                  property."
               "Can't help that," interrupts the gaoler, coolly.
               "But, there's my honour!"
               "An article gaolers better not deal in. It may be very good commodity in some
                  kinds of business—don't pay in ours; and then, when this kind of property is in
                  question, it won't do to show a favour beyond the rule."
               M'Carstrow is in a sad dilemma. He must relieve himself through a problem of law,
                  which, at this late hour, brings matters to a singular point. He believes
                  Franconia suffers from a nervous affection, as the doctors call it, and has fixed
                  her mind upon the only object of relief. He had made no preparation for such a
                  critical event; but there is no postponing the ceremony,—no depriving her of the
                  indulgence. Not a moment is to be lost: he sets off, post-haste, for the sheriff's
                  office. That functionary is well known for his crude method of executing business;
                  to ask a favour of him would be like asking the sea to give up its dead. He is
                  cold, methodical, unmoveable; very much opposed to anything having the appearance
                  of an innovation upon his square rules of business.
               M'Carstrow finds him in just the mood to interpose all the frigid peculiarities of
                  his incomprehensible nature. The colonel has known him by reputation; he knows him
                  now through a different medium. After listening to M'Carstrow's request, and
                  comporting himself with all imaginable dignity, he runs his fingers through his
                  hair, looks at M'Carstrow vacantly, and well nigh rouses his temper. M'Carstrow
                  feels, as southern gentlemen are wont to feel, that his position and title are
                  enough to ensure courtesy and a quick response. The man of writs and summonses
                  feels quite sure that the pomp of his office is sufficient to offset all other
                  distinctions.
               "Whar' d'ye say the gal was,—in my gaol?" the sheriff inquires, with solemn
                  earnestness, and drawling his words measuredly, as if the whole affair was quite
                  within his line of business. The sheriff has the opportunity of making a nice
                  little thing of it; the object to be released will serve the profits
                  of the profession. "Gittin' that gal out yander ain't an easy thing now, 'taint!
                  It'll cost ye 'bout twenty dollars, sartin," he adds, turning over the leaves of
                  his big book, and running his finger down a scale of names.
               "I don't care if it costs a hundred! Give me an order for her release!" M'Carstrow
                  begins to understand Mr. Sheriff's composition, and putting his hand into his
                  pocket, draws forth a 
                     dwenty
                     twenty
                  -dollar gold piece, throws it upon the table. The effect is electric: it
                  smooths down the surface of Mr. Sheriff's nature,—brings out the disposition to
                  accommodate. The Sheriff's politeness now taxes M'Carstrow's power to
                  reciprocate.
               "Now, ye see, my friend," says Mr. Sheriff, in a quaint tone, "there's three
                     fi fas on that critter. Hold a minute!" He
                  must needs take a better glance; he runs his fingers over the page again, mutters
                  to himself, and then breaks out into a half-musical, half-undefinable humming.
                  "It's a snarled-up affair, the whole on't. T'll take a plaguy cunnin' lawyer to
                  take the shine out." The sheriff pushes the piece of coin nearer the inkstand,
                  into the centre of the table. "I feel all over like accommodatin' ye," he deigns
                  to say; "but then t'll be so pestky crooked gettin' the thing straight." He
                  hesitates before the wonderful difficulty,—he can't see his way straight through
                  it. "Three fi fas! I believe I'm correct;
                  there's one principal one, however."
               "I pledge my honour for her return in the morning; and she shall be all shined up
                  with a new dress. Her presence is imperatively necessary to-night," M'Carstrow
                  remarks, becoming impatient.
               "Two fi fas!—well, the first look looked like
                  three. But, the principal one out of the way,—no matter." Mr. Sheriff becomes more
                  and more enlightened on the unenlightened difficulties of the law. He remarks,
                  touching M'Carstrow on the arm, with great seriousness of countenance, "I sees how
                  the knot's tied. Ye know, my functions are turned t' most everything; and it makes
                  a body see through a thing just as straight as ——. Pest on't! Ye see, it's mighty
                  likely property,—don't strike such every day. That gal 'll bring a big tick in the
                  market—"
               
               "Excuse me, my dear sir," M'Carstrow suddenly interrupts. "Understand me, if you
                  please. I want her for nothing that you contemplate,—nothing, I pledge you my
                  honour as a southern gentleman!"
               "'Ah,—bless me! Well, but there's nothin' in that. I see! I see! I see!" Mr.
                  Sheriff brightens up, his very soul seems to expand with legal tenacity. "Well, ye
                  see, there's a question of property raised about the gal, and her young 'un,
                  too—nice young 'un 'tis; but it's mighty easy tellin' whose it is. About the law
                  matter, though, you must get the consent of all the plaintiff's attorneys,—that's
                  no small job. Lawyers are devilish slippery, rough a feller amazingly, once in a
                  while; chance if ye don't have to get the critter valued by a survey. Graspum,
                  though's ollers on hand, is first best good at that: can say her top price while
                  ye'd say seven," says Mr. Sheriff, maintaining his wise dignity, as he reminds
                  M'Carstrow that his name is Cur, commonly called Mr. Cur, sheriff of the county.
                  It must not be inferred that Mr. Cur has any of the canine qualities about him.
                  The hour for the ceremony is close at hand. M'Carstrow, satisfied that rules of
                  law are very arbitrary things in the hands of officials—that such property is
                  difficult to get out of the meshes of legal technicality—that honour is neither
                  marketable or pledgeable in such cases, must move quickly: he seeks the very
                  conscientious attorneys, gets them together, pleads the necessity of the case: a
                  convention is arranged, Graspum will value the property—as a weigher and gauger of
                  human flesh. This done, M'Carstrow signs a bond in the sum of fifteen hundred
                  dollars, making himself responsible for the property. The instrument contains a
                  provision, that should any unforeseen disaster befall it, the question of property
                  will remain subject to the decision of Court. Upon these conditions, M'Carstrow
                  procures an order for her release. He is careful, however, that nothing herein set
                  forth shall affect the suit already instituted.
               Love is an exhilarating medicine, moving and quickening the hearts of old and
                  young. M'Carstrow felt its influence sensibly, as he hurried back to the
                  prison—excited by the near approach of the ceremony—with the all-important order.
                  Bolts, bars, and malarious walls, yield to it the pining captive whose presence
                  will soothe Franconia's feelings.
               Clotilda was no less elated at the hope of changing her prison for the presence of
                  her young mistress; and yet, the previous summons had nearly unnerved her. She
                  lingers at the grating, waiting M'Carstrow's return. Time seems to linger, until
                  her feelings are nearly overwhelmed in suspense. Again, there is a mystery in the
                  mission of the stranger; she almost doubts his sincerity. It may be one of those
                  plots, so often laid by slave-traders, to separate her from her child,—perhaps to
                  run her where all hope of regaining freedom will be for ever lost. One after
                  another did these things recur to her mind, only to make the burden of her
                  troubles more painful.
               Her child has eaten its crust, fallen into a deep sleep, and, its little hands
                  resting clasped on its bosom, lies calmly upon the coarse blanket. She gazes upon
                  it, as a mother only can gaze. There is beauty in that sweet face; it is not
                  valued for its loveliness, its tenderness, its purity. How cursed that it is to be
                  the prime object of her disgrace! Thus contemplating, M'Carstrow appears at the
                  outer gate, is admitted into the prison, reaches the inner grating, is received by
                  the warden, who smiles generously. "I'm as glad as anything! Hope you had a good
                  time with his honour, Mr. Cur?" he says, holding the big key in his hand, and
                  leading the way into the office. He takes his seat at a table, commences preparing
                  the big book. "Here is the entry," he says, with a smile of satisfaction. "We'll
                  soon straighten the thing now." Puts out his hand for the order which M'Carstrow
                  has been holding. "That's just the little thing," he says, reading it word by word
                  carefully, and concluding with the remark that he has had a deal of trouble with
                  it. M'Carstrow places some pieces of silver in his hand; they turn the man of keys
                  into a subservient creature. He hastens to the cell, M'Carstrow following,—draws
                  the heavy bolts,—bids the prisoner come forth. "Yes, come, girl; I've had a tough
                  time to get you out of that place: it holds its prey like lawyers' seals," rejoins
                  M'Carstrow.
               "Not without my child?" she inquires quickly. She stoops down and kisses it. "My
                  daughter,—my sweet child!" she mutters.
               "Till to-morrow. You must leave her for to-night."
               "If I must!" Again she kisses the child, adding, as she smoothed her hand over
                  Annette, and parted her hair, "Mother
                  will return soon." There was something so touching in the word mother, spoken
                  while leaning over a sleeping babe. Clotilda reaches the door, having kept her
                  eyes upon the child as she left her behind. A tremor comes over her,—she
                  reluctantly passes the threshold of the narrow arch; but she breathes the fresh
                  air of heaven,—feels as if her life had been renewed. A mother's thoughts, a
                  mother's anxieties, a mother's love, veil her countenance. She turns to take a
                  last look as the cold door closes upon the dearest object of her life. How it
                  grates upon its hinges! her hopes seem for ever extinguished.
               The law is thus far satisfied—the legal gentlemen are satisfied, the warden is not
                  the least generous; and Mr. Cur feels that, while the job was a very nice one, he
                  has not transcended one jot of his importance. Such is highly gratifying to all
                  parties. Clotilda is hurried into a carriage, driven at a rapid rate, and soon
                  arrives at the mansion. Here she is ushered into a chamber, arrayed in a new
                  dress, and conducted into the presence of Franconia. The meeting may be more
                  easily imagined than described. Their congratulations were warm, affectionate,
                  touching. Clotilda kisses Franconia's hand again and again; Franconia, in turn,
                  lays her hand upon Clotilda's shoulder, and, with a look of commiseration, sets
                  her eyes intently upon her, as if she detects in her countenance those features
                  she cannot disown. She requests to be left alone with Clotilda for a short time.
                  Her friends withdraw. She discloses the difficulties into which the family have
                  suddenly fallen, the plan of escape she has arranged, the hopes she entertains of
                  her regaining her freedom. "Public opinion and the state of our difficulties
                  prompted this course,—I prefer it to any other: follow my directions,—Maxwell has
                  everything prepared, and to-night will carry you off upon the broad blue ocean of
                  liberty. Enjoy that liberty, Clotilda,—be a woman,—follow the path God has strewn
                  for your happiness; above all, let freedom be rewarded with your virtue, your
                  example," says Franconia, as she again places her arm round Clotilda's neck.
               "And leave my child, Franconia?" the other inquires, looking up imploringly in
                  Franconia's face.
               "To me," is the quick response. "I will be her guardian, her mother. Get you
                  beyond the grasp of slavery—get beyond its contaminating breath, and I will be
                  Annette's mother. When you are safely there, when you can breathe the free air of
                  liberty, write me, and she shall meet you. Leave her to me; think of her only in
                  my care, and in my trust she will be happy. Meet Maxwell—he is your friend—at the
                  centre corridor; he will be there as soon as the ceremony commences; he will have
                  a pass from me; he will be your guide!" She overcomes Clotilda's doubts, reasons
                  away her pleadings for her child, gives her a letter and small miniature (they are
                  to be kept until she reaches her destination of freedom), and commences preparing
                  for the ceremony.
               Night arrives, the old mansion brightens and resounds with the bustle of
                  preparation. Servants are moving about in great confusion. Everything is in full
                  dress; "yellow fellows," immersed in trim black coats, nicely-cut pantaloons,
                  white vests and gloves, shirt-collars of extraordinary dimensions, and hair
                  curiously crimped, are standing at their places along the halls, ready for
                  reception. Another class, equally well dressed, are running to and fro through the
                  corridors in the despatch of business. Old mammas have a new shine on their faces,
                  their best "go to church" fixings on their backs. Younger members of the same
                  property species are gaudily attired—some in silk, some in missus's slightly worn
                  cashmere. The colour of their faces grades from the purest ebony to the palest
                  olive. A curious philosophy may be drawn from the mixture: it contrasts strangely
                  with the flash and dazzle of their fantastic dresses, their large circular
                  ear-rings, their curiously-tied bandanas, the large bow points of which lay
                  crossed on the tufts of their crimpy hair. The whole scene has an air of
                  bewitching strangeness. In another part of the mansion we find the small figures
                  of the estate, all agog, toddling and doddling, with faces polished like
                  black-balled shoes; they are as piquant and interesting as their own admiration of
                  the dress master has provided them for the occasion.
               The darkness increases as the night advances. The arbour leading from the great
                  gate to the vaulted hall in the base of the mansion is hung with lanterns of
                  grotesque patterns, emitting light and shade as variegated as the hues of the
                  rainbow. The trees and shrubbery in the arena, hung with fantastic lanterns,
                  enliven the picture—make it grand and imposing. It presents a fairy-like
                  perspective, with spectre lights hung
                  here and there, their mellow glows reflecting softly upon the luxuriant
                  foliage.
               Entering the vaulted hall, its floor of antique tiles; frescoed walls with
                  well-executed mythological designs, jetting lights flickering and dazzling through
                  its arches, we find ourselves amidst splendour unsurpassed in our land. At the
                  termination of the great hall a massive flight of spiral steps, of Egyptian
                  marble, ascends to the fourth story, forming a balcony at each, where ottomans are
                  placed, and from which a fine view of the curvature presents itself, from whence
                  those who have ascended may descry those ascending. On the second story is a
                  corridor, with moulded juttings and fretwork overhead; these are hung with
                  festoons of jasmines and other delicate flowers, extending its whole length, and
                  lighted by globular lamps, the prismatic ornaments of which shed their soft glows
                  on the fixtures beneath. They invest it with the appearance of a bower decorated
                  with buds and blossoms. From this, on the right, a spacious arched door,
                  surmounted by a semi-circle of stained glass containing devices of the Muses and
                  other allegorical figures, leads into an immense parlour, having a centre arch
                  hung with heavy folds of maroon coloured velvet overspread with lace. Look where
                  you will, the picture of former wealth and taste presents itself. Around the walls
                  hang costly paintings, by celebrated Italian masters; some are portraits of the
                  sovereigns of England, from that of Elizabeth to George the Third. Brilliant
                  lights jet forth from massive chandeliers and girandoles, lighting up the long
                  line of chaste furniture beneath. The floor is spread with softest Turkey carpet;
                  groups of figures in marble, skilfully executed, form a curiously arranged
                  fire-place; Britannia's crest surmounting the whole. At each end of the room stand
                  chastely designed pieces of statuary of heroes and heroines of past ages. Lounges,
                  ottomans, reclines, and couches, elaborately carved and upholstered, stand here
                  and there in all their antiqueness and grandeur. Pier-glasses, massive tables
                  inlaid with mosaic and pearl, are arranged along the sides, and overhung with
                  flowing tapestry that falls carelessly from the large Doric windows. Over these
                  windows are massive cornices, richly designed and gilded. Quiet grandeur pervades
                  the whole; even the fairy-like dais that has been raised for the nuptial ceremony
                  rests upon four pieces of statuary, and is covered with crimson velvet set with
                  sparkling crystals. And while this spectacle presents but the vanity of our
                  nature, grand but not lasting, the sweet breath of summer is wafting its balmy
                  odours to refresh and give life to its lifeless luxury.
               The gay cortège begins to assemble; the halls
                  fill with guests; the beauty, grace, and intelligence of this little fashionable
                  world, arrayed in its very best, will be here with its best face. Sparkling
                  diamonds and other precious stones, dazzling, will enhance the gorgeous display.
                  And yet, how much of folly's littleness does it all present! All this costly
                  drapery—all this show of worldly voluptuousness—all this tempest of gaiety, is but
                  the product of pain and sorrow. The cheek that blushes in the gay circle, that
                  fair form born to revel in luxury, would not blush nor shrink to see a naked
                  wretch driven with the lash. Yea! we have said it was the product of pain and
                  sorrow; it is the force of oppression wringing from ignorance and degradation the
                  very dregs of its life. Men say, what of that?—do we not live in a great good land
                  of liberty?
               The young affianced,—dressed in a flowing skirt of white satin, with richly
                  embroidered train; a neat bodice of the same material, with incisions of lace
                  tipped with brilliants; sleeves tapering into neat rufflets of lace clasped upon
                  the wrist with diamond bracelets, a stomacher of chastely worked lace with
                  brilliants in the centre, relieved by two rows of small unpolished pearls,—is
                  ushered into the parlour, followed by groomsmen and bridesmaids as chastely
                  dressed.
               There is a striking contrast between the youth and delicacy of Franconia, blushing
                  modestly and in her calmness suppressing that inert repugnance working in her
                  mind, and the brusqueness of M'Carstrow, who assumes the free and easy dash,
                  hoping thereby to lessen his years in the picture of himself. Clotilda, for the
                  last time, has arranged Franconia's hair, which lies in simple braids across her
                  polished brows, and folds upon the back, where it is secured and set off with a
                  garland of wild flowers. The hand that laid it there, that arranged it so neatly,
                  will never arrange it again. As a last token of affection for her young mistress,
                  Clotilda has plucked a new-blown chiponique, white with crystal dew, and
                  surrounded it with tiny buds and orange blossoms: this, Franconia holds in her left hand, the lace to which
                  it is attached falling like mist to the ground.
               Thus arrayed, they appear at the altar: the good man of modest cloth takes his
                  place, the ceremony commences; and as it proceeds, and the solemn words fall upon
                  her ear, "Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder," she raises
                  her eyes upwards, with a look of melancholy, as tears, like pearls, glisten in her
                  soft expressive eyes. Her heart is moved with deeper emotion than this display of
                  southern galaxy can produce. The combination of circumstances that has brought her
                  to the altar, the decline of fortune, perhaps disgrace, worked upon her mind. It
                  is that which has consigned her to the arms of one she cannot love, whose feelings
                  and associations she never can respect. Was she to be the ransom?—was she to atone
                  for the loss of family fortune, family pride, family inconsistency? kept forcing
                  itself upon her. There was no gladness in it—no happiness. And there was the
                  captive, the victim of foul slavery—so foul that hell yearns for its
                  abettors—whose deliverance she prayed for with her earnest soul. She knew the
                  oppressor's grasp—she had, with womanly pride, come forward to relieve the
                  wronged, and she had become sensible of the ties binding her to Clotilda. Unlike
                  too many of her sex, she did not suppress her natural affections; she could not
                  see only the slave in a disowned sister; she acknowledged the relationship, and
                  hastened to free her, to send her beyond slavery's grasp, into the glad embrace of
                  freedom.
               The ceremony ends; the smiles and congratulations of friends, as they gather round
                  Franconia, shower upon her; she receives them coldly, her heart has no love for
                  them, it throbs with anxiety for that slave whose liberty she has planned, and for
                  whose safety she invokes the all-protecting hand of heaven.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               ANOTHER PHASE OF THE PICTURE.
               WHILE the ceremony we have described in the foregoing chapter was proceeding,
                  Clotilda, yielding to the earnest request of Franconia, dresses herself in
                  garments she has provided, and awaits the commencement of the scene. A little
                  schooner from one of the Bahama Islands lies moored in the harbour awaiting a fair
                  wind to return.
               We need scarcely tell the reader that a plan of escape had been previously
                  arranged between Franconia and Maxwell; but why she took so earnest a part in
                  carrying it out, we must reserve for another chapter.
               Maxwell had sought the captain of this schooner, found him of a generous
                  disposition, ready to act in behalf of freedom. Having soon gained his confidence,
                  and enlisted his good services, it took no great amount of persuasion to do this,
                  his feelings having already been aroused against slavery, the giant arms of which,
                  stretched out between fear and injustice, had interfered with his rights. He had
                  seen it grasp the bones and sinews of those who were born in freedom—he had seen
                  men laugh at his appeals for justice—he had seen one of his free-born British
                  seamen manacled and dragged to prison at noonday, merely because his skin was
                  slightly coloured; he had been compelled to pay tribute to keep alive the
                  oppressor's power, to compensate the villainy rogues practise upon honest men.
               "Yes!" says the captain, a sturdy son of the sea, in answer to Maxwell; "bring her
                  on board; and with a heart's best wishes, if I don't land her free and safe in Old
                  Bahama I'll never cross the gulf stream again." And the mode of
                  getting the boats ready was at once arranged.
               The night was still and dark; picturesque illuminations in and around the mansion
                  glittered in contrast with the starry arch of heaven; the soft south breeze fans
                  to life the dark foliage that clusters around—nature has clothed the scene with
                  her beauties. Clotilda—she has eagerly awaited the coming time—descends to the balustrade in the rear
                  of the mansion. Here she meets a band of musicians; they have assembled to
                  serenade, and wait the benediction, a signal for which will be made from one of
                  the balconies. She fears they may recognise her, hesitates at the entrance, paces
                  backward and forward in the colonnade, and professes to be awaiting some message
                  from her mistress. Again scanning the scene, she watches intently, keeping her
                  eyes fixed in the direction Franconia has suggested. "I was to meet Maxwell
                  there!" works upon her mind until she becomes nervous and agitated. "I was, and
                  must meet him there;" and she walks slowly back to the entrance, turns and
                  returns, watches until her soul has nearly sickened, at length espies the joyous
                  signal. Franconia did not deceive her. Oh, no! he stands there in the glare of a
                  lamp that hangs from a willow-tree. She vaults over the path, grasps his hand with
                  a sister's affection, and simultaneously the soft swelling music of "Still so
                  gently o'er me stealing!" floats in the air, as dulcet and soul-stirring as ever
                  touched the fancy, or clothed with holy inspiration the still repose of a southern
                  landscape at midnight. But she is with Maxwell; they have passed the
                  serenaders,—liberty is the haven of her joy, it gives her new hopes of the future.
                  Those hopes dispel the regrets that hover over her mind as she thinks of her
                  child.
               For several minutes they stand together, listening to the music, and watching the
                  familiar faces of old friends as they come upon the balcony in the second story.
                  Southern life had its pleasant associations—none would attempt to deny them; but
                  the evil brooded in the uncertainty that hung over the fate of millions, now
                  yielding indulgence to make life pleasant, then sinking them for ever in the
                  cruelties of a tyrant's power. It is the crushing out of the mind's force,—the
                  subduing the mental and physical man to make the chattel complete,—the shutting
                  out of all the succinct virtues that nurture freedom, that incite us to improve
                  the endowments of nature, that proves the rankling poison. And this poison spreads
                  its baneful influence in and around good men's better desires.
               After watching in silence for a few moments, Clotilda gives vent to her feelings.
                  "I should like to see old Daddy Bob once more, I should! And my poor Annette; she
                  is celled to be sold, I'm afraid; but I must yield to the kindness ness of
                  Franconia. I have seen some good times among the old folks on the plantation. And
                  there's Aunt Rachel,—a good creature after all,—and Harry. Well; I mustn't think
                  of these things; freedom is sweetest," she says. Maxwell suggests that they move
                  onward. The music dies away in the stillness, as they turn from the scene to flee
                  beyond the grasp of men who traffic in human things called property,—not by a
                  great constitution, but under a constitution's freedom giving power. Would that a
                  great and glorious nation had not sold its freedom to the damning stain of
                  avarice! would that it had not perverted that holy word, for the blessings of
                  which generations have struggled in vain! would that it had not substituted a
                  freedom that mystifies a jurisprudence,—that brings forth the strangest fruit of
                  human passions,—that makes prison walls and dreary cells death-beds of the
                  innocent;—that permits human beings to be born for the market, and judged by the
                  ripest wisdom! "Has God ordained such freedom lasting?" will force itself upon
                  us.—We must return to our humble adventurers.
               The fugitives reached the back gate, leading into a narrow lane, from whence they
                  cross into the main street. Clotilda has none of the African about her; the most
                  observing guardsman would not stop her for a slave. They pass along unmolested;
                  the guardsmen, some mounted and some walking at a slow pace, bow politely. No one
                  demands a pass. They arrive in safety at a point about two miles from the city,
                  where the captain and his boat await them. No time is lost in embarking: the
                  little bark rides at anchor in the stream; the boat quietly glides to her; they
                  are safely on board. A few minutes more, and the little craft moves seaward under
                  the pressure of a gentle breeze. There is no tragic pursuit of slave-hunters, no
                  tramp of horses to terrify the bleeding victim, no howlings of ravenous
                  bloodhounds,—nothing that would seem to make the issue freedom or death. No! all
                  is as still as a midsummer night in the same clime. The woman—this daughter of
                  slavery's vices—cherishes a love for freedom; the hope of gaining it, and
                  improving those endowments nature has bestowed upon her, freshens her spirits and
                  gives her life to look forward without desponding. Maxwell is her friend; he has
                  witnessed the blighting power of slavery—not alone in its workings upon the black
                  man, but upon the lineal offspring of
                  freemen—and has resolved to work against its mighty arm. With him it is the
                  spontaneous action of a generous heart sympathising for the wrongs inflicted upon
                  the weak, and loving to see right respected.
               The fair Franconia, who has just been forced to accept the hand of a mere
                  charlatan, disclosed the secrets of her mind to him; it was she who incited him to
                  an act which might have sacrificed his freedom, perhaps his life. But mankind is
                  possessed of an innate feeling to do good; and there is a charm added when the
                  object to be served is a fair creature about to be dragged into the miseries of
                  slavery. Even the rougher of our kind cannot resist it; and at times—we except the
                  servile opinion which slavery inflicts upon a people through its profitable
                  issues—prompts the ruffian to generous acts.
               The little bark, bound for the haven of freedom, sailed onward over the blue
                  waters, and when daylight dawned had crossed the bar separating the harbour from
                  the ocean. Clotilda ascends to the deck, sits on the companion-seat, and in a
                  pensive mood watches the fading hills where slavery stains the fair name of
                  freedom,—where oppression rears its dark monuments to for ever torture and
                  disgrace a harmless race. She looks intently upon them, as one by one they fade in
                  the obscure horizon, seeming to recall the many associations, pleasant and
                  painful, through which she has passed. She turns from the contemplation to the
                  deep blue sea, and the unclouded arch of heaven, as they spread out before her:
                  they are God's own, man cannot pollute them; they are like a picture of glory
                  inspiring her with emotions she cannot suppress. As the last dim sight of land is
                  lost in the distance, she waves a handkerchief, as if to bid it adieu for ever;
                  then looking at Maxwell, who sits by her side, she says, with a sigh, "I am beyond
                  it! Free,—yes, free! But, have I not left a sufferer behind? There is my poor
                  Annette, my child; I will clasp her to my bosom,—I will love her more when I meet
                  her again. Good-bye, Franconia—dear Franconia! She will be a mother to my little
                  one; she will keep her word." Thus saying, she casts a look upward, invokes heaven
                  to be merciful to her persecutors,—to protect her child,—to guard Franconia
                  through life. Tears stream down her cheeks as she waves her hand and retires to
                  the cabin.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               PLEASANT DEALINGS WITH HUMAN PROPERTY.
               WE must deal gently with our scenes; we must describe them without exaggeration,
                  and in rotation. While the scenes we have just described were proceeding, another,
                  of deeper import, and more expressive of slavery's complicated combinations, was
                  being enacted in another part of the city.
               A raffle of ordinary character had been announced in the morning papers,—we say
                  ordinary, because it came within the ordinary specification of trade, and violated
                  neither statute law nor municipal ordinance,—and the raffler, esteemed a great
                  character in the city, was no less celebrated for his taste in catering for the
                  amusement of his patrons. On this occasion, purporting to be a very great one, the
                  inducements held out were no less an incentive of gambling propensities than an
                  aim to serve licentious purposes. In a word, it offered "all young connoisseurs of
                  beauty a chance to procure one of the finest-developed young wenches,—fair,
                  bright, perfectly brought up, young, chaste, and of most amiable disposition, for
                  a trifling sum." This was all straight in the way of trade, in a free country;
                  nobody should blush at it (some maidens, reading the notice, might feel modestly
                  inclined to), because nobody could gainsay it. This is prize No. 1, prime—as set
                  down in the schedule—and the amount per toss being only a trifle, persons in want
                  of such prizes are respectfully informed of the fact that only a few chances
                  remain, which will command a premium before candle-light. Prize No. 2 is a
                  superior pony, of well-known breed—here the pedigree is set forth; which advantage
                  had not been accorded to the human animal, lest certain members of the same stock
                  should blush—raised with great care and attention, and exactly suited for a
                  gentleman's jant or a lady's saddle-nag. Prize No. 3 is a superior setter dog, who
                  has also been well brought up, is from good stock, is kind to children, who play
                  with him when they please. He knows niggers, is good to watch them, has been known to catch runaways, to tear
                  their shins wonderfully. Indeed, according to the setting forth of the sagacious
                  animal, he would seem to understand slave-law quite well, and to be ready and
                  willing to lend his aid with dogs of a different species to enforce its
                  provisions. The only fault the brute has, if fault it may be called, is that he
                  does not understand the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law,—a law
                  destined to be exceedingly troublesome among a free people. Did the sagacity of
                  the animal thus extend to the sovereign law of the land of the brave and free, he
                  would bring a large price at the north, where men are made to do what dogs most
                  delight in at the south.
               The first prize, as set forth, is valued at seven hundred dollars: the magnanimous
                  gentleman who caters thus generously for his patrons states the delicate prize to
                  be worth fifty or a hundred dollars more, and will, with a little more developing,
                  be worth a great deal more money. Hence, he hopes his patrons will duly appreciate
                  enterprising liberality.
               The second prize he considers generously low at two hundred dollars; and the
                  dog—the sagacious animal constituting the third prize—would be a great bargain to
                  anybody wanting such an animal, especially in consideration of his propensity to
                  catch negroes, at sixty dollars. The trio of human and animal prizes produce no
                  distinctive effect upon the feelings of those who speculate in such property; with
                  them it is only a matter of gradation between dollars and cents.
               But, to be more off-handed in this generous undertaking, and in consideration of
                  the deep-felt sensibility and hospitality which must always protect southern
                  character, the chances will be restricted to two hundred, at five dollars per
                  chance. Money must be paid in before friends can consider themselves
                  stock-holders. It is to be a happy time, in a happy country, where all are boasted
                  happy. The first lucky dog will get the human prize; the next lucky dog will get
                  the pony; the third will make a dog of himself by only winning a dog. The fun of
                  the thing, however, will be the great attraction; men of steady habits are
                  reminded of this. Older gentlemen, having very nice taste for colour, but no
                  particular scruples about religion, and who seldom think morals worth much to
                  niggers, "because they aint got sense to appreciate such things," are expected to
                  be on hand. Those who know bright and fair niggers were never made for anything
                  under the sun but to gratify their own desires, are expected to spread the good
                  news, to set the young aristocracy of the city all agog,—to start up a first-best
                  crowd,—have some tall drinking and first-rate amusement. Everybody is expected to
                  tell his friend, and his friend is expected to help the generous man out with his
                  generous scheme, and all are expected to join in the "bender."
                  Nobody must forget that the whole thing is to come off at "Your House,"—an eating
                  and drinking saloon, of great capacity, kept by the very distinguished man, Mr.
                  O'Brodereque.
               Mr. O'Brodereque, who always pledges his word upon the honour of a southern
                  gentleman—frequently asserting his greatness in the political world, and wondering
                  who could account for his not finding his way into Congress, where talent like his
                  would be brought out for the protection of our south—has made no end of money by
                  selling a monstrous deal of very bad liquor to customers of all grades,—niggers
                  excepted. And, although his hair is well mixed with the grey of many years, he
                  declares the guilt of selling liquor to niggers is not on his shoulders. It is
                  owing to this clean state of his character, that he has been able to maintain his
                  aristocratic position. "Yes, indeed," said one of his patrons, who, having fallen
                  in arrears, found himself undergoing the very disagreeable process of being
                  politely kicked into the street, "money makes a man big in the south: big in
                  niggers, big in politics, big with everything but the way I'm big,—with an empty
                  pocket. I don't care, though; he's going up by the process that I'm coming down.
                  There's philosophy in that." It could not be denied that Mr. O'Brodereque—commonly
                  called General O'Brodereque—was very much looked up to by great people and
                  Bacchanalians,—men who pay court to appease the wondrous discontent of the belly,
                  to the total neglect of the back. Not a few swore, by all their importance, a
                  greater man never lived. He is, indeed, all that can be desired to please the
                  simple pretensions of a free-thinking and free-acting southern people, who, having
                  elevated him to the office of alderman, declare him exactly the man to develope
                  its functions. A few of the old school aristocracy, who still retain the bad left
                  them by their English ancestry, having
                  long since forgotten the good, do sneer now and then at Mr. Brodereque's
                  pretensions. But, like all great men who have a great object to carry out, he
                  affects to frown such things down,—to remind the perpetrators of such aristocratic
                  sneers what a spare few they are. He asserts, and with more truth than poetry,
                  that any gentleman having the capacity to deluge the old aristocracy with doubtful
                  wine, line his pockets while draining theirs—all the time making them feel
                  satisfied he imports the choicest—and who can keep on a cheerful face the while,
                  can fill an alderman's chair to a nicety.
               In addition to the above, Mr. O'Brodereque is one of those very accommodating
                  individuals who never fail to please their customers, while inciting their vanity;
                  and, at the same time, always secure a good opinion for themselves. And, too, he
                  was liberally inclined, never refused tick, but always made it tell; by which
                  well-devised process, his patrons were continually becoming his humble servants,
                  ready to serve him at call.
               Always civil, and even obsequious at first, ready to condescend and accommodate,
                  he is equally prompt when matters require that peculiar turn which southerners
                  frequently find themselves turned into,—no more tick and a turn out of doors. At
                  times, Mr. O'Brodereque's customers have the very unenviable consolation of
                  knowing that a small document called a mortgage of their real and personal
                  property remains in his hands, which he will very soon find it necessary to
                  foreclose.
               It is dark,—night has stolen upon us again,—the hour for the raffle is at hand.
                  The saloon, about a hundred and forty feet long by forty wide, is brilliantly
                  lighted for the occasion. The gas-lights throw strange shadows upon the distemper
                  painting with which the walls are decorated. Hanging carelessly here and there are
                  badly-daubed paintings of battle scenes and heroic devices, alternated with
                  lithographic and badly-executed engravings of lustfully-exposed females. Soon the
                  saloon fills with a throng of variously-mixed gentlemen. The gay, the grave, the
                  old, and the young men of the fashionable world, are present. Some affect the fast
                  young man; others seem mere speculators, attracted to the place for the purpose of
                  enjoying an hour, seeing the sight, and, it may be, taking a throw for the "gal."
                  The crowd presents sents a singular contrast of beings. Some are dressed to the
                  very extreme of fantastic fashion, and would seem to have wasted their brains in
                  devising colours for their backs; others, aspiring to the seriously genteel, are
                  fashioned in very extravagant broadcloth; while a third group is dressed in most
                  niggardly attire, which sets very loosely. In addition to this they wear very
                  large black, white, and grey-coloured felt hats, slouched over their heads; while
                  their nether garments, of red and brown linsey-woolsey, fit like Falstaff's
                  doublet on a whip stock. They seem proud of the grim tufts of hair that, like the
                  moss-grown clumps upon an old oak, spread over their faces; and they move about in
                  the grotesque crowd, making their physiognomies increase its piquancy.
               The saloon is one of those places at the south where great men, small men, men of
                  different spheres and occupations, men in prominently defined positions, men in
                  doubtful calls of life, and men most disreputably employed, most do congregate. At
                  one end of the saloon is a large oyster counter, behind which stand two coloured
                  men, with sauces, savories, and other mixtures at hand, ready to serve customers
                  who prefer the delicacy in its raw state. Men are partaking without noting
                  numbers. Mr. O'Brodereque has boys serving who take very good care of the numbers.
                  Extending along one side of the saloon is an elaborately carved mahogany counter,
                  with panels of French white and gilt mouldings. This is surmounted with a marble
                  slab, upon which stand well-filled decanters, vases, and salvers. Behind this
                  counter, genteelly-dressed and polite attendants are serving customers who stand
                  along its side in a line, treating in true southern style. The
                  calling for drinks is a problem for nice ears to solve, so varied are the sounds,
                  so strange the names: style, quantity, and mixture seemed without limit, set on in
                  various colours to flow and flood the spirits of the jovial. On the opposite side
                  of the saloon are rows of seats and arm-chairs, interspersed with small tables,
                  from which the beverage can be imbibed more at ease. On the second story is the
                  great "eating saloon," with its various apartments, its curtained boxes, its
                  prim-looking waiters, its pier-glass walls. There is every accommodation for belly
                  theologians, who may discuss the choicest viands of the season.
               
               The company are assembled,—the lower saloon is crowded; Mr. O'Brodereque, with
                  great dignity, mounts the stand,—a little table standing at one end of the room.
                  His face reddens, he gives several delinquent coughs, looks round and smiles upon
                  his motley patrons, points a finger recognisingly at a wag in the corner, who has
                  addressed some remarks to him, puts his thumbs in the sleeve-holes of his vest,
                  throws back his coat-collar, puts himself in a defiant attitude, and is ready to
                  deliver himself of his speech.
               "A political speech from the General! Gentlemen, hats off, and give your attention
                  to Mr. General O'Brodereque's remarks!" resounds from several voices. Mr.
                  O'Brodereque is somewhat overcome, his friends compliment him so: he stands,
                  hesitating, as if he had lost the opening part of his speech, like a statue on a
                  molasses-cask. At length he speaks. "If it was a great political question,
                  gentlemen, I'd get the twist of the thing,—I'd pitch into it, big! These little
                  things always trouble public men more than the important intricacies of government
                  do. You see, they are not 
                     comesurate
                     commensurate
                  ,—that's it!" says Mr. Brodereque, looking wondrously wise the while.
                  After bowing, smiling, and acknowledging the compliments of his generous customers
                  with prodigious grace, he merely announces to his friends—with eloquence that
                  defies imitation, and turns rhetoric into a discordant exposition of his own
                  important self—that, not having examined the constitution for more nor three
                  Sundays, they must, upon the honour of a gentleman, excuse his political speech.
                  "But, gents," he says, "you all know how I trys to please ye in the way of raffles
                  and such things, and how I throws in the belly and stomach fixins. Now, brighten
                  up, ye men of taste"—Mr. Brodereque laughs satisfactorily as he surveys his
                  crowd—"I'm going to do the thing up brown for ye,—to give ye a chance for a bit of
                  bright property what ye don't get every day; can't scare up such property only
                  once in a while. It'll make ye old fellers wink, some"—Mr. O'Brodereque winks at
                  several aged gentlemen, whose grey hair is figurative in the crowd—"think about
                  being young again. And, my friends below thirty—my young friends—ah, ye rascals! I
                  thought I'd play the tune on the right string!"—he laughs, and puts his finger to
                  his mouth quizzically—"I likes to suit ye, and please ye: own her up, now,—don't
                  I?"
               "Hurrah! for Brod,—Brod's a trump!" again resounds from a dozen voices.
               They all agree to the remark that nobody can touch the great Mr. O'Brodereque in
                  getting up a nice bit of fun, amusing young men with more money than mind, and
                  being in the favour of aristocratic gentlemen who think nothing of staking a
                  couple of prime niggers on a point of faro.
               Mr. O'Brodereque has been interrupted; he begs his friends will, for a moment,
                  cease their compliments and allow him to proceed. "Gentlemen!" he continues, "the
                  gal's what ye don't get every day; and she's as choice as she's young; and she's
                  as handsome as she's young; and for this delicious young crittur throws are only
                  five dollars a piece." The sentimental southern gentleman has no reference to the
                  throes of anguish that are piercing the wounded soul of the woman.
               "A gentleman what ain't got a V*
                   in his pocket better not show his winkers in this crowd. After that,
                  gentlemen, there's a slap-up pony, and one of the knowinest dogs outside of a
                  court-house. Now,—gents! if this ain't some tall doings,—some of a raffle, just
                  take my boots and I'll put it for Texas. A chance for a nigger gal—a pony—a dog;
                  who on 'arth wants more, gentlemen?" Mr. O'Brodereque again throws back his coat,
                  shrugs his shoulders, wipes the perspiration from his brow, and is about to
                  descend from the table. No, he won't come down just yet. He has struck a vein; his
                  friends are getting up a favourable excitement.
               "Bravo! bravo!—long may General Brodereque keep the hospitable Your House! Who
                  wouldn't give a vote for Brodereque at the next election?" re-echoes through the
                  room.
               "One more remark, gentlemen." Mr. Brodereque again wipes the perspiration from his
                  forehead, and orders a glass of water, to loosen his oratorical organs. He drinks
                  the water, seems to increase in his own greatness; his red face glows redder, he
                  makes a theatrical gesticulation with his right hand, crumples his hair into
                  curious points, and proceeds:—"The lucky man what gets the gal prize
                  is to treat the crowd!" This is seconded and carried by acclamation, without a
                  dissenting voice.
               
                  *Five-dollar bill.
               
               
               A murmuring noise, as of some one in trouble, is now heard at the door: the crowd
                  gives way: a beautiful mulatto girl, in a black silk dress, with low waist and
                  short sleeves, and morocco slippers on her feet, is led in and placed upon the
                  stand Mr. O'Brodereque has just vacated. Her complexion is that of a swarthy
                  Greek; her countenance is moody and reflective; her feelings are stung with the
                  poison of her degraded position. This last step of her disgrace broods in the
                  melancholy of her face. Shame, pain, hope, and fear, combine to goad her very
                  soul. But it's all for a bit of fun, clearly legal; it's all in accordance with
                  society; misfortune is turned into a plaything, that generous, good, and
                  noble-hearted men may be amused. Those who stand around her are extravagant with
                  joy. After remaining a few moments in silence, a mute victim of generous freedom,
                  she turns her head bashfully, covers her face with her hands. Her feelings gush
                  forth in a stream of tears; she cannot suppress them longer.
               There is a touching beauty in her face, made more effective by the deplorable
                  condition to which she is reduced. Again she looks upward, and covers her face
                  with her hands; her soul seems merged in supplication to the God who rules all
                  things aright. He is a forgiving God! Can he thus direct man's injustice to man,
                  while this poor broken flower thus withers under the bane? Sad, melancholy,
                  doomed! there is no hope, no joy for her. She weeps over her degradation.
               "Stop that whimperin!" says a ruffianly bystander, who orders a coloured boy to
                  let down her hair. He obeys the summons; it falls in thick, black, undulating
                  tresses over her neck and shoulders. A few moments more, and she resumes a calm
                  appearance, looks resolutely upon her auditors, with indignation and contempt
                  pictured in her countenance.
               "She'll soon get over that!" ejaculates another bystander, as he smooths the long
                  beard on his haggard face. "Strip her down!" The request is no sooner made, than
                  Mr. O'Brodereque mounts the stand to perform the feat. "Great country this,
                  gentlemen!" he speaks, taking her by the shoulders.
               "All off! all off, general!" is the popular demand.
               The sensitive nature of the innocent girl recoils; she cringes from his touch; she
                  shudders, and vainly attempts to resist. She must yield; the demand is imperative.
                  Her dress falls at Mr. O'Brodereque's touch. She stands before the gazing crowd,
                  exposed to the very thighs, holding the loose folds of her dress in her hands.
                  There is no sympathy for those moistened eyes; oh, no! it is a luscious
                  feast—puritans have no part in the sin—for those who, in our land of love and
                  liberty, buy and sell poor human nature, and make it food for serving hell.
               Naked she stands for minutes; the assembled gentlemen have feasted their
                  eyes,—good men have played the part of their good natures. General O'Brodereque,
                  conscious of his dignity, orders her to be taken down. The waiter performs the
                  duty, and she is led out midst the acclamations and plaudits of the crowd, who
                  call for the raffle.
               Mr. O'Brodereque hopes gentlemen are satisfied with what they have seen, and will
                  pledge his honour that the pony and dog are quite as sound and healthy as the
                  wench whose portions they have had a chance to shy; and for which—the extra
                  sight—they should pay an extra treat. This, however, his generosity will not allow
                  him to stand upon; and, seeing how time is precious, and the weather warm, he
                  hopes his friends will excuse the presence of the animals, take his word of honour
                  in consideration of the sight of the wench.
               "Now, gentlemen," he says, "the throws are soon to commence, and all what ain't
                  put down the tin better attend that ar' needful arrangement, quicker!"
               As the general concludes this very significant invitation, Dan Bengal, Anthony
                  Romescos, and Nath Nimrod, enter together. Their presence creates some little
                  commotion, for Romescos is known to be turbulent, and very uncertain when liquor
                  flows freely, which is the case at present.
               "I say, general!—old hoss! I takes all the chances what's left," Romescos shouts
                  at the top of his voice. His eyes glare with anxiety,—his red, savage face, doubly
                  sun-scorched, glows out as he elbows his way through the crowd up to the desk,
                  where sits a corpulent clerk. "Beg your pardon, gentlemen: not so fast, if you
                  please!" he says, entering names in his ledger, receiving money, "doing the polite
                  of the establishment."
               Romescos's coat and nether clothing are torn in several places, a hunting-belt girdles his waist; a
                  bowie-knife (Sheffield make) protrudes from his breast-pocket, his hair hangs in
                  jagged tufts over the collar of his coat, which, with the rough moccasons on his
                  feet, give him an air of fierce 
                     desperaton
                     desperation
                   and recklessness. His presence is evidently viewed with suspicion; he is
                  a curious object which the crowd are willing to give ample space to.
               "No, you don't take 'em all, neither!" says another, in a defiant tone. The
                  remaining "chances" are at once put up for sale; they bring premiums, as one by
                  one they are knocked down to the highest bidders, some as much as fifty per cent.
                  advance. Gentlemen are not to know it, because Mr. O'Brodereque thinks his honour
                  above everything else; but the fact is, there is a collusion between Romescos and
                  the honourable Mr. O'Brodereque. The former is playing his part to create a
                  rivalry that will put dollars and cents into the pocket of the latter.
               "Well!" exclaims Romescos, with great indifference, as soon as the sale had
                  concluded, "I've got seven throws, all lucky ones. I'll take any man's bet for two
                  hundred dollars that I gets the gal prize." Nobody seems inclined to accept the
                  challenge. A table is set in the centre of the saloon, the dice are brought on,
                  amidst a jargon of noise and confusion; to this is added drinking, smoking,
                  swearing, and all kinds of small betting.
               The raffle commences; one by one the numbers are called. Romescos' turn has come;
                  all eyes are intently set upon him. He is celebrated for tricks of his trade; he
                  seldom repudiates the character, and oftener prides in the name of a shrewd one,
                  who can command a prize for his sharp dealing. In a word, he has a peculiar
                  faculty of shielding the doubtful transactions of a class of men no less
                  dishonest, but more modest in point of reputation.
               Romescos spreads himself wonderfully, throws his dice, and exults over the result.
                  He has turned up three sixes at the first and second throws, and two sixes and
                  five at the third.
               "Beat that! who can?" he says. No one discovers that he has, by a very dexterous
                  movement, slipped a set of false dice into the box, while O'Brodereque diverted
                  attention at the moment by introducing the pony into the saloon.
               We will pass over many things that occurred, and inform the reader that Romescos
                  won the first prize—the woman. The dog and pony prizes were carried off by
                  legitimate winners. This specific part of the scene over, a band of negro
                  minstrels are introduced, who strike up their happy glees, the music giving new
                  life to the revelry. Such a medley of drinking, gambling, and carousing followed,
                  as defies description. What a happy thing it is to be free; they feel this,—
                     it
                     
                   it is a happy feeling! The sport lasts till the small hours of morning
                  advance. Romescos is seen leaving the saloon very quietly.
               "There!" says Mr. O'Brodereque exultingly, "he hasn't got so much of a showing.
                  That nigger gal ain't what she's cracked up to be!" and he shakes his head
                  knowingly, thrusts his hands deep into his breeches pockets, smiles with an air of
                  great consequence.
               "Where did ye raise the critter? devil of a feller ye be, Brodereque!" says a
                  young sprig, giving his hat a particular set on the side of his head, and
                  adjusting his eye-glass anew. "Ye ain't gin her a name, in all the showin'," he
                  continues, drawlingly.
               "That gal! She ain't worth so much, a'ter all. She's of Marston's stock; Ellen
                  Juvarna, I think they call her. She's only good for her looks, in the animal
                  way,—that's all!"
               "Hav'n't told where ye got her, yet," interrupts the sprig; "none of yer crossin'
                  corners, general."
               "Well, I started up that gal of Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy. She takes it into
                  her mind to get crazed now and then, and Marston had to sell her; and the Elder
                  bought her for a trifle, cured up her thinkin'-trap, got her sound up for market,
                  and I makes a strike with the Elder, and gets her at a tall bargain." Mr.
                  O'Brodereque has lost none of his dignity, none of his honour, none of his hopes
                  of getting into Congress by the speculation.
               It is poor Ellen Juvarna; she has been cured for the market. She might have said,
                  and with truth,—"You don't know me now, so wonderful are they who deal with my
                  rights in this our world of liberty!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER 
                     XVII.
                     XVIII.
                  
               
               A NOT UNCOMMON SCENE SLIGHTLY CHANGED.
               ROMESCOS, having withdrawn from the saloon while the excitement raged highest, may
                  be seen, with several others, seated at a table in the upper room. They are in
                  earnest consultation,—evidently devising some plan for carrying out a deep-laid
                  plot.
               "I have just called my friend, who will give us the particulars about the
                  constitutionality of the thing. Here he is. Mr. Scranton, ye see, knows all about
                  such intricacies; he is an editor! formerly from the North," one of the party is
                  particular to explain, as he directs his conversation to Romescos. That gentleman
                  of slave-cloth only knows the part they call the rascality; he pays the gentlemen
                  of the learned law profession to shuffle him out of all the legal intricacies that
                  hang around his murderous deeds. He seems revolving the thing over in his mind at
                  the moment, makes no reply. The gentleman turns to Mr. Scranton—the same
                  methodical gentleman we have described with the good Mrs. Rosebrook—hopes he will
                  be good enough to advise on the point in question. Mr. Scranton sits in all the
                  dignity of his serious philosophy, quite unmoved; his mind is nearly distracted
                  about all that is constitutionally right or constitutionally wrong. He is bound to
                  his own ways of thinking, and would suffer martyrdom before his own conscientious
                  scruples would allow him to acknowledge a right superior to that
                  constitution. As for the humanity! that has nothing to do with the constitution,
                  nothing to do with the laws of the land, nothing to do with popular
                  government,—nothing to do with anything, and never should be taken into
                  consideration when the point at issue involved negro property. The schedule of
                  humanity would be a poor account at one's banker's. Mr. Scranton begins to smooth
                  his face, which seems to elongate like a wet moon. "The question is, as I
                  understand it, gentlemen, how far the law will give you a right to convict and
                  sell the woman in the absence of papers and against the assertions of her owner,
                  that she is free? Now, gentlemen, in the absence of my law books, and without the
                  least scruple that I am legally right, for I'm seldom legally wrong, having been
                  many years secretary to a senator in Congress who made it my particular duty to
                  keep him posted on all points of the constitution—he drawls out with the serious
                  complacency of a London beggar—I will just say that, whatever is legal must be
                  just. Laws are always founded in justice—that's logical, you see,—and I always
                  maintained it long 'afore I come south, long 'afore I knowed a thing about 'nigger
                  law.' The point, thus far, you see, gentlemen, I've settled. Now then!" Mr.
                  Scranton rests his elbow on the table, makes many legal gesticulations with his
                  finger; he, however, disclaims all and every connection with the legal body,
                  inasmuch as its members have sunk very much in the scale of character, and will
                  require a deal of purifying ere he can call them brothers; but he knows a thing or
                  two of constitutional law, and thus proceeds: "'Tain't a whit of matter about the
                  woman, barring the dockerment's all right. You only want to prove that Marston
                  bought her, that's all! As for the young scraps, why—supposing they are his—that
                  won't make a bit of difference; they are property for all that, subject to legal
                  restraints. Your claim will be valid against it. You may have to play nicely over
                  some intricate legal points. But, remember, nigger law is wonderfully elastic; it
                  requires superhuman wisdom to unravel its social and political intricacies, and
                  when I view it through the horoscope of an indefinite future it makes my very head
                  ache. You may, however, let your claim revert to another, and traverse the case
                  until such time as you can procure reliable proof to convict." Mr. Scranton
                  asserts this as the force of his legal and constitutional acumen. He addresses
                  himself to a mercantile-looking gentleman who sits at the opposite side of the
                  table, attentively listening. He is one of several of Marston's creditors, who sit
                  at the table; they have attached certain property, and having some doubts of
                  overthrowing Marston's plea of freedom, which he has intimated his intention to
                  enter, have called in the valuable aid of Romescos. That indomitable individual,
                  however, has more interests than one to serve, and is playing his cards with great
                     "diplomatic skill." Indeed, he often
                  remarks that his wonderful diplomatic skill would have been a great acquisition to
                  the federal government, inasmuch as it would have facilitated all its Southern
                  American projects.
               The point in question at present, and which they must get over, in order to prove
                  the property, is made more difficult by the doubt in which the origin of Clotilda
                  has always been involved. Many are the surmises about her parentage—many are the
                  assertions that she is not of negro extraction—she has no one feature indicating
                  it—but no one can positively assert where she came from; in a word, no one dare!
                  Hence is constituted the ground for fearing the issue of Marston's notice of
                  freedom.
               "Well! I'll own it puzzles my cunnin'; there's a way to get round it—there is—but
                  deuced if 'tain't too much for my noddle," Romescos interposes, taking a little
                  more whiskey, and seeming quite indifferent about the whole affair.
                  "Suppose—Marston—comes—forward! yes, and brings somebody to swear as a kind a'
                  sideways? That'll be a poser in asserting their freedom; it'll saddle you
                  creditors with the burden of proof. There'll be the rub; and ye can't plead a
                  right to enjoin the schedule he files in bankruptcy unless ye show how they were
                  purchased by him. Perchance on some legal uncertainty it might be done,—by your
                  producing proof that he had made an admission, anterior to the levy, of their
                  being purchased by him," Romescos continues, very wisely appealing to his learned
                  and constitutional friend, Mr. Scranton, who yields his assent by adding that the
                  remarks are very legal, and contain truths worth considering, inasmuch as they
                  involve great principles of popular government. "I think our worthy friend has a
                  clear idea of the points," Mr. Scranton concludes.
               "One word more, gentlemen: a bit of advice what's worth a right smart price to ye
                  all"—here he parenthesises by saying he has great sympathy for creditors in
                  distress—"and ye must profit by it, for yer own interests. As the case now stands,
                  it's a game for lawyers to play and get fat at. And, seein' how Marston's feelins
                  are up in a sort of tender way, he feels strong about savin' them young 'uns; and
                  ye, nor all the gentlemen of the lower place, can't make 'em property, if he plays
                  his game right;—he knows how to! ye'll only make a fuss over the brutes, while the
                  lawyers bag all the game worth a dollar. Never see'd a nigger yet what raised a
                  legal squall, that didn't get used up in law leakins; lawyers are sainted pocket
                  masters! But—that kind a' stuff!—it takes a mighty deal of cross-cornered swearing
                  to turn it into property. The only way ye can drive the peg in so the lawyers
                  won't get hold on't, is by sellin' out to old Graspum—Norman, I mean—he does up
                  such business as fine as a fiddle. Make the best strike with him ye can—he's as
                  tough as a knot on nigger trade!—and, if there's any making property out on 'em,
                  he's just the tinker to do it."
               They shake their heads doubtingly, as if questioning the policy of the advice. Mr.
                  Scranton, however, to whom all looked with great solicitation, speaks up, and
                  affirms the advice to be the wiser course, as a bird in the hand is worth two in
                  the bush.
               "Oh, yes!" says Romescos, significantly, "you'll be safe then, and free from
                  responsibility; Graspum's a great fellow to buy risks; but, seeing how he's not
                  popular with juries, he may want to play behind the scenes, continue to prosecute
                  the case in the name of the creditors,—that's all! Curious work, this making
                  property out of doubtful women. Sell out to them what understands the curious of
                  the things, clear yerselfs of the perplexin' risks—ye won't bag a bit of the game,
                  you won't. Saddle it on Norman; he knows the philosophy of nigger trade, and can
                  swim through a sea of legal perplexities in nigger cases." Mr. Romescos never gave
                  more serious advice in his life; he finishes his whiskey, adjusts his hat
                  slouchingly on his head, bids them good night; and, in return for their thanks,
                  assures them that they are welcome. He withdraws; Mr. Scranton, after a time, gets
                  very muddled; so much so, that, when daylight appears, he finds, to his utter
                  astonishment, he has enjoyed a sweet sleep on the floor, some of his quizzical
                  friends having disfigured his face very much after the fashion of a clown's. He
                  modestly, and mechanically, picks up his lethargic body, views his constitutional
                  self in the glass, and is much horrified, much disgusted with those who
                  perpetrated the freak.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER 
                     XVIII.
                     XIX.
                  
               
               THEY ARE ALL GOING TO BE SOLD.
               SLOWLY we pass through the precious scenes, hoping our readers will indulge us
                  with their patience.
               Five days have passed since Clotilda's departure; her absence is creating alarm.
                  No one knows anything of her! a general search is instituted, but the searchers
                  search in vain. Maxwell has eluded suspicion—Franconia no one for a moment
                  suspects. Colonel M'Carstrow—his mind, for the time, absorbed in the charms of his
                  young bride—gives little attention to the matter. He only knows that he has signed
                  a bond for fifteen hundred dollars, to indemnify the sheriff, or creditors, in the
                  event of loss; he reconciles himself with the belief that she has been enticed
                  into some of the neighbouring bright houses, from which he can regain her in the
                  course of time. M'Carstrow knows little of Clotilda's real character; and thus the
                  matter rests a time.
               The sheriff,—important gentleman of an important office,—will give himself no
                  concern about the matter: the plaintiff's attorney acknowledged the deed of
                  release, which is quite enough for him. Graspum, a perfect savan where human
                  property was to be judged, had decided that her square inches of human vitality
                  were worth strong fifteen hundred; that was all desirable for the sheriff—it would
                  leave margin enough to cover the cost. But M'Carstrow, when given the bond, knew
                  enough of nigger law to demand the insertion of a clause leaving it subject to the
                  question of property, which is to be decided by the court. A high court this,
                  where freemen sit assembled to administer curious justice. What constitutional
                  inconsistencies hover over the monstrous judicial dignity of this court,—this
                  court having jurisdiction over the monetary value of beings moulded after God's
                  own image! It forms a happy jurisprudence for those who view it for their selfish
                  ends; it gains freedom tyranny's license, gives birth to strange incongruities,
                  clashing between the right of property in man and all the viler passions of our
                  nature. It holds forth a jurisprudence that turns men into hounds of hell,
                  devouring one another, and dragging human nature down into the very filth of
                  earth.
               Marston's troubles keep increasing. All the preliminaries of law necessary to a
                  sale of the undisputed property have been gone through; the day of its disposal
                  has arrived. The children, Annette and Nicholas, have remained in a cell,
                  suffering under its malarious atmosphere, anxiously awaiting their fate. Marston
                  has had them taught to read,—contrary to a generous law of a generous land,—and at
                  intervals they sit together pondering over little books he has sent them.
               What are such little books to them? the unbending avarice of human nature,
                  fostered by slavery's power, is grappling at their existence. There is no sympathy
                  for them; it is crushed out by the law which makes them chattels. Oh, no!
                  sympathy, generosity, human affections, have little to do with the transactions of
                  slave dealing; that belongs to commerce,—commerce has an unbending rule to
                  maintain while money is to be made by a legalised traffic.
               We must invite the reader to accompany us to the county gaol, on the morning of
                  sale.
               The "gang"—Marston's slaves—have been ordered to prepare themselves for the
                  market; the yard resounds with their jargon. Some are arranging their little
                  clothing, washing, "brightening up" their faces to make the property show off in
                  the market. Others are preparing homony for breakfast; children, in ragged
                  garments, are toddling, running, playing, and sporting about the brick pavement;
                  the smallest are crouched at the feet of their mothers, as if sharing the gloom or
                  nonchalance of their feeling. Men are gathering together the remnants of some
                  cherished memento of the old plantation; they had many a happy day upon it. Women
                  view as things of great worth the little trinkets with which good master, in
                  former days, rewarded their energy. They recall each happy association of the
                  cabin. Husbands, or such as should be husbands, look upon their wives with
                  solicitude; they feel it is to be the last day they will meet together on earth.
                  They may meet in heaven; there is no slavery there. Mothers look upon their
                  children only to feel the pangs of sorrow more keenly; they know and feel that their offspring are born for the
                  market, not for the enjoyment of their affections. They may be torn from them, and
                  sold like sheep in the shambles. Happy, free country! How fair, how beautiful the
                  picture of constitutional rights! how in keeping with every-day scenes of southern
                  life!
               "I'ze gwine to be sold; you're gwint to be sold; we're all gwine to be sold.
                  Wonder what mas'r's gwine t'buy dis child," says Aunt Rachel, arranging her best
                  dress, making her face "shine just so." Aunt Rachel endeavours to suit her
                  feelings to the occasion, trims her bandana about her head with exquisite taste,
                  and lets the bright-coloured points hang about her ears in great profusion.
               "Da'h 's a right smart heap o' dollar in dis old nigger, yet!—if mas'r what gwine
                  t'buy 'em know how't fotch um out; Mas'r must do da'h clean ting wid dis child,"
                  Rachel says, as if exulting over the value of her own person. She brushes and
                  brushes, views and reviews herself in a piece of mirror—several are waiting to
                  borrow it—thinks she is just right for market, asks herself what's the use of
                  fretting? It's a free country, with boundless hospitality—of the southern
                  stamp,—and why not submit to all freedom's dealings? Aunt Rachel is something of a
                  philosopher.
               "Aunte! da' would'nt gin much fo'h yer old pack a' bones if mas'r what gwine to
                  buy ye know'd ye like I. Ye' h'ant da property what bring long price wid Buckra,"
                  replies Dandy, who views Aunt Rachel rather suspiciously, seems inclined to
                  relieve her conceit, and has taken very good care that his own dimensions are
                  trimmed up to the highest point.
               "Dis nigger would'nt swop h'r carcas fo'h yourn. Dat she don't," Rachel
                  retorts.
               "Reckon how ye wouldn't, ah!" Dandy's face fills with indignation. "Buckra what
                  sting ye back wid de lash 'll buy ye old bag a' bones fo'h down south; and when 'e
                  get ye down da' he make ye fo'h a corn grinder." Dandy is somewhat inflated with
                  his rank among the domestics; he is none of yer common niggers, has never
                  associated with black, field niggers, which he views as quite too common for his
                  aristocratic notions, has on his very best looks, his hair combed with
                  extraordinary care, his shirt collar dangerously standing above his ears. He feels
                  something better than nigger blood in his composition, knows the ins and outs of
                  nigger philosophy; he knows it to be the very best kind of philosophy for a
                  "nigger" to put on a good appearance at the shambles. A dandy nigger is not
                  plantation stock,—hence he has "trimmed up," and hopes to find a purchaser in want
                  of his specific kind of property; it will save him from that field-life so much
                  dreaded.
               The property, in all its varied shades, comes rolling out from all manner of
                  places in and about the gaol, filling the yard. It is a momentous occasion, the
                  most momentous of their life-time. And yet many seem indifferent about its
                  consequences. They speak of the old plantation, jeer each other about the value of
                  themselves, offer bets on the price they will bring, assert a superiority over
                  each other, and boast of belonging to some particular grade of the property.
                  Harry—we mean Harry the preacher—is busy getting his wife and children ready for
                  market. He evinces great affection for his little ones, has helped his wife to
                  arrange their apparel with so much care. The uninitiated might imagine them going
                  to church instead of the man shambles. Indeed, so earnest are many good divines in
                  the promotion of slavery, that it would not be unbecoming to form a connection
                  between the southern church and the southern man shambles. The material aid they
                  now give each other for the purpose of keeping up the man trade would be much
                  facilitated.
               However, there is a chance of Harry being sold to a brother divine, who by way of
                  serving his good Lord and righteous master, may let him out to preach, after the
                  old way. Harry will then be serving his brother in brotherly faith; that is, he
                  will be his brother's property, very profitable, strong in the faith with his dear
                  divine brother, to whom he will pay large tribute for the right to serve the same
                  God.
               Harry's emotions—he has been struggling to suppress them—have got beyond his
                  control; tears will now and then show themselves and course down his cheeks.
                  "Never mind, my good folks! it is something to know that Jesus still guards us;
                  still watches over us." He speaks encouragingly to them. "The scourge of earth is
                  man's wrongs, the deathspring of injustice. We are made bearers of the burden; but
                  that very burden will be our passport into a brighter, a juster world. Let us meekly bear it. Cheer up! arm
                  yourselves with the spirit of the Lord; it will give you fortitude to live out the
                  long journey of slave life. How we shall feel when, in heaven, we are brought face
                  to face with master, before the Lord Judge. Our rights and his wrongs will then
                  weigh in the balance of heavenly justice." With these remarks, Harry counsels them
                  to join him in prayer. He kneels on the brick pavement of the yard, clasps his
                  hands together as they gather around him kneeling devotedly. Fervently he offers
                  up a prayer,—he invokes the God of heaven to look down upon them, to bestow his
                  mercy upon master, to incline his ways in the paths of good; and to protect these,
                  his unfortunate children, and guide them through their separate wayfaring. The
                  ardour, grotesqueness, and devotion of this poor forlorn group, are painfully
                  touching. How it presents the portrait of an oppressed race! how sunk is the
                  nature that has thus degraded it! Under the painful burden of their sorrow they
                  yet manifest the purity of simple goodness. "Oh! Father in heaven, hast thou thus
                  ordained it to be so?" breaks forth from Harry's lips, as the criminals, moved by
                  the affecting picture, gather upon the veranda, and stand attentive listeners.
                  Their attention seems rivetted to his words; the more vicious, as he looks through
                  grated bars upon them, whispers words of respect.
               Harry has scarcely concluded his prayer when the sheriff, accompanied by several
                  brokers (slave-dealers), comes rushing through the transept into the yard. The
                  sheriff is not rude; he approaches Harry, tells him he is a good boy, has no
                  objection to his praying, and hopes a good master will buy him. He will do all he
                  can to further his interests, having heard a deal about his talents. He says this
                  with good-natured measure, and proceeds to take a cursory view of the felons.
                  While he is thus proceeding, the gentlemen of trade who accompanied him are
                  putting "the property" through a series of examinations.
               "Property like this ye don't start up every day," says one. "Best I'ze seen come
                  from that ar' district. Give ye plenty corn, down there, don't they, boys?"
                  enjoins another, walking among them, and every moment bringing the end of a small
                  whip which he holds in his right hand about their legs. This, the gentleman
                  remarks, is merely for the purpose—one of the phrases of the very honourable
                  trade—of testing their nimbleness.
               "Well!" replies a tall, lithe dealer, whose figure would seem to have been moulded
                  for chasing hogs through the swamp, "There's some good bits among it; but it won't
                  stand prime, as a lot!" The gentleman, who seems to have a nicely balanced mind
                  for judging the human nature value of such things, is not quite sure that they
                  have been bacon fed. He continues his learned remarks. "Ye'h han't had full tuck
                  out, I reckon, boys?" he inquires of them, deliberately examining the mouths and
                  nostrils of several. The gentleman is very cool in this little matter of trade; it
                  is an essential element of southern democracy; some say, nothing more!
               "Yes, Boss!" replies Enoch, one of the negroes; "Mas'r ollers good t' e niggers,
                  gin him bacon free times a week—sometimes mo' den dat." Several voices chime in to
                  affirm what Enoch says.
               "Ah, very good. Few planters in that district give their negroes bacon; and an all
                  corn-fed nigger won't last two years on a sugar plantation," remarks one of the
                  gentlemen dealers, as he smokes his cigar with great nonchalance.
               While these quaint appendancies of the trade are proceeding, Romescos and Graspum
                  make their appearance. They have come to forestall opinion, to make a few
                  side-winded remarks. They are ready to enter upon the disgusting business of
                  examining property more carefully, more scrupulously, more in private. The
                  honourable sheriff again joins the party. He orders that every accommodation be
                  afforded the gentlemen in their examinations of the property. Men, women, and
                  children—sorrowing property—are made to stand erect; to gesticulate their arms; to
                  expand their chests, to jump about like jackals, and to perform sundry antics
                  pleasing to the gentlemen lookers-on. This is all very free, very democratic, very
                  gentlemanly in the way of trade,—very necessary to test the ingredient of the
                  valuable square inches of the property. What matters all this! the honourable
                  sheriff holds it no dishonour; modest gentlemen never blush at it; the coarse
                  dealer makes it his study,—he trades in human nature; the happy democrat thinks it should have a co-fellowship
                  with southern hospitality—so long and loudly boasted.
               Those little necessary displays over, the honourable sheriff invites his
                  distinguished friends to "have a cigar round;" having satisfied their taste in
                  gymnastarising the property. Romescos, however, thinks he has not quite satisfied
                  his feelings; he is very dogged on nigger flesh. The other gentlemen
                  may smoke their cigars; Mr. Romescos thinks he will enjoy the exercise of his
                  skill in testing the tenacity of negroes' chests; which he does by administering
                  heavy blows, which make them groan out now and then. Groans, however, don't amount
                  to much; they are only nigger groans. Again Mr. Romescos applies the full force of
                  his hands upon their ears; then he will just pull them systematically. "Nice
                  property!" he says, telling the forbearing creatures not to mind the pain.
               Messrs. Graspum and Romescos will make a close inspection of a few pieces. Here,
                  several men and women are led into a basement cell, under the veranda, and stript
                  most rudely. No discrimination is permitted. Happy freedom! What a boon is
                  liberty! Mr. Romescos views their nice firm bodies, and their ebony black skins,
                  with great skill and precaution; his object is to prove the disposition of the
                  articles,—strong evidence being absence of scars. He lays his bony fingers on
                  their left shoulders—they being compelled to stand in a recumbent position—tracing
                  their bodies to the hips and thighs. Here the process ends. Mr. Romescos has
                  satisfied his very nice judgment on the solidity of the human-flesh-property—he
                  has put their bodies through other disgusting inspections—they belong to the
                  trade—which cannot be told here; but he finds clean skins, very smooth, without
                  scars or cuts, or dangerous diseases. He laughs exultingly, orders the people to
                  stow themselves in their clothes again, and relights his cigar. "If it 'ant a tall
                  lot!" he whispers to Graspum, and gives him a significant touch with his elbow.
                  "Bright—smooth as a leather ninepence; han't had a lash—Marston was a fool, or his
                  niggers are angels, rather black, though—couldn't start up a scar on their flesh.
                  A little trimmin' down—it wants it, you see!—to make it show off; must have it—eh!
                  Graspum, old feller? It only wants a little, though, and them dandy niggers, and
                  that slap-up preacher, will bring a smart price fixed up. Great institution! The
                  preacher's got knowin'; can discourse like a college-made deacon, and can convert
                  a whole plantation with his nigger eloquence. A nigger preacher with Bible knowin,
                  when it's smart, is right valuable when ye want to keep the pious of a plantation
                  straight. And then! when the preacher 'ant got a notion a' runnin away in him."
                  Romescos crooks his finger upon Graspum's arm, whispers cautiously in his ear.
               "There 'll be a sharp bidding for some of it; they 'll run up some on the
                  preacher. He 'll be a capital investment,—pay more than thirty per cent.
                  insinuates another gentleman—a small inquisitive looking dealer in articles of the
                  nigger line. When a planter's got a big gang a' niggers, and is just fool enough
                  to keep such a thing for the special purpose of making pious valuable in 'um," Mr.
                  Romescos rejoins, shrugging his shoulders, rubbing his little hawk's eyes, and
                  looking seriously indifferent. Romescos gives wonderful evidence of his "first
                  best cunning propensities;" and here he fancies he has pronounced an opinion that
                  will be taken as profound. He affects heedlessness of everything, is quite
                  disinterested, and, thrusting his hands deep into his pockets, assumes an air of
                  dignity that would not unbecome my Lord Chief Justice.
               "Let us see them two bits of disputed property,—where are they?" inquires Graspum,
                  turning half round, and addressing himself to the gaoler.
               "In the close cells," is the quick reply,—"through the narrow vault, up the stone
                  passage, and on the right, in the arched cell."
               The gaoler—good, honest-hearted man—leads the way, through a chilly vault, up the
                  narrow passage, to the left wing of the building. The air is pestiferous; warm and
                  diseased, it fans us as we approach. The gaoler puts his face to the grating, and
                  in a guttural voice, says, "You're wanted, young uns." They understand the
                  summons; they come forward as if released from torture to enjoy the pure air of
                  heaven. Confinement, dreary and damp, has worn deep into their systems.
               Annette speaks feebly, looks pale and sickly. Her flaxen curls still dangle
                  prettily upon her shoulders. She expected her mother; that mother has not come.
                  The picture seems strange; she looks childishly and vacantly round,—at the dealers, at Graspum, at the sheriff, at
                  the familiar faces of the old plantation people. She recognizes Harry, and would
                  fain leap into his arms. Nicholas, less moved by what is going on around him,
                  hangs reluctantly behind, holding by the skirt of Annette's frock. He has lost
                  that vivacity and pertness so characteristic on the plantation. Happy picture of
                  freedom's love! Happy picture of immortalised injustice! Happy picture of
                  everything that is unhappy! How modest is the boast that we live to be free; and
                  that in our virtuous freedom a child's mother has been sold for losing her mind: a
                  faithful divine, strong with love for his fellow divines, is to be sold for his
                  faith; the child—the daughter of the democrat—they say, will be sold from her
                  democratic father. The death-stinging enemy Washington and Jefferson sought to
                  slaughter—to lay ever dead at their feet, has risen to life again. Annette's
                  mother has fled to escape its poison. We must pause! we must not discourse thus in
                  our day, when the sordid web of trade is being drawn over the land by King
                  Cotton.
               The children, like all such doubtful stock, are considered very fancy, very choice
                  of their kind. It must be dressed in style to suit nice eyes at the shambles.
               "Well! ye'r right interesting looking," says the sheriff—Messrs. Graspum and Co.
                  look upon them with great concern, now and then interrupting with some
                  observations upon their pedigree,—taking them by the arms, and again rumpling
                  their hair by rubbing his hands over their heads. "Fix it up, trim; we must put
                  them up along with the rest to-day. It 'll make Marston—I pity the poor
                  fellow—show his hand on the question of their freedom. Mr. sheriff, being
                  sufficiently secured against harm, is quite indifferent about the latent phases of
                  the suit. He remarks, with great legal logic—we mean legal slave logic—that
                  Marston must object to the sale when the children are on the stand. It is very
                  pretty kind a' property, very like Marston—will be as handsome as pictures when
                  they grow up," he says, ordering it put back to be got ready.
               "Why didn't my mother come?" the child whimpers, dewy tears decorating her eyes.
                  "Why won't she come back and take me to the plantation again? I want her to come
                  back; I've waited so long." As she turns to follow the gaoler—Nicholas still holds
                  her by the skirt of her frock— her flaxen curls again wave to and fro upon her
                  shoulders, adding beauty to her childlike simplicity. "You'll grow to be
                  something, one of these days, won't ye, little dear?" says the gaoler, taking her
                  by the hand. She replies in those silent and touching arguments of the soul; she
                  raises her soft blue eyes, and heaven fills them with tears, which she lifts her
                  tiny hands to wipe away.
               Nicholas tremblingly—he cannot understand the strange movement—follows them
                  through the vault; he looks up submissively, and with instinctive sympathy
                  commences a loud blubbering. "You're going to be sold, little uns! but, don't roar
                  about it; there's no use in that," says the gaoler, inclining to sympathy.
               Nicholas does'nt comprehend it; he looks up to Annette, plaintively, and,
                  forgetting his own tears, says, in a whisper, "Don't cry, Annette; they 'll let us
                  go and see mother, and mother will be so kind to us—."
               "It does seem a pity to sell ye, young 'uns; ye'r such nice 'uns,—have so much
                  interestin' in yer little skins!" interrupts the gaoler, suddenly. The man of keys
                  could unfold a strange history of misery, suffering, and death, if fear of popular
                  opinion, illustrated in popular liberty, did not seal his lips. He admits the
                  present to be*
                   rather an uncommon case, says it makes a body feel kind a' unhinged about
                  the heart, which heart, however rocky at times, will have its own way when little
                  children are sorrowing. "And then, to know their parents! that's what tells deeper
                  on a body's feeling,—it makes a body look into the hereafter." The man of keys and
                  shackles would be a father, if the law did but let him. There is a monster power
                  over him, a power he dreads—it is the power of unbending democracy, moved alone by
                  fretful painstakers of their own freedom.
               "Poor little things! ye 'r most white, yes!—suddenly changing—just as white as
                  white need be. Property's property, though, all over the world. What's sanctioned
                  by the constitution, and protected by the spirit and wisdom of Congress, must be
                  right, and maintained," the gaoler concludes. His heart is at war with his head;
                  but the head has the power, and he must protect the rights of an unrighteous
                  system. They have arrived at a flight of steps, up
                  
                     *We are narrating a scene related to us by the very gaoler we here describe,
                        and as nearly as possible in his own language.
                  
                   which they ascend, and are soon lost in its
                  windings. They are going to be dressed for the market.
               The sheriff is in the yard, awaiting the preparation of the property. Even
                  he—iron-hearted, they say—gives them a look of generous solicitude, as they pass
                  out. He really feels there is a point, no less in the scale of slave dealing,
                  beyond which there is something so repugnant that hell itself might frown upon it.
                  "It's a phase too hard, touches a body's conscience," he says, not observing
                  Romescos at his elbow.
               "Conscience!" interrupts Romescos, his eyes flashing like meteors of red fire,
                  "the article don't belong to the philosophy of our business. Establish
                  conscience—let us, gentlemen, give way to our feelins, and trade in nigger
                  property 'd be deader than Chatham's statue, what was pulled through our streets
                  by the neck. The great obstacle, however, is only this—it is profitable in its
                  way!" Romescos cautiously attempts to shield this, but it will not do.
               The gaoler, protruding his head from a second-story window, like a mop in a rain
                  storm, enquires if it is requisite to dress the children in their very best shine.
                  It is evident he merely views them as two bales of merchandise.
               The sheriff, angrily, says, "Yes! I told you that already. Make them look as
                  bright as two new pins." His honour has been contemplating how they will be mere
                  pins in the market,—pins to bolt the doors of justice, pins to play men into
                  Congress, pins to play men out of Congress, pins to play a President into the
                  White House.
               An old negress, one of the plantation nurses, is called into service. She
                  commences the process of preparing them for market. They are nicely washed,
                  dressed in clean clothes; they shine out as bright and white as anybody's
                  children. Their heads look so sleek, their hair is so nicely combed, so nicely
                  parted, so nicely curled. The old slave loves them,—she loved their father. Her
                  skill has been lavished upon them,—they look as choice and interesting as the
                  human property of any democratic gentleman can be expected to do. Let us be
                  patriotic, let us be law-loving, patient law-abiding citizens, loving that law of
                  our free country which puts them under the man-vender's hammer,—say our
                  peace-abiding neighbours.
               The gaoler has not been long in getting Annette and Nicholas ready. He brings them
                  forward, so neatly and prettily dressed: he places them among the "gang." But they
                  are disputed property: hence all that ingenuity which the system engenders for the
                  advancement of dealers is brought into use to defeat the attempt to assert their
                  freedom. Romescos declares it no difficult matter to do this: he has the deadly
                  weapon in his possession; he can work (shuffle) the debt into Graspum's hands, and
                  he can supply the proof to convict. By this very desirable arrangement the thing
                  may be made nicely profitable.
               No sooner has Aunt Rachel seen the children in their neat and familiar attire,
                  than her feelings bound with joy,—she cannot longer restrain them. She has watched
                  Marston's moral delinquencies with suspicion; but she loves the children none the
                  less. And with honest negro nature she runs to them, clasps them to her bosom,
                  fondles them, and kisses them like a fond mother. The happy associations of the
                  past, contrasted with their present unhappy condition, unbind the fountain of her
                  solicitude,—she pours it upon them, warm and fervent. "Gwine t' sell ye, too!
                  Mas'r, poor old Mas'r, would'nt sell ye, no how! that he don't. But poor old Boss
                  hab 'e trouble now, God bless 'em," she says, again pressing Annette to her bosom,
                  nearer and nearer, with fondest, simplest, holiest affection. Looking intently in
                  the child's face, she laughs with the bounding joy of her soul; then she smooths
                  its hair with her brawny black hands: they contrast strangely with the pure
                  carnatic of the child's cheek.
               "Lor! good Lor, Mas'r Buckra," 
                     aunt
                     Aunt
                   Rachel exclaims, "if eber de Lor' smote 'e vengence on yeh, 't'll be fo'
                  sellin' de likes o' dese. Old Mas'r tinks much on 'em, fo' true. Gwine t' sell dem
                  what Mas'r be so fond on? Hard tellin' what Buckra don't sell win i' makes money
                  on him. Neber mind, children; de Lor' aint so unsartin as white man. He,—da'h good
                  Mas'r yonder in the clouds,—save ye yet; he'll make white man gin ye back when de
                  day o' judgment come." Aunt Rachel has an instinctive knowledge of the errors,
                  accidents, and delays which have brought about this sad event,—she becomes
                  absorbed in their cares, as she loses sight of her own trouble.
               All ready for the market, they are chained together in pairs, men and women, as if the wrongs they bore
                  had made them untrustworthy.
               Romescos, ever employed in his favourite trade, is busily engaged chaining
                  up—assorting the pairs! One by one they quietly submit to the proceeding, until he
                  reaches Harry. That minister-of-the-gospel piece of property thinks,—that is, is
                  foolish enough to think,—his nigger religion a sufficient guarantee against any
                  inert propensity to run away. "Now, good master, save my hands from irons, and my
                  heart from pain. Trust me, let me go unbound; my old Master trust me wid 'is
                  life—"
               "Halloo!" says Romescos, quickly interrupting, and beginning to bristle with rage;
                  "preach about old Master here you'll get the tinglers, I reckon. Put 'em on—not a
                  grunt—or you'll get thirty more—yes, a collar on yer neck." Holding a heavy stick
                  over the poor victim's head, for several minutes with one hand, he rubs the other,
                  clenched, several times across his nose. Graspum interposes by reminding the
                  minister that it is for his interest to be very careful how he makes any reply to
                  white gentlemen.
               "Why, massa, I'ze the minister on de plantation. My old master wouldn't
                  sell—wouldn't do so wid me. Master knows I love God, am honest and peaceable. Why
                  chain the honest? why chain the peaceable? why chain the innocent? They need no
                  fetters, no poisoning shackles. The guilty only fear the hand of retribution,"
                  says Harry, a curl of contempt on his lip. He takes a step backwards as Romescos
                  holds the heavy irons before him.
               "You don't come nigger preacher over this ar' child; 't'ant what's crack'd up to
                  be. I larns niggers to preach different tunes. Don't spoil prime stock for such
                  nonsense—"
               "Master Sheriff will stand answerable for me," interrupts Harry, turning to that
                  honourable functionary, and claiming his protection. That gentleman says it is
                  rather out of his line to interfere.
               "Not a preacher trick, I say again—Romescos evinces signs of increasing temper—ya'
                  black theologin. Preachers can't put on such dignity when they'r property."
                  Preachers of colour must be doubly humbled: they must be humble before God,
                  humbled before King Cotton, humbled before the king dealer, who will sell them for
                  their dollars' worth. Harry must do the bidding of his king master; his monkey
                  tricks won't shine with such a philosopher as Romescos. The man of bones, blood,
                  and flesh, can tell him to sell a nigger preacher to his brother of the ministry,
                  and make it very profitable. He assures Harry, while holding the shackles in his
                  hands, that he may put on just as much of the preacher as he can get, when he gets
                  to the shambles, and hears the fives and tens bidding on his black hide.
               Harry must submit; he does it with pain and reluctance. He is chained to his
                  wife—a favour suggested by the sheriff—with whom he can walk the streets of a free
                  country,—but they must be bound in freedom's iron fellowship. The iron shackle
                  clasps his wrist; the lock ticks as Romescos turns the key: it vibrates to his
                  very heart. With a sigh he says, "Ours is a life of sorrow, streaming its dark way
                  along a dangerous path. It will ebb into the bright and beautiful of heaven; that
                  heaven wherein we put our trust—where our hopes are strengthened. O! come the day
                  when we shall be borne to the realms of joy—joy celestial! There no unholy shade
                  of birth—unholy only to man—shall doom us; the colour of our skin will not there
                  be our misfortune—"
               "What!" quickly interrupts Romescos, "what's that?" The property minister, thus
                  circumstanced, must not show belligerent feelings. Romescos simply, but very
                  skilfully, draws his club; measures him an unamiable blow on the head, fells him
                  to the ground. The poor wretch struggles a few moments, raises his manacled hands
                  to his face as his wife falls weeping upon his shuddering body. She supplicates
                  mercy at the hands of the ruffian—the ruffian torturer. "Quietly, mas'r; my man
                  'ill go wid me," says the woman, interposing her hand to prevent a second
                  blow.
               Harry opens his eyes imploringly, casts a look of pity upon the man standing over
                  him. Romescos is in the attitude of dealing him another blow. The wretch stays his
                  hand. "Do with me as you please, master; you are over me. My hope will be my
                  protector when your pleasure will have its reward."
               A second thought has struck Romescos; the nigger isn't so bad, after all. "Well,
                  reckon how nobody won't have no objection to ya'r thinking just as ya'v mind to;
                  but ya' can't talk ya'r own way, nor
                  ya' can't have ya'r own way with this child. A nigger what puts on parson airs—if
                  it is a progressive age nigger—musn't put on fast notions to a white gentleman of
                  my standing! If he does, we just take 'em out on him by the process of a small
                  quantity of first-rate knockin down," says Romescos, amiably lending him a hand to
                  get up. Graspum and the honourable sheriff are measuredly pacing up and down the
                  yard, talking over affairs of state, and the singular purity of their own southern
                  democracy—that democracy which will surely elect the next President. Stepping
                  aside in one of his sallies, Graspum, in a half whisper, reminds Romescos that,
                  now the nigger has shown symptoms of disobedience, he had better prove the safety
                  of the shackles. "Right! right! all right!" the man of chains responds; he had
                  forgot this very necessary piece of amusement. He places both hands upon the
                  shackles; grasps them firmly; places his left foot against Harry's stomach; and
                  then, uttering a fierce imprecation, makes his victim pull with might and main
                  while he braces against him with full power. The victim, groaning under the pain,
                  begs for mercy. Mercy was not made for him. Freedom and mercy, in this our land of
                  greatness, have been betrayed.
               Harry, made willing property, is now placed by the side of his wife, as four small
                  children—the youngest not more than two years old—cling at the skirts of her gown.
                  The children are scarcely old enough to chain; their strong affections for poor
                  chained mother and father are quite enough to guarantee against their running
                  away. Romescos, in his ample kindness, will allow them to toddle their way to
                  market. They are not dangerous property;—they have their feelings, and will go to
                  market to be sold, without running away.
               The gang is ready. The gaoler, nearly out of breath, congratulates himself upon
                  the manner of dispatching business at his establishment. Romescos will put them
                  through a few evolutions before marching in the street; so, placing himself at
                  their right, and the gaoler at their left flank, they are made to march and
                  counter-march several times round the yard. This done, the generous gaoler invites
                  the gentlemen into his office: he has a good glass of whiskey waiting their
                  superior tastes.
               The ward gates are opened; the great gate is withdrawn; the property, linked in
                  iron fellowship,—the gentlemen having taken their whiskey,—are all ready for the
                  word, march! This significant admonition the sheriff gives, and the property sets
                  off in solemn procession, like wanderers bound on a pilgrimage. Tramp, tramp,
                  tramp, their footsteps fall in dull tones as they sally forth, in broken file,
                  through the long aisles. Romescos is in high glee,—his feelings bound with
                  exultation, he marches along, twirling a stick over his head. They are soon in the
                  street, where he invites them to strike up a lively song—"Jim crack corn, and I
                  don't care, fo'h Mas'r's gone away!" he shouts; and several strike up, the rest
                  joining in the old plantation chorus—"Away! away! away! Mas'r's gone away." Thus,
                  with jingling chorus and seemingly joyous hearts, they march down to the
                  man-market. The two children, Annette and Nicholas, trail behind, in charge of the
                  sheriff, whose better feelings seem to be troubling him very much. Every now and
                  then, as they walk by his side, he casts a serious look at Annette, as if
                  conscience, speaking in deep pulsations, said it wasn't just right to sell such an
                  interesting little creature. Onward they marched, his head and heart warring the
                  while. "There's something about it that does'nt seem to come just right in a
                  fellow's feelins," keeps working itself in his mind, until at length he mutters
                  the words. It is the natural will to do good, struggling against the privileges
                  which a government gives ungovernable men to do wrong.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER 
                     XVIII.
                     XX.
                  
               
               LET US FOLLOW POOR HUMAN NATURE TO THE MAN SHAMBLES.
               GENTLEMEN dealers in want of human property,—planters in want of a few prime
                  people,—brokers who have large transactions in such articles,—and factors who,
                  being rather sensitive of their dignity, give to others the negotiation of their
                  business,—are assembled in and around the mart, a covered shed, somewhat
                  resembling those used by railroad companies for the storing of coarse merchandise.
                  Marston's negroes are to be sold. Suspicious circumstances are connected with his
                  sudden decline: rumour has sounded her seven-tongued symbols upon it, and loud are
                  the speculations. The cholera has made mighty ravages; but the cholera could not
                  have done all. Graspum has grasped the plantation, quietly and adroitly, but he
                  has not raised the veil of mystery that hangs over the process. There must be long
                  explanations before the obdurate creditors are satisfied.
               The irons have been removed from the property, who are crouched round the stand—an
                  elevated platform—in a forlorn group, where sundry customers can scrutinize their
                  proportions. Being little or no fancy among it, the fast young gentlemen of the
                  town, finding nothing worthy their attention and taste, make a few cursory
                  observations, and slowly swagger out of the ring. The children are wonderfully
                  attractive and promising; they are generally admired by the customers, who view
                  them with suspicious glances. Annette's clean white skin and fine features are
                  remarkably promising,—much valued as articles of merchandise,—and will, in time,
                  pay good interest. Her youth, however, saves her from present sacrifice,—it
                  thwarts that spirited competition which older property of the same quality
                  produces when about to be knocked down under the hammer of freedom.
               It is a great day, a day of tribulation, with the once happy people of Marston's
                  plantation. No prayer is offered up for them, their souls being only embodied in
                  their market value. Prayers are not known at the man shambles, though the hammer
                  of the vender seals with death the lives of many. No gentleman in modest black
                  cares aught for such death. The dealer will not pay the service fee! Good master
                  is no longer their protector; his familiar face, so buoyant with joy and
                  affection, has passed from them. No more will that strong attachment manifest
                  itself in their greetings. Fathers will be fathers no longer—it is unlawful.
                  Mothers cannot longer clasp their children in their arms with warm affections.
                  Children will no longer cling around their mothers,—no longer fondle in that bosom
                  where once they toyed and joyed.
               The articles murmur among themselves, cast longing glances at each other, meet the
                  gaze of their purchasers, with pain and distrust brooding over their countenances.
                  They would seem to trace the character—cruel or gentle—of each in his look.
               Was it that God ordained one man thus to doom another? No! the very thought
                  repulsed the plea. He never made one man's life to be sorrow and fear—to be the
                  basest object, upon which blighting strife for gold fills the passions of tyrants.
                  He never made man to be a dealer in his own kind. He never made man after his own
                  image to imprecate the wrath of heaven by blackening earth with his foul deeds. He
                  never made man to blacken this fair portion of earth with storms of contention,
                  nor to overthrow the principles that gave it greatness. He never made man to fill
                  the cup that makes the grim oppressor fierce in his triumphs over right.
               Come reader—come with us: let us look around the pale of these common man
                  shambles. Here a venerable father sits, a bale of merchandise, moved with the
                  quick pulsation of human senses. He looks around him as the storm of resentment
                  seems ready to burst forth: his wrinkled brow and haggard face in vain ask for
                  sympathy. A little further on, and a mother leans over her child,—tremblingly
                  draws it to her side; presses it nearer and nearer to her bosom. Near her, feeding
                  a child with crumbs of bread, is a coarse negro, whose rough exterior covers a
                  good heart. He gives a glance of hate and scorn at those who are soon to tear from
                  him his nearest and dearest. A gloomy ring of sullen faces encircle us: hope,
                  fear, and contempt are pictured in each countenance. Anxious to know its doom, the
                     pent-up soul burns madly within
                  their breasts; no tears can quench the fire—freedom only can extinguish it. But,
                  what are such things? mere trifles when the soul loves only gold. What are they to
                  men who buy such human trifles? who buy and sell mankind, with feelings as unmoved
                  as the virgin heart that knows no guilt?
               Various are the remarks made by those who are taking a cursory view of the people;
                  very learned in nigger nature are many; their sayings evince great profoundness. A
                  question seems to be the separating of wenches from their young 'uns. This is soon
                  settled. Graspum, who has made his appearance, and is very quaintly and slowly
                  making his apprehensions known, informs the doubting spectators that Romescos,
                  being well skilled, will do that little affair right up for a mere trifle. It
                  takes him to bring the nonsense out of nigger wenches. This statement being quite
                  satisfactory, the gentlemen purchasers are at rest on that point.
               The hour of sale has arrived,—the crier rings his bell, the purchasers crowd up to
                  the stand, the motley group of negroes take the alarm, and seem inclined to close
                  in towards a centre as the vender mounts the stand. The bell, with the sharp
                  clanking sound, rings their funeral knell; they startle, as with terror; they
                  listen with subdued anxiety; they wait the result in painful suspense. How little
                  we would recognise the picture from abroad. The vender, an amiable gentleman
                  dressed in modest black, and whose cheerful countenance, graced with the blandest
                  smile, betokens the antipodes of his inhuman traffic, holding his hat in his left
                  hand, and a long paper in his right, makes an obsequious bow to those who have
                  honoured him with their company. He views them for a few moments, smiles, casts
                  his eye over the paper again,—it sets forth age and quality—and then at his
                  marketable people. The invoice is complete; the goods correspond exactly. The
                  texture and quality have been appraised by good judges. Being specified, he
                  commences reading the summons and writs, and concludes with other preliminaries of
                  the sale.
               "Now, gentlemen," says Mr. Forshou—for such is his name—as he adjusts his hat,
                  lays the document on the desk at his right hand, pulls up the point of his
                  shirt-collar, sets his neatly-trimmed whiskers a point forward, and smooths his
                  well-oiled hair: "We-will-proceed-with -the-sale-of this lot of negroes, according
                  to the directions of the sheriff of the county. And if no restrictions are
                  imposed, gentlemen can make their selection of old or young to suit their choice
                  or necessities! Gentlemen, however, will be expected to pay for separating." Mr.
                  Forshou, by way of interpolation, reminds his friends that, seeing many of his
                  very best customers present, he expects sharp and healthy bids. He will further
                  remind them (smiling and fretting his hands, as if to show the number of diamond
                  rings he can afford to wear), that the property has been well raised, is well
                  known, and ranges from the brightest and most interesting, to the commonest black
                  field hand. "Yes, gentlemen," he adds, "by the fortune of this unfortunate sale we
                  can accommodate you with anything in the line of negro property. We can sell you a
                  Church and a preacher—a dance-house and a fiddler—a cook and an oyster-shop.
                  Anything! All sold for no fault; and warranted as sound as a roach. The honourable
                  sheriff will gives titles—that functionary being present signifies his
                  willingness—and every man purchasing is expected to have his shiners ready, so
                  that he can plunk down cash in ten days. I need not recount the circumstances
                  under which this property is offered for sale; it is enough to say that it is
                  offered; but, let me say, gentlemen, to enlarge upon it would be painful to my
                  feelings. I will merely read the schedule, and, after selling the people, put up
                  the oxen, mules, and farming utensils." Mr. Forshou, with easy contentment, takes
                  up the list and reads at the top of his voice. The names of heads of families are
                  announced one by one; they answer the call promptly. He continues till he reaches
                  Annette and Nicholas, and here he pauses for a few moments, turning from the paper
                  to them, as if he one minute saw them on the paper and the next on the floor.
                  "Here, gentlemen," he ejaculates, in a half guttural voice—something he could not
                  account for touched his conscience at the moment—holding the paper nearer his
                  eye-glass, "there is two bits of property bordering on the sublime. It
                  dazzles—seems almost too interesting to sell. It makes a feller's heart feel as if
                  it warn't stuck in the right place." Mr. Forshou casts another irresistible look
                  at the children; his countenance changes; he says he is very sensitive, and shows
                  it in his blushes. He might have saved
                  his blushes for the benefit of the State. The State is careful of its blushes; it
                  has none to sell—none to bestow on a child's sorrow!
               Annette returns his somewhat touching manifestation of remorse with a childlike
                  smile.
               "Well! I reckon how folks is gettin' tenderish, now a' days. Who'd thought the
                  major had such touchy kind a' feelins? Anything wrong just about yer goggler?"
                  interrupts Romescos, giving the vender a quizzical look, and a "half-way wink."
                  Then, setting his slouch hat on an extra poise, he contorts his face into a dozen
                  grimaces. "Keep conscience down, and strike up trade," he says, very coolly,
                  drawing a large piece of tobacco from his breast-pocket and filling his mouth to
                  its utmost capacity.
               "Feelings are over all things," responds the sheriff, who stands by, and will
                  speak for the vender, who is less accustomed to speaking for himself. "Feelings
                  bring up recollections of things one never thought of before,—of the happiest days
                  of our happiest home. 'Tain't much, no, nothing at all, to sell regular black and
                  coloured property; but there's a sort of cross-grained mythology about the
                  business when it comes to selling such clear grain as this."
               The vender relieves the honourable sheriff from all further display of sympathy,
                  by saying that he feels the truth of all the honourable and learned gentleman has
                  said, "which has 'most made the inward virtue of his heart come right up." He
                  leans over the desk, extends his hand, helps himself to a generous piece of
                  Romescos' tobacco.
               Romescos rejoins in a subdued voice—"He thinks a man what loves dimes like the
                  major cannot be modest in nigger business, because modesty ain't trade commodity.
                  It cannot be; the man who thinks of such nonsense should sell out—should go north
                  and join the humane society. Folks are all saints, he feels sure, down north
                  yander; wouldn't sell nigger property;—they only send south right smart preachers
                  to keep up the dignity of the institution; to do the peculiar religion of the very
                  peculiar institution. No objection to that; nor hain't no objection to their
                  feelin' bad about the poor niggers, so long as they like our cash and take our
                  cotton. That's where the pin's drove in; while it hangs they wouldn't be bad
                  friends with us for the world."
               "You may, Mr. Romescos, suspend your remarks," says the vender, looking indignant,
                  as he thrusts his right hand into his bosom, and attempts a word of
                  introduction.
               Romescos must have his last word; he never says die while he has a word at hand.
                  "The major's love must be credited, gentlemen; he's a modest auctioneer,—a
                  gentleman what don't feel just right when white property's for sale," he whispers,
                  sarcastically.
               Another pause, then a hearty laughing, and the man commences to sell his people.
                  He has uttered but a few words, when Marston's attorney, stepping into the centre
                  of the ring, and near the vender, draws a paper from his pocket, and commences
                  reading in a loud tone. It is a copy of the notice he had previously served on the
                  sheriff, setting forth in legal phraseology the freedom of the children, "And
                  therfo'h this is t' stay proceedings until further orders from the honourable
                  Court of Common Pleas," is audible at the conclusion. The company are not much
                  surprised. There is not much to be surprised at, when slave law and common law
                  come in contact. With Marston's sudden decline and unfathomable connection with
                  Graspum, there is nothing left to make the reading of the notice interesting.
               "You hear this, gentlemen?" says the vender, biting his lips: "the sale of this
                  very interesting portion of this very interesting property is objected to by the
                  attorney for the defendant at law. They must, therefore, be remanded to the
                  custody of the sheriff, to await the decision of court." That court of strange
                  judgments! The sheriff, that wonderful medium of slaveocratic power, comes
                  forward, muttering a word of consolation; he will take them away. He passes them
                  over to an attendant, who conducts them to their dark chilly cells.
               "All right!" says Graspum, moving aside to let the children pass out. "No more
                  than might have been expected; it's no use, though. Marston will settle that
                  little affair in a very quiet way." He gives the man-vender a look of approval;
                  the very celebrated Mr. Graspum has self-confidence enough for "six folks what
                  don't deal in niggers." A bystander touching him on the arm, he gives his head a
                  cunning shake, crooks his finger on his red nose. "Just a thing of that kind," he
                  whispers, making some very delicate
                  legal gesticulations with the fore-finger of his right hand in the palm of his
                  left; then, with great gravity, he discusses some very nice points of nigger law.
                  He is heard to say it will only be a waste of time, and make some profitable
                  rascality for the lawyers. He could have settled the whole on't in seven minutes.
                  "Better give them up honourably, and let them be sold with the rest. Property's
                  property all over the world; and we must abide by the laws, or what's the good of
                  the constitution? To feel bad about one's own folly! The idea of taking advantage
                  of it at this late hour won't hold good in law. How contemptibly silly! men
                  feeling fatherly after they have made property of their own children! Poor,
                  conscientious fools, how they whine at times, never thinking how they would let
                  their womanish feelings cheat their creditors. There's no honour in that."
               "Gentlemen!" interrupts the vender, "we have had enough discussion, moral, legal,
                  and otherwise. We will now have some selling."
               The honourable sheriff desires to say a word or two upon points not yet advanced.
                  "The sheriff! the sheriff!" is exclaimed by several voices. He speaks, having
                  first adjusted his spectacles, and relieved himself of three troublesome coughs.
                  "The institution—I mean, gentlemen, the peculiar institution—must be preserved; we
                  cannot, must not, violate statutes to accommodate good-feeling people. My friend
                  Graspum is right, bob and sinker; we'd get ourselves into an everlasting snarl, if
                  we did. I am done!" The sheriff withdraws his spectacles, places them very
                  carefully in a little case, wipes his mouth modestly, and walks away humming an
                  air.
               "Now, gentlemen," says the vender, bristling with renewed animation "seeing how
                  you've all recovered from a small shock of conscience, we will commence the
                  sale."
               Aunt Rachel is now placed upon the stand. Her huge person, cleanly
                  appearance—Auntie has got her bandana tied with exquisite knot—and very motherly
                  countenance excite general admiration, as on an elevated stand she looms up before
                  her audience. Mr. Forshou, the very gentlemanly vender, taking up the paper,
                  proceeds to describe Aunt Rachel's qualities, according to the style and manner of
                  a celebrated race-horse. Auntie doesn't like this,—her dignity is touched; she
                  honours him with an angry frown. Then she appeals to the amiable gentleman; "come,
                  mas'r, sell 'um quick; don' hab no nonsense wid dis child! Sell 'um to some mas'r
                  what make I housekeeper. Old mas'r,—good old Boss,—know I fus' rate at dat. Let
                  'um done gone, mas'r, fo'h soon." Rachel is decidedly opposed to long drawn-out
                  humbuggery.
               The bids now commence; Rachel, in mute anxiety, tremblingly watches the lips they
                  fall from.
               "Give you a first best title to this ar' old critter, gentlemen!" says the vender,
                  affecting much dignity, as he holds up his baton of the trade in flesh. Anybody
                  wanting a good old mother on a plantation where little niggers are raised will
                  find the thing in the old institution before you. The value is not so much in the
                  size of her, as in her glorious disposition." Aunt Rachel makes three or four
                  turns, like a peacock on a pedestal, to amuse her admirers. Again, Mr. Wormlock
                  intimates, in a tone that the vender may hear, that she has some grit, for he sees
                  it in her demeanour, which is assuming the tragic. Her eyes, as she turns, rest
                  upon the crispy face of Romescos. She views him for a few moments—she fears he
                  will become her purchaser. Her lip curls with contempt, as she turns from his gaze
                  and recognises an old acquaintance, whom she at once singles out, accosts and
                  invites beseechingly to be her purchaser, "to save her from dat man!" She points
                  to Romescos.
               Her friend shakes his head unwillingly. Fearing he may become an object of
                  derision, he will not come forward. Poor old slave! faithful from her childhood
                  up, she has reached an age where few find it profitable to listen to her
                  supplications. The black veil of slavery has shut out the past good of her
                  life,—all her faithfulness has gone for nothing; she has passed into that channel
                  where only the man-dealer seeks her for the few dollars worth of labour left in a
                  once powerful body. Oh! valuable remnant of a life, how soon it may be
                  exhausted—forgotten!
               Bidders have some doubts about the amount of labour she can yet perform; and,
                  after much manifest hesitancy, she is knocked down to Romescos for the sum of two
                  hundred and seventy dollars. "There! 'tain't a bad price for ye, nohow!" says the
                  vender, laconically. "Get down, old
                  woman." Rachel moves to the steps, and is received by Romescos, who, taking his
                  purchase by the arm, very mechanically sets it on one side. "Come, Auntie, we'll
                  make a corn-cracker a' you, until such time as we can put yer old bones in trim to
                  send south. Generousness, ye see, made me gin more nor ye war' worth—not much work
                  in ye when ye take it on the square;—but a feller what understands the trimmin' a'
                  niggers like I can do ye up young, and put an honest face on while he's cheatin'
                  some green chap with yer old bones." Romescos, very clever in his profession, is
                  not quite sure that his newly-purchased property will "stay put." He turns about
                  suddenly, approaches Rachel—crouched in a corner—mumbling over some
                  incomprehensible jargon, evidently very much disturbed in her feelings, saying, "I
                  kind a' think I see devil in yer eye, old woman." Rachel turns her head aside, but
                  makes no answer. Mr. Romescos will make everything certain; so, drawing a cord,
                  similar to a small sized clothes line, from his pocket, she holds up her hands at
                  his bidding: he winds it several times round her wrists, then ties it securely.
                  "The property's all safe now," he whispers, and returns to attend the bidding
                  arrangements.
               One by one—mothers, fathers, and single property, old and young, as may be—are put
                  upon the stand; sold for the various uses of manifest democracy. Harry,—the
                  thinking property, whose sense-keeping has betrayed the philosophy of profound
                  democracy,—is a preacher, and, by the value of his theological capacity, attracts
                  more than ordinary attention. But his life has been a failure,—a mere experiment
                  in divinity struggling with the sensitive power of model democracy. He now seems
                  impatient to know that doom to which the freedom of an enlightened age has
                  consigned him. One minute some cheering hope of his getting a good master presents
                  itself in a familiar face; then it turns away, and with it vanishes his hope.
                  Another comes forward, but it is merely to view his fine proportions.
               Harry has feelings, and is strongly inclined to cling to the opinion that those
                  who know his character and talents, will be inclined to purchase. Will they save
                  him from the cruelties of ordinary plantation life?
               "Now for the preacher!"—Mr. Forshou touches his hat, politely. "Gentlemen
                  purchasing, and wanting a church can be accommodated with that article to-morrow.
                  Come, boy, mount up here!" The preaching article draws his steps reluctantly, gets
                  up, and there stands,—a black divine: anybody may look at him, anybody may examine
                  him, anybody may kick him; anybody may buy him, body, soul, and theology. How
                  pleasing, how charmingly liberal, is the democracy that grants the sweet privilege
                  of doing all these things! Harry has a few simple requests to make, which his
                  black sense might have told him the democracy could not grant. He requests
                  (referring to his position as a minister of the gospel) that good master—the
                  vender—will sell him with his poor old woman, and that he do not separate him from
                  his dear children. In support of his appeal he sets forth, in language that would
                  be impressive were it from white lips, that he wants to teach his little ones in
                  the ways of the Lord. "Do, mas'r! try sell us so we live together, where my heart
                  can feel and my eyes see my children," he concludes, pointing to his children
                  (living emblems of an oppressed race), who, with his hapless wife, are brought
                  forward and placed on the stand at his feet. Harry (the vender pausing a moment)
                  reaches out his hand (that hand so feared and yet so harmless), and affectionately
                  places it on the head of his youngest child; then, taking it up, he places it in
                  the arms of his wife,—perhaps not long to be so,—who stands trembling and sobbing
                  at his side. Behold how picturesque is the fruit of democracy! Three small
                  children, clinging round the skirts of a mother's garment, casting sly peeps at
                  purchasers as if they had an instinctive knowledge of their fate. They must be
                  sold for the satisfaction of sundry debts held by sundry democratic creditors. How
                  we affect to scorn the tyranny of Russia, because of her serfdom! Would to God
                  there were truth and virtue in the scorn!
               Mr. Forshou, the very sensitive and gentlemanly vender—he has dropped the title of
                  honourable, which was given him on account of his having been a member of the
                  State Senate—takes Harry by the right hand, and leads him round, where, at the
                  front of the tribune, customers may have a much better opportunity of seeing for
                  themselves.
               "Yes! he's a swell—a right good fellow." Mr. Forshou turns to his schedule,
                  glancing his eye up and down. "I see; it's put down here in the invoice: a
                     minister—warranted sound in every
                  respect. It does seem to me, gentlemen, that here 's a right smart chance for a
                  planter who 'tends to the pious of his niggers, giving them a little preaching
                  once in a while. Now, let the generous move; shake your dimes; let us turn a
                  point, and see what can be done in the way of selling the lot,—preacher, wife, and
                  family. The boy, Harry, is a preacher by nature; has by some unknown process
                  tumbled into the profession. He's a methodist, I reckon! But there's choice field
                  property in him; and his wife, one of the primest wenches in the gang, never says
                  die when there's plenty of cotton to pick. As for the young uns, they are pure
                  stock. You must remember, gentlemen, preachers are not in the market every day;
                  and when one's to be got that'll preach the right stripe, there's no knowing the
                  value of him—"
               "We don't want so much of this," interrupts a voice in the crowd.
               "Rather anxious to buy the feller," Mr. Forshou replies, affecting much
                  indifference. He will say a few words more. "Think the matter over, upon strict
                  principles of political economy, and you'll find, gentlemen, he's just the article
                  for big planters. I am happy to see the calm and serene faces of three of my
                  friends of the clergy present; will they not take an interest for a fellow-worker
                  in a righteous cause?" The vender smiles, seems inclined to jocularity, to which
                  the gentlemen in black are unwilling to submit. They have not been moving among
                  dealers, and examining a piece of property here and there, with any sinecure
                  motive. They view the vender's remarks as exceedingly offensive, return a look of
                  indignation, and slowly, as if with wounded piety, walk away. The gentlemen in
                  black are most sensitive when any comparison is made between them and a black
                  brother. How 
                     horible
                     horrible
                   shocked they seem, as, with white neckerchiefs so modest, they look back
                  as they merge from the mart into the street!
               It is a question whether these sensitive divines were shocked at the affectation
                  and cold indifference manifested by legitimate dealers, or at the vender's very
                  impertinent remarks. We will not charge aught against our brethren of the clergy:
                  no, we will leave the question open to the reader. We love them as good men who
                  might labour for a better cause; we will leave them valiant defenders of southern
                  chivalry, southern generosity, southern affability, and southern injustice. To be
                  offended at so small an affair as selling a brother clergyman,—to make the
                  insinuation that they are not humane, cause of insult,—is, indeed, the very
                  essence of absurdity.
               The vender makes a few side-motions with his thumbs, winks to several of his
                  customers, and gives a significant nod, as the gentlemen in black pass out of the
                  insulting establishment. "Well, gentlemen, I'm sorry if I've offended anybody; but
                  there's a deep-rooted principle in what I've said, nor do I think it christian for
                  the clergy to clear out in that shape. However, God bless 'em; let 'em go on their
                  way rejoicing. Here's the boy—he turns and puts his hand kindly on Harry's
                  shoulder—and his wench, and his young uns,—a minister and family, put down in the
                  invoice as genuine prime. Our worthy sheriff's a good judge of deacons—the
                  sheriff—high functionary—acknowledges the compliment by respectfully nodding—and
                  my opinion is that the boy'll make a good bishop yet: he only wants an apron and a
                  fair showing." He touches Harry under the chin, laughing heartily the while.
               "Yes, master," replies Harry—he has little of the negro accent—quieting his
                  feelings; "what I larn is all from the Bible, while master slept. Sell my old
                  woman and little ones with me; my heart is in their welfare—"
               "Don't trifle with the poor fellow's feelings; put him up and sell him to the best
                  advantage. There's nobody here that wants a preacher and family. It's only
                  depreciating the value of the property to sell it in the lot," says Graspum, in a
                  firm voice. He has been standing as unmoved as a stoic, seeing nothing but
                  property in the wretch of a clergyman, whose natural affections, pictured in his
                  imploring looks, might have touched some tender chord of his feelings.
               After several attempts, it is found impossible to sell the minister and his family
                  in one lot. Hence, by the force of necessity, his agonising beseechings pouring
                  forth, he is put up like other single bales of merchandise, and sold to Mr.
                  M'Fadden, of A—— district. The minister brought eleven hundred dollars, ready
                  money down! The purchaser is a well-known planter; he has worked his way up in the
                  world, is a rigid disciplinarian, measuring the square inches of labour in his property, and adapting the best
                  process of bringing it all out.
               "He's all I want," says M'Fadden, making a move outward, and edging his way
                  through the crowd.
               "A moment with my poor old woman, master, if you please?" says Harry, turning
                  round to his wife.
               "None of your black humbugging; there's wives enough on my place, and a parson can
                  have his choice out of fifty," returns M'Fadden, dragging him along by the arm.
                  The scene that here ensues is harrowing in the extreme. The cries and sobs of
                  children,—the solicitude and affection of his poor wife, as she throws her arms
                  about her husband's neck,—his falling tears of sorrow, as one by one he snatches
                  up his children and kisses them,—are painfully touching. It is the purest,
                  simplest, holiest of love, gushing forth from nature's fountain. It were well if
                  we could but cherish its heavenly worth. That woman, the degraded of a despised
                  race, her arms round a fond husband's neck, struggling with death-like grasp, and
                  imploring them not to take him from her. The men who have made him
                  merchandise,—who have trodden his race in the dust,—look on unmoved as the
                  unfeeling purchaser drags him from the embrace of all that is near and dear to him
                  on earth. Here, in this boasted freest country the sun shines on—where freedom was
                  bequeathed by our brave forefathers,—where the complex tyranny of an old world was
                  overthrown,—such scenes violate no law. When will the glorious, the happy day of
                  their death come? When shall the land be free?
               M'Fadden, having paid the price of his clergyman, drags him to the door. "Once
                  more, master," mutters the victim, looking back with fear and hope pictured on his
                  imploring face. M'Fadden has no patience with such useless implorings, and orders
                  him to move along. "I will see them once more!" the man exclaims, "I will! Good
                  bye! may Heaven bless you on earth, my little ones!—God will protect us when we
                  meet again!" The tears course down his cheeks.
               "None of that ar' kind of nonsense! Shut down yer tear-trap," says M'Fadden,
                  calling an attendant, and, drawing a pair of irons from his pocket, placing them
                  about Harry's hands. Mr. M'Fadden's property shows signs of being somewhat
                  belligerent: to obviate any further nonsense, and to make short work of the thing,
                  Mr. M'Fadden calls in aid, throws his property on the ground, ties its legs with a
                  piece of rope, places it upon a drag, and orders it to be conveyed to the depot,
                  from whence it will be despatched by rail for a new home.
               This little ceremony over, the wife and children (Romescos and M'Fadden, not very
                  good friends, were competitors for the preacher property) are put up and sold to
                  Romescos. That skilful and very adroit gentleman is engaged to do the exciting
                  business of separating, which he is progressing with very coolly and cleverly. The
                  whole scene closes with selling the animal property and farming utensils. Happy
                  Christian brothers are they who would spread the wings of their Christianity over
                  such scenes!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER 
                     XX.
                     XXI.
                  
               
               A FATHER'S TRIALS.
               IF modern Christianity, as improved in our southern world—we mean our world of
                  slavery—had blushes, it might improve the use of them were we to recount in detail
                  the many painful incidents which the improved and very christianly process of
                  separating husbands from wives, parents from children, brothers from sisters, and
                  friends from all the ties and associations the heart, gives birth to. Negroes have
                  tender sympathies, strong loves. Reader, we will save your feelings,-we will not
                  recount them; our aim is not to excite undue feeling, but to relate every-day
                  scenes.
               Days and weeks pass on drearily with Marston. Unhappy, forlorn, driven to the last
                  extremity by obdurate creditors, he waits the tardy process of the law. He seldom
                  appears in public; for those who professed to be his best friends have become his
                  coldest acquaintances. But he has two friends left,—friends whose pure friendship
                  is like sweetest dew-drops: they are Franconia and Daddy Bob. The rusty old
                  servant is faithful, full of benevolence, gratitude, and unshaken fidelity; the
                  other is the generous woman, in whose bosom beat the tender impulses of a noble
                  soul. Those impulses have been moved to action in defence of the innocent; they
                  never can be defeated. Bob is poor, abject, and old with toil. He cares not to be
                  free,—he wants mas'r free. But there yet remains some value in Bob; and he has
                  secreted himself, in hopes of escaping the man-dealer, and sharing his earnings in
                  the support of old mas'r. Franconia is differently situated; yet she can only take
                  advantage of circumstances which yet depend upon the caprice of a subtle-minded
                  husband. Over both these friends of the unfortunate, slavery has stretched its
                  giant arms, confusing the social system, uprooting the integrity of men, weakening
                  respect for law, violating the best precepts of nature, substituting passion for
                  principle, confounding reason, and enslaving public opinion.
               Under the above disorganising state of the social compact, the children, known to
                  be Marston's, are pursued as property belonging to the bankrupt estate. When the
                  law has made it such, it must be sold in satisfaction of Marston's debts.
               Seven months have passed since they were shut up in a felon's cell. They have been
                  visited by Marston; he has been kind to them,—kind as a father could be under such
                  circumstances. Franconia has not forgotten them: she sends many little things to
                  lighten the gloom of their confinement; but society closes her lips, and will
                  frown upon any disclosure she may make of their parentage. Were she to disclose it
                  to Colonel M'Carstrow, the effect would be doubtful: it might add to the
                  suspicious circumstances already excited against her unfortunate uncle. The
                  paramount question—whether they are hereafter to be chattel slaves, or human
                  beings with inalienable rights—must be submitted to the decision of a judicial
                  tribunal. It is by no means an uncommon case, but very full of interest. It will
                  merely be interesting—not as involving any new question of law, nor presenting new
                  phases of southern jurisprudence—in showing what very notorious dealers in human
                  kind, and lawyers of great legal ability, can morally and legally perform. It will
                  show how great men figure in the arena of legal degradation, how they unravel the
                  mystery of slave power.
               Graspum, professedly uninterested, has purchased the claims, and will pursue the
                  payment in the name of the original plaintiffs. With Romescos's cunning aid, of
                  course the trial will be a perfect farce, the only exception being that the very
                  profound Mr. Graspum will exhibit a degree of great sincerity on his part.
               The sessions are sitting; the day for the trial of this important case has
                  arrived; the little dingy court-room is early crowded to excess, but there is not
                  much expression of anxiety. Men speak lightly of the issue, as if some simple game
                  were to be played. The judge, a grave-looking gentleman of no ordinary mien, in
                  whose full countenance sternness is predominant in the well-displayed estimation
                  in which he holds his important self, walks measuredly into court—the lacqueys of
                  the law crying "Court! court!" to which he bows—and takes his seat upon an
                  elevated tribune. There is great solemnity preserved at the opening: the sheriff, with well-ordained costume and
                  sword, sits at his honour's left, his deputy on the right, and the very honourable
                  clerk of the court just below, where there can be no impediment during the process
                  of feeding "the Court" on very legal points of "nigger law." In truth, the
                  solemnity of this court, to those unacquainted with the tenor of legal proceedings
                  at the south, might have been misconstrued for something more in keeping with
                  justice.
               The legal gentlemen, most modest of face, are seated round the bar—a semicircular
                  railing dividing their dignity from the common spectator—waiting the reading of
                  the docket. The clerk takes his time about that, and seems a great favourite with
                  the spectators, who applaud his rising. He reads, the sheriff crying "order!
                  order!" while the judge learnedly examines his notes. Some consultation takes
                  place between several of the attorneys, which is interlarded with remarks from the
                  judge, who, with seeming satisfaction to all parties, orders the case of B. C. R.
                  K. Marston's writ of replevin to be called and proceeded with. "As there are three
                     fi fas," says the junior attorney for the
                  defendants, a very lean strippling of the law, just working his way up in the
                  world, "I object to the manner of procedure; the case only involves a question of
                  law, and should be submitted to the special decision of the Court. It is not a
                  matter for a jury to decide upon," he concludes. The judge has listened to his
                  remarks, objections, and disclaimers, with marked attention; nevertheless, he is
                  compelled to overrule them, and order the case to proceed. Upon this it is agreed
                  among the attorneys—happy fellows, always ready to agree or disagree—that a
                  decision taken upon one fi fa shall be held as
                  establishing a decision for all the cases at issue.
               The children are now brought into Court, and seated near one of the attorneys.
                  Marston stands, almost motionless, a few steps back, gazing upon them as intently
                  and solicitously as if the issue were life or death. Deacon Rosebrook, his good
                  lady, and Franconia, have been summoned as witnesses, and sit by the side of each
                  other on a bench within the bar. We hear a voice here and there among the crowd of
                  spectators expressing sympathy for the children; others say they are only
                  "niggers," and can't be aught else, if it be proved that Marston bought the
                  mother. And there is Mr. Scranton! He is well seated among the gentlemen of the
                  legal profession, for whom he has a strong fellow feeling. He sits, unmoved, in
                  his wonted moodiness; now and then he gives the children a sly look of
                  commiseration, as if the screws of his feelings were unloosing. They—the little
                  property—look so interesting, so innocent, so worthy of being something more than
                  merchandise in a land of liberty, that Mr. Scranton's heart has become
                  irresistibly softened. It gets a few degrees above Mr. Scranton's constitutional
                  scruples. "Painful affair this! What do you think of it, Mr. Scranton?" enquires a
                  member of the profession, touching his arm.
               "It is the fruit of Marston's weakness, you see!—don't feel just straight, I
                  reckon. Didn't understand the philosophy of the law, neither; and finds himself
                  pinched up by a sort of humanity that won't pass for a legal tender in
                  business—"
               "Ah! we cannot always look into the future," interrupts the attorney.
               Mr. Scranton holds that whatever is constitutional must be right and abidable;
                  that one's feelings never should joggle our better understanding when these little
                  curiosities come in the way. He admits, however, that they are strange attendants
                  coming up once in a while, like the fluctuations of an occult science. With him,
                  the constitution gives an indisputable right to overlook every outrage upon
                  natural law; and, while it exists in full force, though it may strip one half the
                  human race of rights, he has no right to complain so long as it does not interfere
                  with him. It strikes Mr. Scranton that people who differ with him in opinion must
                  have been educated under the teaching of a bad philosophy. Great governments, he
                  holds, often nurture the greatest errors. It matters not how much they feel their
                  magnitude; often, the more they do, the least inclined are they to correct them.
                  Others fear the constitutional structure so much, that they stand trembling lest
                  the slightest correction totter it to the ground. Great governments, too, are most
                  likely to stand on small points when these errors are pointed out. Mr. Scranton
                  declares, with great emphasis, that all these things are most legally true,
                  perfectly natural: they follow in man as well as governments.
               With all due deference to Mr. Scranton's opinion, so much demanded among his
                  admiring neighbours, it must be said
                  that he never could bring his mind to understand the difference between natural
                  philosophy and his own constitutional scruples, and was very apt to commit himself
                  in argument, forgetting that the evil was in the fruits of a bad system, bringing
                  disgrace upon his countrymen, corrupting the moral foundation of society,
                  spreading vice around the domestic fireside, and giving to base-minded men power
                  to speculate in the foulness of their own crimes.
               The case is opened by the attorney for the plaintiff, who makes a great many
                  direct and indirect remarks, and then calls witnesses. "Marco Graspum!" the clerk
                  exclaims. That gentleman comes forward, takes his place, calmly, upon the
                  witnesses' stand. At first he affects to know but little; then suddenly remembers
                  that he has heard Marston call their mothers property. Further, he has heard him,
                  while extolling their qualities, state the purchase to have been made of one
                  Silenus, a trader.
               "He stated—be sure now!—to you, that he purchased them of one Silenus, a trader?"
                  interpolates the judge, raising his glasses, and advancing his ear, with his hand
                  raised at its side.
               Yes, yer honour!" "Please observe this testimony," rejoins the attorney, quickly.
                  He bows; says that is enough. The opposing attorney has no question to put on
                  cross-examination: he knows Graspum too well. Being quite at home with the
                  gentlemen of the legal profession, they know his cool nonchalance never can be
                  shaken upon a point of testimony.
               "Any questions to put?" asks the legal opponent, with an air of indifference.
               "No, nothing," is the reply.
               His brother of special pleas smiles, gives a cunning glance at Graspum, and wipes
                  his face with a very white handkerchief. He is conscious of the character of his
                  man; it saves all further trouble. "When we know who we have to deal with, we know
                  how to deal," he mutters, as he sits down.
               Graspum retires from the stand, and takes his seat among the witnesses. "We will
                  now call Anthony Romescos," says the attorney. A few minutes' pause, and that
                  individual rolls out in all his independence, takes his place on the stand. He
                  goes through a long series of questioning and cross-questioning, answers for which
                  he seems to have well studied.
               The whole amounts to nothing more than a corroboration of Graspum's testimony. He
                  has heard Marston call their mothers property: once, he thinks, but would hesitate
                  before pledging his honour, that Marston offered to him the woman Clotilda. Yes;
                  it was her!
               Considerable excitement is now apparent; the auditory whisper among themselves,
                  attorneys put their heads together, turn and turn over the leaves of their
                  statutes. His honour, the Court, looks wiser still. Marston trembles and turns
                  pale; his soul is pinioned between hope and fear. Romescos has told something more
                  than he knows, and continues, at random, recounting a dozen or more irrelevant
                  things. The court, at length, deems it necessary to stop his voluntary testimony,
                  orders that he only answer such questions as are put to him.
               "There's no harm in a feller tellin' what he knows, eh! judge?" returns Romescos,
                  dropping a quid of tobacco at his side, bowing sarcastically to the judge, and
                  drawing his face into a comical picture.
               Mr. Romescos is told that he can stand aside. At this seemingly acceptable
                  announcement, he bristles his crispy red hair with his fingers, shrugs his
                  shoulders, winks at two or three of the jurymen, pats Graspum on the shoulder as
                  he passes him, and takes his seat.
               "We will close the case here, but reserve the right of introducing further
                  testimony, if necessary," says the learned and very honourable counsel.
               The defence here rises, and states the means by which his client intends to prove
                  the freedom of the children; and concludes by calling over the names of the
                  witnesses. Franconia! Franconia! we hear that name called; it sounds high above
                  the others, and falls upon our ear most mournfully. Franconia, that sweet creature
                  of grace and delicacy, brought into a court where the scales of injustice are made
                  to serve iniquity!
               Franconia's reserve and modesty put legal gentlemen's gallantry to the test. One
                  looks over the pages of his reports, another casts a sly look as she sweeps by to
                  take that place the basest of men has just left. The interested spectators stretch
                  their persons anxiously, to get a look at the two pretty children, honourable and
                  legal gentlemen are straining their ability to reduce to property. There stands the blushing woman, calm and beautiful,
                  a virtuous rebuke to curious spectators, mercenary slave dealers, the very learned
                  gentlemen of the bar, and his enthroned honour, the Court! She will give testimony
                  that makes nature frown at its own degradation. Not far from Franconia sits the
                  very constitutional Mr. Scranton, casting side glances now and then. Our
                  philosopher certainly thinks, though he will not admit it, the chivalry is
                  overtaxing itself; there was no occasion for compelling so fair a creature to come
                  into court, and hear base testimony before a base crowd,—to aid a base law in
                  securing base ends. And then, just think and blush, ye who have blushes to
                  spare.
               "Will the learned gentleman proceed with the examination of this witness?" says
                  his honour, who, pen in hand, has been waiting several minutes to take down her
                  testimony. Court and audience, without knowing why, have come to an unconscious
                  pause.
               "Will the witness state to the court in what relation she stands to the gentleman
                  who defends title freedom of the children,—Mr. Hugh Marston?" says the attorney,
                  addressing his bland words to Franconia, somewhat nervously.
               He—he—he—is my—," she mutters, and stops. Her face turns pale; then suddenly
                  changes to glowing crimson. She rests her left hand on the rail, while the judge,
                  as if suddenly moved by a generous impulse, suggests that the attorney pause a
                  moment, until the deputy provides a chair for the lady. She is quiet again. Calmly
                  and modestly, as her soft, meaning eyes wander over the scene before her,
                  compelled to encounter its piercing gaze, the crystal tears leave their wet
                  courses on her blushing cheeks. Her feelings are too delicate, too sensitive, to
                  withstand the sharp and deadly poison of liberty's framework of
                  black laws. She sees her uncle, so kind, so fond of her and her absent brother;
                  her eye meets his in kindred sympathy, imagination wings its way through
                  recollections of the past, draws forth its pleasures with touching sensations, and
                  fills the cup too full. That cup is the fountain of the soul, from which trouble
                  draws its draughts. She watches her uncle as he turns toward the children; she
                  knows they are his; she feels how much he loves them.
               The attorney—the man of duty—is somewhat affected. "I have a duty to perform," he
                  says, looking at the court, at the witness, at the children, at the very red-faced
                  clerk, at the opposing counsel, and anything within the precincts of the
                  court-room. We see his lips move; he hesitates, makes slight gesticulations, turns
                  and turns a volume of Blackstone with his hands, and mutters something we cannot
                  understand. The devil is doing battle with his heart—a heart bound with the iron
                  strings of the black law. At length, in broken accents, we catch the following
                  remarks, which the learned gentleman thinks it necessary to make in order to save
                  his gallantry:—"I am sorry—extremely sorry, to see the witness, a lady so
                  touchingly sensitive, somewhat affected; but, nevertheless" (the gentleman bows to
                  the judge, and says the Court will understand his position!) "it is one of those
                  cases which the demands of the profession at times find us engaged in. As such we
                  are bound, morally, let me say, as well as legally, to protect the interests of
                  our clients. In doing so, we are often compelled to encounter those delicate
                  irregularities to which the laws governing our peculiar institutions are liable. I
                  may say that they are so interwoven with our peculiar institution, that to act in
                  accordance with our duty makes it a painful task to our feelings. We—I may appeal
                  to the court for corroboration—can scarcely pursue an analysation of these cases
                  without pain; I may say, remorse of conscience." Mr. Petterwester, for such is his
                  name, is evidently touched with that sense of shame which the disclosures of the
                  black system bring upon his profession. This is aided by the fascinating
                  appearance of the witness on the stand. It is irresistible because it is at
                  variance with those legal proceedings, those horrors of southern jurisprudence,
                  which he is pressing for the benefit of his clients. Again he attempts to put
                  another question, but is seized with a tremor; he blushes, is nervous and
                  confused, casts a doubting look at the judge. That functionary is indeed very
                  grave—unmoved. The responsibility of the peculiar institution sorely hardened the
                  war of heart against head that was waging among the learned gentlemen; but the
                  institution must be preserved, for its political power works wonders, and its
                  legal power is wondrously curious. "Please tell the court and jury what you know
                  about the relation in which these children stand to the gentleman who asserts
                  their freedom, dear madam? We will not trouble you with questions; make a
                  statement," says Mr. Petterwester, with
                  great sincerity of manner. Indeed, Mr. Petterwester has been highly spoken of
                  among the very oldest, most respectable, and best kind of female society, for his
                  gallantry.
               The brother opposite, a small gentleman, with an exceedingly studious countenance,
                  dressed in shining black, and a profusion of glossy hair falling upon his
                  shoulders, rises with great legal calmness, and objects to the manner of
                  procedure, describing it as contrary to the well-established rules of the bar. The
                  court interpolates a few remarks, and then intimates that it very seriously thinks
                  gentlemen better waive the points,—better come to an understanding to let the lady
                  make her statements! Courtesy entitles her, as a lady, to every respect and
                  consideration. The gentlemen, having whispered a few words together, bow assent to
                  the high functionary's intimation.
               Franconia proceeds. She asserts that Hugh Marston (pointing to him) is her uncle;
                  that she knows little or nothing of his business affairs, cannot tell why her
                  brother left the country so suddenly; she knew Clotilda and Ellen Juvarna, mothers
                  of the children. They never were considered among the property of the plantation.
                  Her short story is told in touching tones. The learned and gallant attorney,
                  esteeming it indispensable, puts a question or two as to whether anything was ever
                  said about selling them in consequence of certain jealousies. Before the brother
                  can object, she answers them evasively, and the testimony amounts to just no
                  testimony at all. The court, bowing respectfully, informs the lady she can get
                  down from the stand.
               The next witness called is Mrs. Rosebrook. This good and benevolent lady is more
                  resolute and determined. The gentlemen of the bar find her quite clever enough for
                  them. Approaching the stand with a firm step, she takes her place as if determined
                  upon rescuing the children. Her answers come rather faster than is compatible with
                  the dignity of the learned gentlemen of the bar. She knows Marston, knows
                  Franconia, knows the old plantation, has spent many happy hours upon it, is sorry
                  to see the old proprietor reduced to this state of things. She knows the two
                  children,—dear creatures,—has always had a kindly feeling for them; knew their
                  poor mothers, has befriended them since Marston's troubles began. She always—her
                  large, loving eyes glowing with the kindness of her soul—heard Marston say they
                  were just as free as people could be, and they should be free, too! Some people
                  did'nt look at the moral obligation of the thing. Here, the good lady, blushing,
                  draws the veil over her face. There is something more she would like to disclose
                  if modesty did not forbid.
               "Nothing direct in such testimony, your honour will perceive!" says Mr.
                  Petterwester, directing himself to the judge.
               "Is there any question with regard to the father of the children?" enquires his
                  honour, again placing his hand to his ear and leaning forward inquisitively. His
                  honour suddenly forgot himself.
               "Ah, ha'h, he—em! The question, so buried under a mountain of complexity, requires
                  very nice legal discrimination to define it properly. However, we must be governed
                  by distinct pleadings, and I think that, in this case, this specific question is
                  not material; nor do my brother colleagues of the Bench think it would be
                  advisable to establish such questions, lest they affect the moral purity of the
                  atmosphere we live in."
               "If your honour will permit it, I may say it will only be necessary in this case
                  to establish the fact of property existing in the mothers. That will settle the
                  whole question; fathers, as you are aware, not being embraced in the law
                  regulating this species of property;" the learned gentleman instructs the
                  court.
               His honour, rejoining with a few very grave and very legal remarks, says they look
                  very much alike, and are of one mother. He is a little undecided, however, takes
                  another good stare at them, and then adds his glasses, that the affinity may be
                  more clear. Turning again to his book, he examines his pages, vacantly. A legal
                  wag, who has been watching the trial for mere amusement, whispering in the ear of
                  his brother, insinuates that the presiding functionary is meditating some problem
                  of speculation, and has forgotten the point at issue.
               "No!" interrupts Mr. Petterwester, "your honour is curiously labouring under an
                  error; they have two mothers, both of the same tenour in life—that is"—Mr.
                  Petterwester corrects himself—"embodying the same questions of property perty. The issue of the case now on is
                  taken as final over the rest."
               "Ah! bless me, now—I—rather—see—into it. The clerk will hand me Cobb's Georgia
                  Reports. A late case, curiously serious, there recorded, may lead me to gather a
                  parallel. Believe me, gentlemen, my feelings are not so dead—his honour addresses
                  himself to the bar in general—that I cannot perceive it to be one of those very
                  delicate necessities of our law which so embarrasses the gallantry of the
                  profession at times—"
               "Yes! yer honour," the attorney for the defence suddenly interrupts, "and which
                  renders it no less a disgrace to drag ladies of high rank into a court of this
                  kind—."
               His honour can assure the learned gentleman that this court has very high
                  functions, and can administer justice equal to anything this side of divine
                  power,—his honour interrupts, indignantly.
               "The court misunderstood the counsel,—he had no reference to the unquestioned high
                  authority of the tribunal; it was only the character of the trials brought before
                  it. When, notwithstanding our boasts of chivalry, delicate ladies are dragged
                  before it in this manner, they must not only endure the painful tenour of the
                  evidence, but submit to the insolence of men who would plunder nature of its
                  right—"
               "I shall claim the protection of the court against such unprofessional
                  imputations," his brother of the opposite interrupts, rising and affecting an air
                  of indignation. The court, quite bewildered, turns a listening ear to his
                  remarks—"Hopes the learned gentlemen will not disgrace themselves."
               Order! order! order! demands the sheriff, making a flourish with his sword. The
                  spectators, rising on tip-toe, express their anxiety to have the case proceed.
                  They whisper, shake their heads, and are heard to say that it will be utterly
                  useless to attempt anything against the testimony of Graspum and Romescos. Mr.
                  Graspum, in the fulness of his slavish and impudent pedantry, feeling secure in
                  the possession of his victims, sits within the bar, seeming to feel his position
                  elevated a few degrees above his highness the judge.
               "I do hope the interposition of this Court will not be necessary in this case.
                  Gentlemen of the learned profession sion should settle those differences more like
                  gentlemen," says his honour, looking down upon his minions with a frown of
                  contempt.
               "The matter is one entirely of a professional nature, yer honour!" responds the
                  scion of the law, quickly, first addressing himself to the judge, and then to the
                  jury. "If the testimony we have already adduced—direct as it is—be not sufficient
                  to establish the existence of property in these children" (Romescos has just
                  whispered something in his ear) "we will produce other testimony of the most
                  conclusive character. However, we will yield all further cross-questioning the
                  ladies; and I now suggest that they be relieved from the painful position of
                  appearing before this court again.
               Mrs. Rosebrook descends from the stand amidst murmurs and applause. Some amount of
                  legal tact now ensues; the attorney for the prosecution displays an earnestness
                  amounting to personal interest.
               Here the counsel for the defence steps forward, whispers to the clerk, and gives
                  notice that he shall call witnesses to impeach the characters of Graspum and
                  Romescos. These two high dignitaries, sitting together, express the utmost
                  surprise at such an insinuation. The character of neither is sacred material, nor
                  will it stand even in a southern atmosphere. They have been pronounced legally
                  impure many years ago.
               Just at this juncture there is quite an excitement in the court-room. Romescos,
                  like a disfigured statue, rises from among his legal friends and addresses the
                  court on the independent principle. "Well now, Squire, if ya'r goin' to play that
                  ar' lawyer game on a feller what don't understand the dodge, I'll just put a
                  settler on't; I'll put a settler on't what ya' won't get over. My word's my
                  honour; didn't come into this establishment to do swarin' cos I wanted to; seein'
                  how, when a feller's summoned by the Boss Squire, he's got to walk up and tell the
                  truth and nothin' shorter. I knows ya' don't feel right about it; and it kind a
                  hurts a feller's feelins to make property of such nice young uns, especially when
                  one knows how nice they've been brought up. This aint the thing, though; 'taint
                  the way to get along in the world; and seein' I'm a man of honour, and wouldn't do
                  a crooked thing nohow—"
               
               His honour the Sheriff, being somewhat impressed with the fact that Mr. Romescos
                  is rather transgressing the rules of the court, interposes. His defence of his
                  honour cannot longer be tolerated; and yet, very much after the fashion of great
                  outlaws, who, when arraigned for their crimes, think themselves very badly used
                  men, Romescos has the most exalted opinion of himself; never for a moment
                  entertains a doubt of his own integrity.
               He reaches over the bar; places his lips to the attorney's ear; is about to
                  whisper something. That gentleman quickly draws back, as if his presence were
                  repulsive. Not the least offended, Romescos winks significantly, crooks the
                  fore-finger of his right hand, and says—"something that'll put the stopper on."
                  The legal gentleman seems reconciled; listens attentively to the important
                  information. "All right! nothing more is needed," he says, rising from his seat,
                  and asking permission to introduce proof which will render it quite unnecessary to
                  proceed with anything that may have for its object the impeachment of the
                  witnesses.
               The attorney for the defence objects to this mode of procedure; and the judge,
                  having sustained the objections, orders the counsel to proceed with his witnesses.
                  Several persons, said to be of very high standing, are now called. They
                  successively depose that they would not believe Romescos nor Graspum upon oath;
                  notwithstanding, both may be very honourable and respectable gentlemen. Thus
                  invalidating the testimony of these high functionaries of the peculiar
                  institution, the gentleman of the prosecution has an opportunity of producing his
                  conclusive proof. Romescos has been seen passing him a very suspicious-looking
                  document.
               All attention is now directed to the children; they sit pensively, unconscious of
                  the dread fate hanging over them. "What can this testimony be?" rings in whispers
                  about the court-room. Some deep intrigue is going on; it is some unforeseen
                  movement of the slave-dealers, not comprehended by the spectators. Can the
                     bonâ-fide creditors be implicated? Even Mr.
                  Scranton feels that his knowledge of the philosophy of slave power is completely
                  at fault.
               "Now, your honour, and gentlemen of the jury," says the gentleman of the
                  prosecution, "I am fully aware of the painful suspense in which this case has kept
                  the court, the jury, and the very respectable persons I see assembled; but,
                  notwithstanding the respectability and well-known position of my clients and
                  witnesses, the defence in this case has succeeded in expunging the testimony, and
                  compelling us to bring forward such proof as cannot be impeached." Here the legal
                  gentleman draws from his pocket a stained and coloured paper, saying, "Will the
                  gentlemen of the jury be kind enough to minutely examine that instrument." He
                  passes it to the foreman.
               "What is the purport of the instrument?" his honour enquires.
               "The bill of sale, your honour."
               Foreman has examined it satisfactorily; passes it to several of his fellows. All
                  are satisfied. He returns it to the learned gentleman. That very important and
                  chivalrous individual throws it upon the table with great self-confidence.
               His honour would like to scan over its details. It is passed to the little fat
                  clerk, and by that gentleman to his honour. "Very, singularly strong!" his honour
                  says, giving his head a very wise shake.
               "When the court gets through," says the advocate for the defence, rising and
                  placing his hand on the clerk's desk.
               "The gentleman can examine," replies the court, passing it coldly to the Sheriff,
                  who politely forwards it.
               He turns it and turns it; reads it slowly; examines the dates minutely. "How did
                  the prosecution come in possession of this document?"
               His brother of the law objects, "That's not an admissible question. If the defence
                  will institute an action against the parties for unlawfully procuring it, we will
                  take great pleasure in showing our hands. It may be, however, well to say, that
                  Mr. Marston and Mr. Graspum have always been on the most friendly terms; but the
                  former gentleman forgot to take care of this very essential
                  document," he continues, taking it from the hand of his professional brother, and
                  turning toward the spectators, his countenance glowing with exultation. The pride
                  of his ambition is served. The profession has honourably sustained itself through
                  the wonderful abilities of this learned brother, who, holding the paper in his hand, awaits the gracious
                  applause of the assembled spectators. There is some applause, some murmuring, much
                  whispering.
               The court, in coldly measured words, hopes the audience will evince no excitement
                     pro or con.
               Some persons declare the bill of sale a forgery,—that Romescos has tried that very
                  same trick twice before. Others say it matters but little on that score,—that all
                  the law in the country won't restrain Graspum; if he sets at it in good earnest he
                  can turn any sort of people into property. A third whispers that the present order
                  of things must be changed, or nobody's children will be safe. Legal gentlemen, not
                  interested in the suit, shake their heads, and successively whisper, "The
                  prosecution never came by that bill of sale honestly." Creditors, not parties to
                     this suit, and brokers who now and then do something in the trade
                  of human beings, say, "If this be the way Marston's going to play the dodge with
                  his property, we will see if there be not some more under the same shaded
                  protection."
               "Will the counsel for the defence permit his client to inspect this instrument?"
                  says the learned gentleman, passing it across the table.
               Marston's face flushes with shame; he is overcome; he extends his trembling hand
                  and takes the fatal document. It is, to him, his children's death-warrant. A cloud
                  of darkness overshadows his hopes; he would question the signature, but the
                  signer, Silenus, is dead,—as dead as the justice of the law by which the children
                  are being tried. And there is the bond attached to it! Again the thought flashed
                  through his mind, that he had sold Ellen Juvarna to Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy.
                  However much he might struggle to save his children—however much a father's
                  obligations might force themselves upon him—however much he might acknowledge them
                  the offspring of his own body, they were property in the law—property in the hands
                  of Graspum; and, with the forethought of that honourable gentleman opposed to
                  him—as it evidently was—his efforts and pleadings would not only prove futile, but
                  tend to expose Lorenzo's crime.
               "The philosophy of the thing is coming out, just as I said—precisely," ejaculates
                  Mr. Scranton, raising his methodical eyes, and whispering to a legal gentleman who
                  sits at his right.
               "Serious philosophy, that embraces and sanctions the sale of such lovely
                  children,—making property of one's children against his wishes! I'm a great
                  Southern rights man, but this is shaving the intermixture a little too close,"
                  rejoins the other, casting a solicitous look at Marston, who has been intently and
                  nervously examining the bill of sale.
               "Any objections to make to it?" says the learned gentleman, bowing politely and
                  extending his hand, as he concludes by inquiring how it happened, in the face of
                  such an array of evidence, that he sold the girl, Ellen Juvarna?
               "No objection, none!" is Marston's quick response. His head droops; he wipes the
                  tears from his eyes; he leaves the court in silence, amid murmurs from the crowd.
                  The female witnesses left before him; it was well they did so.
               That this is the original bill of sale, from one Silenus to Hugh Marston, has been
                  fully established. However painful the issue, nothing remained but to give the
                  case to the jury. All is silent for several minutes. The judge has rarely sat upon
                  a case of this kind. He sits unnerved, the pen in his hand refusing to write as
                  his thoughts wander into the wondrous vortex of the future of slavery. But the
                  spell has passed; his face shades with pallor as slowly he rises to address the
                  jury. He has but few words to say; they fall like death-knells on the ears of his
                  listeners. Some touching words escape his hesitating lips; but duty, enforced by
                  the iron rod of slave power, demands him to sustain the laws of the land. He sets
                  forth the undisputed evidence contained in the bill of sale, the unmistakeable
                  bond, the singular and very high-handed attempt to conceal it from
                  the honest creditors, and the necessity of jurymen restraining their sympathies
                  for the children while performing a duty to the laws of the land. Having thus made
                  his brief address, he sits down; the sheriff shoulders his tip-staff, and the
                  august twelve, with papers provided, are marched into the jury-room, as the court
                  orders that the case of Dunton v. Higgins be called.
               Five minutes have intervened; the clerk calling the case 
                     s
                     is
                   interrupted by a knocking at the jury-room door; he stops his reading,
                  the door is opened, and the sheriff conducts his twelve gentlemen back to their
                  seats. Not a whisper is heard; the stillness of the tomb reigns over this high judicial scene. The sheriff
                  receives a packet of papers from the foreman's hands, and passes them to the
                  clerk.
               "Gentlemen of the jury will please stand up," says that very amiable functionary.
                  "Have you agreed on your verdict?" The foreman bows assent.
               "Guilty or not guilty, gentlemen?"
               "Guilty," says the former, in tones like church-yard wailings: "Guilty. I suppose
                  that's the style we must render the verdict in?" The foreman is at a loss to know
                  what style of verdict is necessary.
               "Yes," returns the clerk, bowing; and the gentlemen of the jury well complimented
                  by the judge, are discharged until to-morrow. The attorney for the defence made a
                  noble, generous, and touching appeal to the fatherly twelve; but his appeal fell
                  like dull mist before the majesty of slavery. Guilty! O heavens, that ever the
                  innocent should be made guilty of being born of a mother! That a mother—that name
                  so holy—should be stained with the crime of bearing her child to criminal
                  life!
               Two children, fair and beautiful, are judged by a jury of twelve—perhaps all good
                  and kind fathers, free and enlightened citizens of a free and happy
                  republic—guilty of the crime of being born of a slave mother. Can this inquiring
                  jury, this thinking twelve, feel as fathers only can feel when their children are
                  on the precipice of danger? Could they but break over that seeming invulnerable
                  power of slavery which crushes humanity, freezes up the souls of men, and makes
                  the lives of millions but a blight of misery, and behold with the honesty of the
                  heart what a picture of misery their voice "Guilty!" spreads before these
                  unfortunate children, how changed would be the result!
               A judge, endeared to his own children by the kindest affections, feels no
                  compunction of conscience while administering the law which denies a father his
                  own children—which commands those children to be sold with the beasts of the
                  field! Mark the slender cord upon which the fate of these unfortunates turns; mark
                  the suffering through which they must pass.
               The hand on the clock's pale face marks four. His honour reminds gentlemen of the
                  bar that it is time to adjourn court. Court is accordingly adjourned. The crowd
                  disperse in silence. Gentlemen of the legal profession are satisfied the majesty
                  of the law has been sustained.
               Hence the guilty children, scions of rights-loving democracy, like two pieces of
                  valuable merchandise judicially decreed upon, are led back to prison, where they
                  will await sale. Annette has caught the sound of "Guilty!"—she mutters it while
                  being taken home from the court, in the arms of an old slave. May heaven forgive
                  the guilt we inherit from a mother, in this our land of freedom!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER 
                     XXI.
                     XXII.
                  
               
               WE CHANGE WITH FORTUNE.
               BUT a few months have passed since the popularly called gallant M'Carstrow led the
                  fair Franconia to the hymeneal altar; and, now that he has taken up his residence
                  in the city, the excitement of the honeymoon is waning, and he has betaken himself
                  to his more congenial associations. The beautiful Franconia for him had but
                  transient charms, which he now views as he would objects necessary to the
                  gratifications of his coarse passions. His feelings have not been softened with
                  those finer associations which make man the kind patron of domestic life; nor is
                  his mind capable of appreciating that respect for a wife which makes her an
                  ornament of her circle. Saloons, race-courses, and nameless places, have superior
                  attractions for him: home is become but endurable.
               In truth, Franconia, compelled to marry in deference to fortune, finds she is
                  ensnared into misfortunes. M'Carstrow (Colonel by courtesy) had fifteen hundred
                  dollars, cash down, to pay for Clotilda: this sad grievance excites his feelings,
                  inasmuch as it was all owing to his wife's whims, and the poverty of her
                  relations. The verdict of the jury, recently rendered, was to his mind a strictly
                  correct one; but he cannot forget the insane manner in which the responsibility
                  was fastened upon him, and the hard cash—which might have made two handsome stakes
                  on the turf—drawn from his pocket. His wife's poverty-stricken relations he now
                  detests, and can tolerate them best when farthest away from him. But Franconia
                  does not forget that he is her husband; no, night after night she sits at the
                  window until midnight, waiting his return. Feeble and weary with anxiety, she will
                  despatch a negro on a hopeless errand of search; he, true to his charge, returns
                  with the confidential intelligence of finding Mas'r in a place less reputable than
                  it is proper to mention. Such is our southern society,—very hospitable in
                  language, chivalrous in memory,—base in morals! Sometimes times the gallant
                  colonel deems it necessary to remain until daylight, lest, in returning by night,
                  the pavement may annoy his understanding. Of this, however, he felt the world knew
                  but little. Now and then, merely to keep up the luxury of southern life, the
                  colonel finds it gratifying to his feelings, on returning home at night, to order
                  a bed to be made for him in one of the yard-houses, in such manner as to give the
                  deepest pain to his Franconia. Coarse and dissolute, indifference follows, cold
                  and cutting; she finds herself a mere instrument of baser purpose in the hands of
                  one she knows only as a ruffian—she loathes! Thus driven under the burden of
                  trouble, she begins to express her unhappiness, to remonstrate against his
                  associations, to plead with him against his course of life. He jeers at this,
                  scouts such prudery, proclaims it far beneath the dignity of his standing as a
                  southern gentleman.
               The generous woman could have endured his dissipation—she might have tolerated his
                  licentiousness, but his arbitrary and very uncalled-for remarks upon the
                  misfortunes of her family are more than she can bear. She has tried to respect
                  him—love him she cannot—and yet her sensitive nature recoils at the thought of
                  being attached to one whose feelings and associations are so at variance with her
                  own. Her impulsive spirit quails under the bitterness of her lot; she sees the
                  dreary waste of trouble before her only to envy the happiness of those days of
                  rural life spent on the old plantation. That she should become fretful and unhappy
                  is a natural consequence.
               We must invite the reader to go with us to M'Carstrow's residence, an
                  old-fashioned wooden building, three stories high, with large basement windows and
                  doors, on the south side of King Street. It is a wet, gloomy night, in the month
                  of November,—the wind, fierce and chilling, has just set in from the north-east; a
                  drenching rain begins to fall, the ships in the harbour ride ill at ease; the
                  sudden gusts of wind, sweeping through the narrow streets of the city, lighted
                  here and there by the sickly light of an old-fashioned lamp, bespread the scene
                  with drear. At a second-story window, lighted by a taper burning on the sill, sits
                  Franconia, alone, waiting the return of M'Carstrow. M'Carstrow is enjoying his
                  night orgies! He cares neither for the pelting storm, the anxiety of his wife, nor
                  the sweets of home.
               
               A gust of wind shakes the house; the windows rattle their stormy music; the
                  cricket answers to the wailings of the gale as it gushes through the crevices;
                  Franconia's cares are borne to her husband. Now the wind subsides,—a slow rap is
                  heard at the hall door, in the basement: a female servant, expecting her master,
                  hastens to open it. Her master is not there; the wind has extinguished the flaring
                  light; and the storm, sweeping through the sombre arch, spreads noise and
                  confusion. She runs to the kitchen, seizes the globular lamp, and soon returns,
                  frightened at the sight presented in the door. Master is not there—it is the lean
                  figure of a strange old "nigger," whose weather-worn face, snowy with beard and
                  wrinkled with age, is lit up with gladness. He has a warm soul within him,—a soul
                  not unacceptable to heaven! The servant shrinks back,—she is frightened at the
                  strange sight of the strange old man. "Don' be feared, good child; Bob ain't bad
                  nigger," says the figure, in a guttural whisper.
               "An't da'h fo'h notin good; who is ye'?" returns the girl, holding the globular
                  lamp before her shining black face. Cautiously she makes a step or two forward,
                  squinting at the sombre figure of the old negro, as he stands trembling in the
                  doorway. "Is my good young Miss wid'n?" he enquires, in the same whispering voice,
                  holding his cap in his right hand.
               "Reckon how ye bes be gwine out a dat afo'h Miss come. Yer miss don' lib in dis
                  ouse." So saying, the girl is about to close the door in the old man's face, for
                  he is ragged and dejected, and has the appearance of a "suspicious nigger without
                  a master."
               "Don' talk so, good gal; ye don' know dis old man,—so hungry,—most starved. I lub
                  Miss Franconia. Tell she I'ze here," he says, in a supplicating tone, as the girl,
                  regaining confidence, scrutinises him from head to foot with the aid of her
                  lamp.
               The servant is about to request he will come inside that she may shut out the
                  storm. "Frankone knows old Daddy Bob,—dat she do!" he reiterates, working his cap
                  in his fingers. The familiar words have caught Franconia's ear; she recognises the
                  sound of the old man's voice; she springs to her feet, as her heart gladdens with
                  joy. She bounds down the stairs, and to the door, grasps the old man's hand, as a
                  fond child warmly grasps the hand of a parent, and welcomes him with the
                  tenderness of a sister. "Poor—my poor old Daddy!" she says, looking in his face so
                  sweetly, so earnestly, "where have you come from? who bought you? how did you
                  escape?" she asks, in rapid succession. Holding his hand, she leads him along the
                  passage, as he tells her. "Ah, missus, I sees hard times since old mas'r lef' de
                  plantation. Him an't how he was ven you dah." He views her, curiously, from head
                  to foot; kisses her hand; laughs with joy, as he was wont to laugh on the old
                  plantation.
               "Faithful as ever, Daddy? You found me out, and came to see me, didn't you?" says
                  Franconia, so kindly, leading him into a small room on the left hand of the hall,
                  where, after ordering some supper for him, she begs he will tell her all about his
                  wayfaring. It is some minutes before Bob can get an opportunity to tell Franconia
                  that he is a fugitive, having escaped the iron grasp of the law to stand true to
                  old mas'r. At length he, in the enthusiastic boundings of his heart, commences his
                  story.
               "Nigger true, Miss Franconia"—he mumbles out—"on'e gib 'im chance to be. Ye sees,
                  Bob warn't gwine t' lef' old mas'r, nohow; so I gin 'ein da slip when'e come t'
                  takes 'em fo'h sell—"
               "Then they didn't sell you, old Dad? That's good! that's good! And Daddy's cold
                  and wet?" she interrupts, anxiously, telling the servant to get some dry clothes
                  for him.
               "I is dat, Miss Frankone. Han't ad nofin t' eat dis most two days," he returns,
                  looking at her affectionately, with one of those simple smiles, so true, so
                  expressive.
               A supper is soon ready for Daddy, to which he sits down as if he were about to
                  renew all his former fondness and familiarity. "Seems like old times, don 'un,
                  Miss Frankone? Wish old mas'r war here, too," says the old man, putting the bowl
                  of coffee to his lips, and casting a side-look at the servant.
               Franconia sits watching him intently, as if he were a child just rescued from some
                  impending danger. "Don't mention my poor uncle, Daddy. He feels as much interest
                  in you as I do; but the world don't look upon him now as it once did—"
               "Neber mind: I gwine to work fo' old mas'r. It'll take dis old child to see old
                  mas'r all right," replies the old man,
                  forgetting that he is too old to take care of himself, properly. Bob finishes his
                  supper, rests his elbow on the table and his head in his hand, and commences
                  disclosing his troubles to Franconia. He tells her how he secreted himself in the
                  pine-woods,—how he wandered through swamps, waded creeks, slept on trunks of
                  trees, crept stealthily to the old mansion at night, listened for mas'r's
                  footsteps, and watched beneath the veranda; and when he found he was not there,
                  how he turned and left the spot, his poor heart regretting. How his heart beat as
                  he passed the old familiar cabin, retracing his steps to seek a shelter in the
                  swamp; how, when he learned her residence, famished with hunger, he wended his way
                  into the city to seek her out, knowing she would relieve his wants.
               "What vil da do wid me, spose da cotch me, Miss Frankone?" enquires the old man,
                  simply, looking down at his encrusted feet, and again at his nether wardrobe,
                  which he feels is not just the thing to appear in before young missus.
               "They won't do anything cruel to you, Daddy. You are too old; your grey hairs will
                  protect you. Why, Daddy, you would not fetch a bid if they found out who owned
                  you, and put you up at auction to-morrow," she says, with seeming unconsciousness.
                  She little knew how much the old man prided in his value,—how much he esteemed the
                  amount of good work he could do for master. He shakes his head, looks doubtingly
                  at her, as if questioning the sincerity of her remark.
               "Just get Daddy Bob—he mutters—a badge, den 'e show missus how much
                  work in 'um."
               Franconia promises to comply with his request, and, with the aid of a friend, will
                  intercede for him, and procure for him a badge, that he may display his energies
                  for the benefit of old mas'r. This done, she orders the servant to show him his
                  bed in one of the "yard houses;" bids the old man an affectionate good night,
                  retires to her room, and watches the return of her truant swain.
               There, seated in an arm-chair, she waits, and waits, and waits, hope and anxiety
                  recording time as it passes. The servant has seen Daddy safe in his room, and
                  joins her missus, where, by the force of habit, she coils herself at her feet, and
                  sleeps. She has not long remained in this position when loud singing breaks upon
                  her ear; louder and louder it vibrates through the music of the storm, and
                  approaches. Now she distinctly recognises the sharp voice of M'Carstrow, which is
                  followed by loud rappings at the door of the basement hall. M'Carstrow,
                  impatiently, demands entrance. The half-sleeping servant, startled at the noise,
                  springs to her feet, rubs her eyes, bounds down the stairs, seizes the globular
                  lamp, and proceeds to open the door. Franconia, a candle in her hand, waits at the
                  top of the stairs. She swings back the door, and there, bespattered with mud, face
                  bleeding and distorted, and eyes glassy, stands the chivalrous M'Carstrow. He
                  presents a sorry picture; mutters, or half growls, some sharp imprecations; makes
                  a grasp at the girl, falls prostrate on the floor. Attempting to gain his
                  perpendicular, he staggers a few yards—the girl screaming with fright—and groans
                  as his face again confronts the tiles. To make the matter still worse, three of
                  his boon companions follow him, and, almost in succession, pay their penance to
                  the floor, in an indescribable catacomb.
               "I tell you what, Colonel! if that nigger gal a' yourn don't stand close with her
                  blazer we'll get into an all-fired snarl," says one, endeavouring to extricate
                  himself and regain his upright. After sundry ineffectual attempts, surging round
                  the room in search of his hat, which is being very unceremoniously transformed
                  into a muff beneath their entangled extremes, he turns over quietly, saying,
                  "There's something very strange about the floor of this establishment,—it don't
                  seem solid; 'pears how there's ups and downs in it." They wriggle and twist in a
                  curious pile; endeavour to bring their knees out of "a fix"—to free themselves
                  from the angles which they are most unmathematically working on the floor. Working
                  and twisting,—now staggering, and again giving utterance to the coarsest
                  language,—one of the gentry—they belong to the sporting world—calls loudly for the
                  colonel's little 'oman. Regaining his feet, he makes indelicate advances towards
                  the female servant, who, nearly pale with fright—a negro can look pale—runs to her
                  mistress at the top of the stairs.
               He misses the frightened maid, and seats himself on the lowest step of the stairs.
                  Here he delivers a sort of half-musical soliloquy, like the following: "Gentlemen!
                     this kind a' thing only happens at
                  times, and isn't just the square thing when yer straight; but—seein' how southern
                  life will be so—when a body get's crooked what's got a wife what don't look to
                  matters and things, and never comes to take care on a body when he's done gone, he
                  better shut up shop. Better be lookin' round to see what he can scare up!"
               Franconia holds the flaring light over the stairs: pale and death-like, she
                  trembles with fear, every moment expecting to see them ascend.
               "I see the colonel's 'oman! yander she is; she what was imposed on him to save the
                  poverty of her folks. The M'Carstrows know a thing or two: her folks may crawl
                  under the dignity of the name, but they don't shell under the dignity of the
                  money—they don't!" says a stalwart companion, attempting to gain a position by the
                  side of his fellow on the steps. He gives a leering wink, contorts his face into a
                  dozen grimaces, stares vacantly round the hall (sliding himself along on his hands
                  and knees), his glassy eyes inflamed like balls of fire. "It'll be all square
                  soon," he growls out.
               The poor affrighted servant again attempts—having descended the stairs—to relieve
                  her master; but the crawling creature has regained his feet. He springs upon her
                  like a fiend, utters a fierce yell, and, snatching the lamp from her hand, dashes
                  it upon the tiles, spreading the fractured pieces about the hall. Wringing herself
                  from his grasp, she leaves a portion of her dress in his bony hand, and seeks
                  shelter in a distant part of the hall. Holding up the fragment as a trophy, he
                  staggers from place to place, making hieroglyphics on the wall with his fingers.
                  His misty mind searches for some point of egress. Confronting (rather
                  uncomfortably) hat stands, tables, porcelains, and other hall appurtenances, he at
                  length shuffles his way back to the stairs, where, as if doubting his bleered
                  optics, he stands some moments, swaying to and fro. His hat again falls from his
                  head, and his body, following, lays its lumbering length on the stairs. Happy
                  fraternity! how useful is that body! His companion, laying his muddled head upon
                  it, says it will serve for a pillow. "E'ke—hum—spose 'tis so? I reckon how I'm
                  some—ec! eke!—somewhere or nowhere; aint we, Joe? It's a funny house, fellers," he
                  continues to soliloquise, laying his arm affectionately over his companion's neck,
                  and again yielding to the caprice of his nether limbs.
               The gentlemen will now enjoy a little refreshing sleep; to further which
                  enjoyment, they very coolly and unceremoniously commence a pot-pourri of discordant snoring. This seems of grateful concord for
                  their boon companions, who—forming an equanimity of good feeling on the floor—join
                  in.
               The servant is but a slave, subject to her owner's will; she dare not approach him
                  while in such an uncertain condition. Franconia cannot intercede, lest his
                  companions, strangers to her, and having the appearance of low-bred men, taking
                  advantage of M'Carstrow's besotted condition, make rude advances. M'Carstrow,
                  snoring high above his cares, will take his comfort upon the tiles.
               The servant is supplied with another candle, which, at Franconia's bidding, she
                  places in a niche of the hall. It will supply light to the grotesque sleepers,
                  whose lamp has gone out.
               Franconia has not forgotten that M'Carstrow is her husband; she has not forgotten
                  that she owes him a wife's debt of kindness. She descends the stairs gently, leans
                  over his besotted body, smooths his feverish brow with her hand, and orders the
                  servant to bring a soft cushion; which done, she raises his head and places it
                  beneath—so gently, so carefully. Her loving heart seems swelling with grief, as
                  compassionately she gazes upon him; then, drawing a cambric handkerchief from her
                  bosom, spreads it so kindly over his face. Woman! there is worth in that last
                  little act. She leaves him to enjoy his follies, but regrets their existence.
                  Retiring to the drawing-room, agitated and sleepless, she reclines on a lounge to
                  await the light of morning. Again the faithful servant, endeavouring to appease
                  her mistress's agitation, crouches upon the carpet, resting her head on the
                  ottoman at Franconia's feet.
               The morning dawns bright and sunny: Franconia has not slept. She has passed the
                  hours in watchfulness; has watched the negro sleeping, while her thoughts were
                  rivetted to the scene in the hall. She gets up, paces the room from the couch to
                  the window, and sits down again undecided, unresolved. Taking Diana—such is the
                  servant's name—by the hand, she wakes her, and sends her into the hall to
                  ascertain the condition of the sleepers. The metamorphosed group, poisoning the air with their reeking breath,
                  are still enjoying the morbid fruits of their bacchanalianism. Quietly, coolly,
                  and promiscuously, they lay as lovingly as fellows of the animal world could
                  desire.
               The servant returns, shaking her head. "Missus, da'h lays yander, so in all fixins
                  dat no tellin' which most done gone. Mas'r seems done gone, sartin!" says the
                  servant, her face glowing with apprehension.
               The significant phrase alarms Franconia. She repairs to the hall, and commences
                  restoring the sleepers to consciousness. The gentlemen are doggedly obstinate;
                  they refuse to be disturbed. She recognises the face of one whose business it is
                  to reduce men to the last stage of poverty. Her sensitive nature shudders at the
                  sight, as she views him with a curl of contempt on her lip. "Oh,
                  M'Carstrow,—M'Carstrow!" she whispers, and taking him by the hand, shakes it
                  violently. M'Carstrow, with countenance ghastly and inflamed, begins to raise his
                  sluggish head. He sees Franconia pensively gazing in his face; and yet he enquires
                  who it is that disturbs the progress of his comforts. "Only me!" says the good
                  woman, soliciting him to leave his companions and accompany her.
               Oh, you, is it?" he replies, grumblingly, rising on his right elbow, and rubbing
                  his eyes with his left hand. Wildly and vacantly he stares round the hall, as if
                  aroused from a trance, and made sensible of his condition.
               "Yes, me—simply me, who, lost to your affections, is made most unhappy—" Franconia
                  would proceed, but is interrupted by her muddling swain.
               "Unhappy! unhappy!" says the man of southern chivalry, making sundry irresistible
                  nods. "Propagator of mischief, of evil contentions, of peace annihilators. Ah! ah!
                  ah! Thinking about the lustre of them beggared relations. It always takes fools to
                  make a fuss over small things: an angel wouldn't make a discontented woman happy."
                  Franconia breaks out into a paroxysm of grief, so unfeeling is the tone in which
                  he addresses her. He is a southern gentleman,—happily not of New England in his
                  manners, not of New England in his affections, not of New England in his domestic
                  associations. He thinks Franconia very silly, and scouts with derision the idea of
                  marrying a southern gentleman who likes enjoyment, and then making a fuss about
                  it. He thinks she had better shut up her whimpering,—learn to be a good wife upon
                  southern principles.
               "Husbands should be husbands, to claim a wife's respect; and they should never
                  forget that kindness makes good wives. Take away the life springs of woman's love,
                  and what is she? What is she with her happiness gone, her pride touched, her
                  prospects blasted? What respect or love can she have for the man who degrades her
                  to the level of his own loathsome companions?" Franconia points to those who lie
                  upon the floor, repulsive, and reeking with the fumes of dissipation. "There are
                  your companions," she says.
               "Companions?" he returns, enquiringly. He looks round upon them with surprise.
                  "Who are those fellows you have got here?" he enquires, angrily.
               "You brought them to your own home; that home you might make happy—"
               "Not a bit of it! They are some of your d—d disreputable relations."
               "My relations never violate the conduct of gentlemen." "No; but they sponge on me.
                  These my companions!" looking at them inquisitively. "Oh, no! Don't let us talk
                  about such things; I'ze got fifteen hundred dollars and costs to pay for that
                  nigger gal you were fool enough to get into a fit about when we were married.
                  That's what I'ze got for my good-heartedness." M'Carstrow permits his very
                  gentlemanly southern self to get into a rage. He springs to his feet suddenly,
                  crosses and recrosses the hall like one frenzied with excitement. Franconia is
                  frightened, runs up the stairs, and into her chamber, where, secreting herself,
                  she fastens the door. He looks wistfully after her, stamping his foot, but he will
                  not follow. Too much of a polished gentleman, he will merely amuse himself by
                  running over the gamut of his strongest imprecations. The noise creates general
                  alarm among his companions, who, gaining their uprights, commence remonstrating
                  with him on his rude conduct, as if they were much superior beings.
               "Now, colonel, major,—or whatever they dubbed ye, in the way of a title," says
                  one, putting his hand to his hat with a swaggering bow; "just stop that ar' sort
                  a' nonsense, and pay over this 'ere little affair afore we gets into polite etiquette and such things. When, to
                  make the expenses, ye comes into a place like ours, and runs up a credit
                  score,—when ye gets so lofty that ye can't tell fifty from five, we puts a sealer
                  on, so customers don't forget in the morning." The modest gentleman presents to
                  M'Carstrow's astonished eyes a note for twenty-seven hundred dollars, with the
                  genuine signature. M'Carstrow takes it in his hand, stares at it, turns it over
                  and over. The signature is his; but he is undecided about the manner of its
                  getting there, and begins to give expression to some doubt.
               The gentleman watches M'Carstrow very cautiously. "Straight! colonel—he says—just
                  turn out the shiners, or, to 'commodate, we'll let ye off with a sprinkling of
                  niggers."
               The colonel puts the fore-finger of his left hand to his lips, and, with serious
                  countenance, walks twice or thrice across the hall, as if consulting his dignity:
                  "Shell out the niggers first; we'll take the dignity part a'ter," he
                  concludes.
               "I demand to know how you came in my house," interrupts the colonel, impatiently.
                  He finds himself in very bad company; company southern gentlemen never acknowledge
                  by daylight.
               "We brought you here! Anything else you'd like to know?" is the cool,
                  sneering response. The gentleman will take a pinch of snuff; he draws his fancy
                  box from his pocket, gives the cover a polite rap with his finger, invites the
                  enraged M'Carstrow to "take." That gentleman shakes his head,—declines. He is
                  turning the whole affair over in his head, seems taking it into serious
                  consideration. Seriously, he accepted their accommodation, and now finds himself
                  compelled to endure their painful presence.
               "I, I, I—m, rather in doubt," stammers M'Carstrow, fingering the little obligation
                  again, turning it over and over, rubbing his eyes, applying his glass. He sees
                  nothing in the signature to dispute. "I must stop this kind of fishing," he says;
                  "don't do. It 's just what friend Scranton would call very bad philosophy.
                  Gentlemen, suppose you sit down; we'd better consider this matter a little. Han't
                  got a dime in the bank, just now." M'Carstrow is becoming more quiet, takes a
                  philosophical view of the matter, affects more suavity. Calling loudly for the
                  negro servant, that personage presents herself, and is ordered to bring chairs to
                  provide accommodation for the gentlemen, in the hall.
               "Might just as well settle the matter in the parlour, colonel; t'wont put you out
                  a mite," the gambler suggests, with a laconic air. He will not trouble M'Carstrow
                  by waiting for his reply. No; he leads the way, very coolly, asking no odds of
                  etiquette; and, having entered the apartment, invites his comrades to take seats.
                  The dignity and coolness with which the manœuvre is executed takes "Boss"
                  M'Carstrow by surprise; makes him feel that he is merely a dependent individual,
                  whose presence there is not much need of. "I tell you what it is, gents, I'ze
                  shaved my accounts at the bank down to the smallest figure, have! but there's an
                  honourable consideration about this matter; and, honour's honour, and I want to
                  discharge it somehow—niggers or cash!" The gentlemen's feelings have smoothed down
                  amazingly. M'Carstrow is entirely serious, and willing to comply.
               The gentlemen have seated themselves in a triangle, with the "done over" colonel
                  in the centre.
               "Well, niggers will do just as well, provided they are sound, prime, and put at
                  prices so a feller can turn 'em into tin, quick," says the gentleman, who elects
                  himself spokesman of the party.
               "Keeps my property in tall condition, but won't shove it off under market
                  quotations, no how!" M'Carstrow interrupts, as the spokesman, affecting the
                  nonchalance of a newly-elected alderman, places his feet upon the rich upholstery
                  of a sofa close by. He would enjoy the extremes of southern comfort. "Colonel, I
                  wish you had a more convenient place to spit," rejoins the gentleman. He will not
                  trouble the maid, however—he let's fly the noxious mixture, promiscuously; it
                  falls from his lips upon the soft hearth-rug. "It will add another flower to the
                  expensive thing," he says, very coolly, elongating his figure a little more. He
                  has relieved himself, wondrously. M'Carstrow calls the servant, points to the
                  additional wreath on the hearth-rug!
               "All your nigger property as good-conditioned as that gal?" enquires the
                  gentleman, the others laughing at the nicety of his humour. Rising from his seat
                  very deliberately, he approaches the
                  servant, lays his hand upon her neck and shoulders.
               "Not quite so fast, my friend: d—n it, gentlemen, don't be rude. That's coming the
                  thing a little too familiar. There is a medium: please direct your moist
                  appropriations and your improper remarks in their proper places." The girl,
                  cringing beneath the ruffian's hand, places the necessary receptacle at his
                  feet.
               The gentleman is offended,—very much offended. He thinks it beneath the expansion
                  of his mind—to be standing on aristocratic nonsense! "Spit boxes and nigger
                  property ain't the thing to stand on about haristocrats; just put down the dimes.
                  Three bright niggers 'll do: turn 'em out."
               "Three of my best niggers!" ejaculates the Colonel.
               "Nothin' shorter, Colonel."
               "Remember, gentlemen, the market price of such property. The demand for cotton has
                  made niggers worth their weight in gold, for any purpose. Take the prosperity of
                  our country into consideration, gentlemen; remember the worth of prime men. The
                  tip men of the market are worth 1200 dollars."
               "Might as well lay that kind a' financerin aside, Colonel. What's the use of
                  living in a free country, where every man has a right to make a penny when he can,
                  and talk so? Now, 'pears to me t'aint no use a' mincing the matter; we might a'
                  leaked ye in for as many thousands as hundreds. Seein' how ye was a good customer,
                  we saved ye on a small shot. Better put the niggers out: ownin' such a lot, ye
                  won't feel it! Give us three prime chaps; none a' yer old sawbones what ye puts up
                  at auction when ther' worked down to nothin'."
               M'Carstrow's powers of reasoning are quite limited; and, finding himself in one of
                  those strange situations southern gentlemen so often get into, and which not
                  unfrequently prove as perplexing as the workings of the peculiar institution
                  itself, he seeks relief by giving an order for three prime fellows. They will be
                  delivered up, at the plantation, on the following day, when the merchandise will
                  be duly made over, as per invoice. Everything is according to style and honour;
                  the gentlemen pledge their faith to be gentlemen, to leave no dishonourable
                  loop-hole for creeping out. And now, having settled the little matter, they make
                  M'Carstrow the very best of bows, desire to be remembered to his woman, bid him
                  good morning, and leave. They will claim their property—three prime men—by the
                  justice of a "free-born democracy."
               M'Carstrow watches them from the house, moralising over his folly. They have gone!
                  He turns from the sight, ascends the stairs, and repairs to meet his
                  Franconia.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER 
                     XXII.

               THE VICISSITUDES OF A PREACHER.
               WE left Harry, the faithful servant, whose ministerial functions had been employed
                  in elevating the souls of Marston's property, being separated from his wife and
                  sold to Mr. M'Fadden. M'Fadden is a gentleman—we do not impugn the name, in a
                  southern sense—of that class—very large class—who, finding the laws of their own
                  country too oppressive for their liberal thoughts, seek a republican's home in
                  ours. It is to such men, unhappily, the vices of slavery are open. They grasp
                  them, apply them to purposes most mercenary, most vile. The most hardened of
                  foreigners—that essence of degraded outcasts,—may, under the privileges of
                  slavery, turn human misery into the means of making money. He has no true
                  affiliations with the people of the south, nor can he feel aught beyond a selfish
                  interest in the prosperity of the State; but he can be active in the work of evil.
                  With the foreigner—we speak from observation—affecting love of liberty at home, it
                  would seem, only makes him the greater tyrant when slavery gives him power to
                  execute its inhuman trusts. Mr. Lawrence M'Fadden is one of this description of
                  persons; he will make a fortune in the South, and live a gentleman in the
                  North—perhaps, at home on his own native Isle. Education he has none; moral
                  principle he never enjoyed,—never expects to. He is a tall, athletic man, nearly
                  six feet two inches in height, with extremely broad, stooping shoulders, and
                  always walks as if he were meditating some speculation. His dress is usually of
                  southern red-mixed homespun,—a dress which he takes much pride in wearing, in
                  connection with a black brigand hat, which gives his broad face, projecting
                  cheek-bones, and blunt chin, a look of unmistakeable sullenness. Add to this a
                  low, narrow forehead, generally covered with thick tufts of matted black hair,
                  beneath which two savage eyes incessantly glare, and, reader, you have the
                  repulsive personification of the man. Mr. M'Fadden has
                     M'FADDEN AMUSES HIS PEOPLE WITH A FANDANGO.
                     "Got a tall chap here, boys! Make ye stand round some, in pickin' time; and
                        can preach, too! Can put in the big licks preachin'; and I'ze goin' t'let
                        'im, once in a while. Goin' t'have good times on my place, boys—ha'h! Got a
                        jug of whiskey to have a fandango, and a preacher to do it up brown at
                        t'other end."
                  
                   bought a preacher,—an article with the
                  very best kind of a soul,—which he would send to his place in the country. Having
                  just sent the article to the rail-road, he stands in a neighbouring bar-room,
                  surrounded by his cronies, who are joining him in a social glass, discussing the
                  qualities of the article preacher. We are not favoured with the point at issue;
                  but we hear Mr. Lawrence M'Fadden say, with great force,—"Preachers are only good
                  property under certain circumstances; and if them circumstances ain't just so, it
                  won't do to buy 'em. Old aristocrat rice planters may make a good thing or two on
                  'em, because they can make 'em regulate the cummin' o' their property, and make it
                  understand what the Lord says about minding their masters." For his—Mr. Lawrence
                  M'Fadden's—own part, he wouldn't give seven coppers for the thinking part of any
                  property, having no belief in that fashionable way of improving its value. "My
                  preacher has been nicely packed up and sent off in advance," he says, wiping his
                  mouth with his coat sleeve, and smacking his lips, as he twirls his glass upon the
                  zinc counter, shakes hands with his friends—they congratulate him upon the good
                  bargain in his divine—and proceeds to the railroad depôt. Harry has arrived nearly
                  two hours in advance,—delivered in good condition, as stated in a receipt which he
                  holds in his hand, and which purports to be from the baggage-master. "Ah! here you
                  are," says M'Fadden, taking the paper from Harry's hand, as he enters the
                  luggage-room. "Take good care on ye,—I reckon I will!" He looks down upon him with
                  an air of satisfaction. The poor preacher—the soul-glowing property—is yet
                  chained, hand and foot. He sits upon the cold floor, those imploring eyes swelling
                  at the thought that freedom only awaits him in another world. M'Fadden takes a
                  little flask from his breast pocket, and, with a motion of kindness, draws the
                  cork, passes it to him. "It's whiskey!" he says; "take a drop—do ye good, old
                  feller." Quietly the man passes it to his lips, and moistens his mouth. "No
                  winking and blinking—it's tip-top stuff," enjoins M'Fadden; "don't get it every
                  day."
               Mr. M'Fadden will take a little himself. "Glad to find ye here, all straight!" he
                  mutters, taking the flask from his mouth. He had returned the receipt to his
                  property; and, having gratified his
                  appetite a little, he begins to take a more perspective view of his theological
                  purchase.
               "Yes, master; I am here!" He again holds up his chained hands, drops his face upon
                  his knees; as much as to say, be sure I am all safe and sound.
               Looking at the receipt again, and then at his preacher, "Guess 'hain't made a bad
                  rap on ye' to-day!" he ejaculates, taking out his pocket-book and laying away the
                  precious paper as carefully as if it were a hundred dollar note. "Should like to
                  have bought your old woman and young 'uns, but hadn't tin enough. And the way
                  stock's up now, ain't slow! Look up here, my old buck! just put on a face as
                  bright and smooth as a full moon—no sulkin'. Come along here."
               The manacled preacher turns upon his hands, gets up as best he can—M'Fadden kindly
                  assists by taking hold of his shoulder—and follows his purchaser to the
                  platform,—like a submissive animal goaded to the very flesh, but chained, lest it
                  make some show of resentment. "Good heap o' work in ye', old chuck; had a master
                  what didn't understand bringing on't out, though!" mutters M'Fadden, as he
                  introduces Harry to the negro car, at the same time casting a look of satisfaction
                  at the brakeman standing at his left hand ready to receive the freight.
               In the car—a dungeon-like box about ten feet square, the only aperture for
                  admitting light being a lattice of about eight inches square, in the door—are
                  three rough negro men and one woman, the latter apparently about twenty years of
                  age.
               "Got a tall chap here, boys! Make ye stand round some, in pickin'
                  time; and can preach, too." M'Fadden shakes his head exultingly! "Can put in the
                  big licks preachin'; and I'ze goin' t' let 'im, once in a while. Goin' t' have
                  good times on my place, boys—ha'h! Got a jug of whiskey to have a fandango when ye gits home. Got it somewhere, I
                  knows." Mr. M'Fadden exults over the happy times his boys have at home. He shakes
                  himself all over, like a polar bear just out of the water, and laughs heartily. He
                  has delivered himself of something that makes everybody else laugh; the mania has
                  caught upon his own subtle self. The negroes laugh in expressive sive cadences,
                  and shrug their shoulders as Mr. M'Fadden continues to address them so sportively,
                  so familiarly. Less initiated persons might have formed very satisfactory opinions
                  of his character. He takes a peep under one of the seats, and with a rhapsody of
                  laughter draws forth a small jug. "You can't come the smuggle over me, boys! I
                  knew ye had a shot somewhere," he exclaims. At his bidding, the woman hands him a
                  gourd, from which he very deliberately helps himself to a stout draught.
               "Sit down here!—Isaac, Abraham, Daniel, or whatever yer name is—Mr. M'Fadden
                  addresses himself to his preacher. Ye'll get yer share on't when ye gits to my
                  place." He sets the jug down, and passes the gourd back, saying: "What a saucy
                  hussy ye are!" slapping the woman's black shoulder playfully. "Give him some—won't
                  ye', boys?" he concludes.
               Mr. M'Fadden (the cars are not yet ready to start, but the depôt is thronging with
                  travellers, and the engine is puffing and snorting, as the driver holds his hand
                  on the throttle, and the stoker crams with pitch pine knots the iron steed of
                  fiery swiftness) will step out and take the comfort of his cigar. He pats his
                  preacher on the shoulder, takes off his shackles, rubs his head with his hand,
                  tells the boys to keep an eye on him. "Yes, mas'r," they answer, in tones of happy
                  ignorance. The preacher must be jolly, keep on a bright face, never mind the old
                  gal and her young 'uns, and remember what a chance he will have to get another. He
                  can have two or more, if he pleases; so says his very generous owner.
               Mr. M'Fadden shakes hands with his friends on the platform, smokes his cigar
                  leisurely, mingles with the crowd importantly, thinking the while what an
                  unalloyed paragon of amiability he is. Presently the time-bell strikes its
                  warning; the crowd of passengers rush for the cars; the whistle shrieks; the
                  exhaust gives forth its gruff snorts, the connections clank, a jerk is felt, and
                  onward bounds—mighty in power, but controlled by a finger's slightest touch—the
                  iron steed, dragging its curious train of living merchandise.
               M'Fadden again finds his way to the negroes' car, where, sitting down in front of
                  his property, he will take a bird's-eye view of it. It is very fascinating to a
                  man who loves the quality of such articles as preachers. He will draw his seat somewhat closer to the minister;
                  his heart bounds with joy at the prime appearance of his purchase. Reaching out
                  his hand, he takes the cap from Harry's head, throws it into the woman's lap;
                  again rubs his hair into a friz. Thus relieved of his pleasing emotions, he will
                  pass into one of the fashionable cars, and take his place among the
                  aristocrats.
               "Boss mighty funny when 'e come t' town, and git just so 'e don't see straight:
                  wish 'e so good wen 'e out da'h on de plantation yander," ejaculates one of the
                  negroes, who answers to the name—Joe! Joe seems to have charge of the rest; but he
                  watches M'Fadden's departure with a look of sullen hatred.
               "Hard old Boss on time—an't he, boys?" enquires Harry, as an introduction to the
                  conversation.
               "Won't take ye long t' find 'um out, I reckon! Git nigger on de plantation 'e
                  don't spa' him, nohow," rejoins another.
               "Lor', man, if ye ain't tough ye'll git used up in no time, wid him!" the woman
                  speaks up, sharply. Then, pulling her ragged skirts around her, she casts a
                  sympathising look at Harry, and, raising her hand in a threatening attitude, and
                  shaking it spitefully in the direction M'Fadden has gone, says:—"If only had dat
                  man, old Boss, where 'um could revenge 'um, how a' would make 'um suffer! He don'
                  treat 'e nigger like 'e do 'e dog. If 'twarn't fo'h Buckra I'd cut 'e troat,
                  sartin." This ominous expression, delivered with such emphasis, satisfies Harry
                  that he has got into the hands of a master very unlike the kind and careless
                  Marston.
               Onward the cars speed, with clanking music making din as they go. One of the
                  negroes will add something to change the monotony. Fumbling beneath the seats for
                  some minutes, he draws forth a little bag, carefully unties it, and presents his
                  favourite violin. Its appearance gladdens the hearts of his comrades, who welcome
                  it with smiling faces and loud applause. The instrument is of the most antique and
                  original description. It has only two strings; but Simon thinks wonders of it, and
                  would not swap it for a world of modern fiddles, what don't touch the heart with
                  their music. He can bring out tremendous wailings with these two strings; such as
                  will set the whole plantation dancing. He puts it through the process of tuning,
                  adding all the scientific motions and twists of an Italian first-fiddling artiste.
                  Simon will moisten its ears by spitting on them, which he does, turning and
                  twisting himself into the attitudes of a pompous maestro. But now he has got it in
                  what he considers the very nick of tune; it makes his face glow with satisfaction.
                  "Jest—lef'—'um cum, Simon;—big and strong!" says Joe, beginning to keep time by
                  slapping his hands on his knees. And such a sawing, such a scraping, as he
                  inflicts, never machine of its kind, ancient or modern, got before. Simon and his
                  companions are in ecstasies; but such cross-grained, such painful jingling of
                  sounds! Its charm is irresistible with the negro; he mustn't lose a note of the
                  tune; every creak is exhausted in a break-down dance, which the motion of the "Jim
                  Crow" car makes more grotesque by every now and then jolting them into a huddle in
                  one corner.
               Mr. M'Fadden has been told that his property are having a lively time, and thinks
                  he will leave his aristocratic friends, and go to see it; here he is followed by
                  several young gentlemen, anxious to enjoy the hilarity of the scene.
               "All my property,—right prime, isn't it?" says M'Fadden, exultingly, nudging one
                  of the young men on the shoulder, as he, returning, enters the car. The gentleman
                  nods assent, sits down, and coolly lights his cigar. "Good thing to have a fiddler
                  on a plantation! I'd rather have it than a preacher; keeps the boys together, and
                  makes 'um a deal better contented," he adds, beginning to exhale the fumes from
                  his weed.
               "Yes!—and ye sees, fellers, how I'ze bought a parson, too. Can do the thing up
                  brown now, boys, I reckon," remarks the happy politician, slapping his
                  professional gentleman on the knee, and laughing right heartily.
               Turning to Harry with a firm look, he informs the gentlemen that "this critter's
                  kind o got the sulks, a'cos Romescos—he hates Romescos—has bought his wench and
                  young 'uns. Take that out on him, at my place," he adds.
               The dancing continues right merrily. One of the young gentlemen would like to have
                  the fiddler strike up "Down in Old Tennessee." The tune is sounded forth with all
                     that warmth of feeling the negro
                  only can add to the comical action of his body.
               "Clar' the way; let the boys have a good time," says Mr. Lawrence M'Fadden, taking
                  Harry by the arm and giving him a violent shake. He commands him to join in, and
                  have a jolly good tune with the rest on 'em.
               "Have no call for that, master. Let me act but the part of servant to you."
               "Do you mean to come nigger sulks over this child?" interrupts M'Fadden,
                  impatiently, scowling his heavy eyebrows, and casting a ferocious look at Harry.
                  After ordering him to stow himself in a corner, he gets the others upon the floor,
                  and compels them to shuffle what he calls a plantation "rip-her-up." The effect of
                  this, added to the singular positions into which they are frequently thrown by the
                  motion of the cars, affords infinite amusement.
               "You see, gentlemen, there's nothing like putting the springs of life into
                  property. Makes it worth fifty per cent. more; and then ye'll get the hard knocks
                  out to a better profit. Old southerners spoil niggers, makin' so much on 'em; and
                  soft-soapin' on 'em. That bit o' property's bin spiled just so—he points to Harry,
                  crouched in the corner—And the critter thinks he can preach! Take that out on him
                  with a round turn, when I git to my place," he continues.
               Harry cares very little for M'Fadden's conversation; he sits as quietly and
                  peaceably as if it had been addressed to some other negro. M'Fadden, that he may
                  not be found wanting in his efforts to amuse the young gentlemen, reaches out his
                  hand to one of them, takes his cigar from a case, lights it, and proceeds to keep
                  time by beating his hands on his knees.
               The train is approaching the crossing where Mr. M'Fadden will discharge his
                  property,—his human merchandise, and proceed with it some eleven miles on the high
                  road. The noise created by the exuberance of feeling on the part of Mr. M'Fadden
                  has attracted a numerous assemblage of passengers to the "Jim Crow" car. The
                  conductor views this as violating the rules of the corporation; he demands it
                  shall be stopped. All is quiet for a time; they reach the "crossing" about five
                  o'clock P.M., where, to Mr. Lawrence M'Fadden's great delight, he finds himself
                  surrounded by a promiscuous assembly of sovereign citizens, met to partake of the
                  hospitalities offered by the candidate for the Assembly, who, having offered
                  himself, expects the distinguished honour of being elected. The assembled citizens
                  will hear what the learned man's going to talk about when he gets into the
                  Assembly.
               As Mr. M'Fadden is a great politician, and a greater democrat—we speak according
                  to the southern acceptation—his presence is welcomed with an enthusiastic burst of
                  applause. Shout after shout makes the very welkin ring, as his numerous friends
                  gather round him, smile solicitously, shake him warmly by the hand, honour him as
                  the peasantry honour the Lord of the Manor.
               The crossing—one of those points so well known in the south—is a flat, wooded
                  lawn, interspersed here and there with clumps of tall pine-trees. It is generally
                  dignified with a grocery, a justice's office, and a tavern, where entertainment
                  for man and beast may always be had. An immense deal of judicial and political
                  business "is put through a process" at these strange places. The squire's law-book
                  is the oracle; all settlements must be made by it; all important sayings drawn
                  from it. The squire himself is scarcely less an individual of mysterious
                  importance; he draws settled facts from his copious volume, and thus saves himself
                  the trouble of analysing them. Open it where he will, the whys and wherefores for
                  every case are never wanting.
               Our present crossing is a place of much importance, being where the political
                  effervescence of the state often concentrates. It will not do, however, to analyse
                  that concentration, lest the fungi that give it life and power may seem to
                  conflict with the safety of law and order. On other occasions it might be taken
                  for a place of rural quiet, instead of those indescribable gatherings of the
                  rotten membranes of a bad political power.
               Here the justice's office is attached to the grocery, a little shop in which all
                  men may drink very deleterious liquor; and, in addition to the tavern, which is
                  the chief building—a quadrangular structure raised a few feet from the ground on
                  piles of the palmetto tree—there is a small church, shingled and clapboarded, and
                  having a belfry with lattice-work sides. An upper and lower veranda surround
                     the tavern, affording gentlemen an
                  opportunity to enjoy the shade.
               Several of Mr. Lawrence M'Fadden's friends meet him at the station, and, as he
                  receives his property, assist him in securing it with irons preparatory to lodging
                  it in a place of safe keeping.
               "Goin' t' make this chap a deacon on my place; can preach like sixty. It'll save
                  the trouble sendin' north for such trash as they send us. Can make this feller
                  truer on southern principles," says M'Fadden, exultingly, addressing himself to
                  his companions, looking Harry smilingly in the face, and patting him on the
                  shoulder. The gentlemen view Harry with particular admiration, and remark upon his
                  fine points with the usual satisfaction of connoisseurs. Mr. M'Fadden will secure
                  his preacher, in iron fellowship, to the left hand of the woman slave.
               "All right!" he says, as the irons are locked, and he marches his property up to
                  the tavern, where he meets mine host—a short, fat man, with a very red and
                  good-natured face, who always dresses in brown clothes, smiles, and has an extra
                  laugh for 'lection days—who stands his consequential proportions in the entrance
                  to the lower veranda, and is receiving his customers with the blandest smiles. "I
                  thinks a right smart heap on ye, or I would'nt a' 'gin ye that gal
                  for a mate," continues M'Fadden, walking along, looking at Harry earnestly, and,
                  with an air of self-congratulation, ejecting a quantity of tobacco-juice from his
                  capacious mouth. "Mr. M'Fadden is very, very welcome;" so says mine host, who
                  would have him take a social glass with his own dear self.
               Mr. M'Fadden must be excused until he has seen the place in which to deposit his
                  preacher and other property.
               "Ah, ha!"—mine host cants his ear, enquiringly;—"want grits for 'em, I s'pose?" he
                  returns, and his round fat face glows with satisfaction. "Can suit you to a
                  shavin'."
               "That's right, Colonel; I know'd ye could," ejaculates the other. Mine host is
                  much elated at hearing his title appended. Colonel Frank Jones—such is mine host's
                  name—never fought but one duel, and that was the time when, being a delegate to
                  the southern blowing-up convention, lately holden in the secession city of
                  Charleston, he entered his name on the register of the Charleston Hotel— "Colonel
                  Frank Jones, Esq., of the South Carolina Dragoons;" beneath which an impertinent
                  wag scrawled—"Corporal James Henry Williamson M'Donal Cudgo, Esq. of the same
                  regiment." Colonel Frank Jones, Esq. took this very gross insult in the highest
                  kind of dudgeon, and forthwith challenged the impertinent wag to settle the matter
                  as became gentlemen. The duel, however, ended quite as harmlessly as the
                  blowing-up convention of which Mr. Colonel Frank Jones was a delegate, the
                  seconds—thoughtless wretches—having forgot to put bullets in the weapons.
               Our readers must excuse us for digressing a little. Mine host rubs his hands,
                  draws his mouth into a dozen different puckers, and then cries out at the top of
                  his voice, "Ho, boys, ho!"
               Three or four half-clad negroes come scampering into the room, ready to answer the
                  summons. "Take charge o' this property o' my friend's here. Get 'em a good tuck
                  out o' grits."
               "Can grind 'em themselves," interrupts M'Fadden, quickly. "About the price,
                  Colonel?"
               "That's all straight," spreading his hands with an accompanying nod of
                  satisfaction: "'commodate ye with a first-rate lock-up and the grits at
                  seven-pence a day."
               "No objection." Mr. M'Fadden is entirely satisfied. The waiters take the
                  gentleman's property in charge, and conduct it to a small building, an appropriate
                  habitation of hens and pigs. It was of logs, rough hewn, without chinking; without
                  floor to keep Mr. M'Fadden's property from the ground, damp and cold. Unsuited as
                  it is to the reception of human beings, many planters of great opulence have none
                  better for their plantation people. It is about ten feet high, seven broad, and
                  eleven long.
               "Have a dandy time on't in here to-night," says Mr. M'Fadden, addressing himself
                  to Harry, as one of the waiters unlocks the door and ushers the human property
                  into its dreary abode. Mr. M'Fadden will step inside, to take a bird's-eye view of
                  the security of the place. He entertains some doubts about the faith of his
                  preacher, however, and has half an inclination to turn round as he is about making
                  his exit. He will. Approaches Harry a second time; he feels his pockets carefully,
                  and suggests that he has some
                  mischievous weapon of liberty stowed away somewhere. He presses and presses his
                  hands to his skirts and bosom. And now he knew he was not mistaken, for he feels
                  something solid in the bosom of his shirt, which is not his heart, although that
                  thing makes a deuce of a fluttering. Mr. M'Fadden's anxiety increases as he
                  squeezes his hands over its shapes, and watches the changes of Harry's
                  countenance. "Book, ha'h!" he exclaims, drawing the osnaburg tight over the square
                  with his left hand, while, with his right, he suddenly grasps Harry firmly by the
                  hair of the head, as if he has discovered an infernal machine. "Book, ha'h!"
               "Pull it out, old buck. That's the worst o' learned niggers; puts the very seven
                  devils in their black heads, and makes 'em carry their conceit right into nigger
                  stubbornness, so ye have t' bring it out by lashin' and botherin'. Can't stand
                  such nigger nonsense nohow."
               Harry has borne all very peaceably; but there is a time when even the worm will
                  turn. He draws forth the book,—it is the Bible, his hope and comforter; he has
                  treasured it near his heart—that heart that beats loudly against the rocks of
                  oppression. "What man can he be who feareth the word of God, and says he is of his
                  chosen? Master, that's my Bible: can it do evil against righteousness? It is the
                  light my burdened spirit loves, my guide—"
               "Your spirit?" inquires M'Fadden, sullenly, interrupting Harry. "A black spirit,
                  ye' mean, ye' nigger of a preacher. I didn't buy that, nor don't want it. 'Taint
                  worth seven coppers in picking time. But I tell ye, cuff, wouldn't mind lettin' on
                  ye preach, if a feller can make a spec*
                   on't." The gentleman concludes, contracting his eyebrows, and scowling at
                  his property forbiddingly.
               "You'll let me have it again when I gets on the plantation, won't ye, master?"
                  inquires Harry, calmly.
               "Let you have it on the plantation?"—Mr. M'Fadden gives his preacher a piercingly
                  fierce look—"that's just where ye won't have 't. Have any kind o' song-book ye'
                  wants; only larn 'em to other niggers, so they can put in the chorus once in a
                  while. Now, old buck (I'm a man o' genius, ye know), when niggers get larnin' the
                  Bible out o' ther' own heads, 't makes 'em sassy'r than ther's any calculatin' on.
                  It just puts the very d—l into property. Why, 
                  
                     *Good profit.
                  
                  deacon," he addresses himself to
                  Harry with more complacency, "my old father—he was as good a father as ever came
                  from Dublin—said it was just the spilin' on his children to larn 'em to read. See
                  me, now! what larnin' I'ze got; got it all don't know how: cum as nat'ral as
                  daylight. I've got the allfired'st sense ye ever did see; and it's common sense
                  what makes money. Yer don't think a feller what's got sense like me would bother
                  his head with larnin' in this ar' down south?" Mr. M'Fadden exhibits great
                  confidence in himself, and seems quite playful with his preacher, whom he pats on
                  the shoulder and shakes by the hand. "I never read three chapters in that ar' book
                  in my whole life—wouldn't neither. Really, deacon, two-thirds of the people of our
                  State can't read a word out o' that book. As for larnin', I just put me mind on
                  the thing, and got the meanin' out on't sudden."
               Mr. M'Fadden's soothing consolation, that, as he has become such a wonderful
                  specimen of mankind without learning, Harry must be a very dangerous implement of
                  progress if allowed to go about the plantation with a Bible in his pocket, seems
                  strange in this our Christian land. "Can fiddle just as much as yer mind t',"
                  concludes Mr. Lawrence M'Fadden, as he again shakes the hand of his preacher, and
                  proceeds to mingle with the political gathering, the Bible in his pocket.
           
            
            
               
               CHAPTER 
                     XXIII.
                     XXIV.
                  
               
               HOW WE MANUFACTURE POLITICAL FAITH.
               MR. M'FADDEN enters the tavern, which presents one of those grotesque scenes so
                  peculiarly southern, almost impossible for the reader to imagine, and scarcely
                  less for pen to describe. In and around the verandas are numerous armchairs,
                  occupied by the fashionable portion of the political material, who, dressed in
                  extreme profuseness, are displaying their extraordinary distinctions in jewellery
                  of heavy seals and long dangling chains. Some are young men who have enjoyed the
                  advantage of a liberal education, which they now turn into the more genial duty of
                  ornamenting themselves. They have spent much time and many valuable cosmetics on
                  their heads, all of which is very satisfactorily repaid by the smoothness of their
                  hair. Their pleasure never penetrated beyond this; they ask no more.
               They ask but little of the world, and are discussing the all-important question,
                  whether Colonel Mophany or General Vandart will get the more votes at the polls.
                  So they smoke and harangue, and drink and swear, and with inimitable
                  provincialisms fill up the clattering music. There is a fascinating piquancy in
                  the strange slang and conversational intermixture. It is a great day at the
                  crossing; the political sediment has reduced all men to one grade, one harmonious
                  whole, niggers excepted. Spirits that cannot flow one way must flow another.
               In an adjoining room sit the two candidates—gentlemen of high distinction—for the
                  votes of the sovereign people. Through those sovereign rights they will satisfy
                  their yearning desire to reach the very high position of member of the general
                  assembly. Anxiety is pictured on their very countenances; it is the fruit of care
                  when men travel the road to distinction without finding it. They are well dressed,
                  and would be modest, if modesty were worth its having in such an atmosphere.
                  Indeed, they might have been taken for men with other motives than those of
                  gaining office by wallowing in a political quagmire reeking with democratic filth.
                  Courteous to each other, they sit at a large table containing long slips of paper,
                  each candidate's sentiments printed thereon. As each voter—good fellow that he
                  is—enters the room, one or the other candidate reaches out his hand to welcome
                  him, and, as a sequel, hands him his slip, making the politest bow. Much is said
                  about the prospects of the South, and much more that is very acceptable to those
                  about to do the drinking part of the scene.
               Both candidates are very ambitious men; both profess to be the people's
                  champion—the sovereign people—the dear people—the noble-hearted people—the
                  iron-handed, unbribable, unterrified democracy—the people from whom all power
                  springs. The never-flinching, unterrified, irresistible democracy are smothered
                  with encomiums of praise, sounding from all parts of the room. Mr. Lawrence
                  M'Fadden is ushered into the room to the great joy of his friends: being a very
                  great man among the loyal voters, his appearance produces great excitement.
               Several friends of the candidates, working for their favourites, are making
                  themselves very humble in their behalf. Although there is little care for
                  maintaining any fundamental principle of government that does not serve his own
                  pocket, Mr. M'Fadden can and will control a large number of votes, do a deal of
                  knocking down at the polls, and bring up first-rate fighting men to do the keeping
                  away the opposite's constituents. Thus our man, who has lately been bought as
                  preacher, is most useful in this our little democratic world.
               Some two or three hundred persons have collected near a clump of trees on the
                  lawn, and are divided into knots intermixed with ruffian-looking desperadoes,
                  dressed most coarsely and fantastically. They are pitting their men, after the
                  fashion of good horses; then they boldly draw forth and expose the minor
                  delinquencies of opposing candidates. Among them are the "Saw-piters," who affect an air of dignity, and scout the planter's offer of work
                  so long as a herring runs the river; the "piny woods-man," of great independence
                  while rabbits are found in the woods, and he can wander over the barren
                  unrestrained; and the "Wire-Grass-Men;" and the Crackers,*
                   who live anywhere
                  
                     
                     *Singular species of gypsies, found throughout the State.
                   where and
                  everywhere, and whom the government delights to keep in ignorance, while declaring
                  it much better they were enslaved. The State possesses many thousands of these
                  people; but few of them can read, while never having written a stroke in their
                  lives is a boast. Continually armed with double-barrel guns, to hunt the panting
                  buck is one of their sports; to torture a runaway negro is another; to make free
                  with a planter's corn field is the very best. The reader may imagine this picture
                  of lean, craven faces—unshaven and made fiercely repulsive by their small,
                  treacherous eyes, if he can. It can only be seen in these our happy
                  slave states of our happy Union.
               The time draws near when the candidates will come forward, address the sovereign
                  constituency, and declare their free and open principles—their love of liberal
                  governments, and their undying affection for the great truths of democracy. The
                  scene, as the time approaches, becomes more and more animated. All are armed to
                  the teeth, with the symbol of honour—something so called—beneath their coarse
                  doublets, or in the waistbands of their pantaloons. The group evinces so much
                  excitement that belligerents are well nigh coming to blows; in fact, peace is only
                  preserved by the timely appearance of the landlord, who proclaims that unless
                  order be preserved until after the candidates have addressed them, the next barrel
                  of whiskey will positively "not be tapped." He could not use a more effectual
                  argument. Mr. M'Fadden, who exercises great authority over the minions under him,
                  at this announcement mounts the top of an empty whiskey barrel, and declares he
                  will whip the "whole crowd," if they do not cease to wage their political
                  arguments.
               While the above cursory remarks and party sparrings are going on, some forty
                  negroes are seen busily employed preparing the indispensable adjuncts of the
                  occasion—the meats. Here, beneath the clump of trees, a few yards from the grocery
                  and justices' office, the candidates' tables are being spread with cold meats,
                  crackers, bread and cheese, cigars, &c., &c. As soon as the gentlemen
                  candidates have delivered themselves of their sentiments, two barrels of real
                  "straight-back" whiskey will be added.
               "This is the way we puts our candidate through, down south, ye see, fellers,
                  voters: it's we what's the bone and siners o' the rights o' the south. It's we
                  what's got t' take the slow-coach politics out o' the hands o' them ar' old
                  harristocrats what don't think them ar' northern abolitionists han't goin to do
                  nothin. It's we, fellow citizens, what puts southern-rights principles clean
                  through; it's we what puts them ar' old Union haristocrats, what spiles all the
                  nigger property, into the straight up way o' doing things! Now, feller voters,
                  free and independent citizens—freemen who have fought for freedom,—you, whose old,
                  grey-headed fathers died for freedom! it takes you t' know what sort a thing
                  freedom is; and how to enjoy it so niggers can't take it away from you! I'ze lived
                  north way, know how it is! Yer jist the chaps to put niggers straight,—to vote for
                  my man, Colonel Mohpany," Mr. M'Fadden cries out at the very top of his voice, as
                  he comes rushing out of the tavern, edging his way through the crowd, followed by
                  the two candidates. The gentlemen look anxiously good-natured; they walk together
                  to the rostrum, followed by a crowd, measuring their way to the assembly through
                  the darling affections of our free and independent voters. Gossamer citizenship,
                  this!
               As they reach the rostrum, a carriage is seen in the distance, approaching in
                  great haste. All attention being directed to it, the first candidate, Colonel
                  Mohpany, mounts the stump, places his right hand in his bosom, and pauses as if to
                  learn who it brings. To the happy consolation of Mr. M'Fadden and his friends, it
                  bears Mr. Scranton the philosopher. Poor Mr. Scranton looks quite worn out with
                  anxiety; he has come all the way from the city, prepared with the very best kind
                  of a southern-rights speech, to relieve his friend, General Vardant, who is not
                  accustomed to public declamation. The General is a cunning fellow, fears the stump
                  accomplishments of his antagonist, and has secured the valuable services of
                  philosopher Scranton. Mr. S. will tell the constituency, in very logical
                  phraseology,—making the language suit the sentiments of his friends,—what
                  principles must be maintained; how the General depends upon the soundness of their
                  judgment to sustain him; how they are the bone and sinews of the great political
                  power of the South; how their hard, uncontrastable appearance, and their garments
                  of similar primitiveness, are emblematic of the iron firmness of their democracy.
                  Mr. Scranton will further assure them
                  that their democracy is founded on that very accommodating sort of freedom which
                  will be sure to keep all persons of doubtful colour in slavery.
               Mr. Scranton arrives, receives the congratulations of his friends, gets the
                  negroes to brush him down,—for it is difficult to distinguish him from a pillar of
                  dust, save that we have his modest eyes for assurances—takes a few glasses of
                  moderate mixture, and coolly collects his ideas. The mixture will bring out Mr.
                  Scranton's philosophical facts: and, now that he has got his face and beard
                  cleanly washed, he will proceed to the stand. Here he is received with loud
                  cheering; the gentleman is a great man, all the way from the city. Sitting on a
                  chair he is sorry was made at the north, he exhibits a deal of method in taking
                  from his pocket a long cedar pencil, with which he will make notes of all Colonel
                  Mohpany's loose points.
               The reader, we feel assured, will excuse us for not following Colonel Mohpany
                  through his speech, so laudatory of the patriotism of his friends, so much
                  interrupted by applause. The warm manner in which his conclusion is received
                  assures him that he now is the most popular man in the State. Mr. Scranton, armed
                  with his usually melancholy countenance, rises to the stump, makes his modestly
                  political bow, offers many impressive apologies for the unprepared state in which
                  he finds himself, informs his hearers that he appears before them only as a
                  substitute for his very intimate and particular friend, General Vardant. He, too,
                  has a wonderful prolixity of compliments to bestow upon the free, the patriotic,
                  the independent voters of the very independent district. He tries to be facetious;
                  but his temperament will not admit of any inconsistencies, not even in a political
                  contest. No! he must be serious; because the election of a candidate to so high an
                  office is a serious affair. So he will tell the "Saw-pit men" a great deal about
                  their noble sires; how they lived and died for liberty; how the tombstones of
                  immortality are emblazoned with the fame of their glorious deeds. And he will tell
                  these glorious squatters what inalienable rights they possess; how they must be
                  maintained; and how they have always been first to maintain the principle of
                  keeping "niggers" in their places, and resisting those mischievous propagators of
                  northern villainy—abolitionists. He will tell the deep-thinking saw-pit voters how
                  it has been charged against them that they were only independent once a year, and
                  that was when herrings run up the Santee river. Such a gross slander Mr. Scranton
                  declares to be the most impious. They were always independent; and, if they were
                  poor, and preferred to habit themselves in primitive garbs, it was only because
                  they preferred to be honest! This, Mr. Scranton, the northern philosopher, asserts
                  with great emphasis. Yes! they are honest; and honest patriots are always better
                  than rich traitors. From the san-pit men, Mr. Scranton, his face distended with
                  eloquence, turns to his cracker and "wire-grass" friends, upon whom he bestows
                  most piercing compliments. Their lean mules—the speaker laughs at his own wit—and
                  pioneer waggons always remind him of the good old times, when he was a boy, and
                  everybody was so honest it was unnecessary even to have such useless finery as
                  people put on at the present day. A word or two, very derogatory of the
                  anti-slavery people, is received with deafening applause. Of the descendants of
                  the Huguenots he says but little; they are few, rich, and very unpopular in this
                  part of the little sovereign state. And he quite forgot to tell this unlettered
                  mass of a sovereign constituency the true cause of their poverty and degradation.
                  Mr. Scranton, however, in one particular point, which is a vital one to the
                  slave-ocracy, differs with the ungovernable Romescos,—he would not burn all common
                  schools, nor scout all such trash as schoolmasters.
               In another part of Mr. Scranton's speech he enjoins them to be staunch supporters
                  of men known to be firm to the south, and who would blow up every
                  yankee who came south, and refused to declare his sentiments to be for concession.
                  "You!"—he points round him to the grotesque crowd—"were first to take a stand and
                  keep niggers down; to keep them where they can't turn round and enslave you! Great
                  Britain, 
                     fell ercitizens
                     feller citizens
                  ,"—Mr. Scranton begins to wax warm; he adjusts his coat sleeves, and
                  draws himself into a tragic attitude as he takes his tobacco from his mouth,
                  seemingly unconscious of his own enthusiasm—I say Great Britain—" A sudden
                  interruption is caused. Mr. Scranton's muddled quid, thrown with such violence,
                  has bedaubed the cheek of an admiring saw-pitter, whose mind was completely
                  absorbed in his eloquence. He was listening with breathless suspense, and only saved its admission in his
                  capacious mouth by closing it a few seconds before.
               "Sarved him just right; keep on, Colonel!" exclaims Mr. M'Fadden. He takes the man
                  by the arm, pushes him aside, and makes a slight bow to Mr. Scranton. He would
                  have him go on.
               "Great Britain—feller citizens, I say—was first to commence the warfare against
                  nigger slavery; and now she is joining the north to seek its permanent overthrow.
                  She is a monster tyrant wherever she sets her foot—I say! (Three cheers for that.)
                  She contributed to fasten the curse upon us; and now she wants to destroy us by
                  taking it away according to the measures of the northern abolitionists—fanaticism!
                  Whatever the old school southerner neglects to do for the preservation of the
                  peculiar institution, we must do for him! And we, who have lived at the north,
                  can, with your independent support, put the whole thing through a course of
                  political crooks." Again Mr. Scranton pauses; surveys his assembly of free and
                  independent citizens.
               "That we can: I knows what fanatics down east be!" rejoins Mr. M'Fadden, shaking
                  his head very knowingly. He laughs with an air of great satisfaction, as much as
                  to say that, with such northern philosophers to do the championism of slavery in
                  the south, all the commercial relations for which northern merchants are under so
                  many obligations to slave-labour, will be perfectly safe. But Mr. Scranton has
                  drawn out his speech to such an uncommon length, that the loquacious M'Fadden is
                  becoming decidedly wearied. His eyes begin to glow languid, and the lids to
                  close,—and now he nods assent to all Mr. Scranton's sayings, which singularly
                  attracts the attention of that orator's hearers. The orator becomes very much
                  annoyed at this, suddenly stops—begs Mr. M'Fadden will postpone his repose. This,
                  from so great a man as Mr. Scranton, is accepted as provokingly witty. Mr.
                  M'Fadden laughs; and they all laugh. The gentleman will continue his speech.
               "The South must come out; must establish free trade, direct trade,—trade that will
                  free her from her disreputable association with the North. She can do it!" Mr.
                  Scranton wipes his forehead with his white pocket-handkerchief.
               "Ain't we deeply indebted to the North?" a voice in the crowd cries out.
               "Well! what if we are? Can't we offset the debts on the principles of war? Let it
                  go against the injury of abolition excitements!" Mr. Scranton makes a theatrical
                  flourish with his right hand, and runs the fingers of his left through his crispy
                  hair, setting it on end like quills on a porcupine's back. Three long and loud
                  cheers follow, and the gentleman is involuntarily compelled to laugh at his own
                  singular sayings. "The South must hold conventions; she must enforce
                  constitutional guarantees; she must plant herself in the federal capital, and
                  plead her cause at the bar of the world. She will get a hearing there! And she
                  must supplant that dangerous engine of abolition, now waging war against our
                  property, our rights, our social system." Thus concluding, Mr. Scranton sits down,
                  very much fatigued from his mental effervescence, yet much lighter from having
                  relieved himself of his speech, amidst a storm of applause. Such a throwing up of
                  hats and slouches, such jostling, abetting, and haranguing upon the merits of the
                  candidates, their speeches and their sentiments, never was heard or seen
                  before.
               Mine host now mounts the stand to make the welcome announcement, that, the
                  speeches being over, the eating entertainments are ready. He hopes the friends of
                  the candidates will repair to the tables, and help themselves without stint or
                  restraint. As they are on the point of rushing upon the tables, Colonel Mohpany
                  suddenly jumps up, and arrests the progress of the group by intimating that he has
                  one word more to say. That word is, his desire to inform the bone and sinew of the
                  constituency that his opponent belongs to a party which once declared in the
                  Assembly that they—the very men who stand before him now—were a
                     dangerous class unless reduced to slavery! The Colonel has scarcely
                  delivered himself of this very clever charge, when the tables, a few yards
                  distant, are surrounded by promiscuous friends and foes, who help themselves after
                  the fashion most advantageous. All rules of etiquette are unceremoniously
                  dispensed with,—he who can secure most is the best diplomatist. Many find their
                  mouths so inadequate to the temptation of the feast, that they improve on Mr.
                  Scranton's philosophy by making good use of their ample pockets. Believe us,
                  reader, the entertainment is the essential part of the candidate's political
                  virtue, which must be measured
                  according to the extent of his cold meats and very bad whiskey.
               To carry out the strength of General Vardant's principles, several of his
                  opponent's friends are busily employed in circulating a report that his barrel of
                  whiskey has been "brought on" only half full. A grosser slander
                  could not have been invented. But the report gains circulation so fast, that his
                  meats and drinks are mischievously absorbed, and the demonstration of his
                  unpopular position begins to be manifest. The candidates, unflinching in their
                  efforts, mix with the medley, have the benefit of the full exercise of free
                  thought and action, hear various opinions upon "the Squire's chances," and listen
                  to the chiming of high-sounding compliments. While this clanging of merry jargon
                  is at its highest, as if by some magic influence Romescos makes his appearance,
                  and immediately commences to pit sides with Mr. M'Fadden. With all Romescos'
                  outlawry, he is tenacious of his southern origin; and he will assert its rights
                  against Mr. M'Fadden, whom he declares to be no better than a northern humbug,
                  taking advantage of southern institutions. To him all northerners are great
                  vagabonds, having neither principles nor humanity in their composition; he makes
                  the assertion emphatically, without fear or trembling; and he calls upon his
                  friends to sustain him, that he may maintain the rights of the South. Those rights
                  Romescos asserts, and re-asserts, can only be preserved by southern men—not by
                  sneaking northerners, who, with their trade, pocket their souls. Northerners are
                  great men for whitewashing their faces with pretence! Romescos is received with
                  considerable éclat. He declares, independently,
                  that Mr. Scranton too is no less a sheer humbug of the same stripe, and whose
                  humbugging propensities make him the humble servant of the south so long as he can
                  make a dollar by the bemeaning operation. His full and unmeasured appreciation of
                  all this northern-southern independence is here given to the world for the world's
                  good. And he wants the world to particularly understand, that the old southerner
                  is the only independent man, the only true protector of humanity!
               Romescos' sudden appearance, and the bold stand he takes against Mr. M'Fadden and
                  his candidate, produce the utmost confusion; he being unpopular with the saw-pit
                  men, with whom he once exhibited considerable dexterity in carrying off one of
                  their number and putting the seal of slavery on him, they take sides against him.
                  It is the Saw-pitters against Romescos and the Crackers. The spirits have flowed,
                  and now the gods of our political power sway to and fro under most
                  violent shocks. Many, being unable to keep a perpendicular, are accusing each
                  other of all sorts of misdeeds—of the misdeeds of their ancestors—of the specific
                  crimes they committed—the punishments they suffered. From personalities of their
                  own time they descend forth into jeering each other on matters of family frailty,
                  setting what their just deserts would have entitled them to receive. They continue
                  in this strain of jargon for some time, until at length it becomes evident the
                  storm of war is fast approaching a crisis. Mr. M'Fadden is mentally unprepared to
                  meet this crisis, which Romescos will make to suit himself; and to this end the
                  comical and somewhat tragical finale seems pretty well understood by the
                  candidates and a few of the "swell-ocracy," who have assembled more to see the
                  grand representation of physical power on the part of these free and
                  enlightened citizens, than to partake of the feast or listen to the rhetoric of
                  the speeches. In order to get a good view of the scene they have ascended trees,
                  where, perched among their branches like so many jackals, they cheer and urge on
                  the sport, as the nobility of Spain applaud a favourite champion of the ring. At
                  length the opposing parties doff their hats and coats, draw knives, make
                  threatening grimaces, and twirl their steel in the air: their desperation is
                  earnest; they make an onset, charging with the bravado of men determined to
                  sacrifice life. The very air resounds with their shouts of blasphemy; blood flows
                  from deep incisions of bowie-knives, garments are rent into shreds; and men seem
                  to have betaken themselves to personating the demons.
               Would that they were rational beings! would that they were men capable of
                  constituting a power to protect the liberty of principle and the justice of law!
                  Shout after shout goes up; tumult is triumphant. Two fatal rencontres are
                  announced, and Mr. Lawrence M'Fadden is dangerously wounded; he has a cut in the
                  abdomen. The poor victims attract but little attention; such little trifling
                  affairs are very common, scarcely worth a word of commiseration. One gentleman
                  insinuates that the affair has been a
                  desperately amusing one; another very coolly adds, that this
                  political feed has had much more interest in it than any preceding one.
               The victims are rolled in blankets, and laid away in the corn-shed; they will
                  await the arrival of the coroner, who, the landlord says, it will be no more than
                  right to send for. They are only two dead Crackers, however, and nobody doubts
                  what the verdict will be. In truth—and it must be told once in a while, even in
                  our atmosphere—the only loss is the two votes, which the candidate had already
                  secured with his meat and drink, and which have now, he regrets, been returned to
                  the box of death instead of his ballot. Poor voters, now only fit to serve the
                  vilest purpose! how degraded in the scale of human nature is the being, only worth
                  a suffrance at elections, where votes cast from impulse control the balance of
                  power. Such beings are worth just nothing; they would not sell in the market. The
                  negro waiters say, "It don't make a bit of matter how much white rubbish like this
                  is killed, it won't fetch a bid in the market; and when you sell it, it won't stay
                  sold."
               "Lose I dat way, Cato, might jist as well take tousand dollar straight out o'
                  mas'r's pocket; but dese critters b'nt notin' nohow," says old Daniel, one of the
                  servants, who knows the value of his own body quite well. Daniel exults as he
                  looks upon the dead bodies he is assisting to deposit in the corn-shed.
               Mr. M'Fadden is carefully borne into the tavern, where, after much difficulty, he
                  is got up stairs and laid on a very nice bed, spread with snowy white linen. A
                  physician is called, and his wound dressed with all possible skill and attention.
                  He is in great pain, however; begs his friends to bestow all care upon him, and
                  save no expense.
               Thus ends our political day. The process of making power to shape the social and
                  political weal of our State, closes.
            
            
               CHAPTER 
                     XXIV.
                     XXV.
                  
               
               MR. M'FADDEN SEES SHADOWS IN THE FUTURE.
               NIGHT has quickly drawn its curtain over the scene. Mr. M'Fadden lies on his bed,
                  writhing under the pain of the poisoned wound. He left his preacher locked up for
                  the night in a cold hovel, and he has secured the dangerous Bible, lest it lessen
                  his value. Mr. M'Fadden, however, feels that now his earthly career is fast
                  closing he must seek redemption. Hie has called in the aid of a physician, who
                  tells him there is great danger, and little hope unless his case takes a
                  favourable turn about midnight. The professional gentleman merely suggests this,
                  but the suggestion conveys an awful warning. All the misdeeds of the past cloud
                  before his eyes; they summon him to make his peace with his Maker. He remembers
                  what has been told him about the quality of mercy,—the duration of hope in
                  redemption,—which he may secure by rendering justice to those he has wronged. But
                  now conscience wars with him; he sees the fierce elements of retribution gathering
                  their poisoned shafts about him; he quails lest their points pierce his heart; and
                  he sees the God of right arraigning him at the bar of justice. There, that
                  Dispenser of all Good sits in his glory and omnipotence, listening while the
                  oppressed recites his sufferings: the oppressed there meets him face to face,
                  robed in that same garb of submission which he has inflicted upon him on earth.
                  His fevered brain gives out strange warnings,—warnings in which he sees the angel
                  of light unfolding the long list of his injustice to his fellow man, and an angry
                  God passing the awful sentence. Writhing, turning, and contorting his face, his
                  very soul burns with the agony of despair. He grasps the hand of his physician,
                  who leans over his wounded body, and with eyes distorted and glassy, stares wildly
                  and frantically round the room. Again, as if suffering inward torture, he springs
                  from his pillow, utters fierce imprecations against the visions that surround him,
                  grasps at them with his outstretched
                  stretched fingers, motions his hand backward and forward, and breaks out into
                  violent paroxysms of passion, as if struggling in the unyielding grasp of
                  death.
               That physical power which has so long borne him up in his daily pursuits yields to
                  the wanderings of his haunted mind. He lays his hand upon the physician's shoulder
                  as his struggles now subside, looks mournfully in his face, and rather mutters
                  than speaks: "Bring—bring—bring him here: I'll see him,—I must see him! I—I—I took
                  away the book; there's what makes the sting worse! And when I close my eyes I see
                  it burning fiercely—"
               "Who shall I bring?" interrupts the physician, mildly, endeavouring to soothe his
                  feelings by assuring him there is no danger, if he will but remain calm.
               "Heaven is casting its thick vengeance round me; heaven is consuming me with the
                  fire of my own heart! How can I be calm, and my past life vaulted with a glow of
                  fire? The finger of Almighty God points to that deed I did today. I deprived a
                  wretch of his only hope: that wretch can forgive me before heaven. Y-e-s, he
                  can,—can speak for me,—can intercede for me; he can sign my repentance, and save
                  me from the just vengeance of heaven. His—his—his—"
               "What?" the physician whispers, putting his ear to his mouth. "Be calm."
               "Calm!" he mutters in return.
               "Neither fear death nor be frightened at its shadows—"
               "It's life, life, life I fear—not death!" he gurgles out. "Bring him to me; there
                  is the Bible. Oh! how could I have robbed him of it! 'Twas our folly—all folly—my
                  folly!" Mr. M'Fadden had forgotten that the bustle of current life was no excuse
                  for his folly; that it would be summed up against him in the day of trouble. He
                  never for once thought that the Bible and its teachings were as dear to slave as
                  master, and that its truths were equally consoling in the hour of death. In life
                  it strengthens man's hopes; could it have been thus with M'Fadden before death
                  placed its troubled sea before his eyes, how happy he would have died in the
                  Lord!
               The emphatic language, uttered in such supplicating tones, and so at variance with
                  his habits of life, naturally excited the feelings of his physician, whose only
                  solicitude had been evinced in his efforts to save life,—to heal the wound. Never
                  had he watched at a patient's bed-side who had exhibited such convulsions of
                  passion,—such fears of death.
               Now struggling against a storm of convulsions, then subsiding into sluggish
                  writhings, accompanied with low moans, indicating more mental disquietude than
                  bodily pain. Again he is quiet; points to his coat.
               The physician brings it forward and lays it upon the bed, where Mr. M'Fadden can
                  put his hand upon it. "It is there—in there!" he says, turning on his left side,
                  and with a solicitous look pointing to the pockets of his coat. The professional
                  gentleman does not understand him.
               He half raises himself on his pillow, but sinks back fatigued, and faintly
                  whispers, "Oh, take it to him—to him! Give him the comforter: bring him, poor
                  fellow, to me, that his spirit may be my comforter!"
               The physician understands, puts his hand into the pocket; draws forth the little
                  boon companion. It is the Bible, book of books; its great truths have borne Harry
                  through many trials,—he hopes it will be his shield and buckler to carry him
                  through many more. Its associations are as dear to him as its teachings are
                  consoling in the days of tribulation. It is dear to him, because the promptings of
                  a noble-hearted woman secretly entrusted it to his care, in violation of slavery's
                  statutes. Its well-worn pages bear testimony of the good service it has done. It
                  was Franconia's gift—Franconia, whose tender emotions made her the friend of the
                  slave—made in the kindness of woman's generous nature. The good example, when
                  contrasted with the fierce tenor of slavery's fears, is worthy many followers.
               But men seldom profit by small examples, especially when great fears are
                  paramount.
               The physician, holding the good book in his hand, enquires if Mr. M'Fadden would
                  have him read from it? He has no answer to make, turns his feverish face from it,
                  closes his eyes, and compressing his forehead with his hands, mutely shakes his
                  head. A minute or two passes in silence; he has re-considered the point,—answers,
                  no! He wants Harry brought to him, that he may acknowledge his crimes; that he may
                  quench the fire of unhappiness burning within him. "How seldom we think of death
                  while in life,—and how painful to see death while gathering together the dross
                     of this worldly chaos! Great, great,
                  great is the reward of the good, and mighty is the hand of Omnipotence that,
                  holding the record of our sins, warns us to prepare." As Mr. M'Fadden utters these
                  words, a coloured woman enters the room to enquire if the patient wants
                  nourishment. She will wait at the door.
               The physician looks at the patient; the patient shakes his head and whispers,
                  "Only the boy. The boy I bought to-day." The Bible lays at his side on the sheet.
                  He points to it, again whispering, "The boy I took it from!"
               The boy, the preacher, Mr. M'Fadden's purchase, can read; she will know him by
                  that; she must bring him from the shed, from his cold bed of earth. That crime of
                  slavery man wastes his energies to make right, is wrong in the sight of heaven;
                  our patient reads the glaring testimony as the demons of his morbid fancy haunt
                  him with their damning terrors, their ghastly visages.
               "Go, woman, bring him!" he whispers again.
               Almost motionless the woman stands. She has seen the little book—she knows it, and
                  her eyes wander over the inscription on the cover. A deep blush shadows her
                  countenance; she fixes her piercing black eyes upon it until they seem melting
                  into sadness; with a delicacy and reserve at variance with her menial condition,
                  she approaches the bed, lays her hand upon the book, and, while the physician's
                  attention is attracted in another direction, closes its pages, and is about to
                  depart.
               "Can you tell which one he wants, girl?" enquires the physician, in a stern
                  voice.
               "His name, I think, is Harry; and they say the poor thing can preach; forgive me
                  what I have done to him, oh Lord! It is the weakness of man grasping the things of
                  this world, to leave behind for the world's nothingness," says Mr. M'Fadden, as
                  the woman leaves the room giving an affirmative reply.
               The presence of the Bible surprised the woman; she knew it as the one much used by
                  Harry, on Marston's plantation. It was Franconia's gift! The associations of the
                  name touched the chord upon which hung the happiest incidents of her life.
                  Retracing her steps down the stairs, she seeks mine host of the tavern, makes
                  known the demand, and receives the keys of this man-pen of our land of liberty.
                  Lantern in hand, she soon reaches the door, unlocks it gently, as if she expects
                  the approach of some strange object, and fears a sudden surprise.
               There the poor dejected wretches lay; nothing but earth's surface for a bed,—no
                  blanket to cover them. They have eaten their measure of corn, and are sleeping;
                  they sleep while chivalry revels! Harry has drawn his hat partly over his face,
                  and made a pillow of the little bundle he carried under his arm.
               Passing from one to the other, the woman approaches him, as if to see if she can
                  recognise any familiar feature. She stoops over him, passes the light along his
                  body, from head to foot, and from foot to head. "Can it be our Harry?" she
                  mutters. "It can't be; master wouldn't sell him." Her eyes glare with anxiety as
                  they wander up and down his sleeping figure.
               "Harry,—Harry,—Harry! which is Harry?" she demands.
               Scarcely has she lisped the words, when the sleeper starts to his feet, and sets
                  his eyes on the woman with a stare of wonderment. His mind wanders—bewildered; is
                  he back on the old plantation? That cannot be; they would not thus provide for him
                  there. "Back at the old home! Oh, how glad I am: yes, my home is there, with good
                  old master. My poor old woman; I've nothing for her, nothing," he says, extending
                  his hand to the woman, and again, as his mind regains itself, their glances become
                  mutual; the sympathy of two old associates gushes forth from the purest of
                  fountains,—the oppressed heart.
               "Harry—oh, Harry! is it you?"
               "Ellen! my good Ellen, my friend, and old master's friend!" is the simultaneous
                  salutation.
               "Sold you, too?" enquires Harry, embracing her with all the fervour of a father
                  who has regained his long-lost child. She throws her arms about his neck, and
                  clings to him, as he kisses, and kisses, and kisses her olive brow.
               "My sale, Harry, was of little consequence; but why did they sell you? (Her
                  emotions have swollen into tears). You must tell me all, to-night! You must tell
                  me of my child, my Nicholas,—if master cares for him, and how he looks, grows, and
                  acts. Oh, how my heart beats to have him at my side;—when, when will that day
                  come! I would have him with me, even if sold for the purpose." Tears gush down her cheeks, as Harry, encircling
                  her with his arm, whispers words of consolation in her ear.
               "If we were always for this world, Ellen, our lot could not be borne. But heaven
                  has a recompense, which awaits us in the world to come. Ellen!"—he holds her from
                  him and looks intently in her face—"masters are not to blame for our
                  sufferings,—the law is the sinner! Hope not, seek not for common justice, rights,
                  privileges, or anything else while we are merchandise among men who, to please
                  themselves, gamble with our souls and bodies. Take away that injustice, Ellen, and
                  men who now plead our unprofitableness would hide their heads with shame. Make us
                  men, and we will plead our own cause; we will show to the world that we are men;
                  black men, who can be made men when they are not made merchandise." Ellen must
                  tell him what has brought her here, first! He notices sad changes in her
                  countenance, and feels anxious to listen to the recital of her troubles.
               She cannot tell him now, and begs that he will not ask her, as the recollection of
                  them fills her heart with sorrow. She discloses the object of her mission, will
                  guide him to his new master, who, they say, is going to die, and feels very bad
                  about it. He was a desperate man on his plantation, and has become the more
                  contrite at death's call. "I hope God will forgive him!"
               "He will!—He will! He is forgiving," interrupts Harry, hurriedly.
               Ellen reconnoitres the wearied bodies of the others as they lie around. "Poor
                  wretches! what can I do for them?" she says, holding the lamp over them. She can
                  do but little for them, poor girl. The will is good, but the wherewith she hath
                  not. Necessity is a hard master; none know it better than the slave woman. She
                  will take Harry by the hand, and, retracing her steps, usher him into the presence
                  of the wounded man. Pressing his hand as she opens the door, she bids him good
                  night, and retires to her cabin. "Poor Harry!" she says, with a sigh.
               The kind woman is Ellen Juvarna. She has passed another eventful stage of her
                  eventful life. Mine host, good fellow, bought her of Mr. O'Brodereque, that's
                  all!
            
            
               CHAPTER 
                     XXV.
                     XXVI.
                  
               
               HOW THEY STOLE THE PREACHER.
               THE scenes we have described in the foregoing chapter have not yet been brought to
                  a close. In and about the tavern may be seen groups of men, in the last stage of
                  muddled mellowness, the rank fumes of bad liquor making the very air morbid.
                  Conclaves of grotesque figures are seated in the veranda and drinking-room,
                  breaking the midnight stillness with their stifled songs, their frenzied
                  congratulations, their political jargon; nothing of fatal consequence would seem
                  to have happened.
               "Did master send for me? You've risen from a rag shop, my man!" interrupts the
                  physician.
               "Master there—sorry to see him sick—owns me." Harry cast a subdued look on the bed
                  where lay his late purchaser.
               Harry's appearance is not the most prepossessing,—he might have been taken for
                  anything else but a minister of the gospel; though the quick eye of the southerner
                  readily detected those frank and manly features which belong to a class of very
                  dark men who exhibit uncommon natural genius.
               At the sound of Harry's voice, M'Fadden makes an effort to raise himself on his
                  elbow. The loss of blood has so reduced his physical power that his effort is
                  unsuccessful. He sinks back, prostrate,—requests the physician to assist him in
                  turning over. He will face his preacher. Putting out his hand, he embraces him
                  cordially,—motions him to be seated.
               The black preacher, that article of men merchandise, takes a seat at the bed-side,
                  while the man of medicine withdraws to the table. The summons is as acceptable to
                  Harry as it is strange to the physician, who has never before witnessed so strange
                  a scene of familiarity between slave and master. All is silent for several
                  minutes. Harry looks at his master, as if questioning the motive for which he is
                  summoned into his presence; and still he can read the deep anxiety playing upon M'Fadden's distorted countenance.
                  At length, Harry, feeling that his presence may be intrusive, breaks the silence
                  by enquiring if there is anything he can do for master. Mr. M'Fadden whispers
                  something, lays his trembling hand on Harry's, casts a meaning glance at the
                  physician, and seems to swoon. Returning to his bed-side, the physician lays his
                  hand upon the sick man's brow; he will ascertain the state of his system.
               "Give—him—his—Bible," mutters the wounded man, pointing languidly to the table.
                  "Give it to him that he may ask God's blessing for me—for me—for me,—"
               The doctor obeys his commands, and the wretch, heart bounding with joy, receives
                  back his inspiring companion. It is dear to him, and with a smile of gratitude
                  invading his countenance he returns thanks. There is pleasure in that little book.
                  "And now, Harry, my boy," says M'Fadden, raising his hand to Harry's shoulder, and
                  looking imploringly in his face as he regains strength; "forgive what I have done.
                  I took from you that which was most dear to your feelings; I took it from you when
                  the wounds of your heart were gushing with grief—" He makes an effort to say more,
                  but his voice fails; he will wait a few moments.
               The kind words touch Harry's feelings; tears glistening in his eyes tell how he
                  struggles to suppress the emotions of his heart. "Did you mean my wife and
                  children, master?" he enquires.
               M'Fadden, somewhat regaining strength, replies in the affirmative. He acknowledges
                  to have seen that the thing "warn't just right." His imagination has been
                  wandering through the regions of heaven, where, he is fully satisfied, there is no
                  objection to a black face. God has made a great opening in his eyes and heart just
                  now. He sees and believes such things as he neither saw nor believed before; they
                  pass like clouds before his eyes, never, never to be erased from his memory. Never
                  before has he thought much about repentance; but now that he sees heaven on one
                  side and hell on the other, all that once seemed right in bartering and selling
                  the bodies and souls of men, vanishes. There, high above all, is the vengeance of
                  heaven written in letters of blood, execrating such acts, and pointing to the
                  retribution. It is a burning consciousness of all the suffering he has inflicted
                  upon his negroes. Death, awful monitor! stares him in the face; it holds the stern
                  realities of truth and justice before him; it tells him of the wrong,—points him
                  to the right. The unbending mandates of slave law, giving to man power to debase
                  himself with crimes the judicious dare not punish, are being consumed before
                  Omnipotence, the warning voice of which is calling him to his last account.
               And now the wounded man is all condescension, hoping forgiveness! His spirit has
                  yielded to Almighty power; he no longer craves for property in man; no, his coarse
                  voice is subdued into softest accents. He whispers "coloured man," as if the
                  merchandise changed as his thoughts are brought in contact with revelations of the
                  future.
               "Take the Bible, my good boy—take it, read it to me, before I die. Read it, that
                  it may convert my soul. If I have neglected myself on earth, forgive me; receive
                  my repentance, and let me be saved from eternal misery. Read, my dear good
                  boy,"—M'Fadden grasps his hand tighter and tighter—"and let your voice be a
                  warning to those who never look beyond earth and earth's enjoyments." The
                  physician thinks his patient will get along until morning, and giving directions
                  to the attendants, leaves him.
               Harry has recovered from the surprise which so sudden a change of circumstances
                  produced, and has drawn from the patient the cause of his suffering. He opens the
                  restored Bible, and reads from it, to Mr. M'Fadden's satisfaction. He reads from
                  Job; the words producing a deep effect upon the patient's mind.
               The wretched preacher, whose white soul is concealed beneath black skin, has
                  finished his reading. He will now address himself to his master, in the following
                  simple manner.
               "Master, it is one thing to die, and another to die happy. It is one thing to be
                  prepared to die, another to forget that we have to die, to leave the world and its
                  nothingness behind us. But you are not going to die, not now. Master, the Lord
                  will forgive you if you, make your repentance durable. 'Tis only the fear of death
                  that has produced the change on your mind. Do, master! learn the Lord; be just to
                  we poor creatures, for the Lord now tells you it is not right to buy and sell
                  us."
               
               "Buy and sell you!" interrupts the frightened man, making an effort to rise from
                  his pillow; "that I never will, man nor woman. If God spares my life, my people
                  shall be liberated; I feel different on that subject, now! The difference between
                  the commerce of this world and the glory of heaven brightens before me. I was an
                  ignorant man on all religious matters; I only wanted to be set right in the way of
                  the Lord,—that's all." Again he draws his face under the sheet, writhing with the
                  pain of his wound.
               "I wish everybody could see us as master does, about this time; for surely God can
                  touch the heart of the most hardened. But master ain't going to die so soon as he
                  thinks," mutters Harry, wiping the sweat from his face, as he lays his left hand
                  softly upon master's arm. "God guide us in all coming time, and make us forget the
                  retribution that awaits our sins!" he concludes, with a smile glowing on his
                  countenance.
               The half spoken words catch upon the patient's ear. He starts suddenly from his
                  pillow, as if eager to receive some favourable intelligence. "Don't you think my
                  case dangerous, my boy? Do you know how deep is the wound?" he enquires, his
                  glassy eyes staring intently at Harry.
               "It is all the same, master!" is the reply.
               "Give me your hand again"—M'Fadden grasps his hand and seems to revive—"pray for
                  me now; your prayers will be received into heaven, they will serve me there!"
               "Ah, master," says Harry, kindly, interrupting him at this juncture, "I feel more
                  than ever like a christian. It does my heart good to hear you talk so true, so
                  kind. How different from yesterday! then I was a poor slave, forced from my
                  children, with nobody to speak a kind word for me; everybody to reckon me as a
                  good piece of property only. I forgive you, master—I forgive you; God is a loving
                  God, and will forgive you also." The sick man is consoled; and, while his preacher
                  kneels at his bed-side, offering up a prayer imploring forgiveness, he listens to
                  the words as they fall like cooling drops on his burning soul. The earnestness—the
                  fervency and pathos of the words, as they gush forth from the lips of a wretch,
                  produce a still deeper effect upon the wounded man. Nay, there is even a chord
                  loosened in his heart; he sobs audibly. "Live on earth so as to be prepared for
                  heaven; that when death knocks at the door you may receive him as a welcome guest.
                  But, master! you cannot meet our Father in heaven while the sin of selling men
                  clings to your garments. Let your hair grow grey with justice, and God will reward
                  you," he concludes.
               "True, Harry; true!—he lays his hand on the black man's shoulder, is about to
                  rise—"it is the truth plainly told, and nothing more." He will have a glass of
                  water to quench his thirst; Harry must bring it to him, for there is consolation
                  in his touch. Seized with another pain, he grasps with his left hand the arm of
                  his consoler, works his fingers through his matted hair, breathes violently,
                  contorts his face haggardly, as if suffering acutely. Harry waits till the spasm
                  has subsided, then calls an attendant to watch the patient while he goes to the
                  well. This done he proceeds into the kitchen to enquire for a vessel. Having
                  entered that department as the clock strikes two, he finds Ellen busily engaged
                  preparing food for Mr. M'Fadden's property, which is yet fast secured in the pen.
                  Feeling himself a little more at liberty to move about unrestrained, he procures a
                  vessel, fills it at the well, carries it to his master's bed-side, sees him
                  comfortably cared for, and returns to the kitchen, where he will assist Ellen in
                  her mission of goodness.
               The little pen is situated a few yards from the tavern, on the edge of a clump of
                  tall pines.
               Ellen has got ready the corn and bacon, and with Harry she proceeds to the pen,
                  where the property are still enjoying that inestimable boon,—a deep sleep.
               "Always sleeping," he says, waking them one by one at the announcement of corn and
                  bacon. "Start up and get something good my girl has prepared for you." He shakes
                  them, while Ellen holds the lantern. There is something piercing in the
                  summons—meats are strong arguments with the slave—they start from their slumbers,
                  seize upon the food, and swallow it with great relish. Harry and Ellen stand
                  smiling over the gusto with which they swallow their coarse meal.
               "You must be good boys to-night. Old master's sick; flat down on e' back, and
                  'spects he's going to die, he does." Harry shakes his head as he tells it to the
                  astonished merchandise. "Had a great time at the crossing to-day; killed two or
                  three certain, and almost put master on the plank."
               
               "'Twarn't no matter, nohow: nobody lose nofin if old Boss do die: nigger on e'
                  plantation don' put e' hat in mournin'," mutters the negro woman, with an air of
                  hatred. She has eaten her share of the meal, shrugs her shoulders, and again
                  stretches her valuable body on the ground.
               "Uncle Sparton know'd old Boss warn't gwine t' be whar de debil couldn't cotch
                  'em, so long as 'e tink. If dat old mas'r debil, what white man talk 'bout so
                  much, don' gib 'em big roasting win 'e git 'e dah, better hab no place wid fireins
                  fo' such folks," speaks up old Uncle Sparton, one of the negroes, whose face
                  shines like a black-balled boot.
               "Neber mind dat, Uncle Sparton; 'taint what ye say 'bout he. Ven mas'r debil cotch
                  old Boss 'e don't cotch no fool. Mas'r debil down yander find old Boss too tuf fo'
                  he business; he jus' like old hoss what neber die," rejoins another.
               In a word, M'Fadden had told his negroes what a great democrat he was—how he loved
                  freedom and a free country—until their ideas of freedom became strangely
                  mystified; and they ventured to assert that he would not find so free a country
                  when the devil became his keeper. "Mas'r tink 'e carry 'e plantation t' t'oder
                  world wid him, reckon," Uncle Sparton grumblingly concludes, joining the motley
                  conclave of property about to resume its repose.
               Ellen returns to the house. Harry will remain, and have a few words more with the
                  boys. A few minutes pass, and Ellen returns with an armful of blankets, with which
                  she covers the people carefully and kindly. How full of goodness—how touching is
                  the act! She has done her part, and she returns to the house in advance of Harry,
                  who stops to take a parting good-night, and whisper a word of consolation in their
                  ears. He looks upon them as dear brothers in distress, objects for whom he has a
                  fellow sympathy. He leaves them for the night; closes the door after him; locks
                  it. He will return to Ellen, and enjoy a mutual exchange of feeling.
               Scarcely has he left the door, when three persons, disguised, rush upon him,
                  muffle his head with a blanket, bind his hands and feet, throw him bodily into a
                  waggon, and drive away at a rapid speed.
            
            
               CHAPTER 
                     XXVI.
                     XXVII.
                  
               
               COMPETITION IN HUMAN THINGS.
               IT is enough to inform the reader that Romescos and Mr. M'Fadden were not only
                  rival bidders for this very desirable piece of preaching property, but, being near
                  neighbours, had become inveterate enemies and fierce political opponents. The
                  former, a reckless trader in men, women, and children, was a daring, unprincipled,
                  and revengeful man, whose occupation seldom called him to his plantation; while
                  the latter was notorious as a hard master and a cruel tyrant, who exacted a larger
                  amount of labour from his negroes than his fellow planters, and gave them less to
                  eat. His opinion was, that a peck of corn a week was quite enough for a negro; and
                  this was his systematic allowance;—but he otherwise tempted the appetites of his
                  property, by driving them, famished, to the utmost verge of necessity. Thus driven
                  to predatory acts in order to sustain life, the advantages offered by Romescos'
                  swamp—generally well sprinkled with swine—were readily appropriated to a very good
                  use.
               Under covert of Romescos' absence, Mr. M'Fadden had no very scrupulous objection
                  to his negroes foraging the amply provided swamp,—provided, however, they did the
                  thing on the sly, were careful whose porker they dispatched, and said nothing to
                  him about the eating. In fact, it was simply a matter of economy with Mr.
                  M'Fadden; and as Romescos had a great number of the obstinate brutes, it saved the
                  trouble of raising such undignified stock. Finding, however, that neighbour
                  M'Fadden, or his predatory negroes—such they were called—were laying claim to more
                  than a generous share of their porkships, Romescos thought it high time to put the
                  thing down by a summary process. But what particularly "riled" Romescos in this
                  affair of the hogs was, that M'Fadden's negroes were not content with catching
                  them in an honourable way, but would do it through the agency of nasty cur-dogs, which he always had despised, and held as unfit even to
                  hunt niggers with. Several times had he
                  expressed his willingness to permit a small number of his grunters to be captured
                  for the benefit of his neighbour's half-starved negroes, provided, always, they
                  were hunted with honourable hound-dogs. He held such animals in high
                  esteem, while curs he looked upon with utter contempt; he likened the one to the
                  chivalrous old rice-planter, the other to a pettifogging schoolmaster fit for
                  nothing but to be despised and shot. With these feelings he (Romescos) declared
                  his intention to kill the very first negro he caught in his swamp with cur-dogs;
                  and he kept his word. Lying in ambush, he would await their approach, and, when
                  most engaged in appropriating the porkers, rush from his hiding-place, shoot the
                  dogs, and then take a turn at the more exhilarating business of shooting the
                  negroes. He would, with all possible calmness, command the frightened property to
                  approach and partake of his peculiar mixture, administered from his double-barrel
                  gun.
               That the reader may better understand Romescos' process of curing this malady of
                  his neighbour's negroes, we will give it as related by himself. It is a curious
                  mode of dispatching negro property; the reader, however, cannot fail to comprehend
                  it. "Plantin' didn't suit my notions o' gittin' rich, ye see, so I spec'lates in
                  nigger property, and makes a better thing on't. But there's philosophy about the
                  thing, and a body's got t' know the hang on't afore he can twist it out
                  profitably; so I keeps a sort of a plantation just to make a swell; cos ye got to
                  make a splash to be anybody down south. Can't be a gentleman, ye see, 'cept ye
                  plants cotton and rice; and then a feller what's got a plantation in this kind of
                  a way can be a gentleman, and do so many other bits of trade to advantage. The
                  thing works like the handle of a pump; and then it makes a right good place for
                  raising young niggers, and gettin' old uns trimmed up. With me, the worst thing is
                  that old screwdriver, M'Fadden, what don't care no more for the wear and tear of a
                  nigger than nothin', and drives 'em like as many steam-engines he thinks he can
                  keep going by feeding on saw-dust. He han't no conception o' nigger constitution,
                  and is just the worst sort of a chap that ever cum south to get a fortune. Why,
                  look right at his niggers: they look like crows after corn-shuckin. Don't give 'em
                  no meat, and the critters must steal somethin' t' keep out o' the bone-yard. Well,
                  I argers the case with Mack, tells him how t'll be atween he and me on this thing,
                  and warns him that if he don't chunk more corn and grease into his niggers, there
                  'll be a ruptous fuss. But he don't stand on honour, as I does, especially when
                  his property makes a haul on my swamp of shoats. I an't home often; so the hogs
                  suffer; and Mack's niggers get the pork. This 'ere kind o' business"—Romescos
                  maintains the serious dignity of himself the while—"don't go down nohow with me;
                  so Mack and me just has a bit of a good-natured quarrel; and from that we gets at
                  daggers' points, and I swears how I'll kill the first nigger o' his'n what steals
                  hogs o' mine. Wouldn't a cared a sous, mark ye, but it cum crossways on a feller's
                  feelins to think how the 'tarnal niggers had no more sense than t' hunt hogs o'
                  mine with cur-dogs: bin hounds, honourable dogs, or respectable dogs what 'll do
                  to hunt niggers with, wouldn't a cared a toss about it;
                  but—when—I—hears—a cur-dog yelp, oh! hang me if it don't set my sensations all on
                  pins, just as somethin' was crucifyin' a feller. I warns and talks, and then
                  pleads like a lawyer what's got a bad case; but all to no end o' reformin' Mack's
                  morals,—feller han't got no sense o' reform in him. So I sets my niggers on the
                  scent—it gives 'em some fun—and swears I'll kill a nigger for every hog he steals.
                  This I concludes on; and I never backs out when once I fixes a conclusion.
               "Hears the infernal cur-dog's yelp, yelp, yelp, down in the swamp;
                  then I creeps through the jungle so sly, lays low till the fellers cum up, all
                  jumpin'—pig ahead, then dogs, niggers follerin', puffin' and blowin', eyes poppin'
                  out, 'most out o' breath, just as if they tasted the sparerib afore they'd got the
                  critter.
               "Well, ye see, I know'd all the ins and outs of the law,—keeps mighty shy about
                  all the judicial quibbles on't,—never takes nobody with me whose swearin' would
                  stand muster in a court of law. All right on that score (Romescos exults in his
                  law proficiency). I makes sure o' the dogs fust, ollers keepin' the double-barrel
                  on the right eye for the best nigger in the lot. It would make the longest-faced
                  deacon in the district laugh to see the fire flash out o' the nigger's big black
                  eyes, when he sees the cur drop, knowin' how he'll get the next plugs souced into
                  him. It's only natural, cos it would frighten a feller what warn't used to it just to see what a thunder-cloud of
                  agitation the nigger screws his black face into. And then he starts to run, and
                  puts it like streaks o' cannon-balls chased by express lightnin'.
               "'Stand still, ye thievin' varmint! hold up,—bring to a mooring: take the mixture
                  according to Gunter!' I shouts. The way the nigger pulls up, begs, pleads, and
                  says things what'll touch a feller's tender feelins, aint no small kind of an
                  institution. 'Twould just make a man what had stretchy conscience think there was
                  somethin' crooked somewhere. 'Well, boys,' says I, feeling a little soft about the
                  stomach, 'seeing how it's yer Boss what don't feed ye, I'll be kind o' good, and
                  give ye a dose of the mixture in an honourable way.' Then I loads t'other barrel,
                  the feller's eyes flashin' streaks of blue lightnin' all the time, lookin' at how
                  I rams it down, chunk! 'Now, boys,' says I, when the plugs*
                   is all ready, 'there's system 'bout this ere thing a' mine—t'aint killin'
                  ye I wants,—don't care a copper about that (there an't no music in that), but must
                  make it bring the finances out a' yer master's pocket. That's the place where he
                  keeps all his morals. Now, run twenty paces and I'll gin ye a fair chance!' The
                  nigger understands me, ye see, and moves off, as if he expected a thunderbolt at
                  his heel, lookin' back and whining like a puppy what's lost his mother. Just when
                  he gets to an honourable distance,—say twenty paces, according to fighting rule,—I
                  draws up, takes aim, and plumps the plugs into him. The way the critter jumps
                  reminds me of a circus rider vaultin' and turnin' sumersets. You'd think he was
                  inginrubber 'lectrified. A'ter all, I finds these playin' doses don't do; they
                  don't settle things on the square. So I tries a little stronger mixture, which
                  ends in killin' three o' Mack's niggers right up smooth. But the best on't is that
                  Mack finds he han't no proof, goes right into it and kills three o' my prime fat
                  niggers: that makes us bad friends on every score. But he got a nigger ahead o' me
                  a'ter awhile, and I ware detarmined to straighten accounts, if it was by stealin'
                  the odds. Them ar's my principles, and that's just the way I settles accounts with
                  folks what don't do the square thing in the way o' nigger property."
               Thus the two gentlemen lived in the terror of internal 
                  
                  *Shot.
               war; and Romescos, seeing
                  such a fine piece of property pass into the hands of his antagonist, resolved on
                  squaring accounts by stealing the preacher,—an act Mr. M'Fadden least
                  expected.
               The candidates' festival offered every facility for carrying this singular
                     coup-d'état into effect. Hence, with the
                  skilful assistance of Nath. Nimrod, and Dan Bengal, Harry was very precipitately
                  and dexterously passed over to the chances of a new phase of slave life.
               Ellen waited patiently for Harry's return until it became evident some ill-luck
                  had befallen him. Lantern in hand, she proceeds to the pen in search. No Harry is
                  to be found there; Mr. M'Fadden's common negroes only are there, and they sleep
                  sweetly and soundly. What can have befallen him? She conjectures many things, none
                  of which are the right. The lock is upon the door; all is still outside; no traces
                  of kidnapping can be found. She knows his faithfulness,—knows he would not desert
                  his master unless some foul means had been used to decoy him into trouble. She
                  returns to the house and acquaints her master.
               Straggling members, who had met to enjoy the generous political banquet, and who
                  still remain to see the night "through" with appropriate honour, are apprised of
                  the sudden disappearance of this very valuable piece of property. They are ready
                  for any turn of excitement,—anything for "topping off" with a little amusement;
                  and to this end they immediately gather round mine host in a party of pursuit.
                  Romescos—he must make his innocence more imposing—has been conspicuous during the
                  night, at times expressing sympathy for Mr. M'Fadden, and again assuring the
                  company that he has known fifty worse cases cured. In order to make this better
                  understood, he will pay the doctor's bill if M'Fadden dies. Mine host has no
                  sooner given the alarm than Romescos expresses superlative surprise. He was
                  standing in the centre of a conclave of men, whom he harangues on the particular
                  political points necessary for the candidates to support in order to maintain the
                  honour of the State; now he listens to mine host as he recounts the strange
                  absence of the preacher, pauses and combs his long red beard with his fingers,
                  looks distrustfully, and then says, with a quaintness that disarmed suspicion,
                  "Nigger-like!—preacher or angel, nigger will be nigger! The idea o' makin' the black rascals preachers, thinkin'
                  they won't run away! Now, fellers, that ar' chap's skulkin' about, not far off,
                  out among the pines; and here's my two dogs"—he points to his dogs, stretched on
                  the floor—"what'll scent him and bring him out afore ten minutes! Don't say a word
                  to Mack about it; don't let it 'scape yer fly-trap, cos they say he's got a notion
                  o' dying, and suddenly changed his feelins 'bout nigger tradin'. There's no
                  tellin' how it would affect the old democrat if he felt he warnt goin' to slip his
                  breeze. This child"—Romescos refers to himself—"felt just as Mack does more nor a
                  dozen times, when Davy Jones looked as if he was making slight advances: a feller
                  soon gets straight again, nevertheless. It's only the difference atween one's
                  feelings about makin' money when he's well, and thinkin' how he made it when he's
                  about to bid his friends good morning and leave town for awhile. Anyhow, there
                  aint no dodging now, fellers! We got to hunt up the nigger afore daylight, so let
                  us take a drop more and be moving." He orders the landlord to set on the
                  decanters,—they join in a social glass, touch glasses to the recovery of the
                  nigger, and then rush out to the pursuit. Romescos heads the party. With dogs,
                  horses, guns, and all sorts of negro-hunting apparatus, they scour the pinegrove,
                  the swamp, and the heather. They make the pursuit of man full of interest to those
                  who are fond of the chase; they allow their enthusiasm to bound in unison with the
                  sharp baying of the dogs.
               For more than two hours is this exhilarating sport kept up. It is sweet music to
                  their ears; they have been trained (educated) to the fascination of a man-hunt,
                  and dogs and men become wearied with the useless search.
               Romescos declares the nigger is near at hand: he sees the dogs curl down their
                  noses; he must be somewhere in a hole or jungle of the swamp, and, with more
                  daylight and another dog or two, his apprehension is certain. He makes a halt on
                  the brow of a hill, and addresses his fellow-hunters from the saddle. In his
                  wisdom on nigger nature he will advise a return to the tavern—for it is now
                  daylight—where they will spend another hour merrily, and then return brightened to
                  the pursuit. Acting on this advice, friends and foes—both join as good fellows in
                  the chase for a nigger—followed his retreat as they had his advance.
               "No nigger preacher just about this circle, Major!" exclaims Romescos, addressing
                  mine host, as he puts his head into the bar-room, on his return. "Feller's
                  burrowed somewhere, like a coon: catch him on the broad end of morning, or I'll
                  hang up my old double-barrel," he concludes, shaking his head, and ordering drink
                  for the party at his expense.
               The morning advanced, however, and nothing was to be seen of Romescos: he vanished
                  as suddenly from among them as Harry had from the pen. Some little surprise is
                  expressed by the knowing ones; they whisper among themselves, while mine host
                  reaches over the counter, cants his head solicitously, and says:—"What's that,
                  gentlemen?"
               In this dilemma they cannot inform mine host; they must continue the useless chase
                  without Romescos' valuable services. And here we must leave mine host preparing
                  further necessaries for capturing the lost property, that he may restore it to its
                  owner so soon as he shall become convalescent, and turn to Harry.
               Like a well-stowed bale of merchandise, to be delivered at a stated place within a
                  specified time, he was rolled in bagging, and not permitted to see the direction
                  in which he was being driven. When the pursuing party started from the crossing,
                  Romescos took the lead in order to draw it in an opposite direction, and keep the
                  dogs from the trail. This would allow the stolen clergyman to get beyond their
                  reach. When daylight broke upon the capturers they were nearly twenty miles beyond
                  the reach of the pursuers, approaching an inn by the road side. The waggon
                  suddenly stopped, and Harry found himself being unrolled from his winding sheet by
                  the hands of two strangers. Lifting him to his feet, they took him from the
                  waggon, loosed the chains from his legs, led him into the house, and placed him in
                  a dark back room. Here, his head being uncovered, he looks upon his captors with
                  an air of confusion and distrust. "Ye know me too, I reckon, old feller, don't
                  ye?" enquires one of the men, with a sardonic grin, as he lifts his hat with his
                  left hand, and scratches his head with his right.
               "Yes, mas'r; there's no mistakin on ye!" returns Harry, shaking his head, as they
                  release the chains from his hands. He at length recognises the familiar faces of
                  Dan Bengal and Nath. Nimrod. Both have
                  figured about Marston's plantation, in the purchase and sale of negroes.
               "Ye had a jolly good ride, old feller, had'nt ye?" says Bengal, exultingly,
                  looking Harry in the face, shrugging his shoulders, and putting out his hand to
                  make his friendship.
               Harry has no reply to make; but rubs his face as if he is not quite satisfied with
                  his new apartment, and wants to know a little more of the motive of the
                  expedition. "Mas'r! I don't seem to know myself, nor nothin'. Please tell me where
                  I am going to, and who is to be my master? It will relieve my double troubles," he
                  says, casting an enquiring look at Nimrod.
               "Shook up yer parson-thinkin' some, I reckon, did'nt it, old chap?" returns
                  Nimrod, laughing heartily, but making no further reply. He thinks it was very much
                  like riding in a railroad backwards.
               "Did my sick mas'r sell me to you?" again he enquires.
               "No business o' yourn, that ain't; yer nigger-knowin ought to tell you how ye'd
                  got into safe hands. We'll push along down south as soon as ye gets some feed. Put
                  on a straight face, and face the music like a clever deacon, and we'll do the
                  square in selling ye to a Boss what 'll let ye preach now and then. (Nimrod
                  becomes very affectionate). Do the thing up righteous, and when yer sold there 'll
                  be a five-dollar shiner for yerself. (He pats him on the head, and puts his arm
                  over his shoulder.) Best t' have a little shot in a body's own pocket; now, shut
                  up yer black bread-trap, and don't go makin a fuss about where yer goin' to:
                  that's my business!"
               Harry pauses as if in contemplation; he is struggling against his indignation
                  excited by such remarks. He knew his old master's weaknesses, enjoyed his
                  indulgences; but he had never been made to feel so acutely how degraded he could
                  be as a mere article of trade. It would have been some consolation to know which
                  way he was proceeding, and why he had been so suddenly snatched from his new
                  owner. Fate had not ordained this for him; oh no! He must resign himself without
                  making any further enquiries; he must be nothing more than a nigger—happy nigger
                  happily subdued! Seating himself upon the floor, in a recumbent position, he drops
                  his face on his knees,—is humbled among the humblest. He is left alone for some
                  time, while his captors, retiring into an adjoining room, hold a consultation.
               Breakfast is being prepared, and much conversation is kept up in an inaudible tone
                  of voice. Harry has an instinctive knowledge that it is about him, for he hears
                  the words, "Peter! Peter!" his name must be transmogrified into "Peter!" In
                  another minute he hears dishes rattling on the table, and Bengal distinctly
                  complimenting the adjuncts, as he orders some for the nigger preacher. This
                  excites his anxiety; he feels like placing his ear at the keyhole,—doing a little
                  evesdropping. He is happily disappointed, however, for the door opens, and a black
                  boy bearing a dish of homony enters, and, placing it before him, begs that he will
                  help himself. Harry takes the plate and sets it beside him, as the strange boy
                  watches him with an air of commiseration that enlists his confidence. "Ain't da'h
                  somefin mo' dat I can bring ye?" enquires the boy, pausing for an answer.
               "Nothing,—nothing more!"
               Harry will venture to make some enquiries about the locality. "Do you belong to
                  master what live here?" He puts out his hand, takes the other by the arm.
               "Hard tellin who I belongs to. Buckra man own 'em to-day; ain't sartin if he own
                  'em to-morrow, dough. What country-born nigger is you?"
               "Down country! My poor old master's gone, and now I'm goin'; but God only knows
                  where to. White man sell all old Boss's folks in a string,—my old woman and
                  children among the rest. My heart is with them, God bless them!"
               "Reckon how ya' had a right good old Boss what larn ye somethin." The boy listens
                  to Harry with surprise. "Don't talk like dat down dis a way; no country-born
                  nigger put in larn'd wods so, nohow," returns the boy, with a look of curious
                  admiration.
               "But you harn't told me what place this is?"
               "Dis 'ouse! e' ant nowhare when Buckra bring nigger what he want to sell, and don'
                  want nobody to know whar e' bring him from. Dat man what bring ye here be great
                  Buckra. De 'h way he lash nigger whin e' don do jist so!" The boy shakes his head
                  with a warning air.
               
               "How did you get here? There must be roads leading in some directions?"
               "Roads runnin' every which way, yand'r; and trou de woods anyway, but mighty hard
                  tellin whar he going to, he is. Mas'r Boss don lef 'e nigger know how 'e bring'um,
                  nor how he takes 'um way. Guess da 'h gwine to run ye down country, so God bless
                  you," says the boy, shaking him by the hand, and taking leave.
               "Well! if I only knew which way I was going I should feel happy; because I could
                  then write to my old master, somewhere or somehow. And I know my good friend
                  Missus Rosebrook will buy me for her plantation,—I know she will. She knows my
                  feelings, and in her heart wouldn't see me abused, she wouldn't! I wish I knew who
                  my master is, where I am, and to whom I'm going to be sold next. I think new
                  master has stolen me, thinking old master was going to die," Harry mutters to
                  himself, commencing his breakfast, but still applying his listening faculties to
                  the conversation in the next room. At length, after a long pause, they seem to
                  have finished breakfast and taken up the further consideration of his sale.
               "I don't fear anything of the kind! Romescos is just the keenest fellow that can
                  be scared up this side of Baltimore. He never takes a thing o' this stamp in hand
                  but what he puts it through," says Bengal, in a whispering tone.
               "True! the trouble's in his infernal preaching; that's the devil of niggers having
                  intelligence. Can do anything in our way with common niggers what don't know
                  nothin'; but when the critters can do clergy, and preach, they'll be sending notes
                  to somebody they know as acquaintances. An intelligent nigger's a bad article when
                  ye want to play off in this way," replies the other, curtly.
               "Never mind," returns Bengal, "can't ollers transpose a nigger, as easy as turnin'
                  over a sixpence, specially when he don't have his ideas brightened. Can't steer
                  clar on't. Larnin's mighty dangerous to our business, Nath.—better knock him on
                  the head at once; better end him and save a sight of trouble. It'll put a stopper
                  on his preaching, this pesks exercisin' his ideas."
               A third interrupts. Thinks such a set of chicken-hearted fellows won't do when it
                  comes to cases of 'mergency like this. He will just make clergyman Peter Somebody
                  the deacon; and with this honorary title he'll put him through to Major Wiley's
                  plantation, when he'll be all right down in old Mississippi. The Colonel and he,
                  understanding the thing, can settle it just as smooth as sunrise. The curate is
                  what we call a right clever fellow, would make the tallest kind of a preacher, and
                  pay first-rate per centage on himself." Bengal refers to Harry. His remarks are,
                  indeed, quite applicable. "I've got the dockerment, ye see, all prepared; and
                  we'll put him through without a wink," he concludes, in a measured tone of
                  voice.
               The door of Harry's room opens, and the three enter together. "Had a good
                  breakfast, old feller, hain't ye?" says Nimrod, approaching with hand extended,
                  and patting him on the head with a child's playfulness. "I kind o' likes the looks
                  on ye" (a congratulatory smile curls over his countenance), "old feller; and means
                  to do the square thing in the way o' gettin' on ye a good Boss. Put on the
                  Lazarus, and no nigger tricks on the road. I'm sorry to leave ye on the excursion,
                  but here's the gentleman what'll see ye through,—will put ye through to old
                  Mississip just as safe as if ye were a nugget of gold." Nimrod introduces Harry to
                  a short gentleman with a bald head, and very smooth, red face. His
                  dress is of brown homespun, a garb which would seem peculiar to those who do the
                  villainy of the peculiar institution. The gentleman has a pair of handcuffs in his
                  left hand, with which he will make his pious merchandise safe. Stepping forward,
                  he places the forefinger of his right hand on the preacher's forehead, and reads
                  him a lesson which he must get firm into his thinking shell. It is this. "Now, at
                  this very time, yer any kind of a nigger; but a'ter this ar' ye got to be a
                  Tennessee nigger, raised in a pious Tennessee family. And yer name is
                  Peter—Peter—Peter!—don't forget the Peter: yer a parson, and ought t' keep the old
                  apostle what preached in the marketplace in yer noddle. Peter, ye see, is a pious
                  name, and Harry isn't; so ye must think Peter and sink Harry."
               "What do I want to change my name for? Old master give me that name long time
                  ago!"
               "None o' yer business; niggers ain't t' know the philosophy of such things. No
                  nigger tricks, now!" interrupts Bengal, quickly, drawing his face into savage
                     contortions. At this the gentleman
                  in whose charge he will proceed steps forward and places the manacles on Harry's
                  hands with the coolness and indifference of one executing the commonest branch of
                  his profession. Thus packed and baled for export, he is hurried from the house
                  into a two-horse waggon, and driven off at full speed. Bengal watches the waggon
                  as it rolls down the highway and is lost in the distance. He laughs heartily,
                  thinks how safe he has got the preacher, and how much hard cash he will bring. God
                  speed the slave on his journey downward, we might add.
               It will be needless for us to trace them through the many incidents of their
                  journey; our purpose will be served when we state that his new guardian landed him
                  safely at the plantation of Major Wiley, on the Tallahatchee River, Mississippi,
                  on the evening of the fourth day after their departure, having made a portion of
                  their passage on the steamer Ohio. By some process unknown to Harry he finds
                  himself duly ingratiated among the major's field hands, as nothing more than plain
                  Peter. He is far from the high-road, far from his friends, without any prospect of
                  communicating with his old master. The major, in his way, seems a well-disposed
                  sort of man, inclined to "do right" by his negroes, and willing to afford them an
                  opportunity of employing their time after task, for their own benefit. And yet it
                  is evident that he must in some way be connected with Graspum and his party, for
                  there is a continual interchange of negroes to and from his plantation. This,
                  however, we must not analyse too closely, but leave to the reader's own
                  conjectures, inasmuch as Major Wiley is a very distinguished gentleman, and
                  confidently expects a very prominent diplomatic appointment under the next
                  administration.
               Harry, in a very quiet way, sets himself about gaining a knowledge of his master's
                  opinions on religion, as well as obtaining his confidence by strict fidelity to
                  his interests. So far does he succeed, that in a short time he finds himself
                  holding the respectable and confidential office of master of stores. Then he
                  succeeds in inducing his master to hear him preach a sermon to his negroes. The
                  major is perfectly willing to allow him the full exercise of his talents, and is
                  moved to admiration at his fervency, his aptitude, his knowledge of the Bible, and
                  the worth there must be in such a piece of clergy property. Master Wiley makes his
                  man the offer of purchasing his time, which Harry, under the alias of Peter,
                  accepts, and commences his mission of preaching on the neighbouring
                  plantations.
               Ardently and devoutedly does he pursue his mission of Christianity among his
                  fellow-bondmen; but he has reaped little of the harvest to himself, his master
                  having so increased the demand for his time that he can scarcely save money enough
                  to purchase clothes. At first he was only required to pay six dollars a week; now,
                  nothing less than ten is received. It is a happy premium on profitable human
                  nature; and through it swings the strongest hinge of that cursed institution which
                  blasts alike master and slave. Major Wiley is very chivalrous, very hospitable,
                  and very eminent for his many distinguished qualifications; but his very pious
                  piece of property must pay forty-seven per cent. annual tribute for the very
                  hospitable privilege of administering the Word of God to his brother bondmen.
                  Speak not of robed bishops robbing Christianity in a foreign land, ye men who deal
                  in men, and would rob nature of its tombstone! Ye would rob the angels did their
                  garments give forth gold.
               The poor fellow's income, depending, in some measure, upon small presents bestowed
                  by the negroes to whom he preached, was scarcely enough to bring him out at the
                  end of the week, and to be thus deprived of it seemed more than his spirits could
                  bear. Again and again had he appealed to his master for justice; but there was no
                  justice for him,—his appeals proved as fruitless as the wind, on his master's
                  callous sensibilities. Instead of exciting compassion, he only drew upon him his
                  master's prejudices; he was threatened with being sold, if he resisted for a day
                  the payment of wages for his own body. Hence he saw but one alternative left—one
                  hope, one smile from a good woman, who might, and he felt would, deliver him; that
                  was in writing to his good friend, Mrs. Rosebrook, whose generous heart he might
                  touch through his appeals for mercy. And yet there was another obstacle; the
                  post-office might be ten miles off, and his master having compelled him to take
                  the name of Peter Wiley, how was he to get a letter to her without the knowledge
                  of his master? Should his letter be intercepted, his master, a strict
                  disciplinarian, would not only sell him
                  farther south, but inflict the severest punishment. Nevertheless, there was one
                  consolation left; his exertions on behalf of the slaves, and his earnestness in
                  promoting the interests of their masters, had not passed unnoticed with the
                  daughter of a neighbouring planter (this lady has since distinguished herself for
                  sympathy with the slave), who became much interested in his welfare. She had
                  listened to his exhortations with admiration; she had listened to his advice on
                  religion, and become his friend and confidant. She would invite him to her
                  father's house, sit for hours at his side, and listen with breathless attention to
                  his pathos, his display of natural genius. To her he unfolded his deep and painful
                  troubles; to her he looked for consolation; she was the angel of light guiding him
                  on his weary way, cheering his drooping soul on its journey to heaven. To her he
                  disclosed how he had been called to the bedside of his dying master; how,
                  previously, he had been sold from his good old master, Marston, his wife, his
                  children; how he was mysteriously carried off and left in the charge of his
                  present master, who exacts all he can earn.
               The simple recital of his story excites the genial feelings of the young lady; she
                  knows some foul transaction is associated with his transition, and at once tenders
                  her services to release him. But she must move cautiously, for even Harry's
                  preaching is in direct violation of the statutes; and were she found aiding in
                  that which would unfavourably affect the interests of his master she would be
                  subjected to serious consequences—perhaps be invited to spend a short season at
                  the sheriff's hotel, commonly called the county gaol. However, there was virtue in
                  the object to be served, and feeling that whatever else she could do to relieve
                  him would be conferring a lasting benefit on a suffering mortal, she will brave
                  the attempt.
               "Tell me he is not a man, but a slave! tell me a being with such faculties should
                  be thus sunken beneath the amenities of freedom! that man may barter almighty
                  gifts for gold! trample his religion into dust, and turn it into dollars and
                  cents! What a mockery is this against the justice of heaven! When this is done in
                  this our happy land of happy freedom, scoffers may make it their foot-ball, and
                  kings in their tyranny may point the finger of scorn at us, and ask us for our
                  honest men, our cherished freedom!
               "Woman can do something, if she will; let me see what I can do to relieve this
                  poor oppressed," she exclaims one day, after he has consulted her on the best
                  means of relief. "I will try."
               Woman knows the beatings of the heart; she can respond more quickly to its pains
                  and sorrows. Our youthful missionary will sit down and write a letter to Mrs.
                  Rosebrook—she will do something, the atmosphere of slavery will hear of her yet—it
                  will!

               THE PRETTY CHILDREN ARE TO BE SOLD.
               HOW varied are the sources of human nature—how changing its tints and glows—how
                  immeasurable its uncertainties, and how obdurate the will that can turn its
                  tenderest threads into profitable degradation! But what democrat can know himself
                  a freeman when the whitest blood makes good merchandise in the market? When the
                  only lineal stain on a mother's name for ever binds the chains, let no man boast
                  of liberty. The very voice re-echoes, oh, man, why be a hypocrite! cans't thou not
                  see the scorner looking from above? But the oligarchy asks in tones so modest, so
                  full of chivalrous fascination, what hast thou to do with that? be no longer a
                  fanatic. So we will bear the warning—pass from it for the present.
               More than two years have passed; writs of error have been filed and argued; the
                  children have dragged out time in a prison-house. Is it in freedom's land a prison
                  was made for the innocent to waste in? So it is, and may Heaven one day change the
                  tenour! Excuse, reader, this digression, and let us proceed with our
                  narrative.
               The morning is clear and bright; Mrs. Rosebrook sits at the window of her cheerful
                  villa, watching the approach of the post-rider seen in the distance, near a
                  cluster of oaks that surround the entrance of the arbour, at the north side of the
                  garden. The scene spread out before her is full of rural beauty, softened by the
                  dew-decked foliage, clothing the landscape with its clumps. As if some fairy hand
                  had spread a crystal mist about the calm of morning, and angels were bedecking it
                  with the richest tints of a rising sun at morn, the picture sparkles with silvery
                  life. There she sits, her soft glowing eyes scanning the reposing scene, as her
                  graceful form seems infusing spirit into its silent loveliness. And then she
                  speaks, as if whispering a secret to the wafting air: "our happy union!" It falls upon the ear like some angel voice speaking of things too pure,
                  too holy for the caprices of earth. She would be a type of that calmness pervading
                  the scene—that sweetness and repose which seem mingling to work out some holy
                  purpose; and yet there is a touching sadness depicted in her face.
               "Two years have passed; how changed!" she exclaims, as if rousing from a reverie:
                  "I would not be surprised if he brought bad tidings."
               The postman has reached the gate and delivered a letter, which the servant quickly
                  bears to her hand. She grasps it anxiously, as if recognising the superscription;
                  opens it nervously; reads the contents. It is from Franconia, interceding with her
                  in behalf of her uncle and the two children, in the following manner:— 
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "My dearest Friend,
                              
                              "Can I appeal to one whose feelings are more ready to be enlisted
                                 in a good cause? I think not. I wish now to enlist your feelings in
                                 something that concerns myself. It is to save two interesting
                                 children—who, though our eyes may at times be blinded to facts, I
                                 cannot forget are nearly allied to me by birth and association—from
                                 the grasp of slavery. Misfortune never comes alone; nor, in this
                                 instance, need I recount ours to you. Of my own I will say but
                                 little; the least is best. Into wedlock I have been sold to one it
                                 were impossible for me to love; he cannot cherish the respect due
                                 to my feelings. His associations are of the coarsest, and his
                                 heartless treatment beyond my endurance. He subjects me to the
                                 meanest grievances; makes my position more degraded than that of
                                 the slave upon whom he gratifies his lusts. Had my parents saved me
                                 from such a monster—I cannot call him less—they would have saved me
                                 many a painful reflection. As for his riches—I know not whether
                                 they really exist—they are destined only to serve his lowest
                                 passions. With him misfortune is a crime; and I am made to suffer
                                 under his taunts about the disappearance of my brother, the poverty
                                 of my parents.
                              "You are well aware of the verdict of the jury, and the affirmation
                                 of the Court of Appeal, upon those dear children. The decree orders
                                 them to be sold in the market, for the benefit of my uncle's
                                 creditors: this is the day, the fatal day, the sale takes place.
                                 Let me beseech of you, as you have it in your power, to induce the
                                 deacon to purchase them. O, save them from the fate that awaits
                                 them! You know my
                                 uncle's errors; you know also his goodness of heart; you can
                                 sympathise with him in his sudden downfall. Then the affection he
                                 has for Annette is unbounded. No father could be more dotingly fond
                                 of his legitimate child. But you know what our laws are—what they
                                 force us to do against our better inclinations. Annette's mother,
                                 poor wretch, has fled, and M'Carstrow charges me with being
                                 accessory to her escape: I cannot, nor will I, deny it, while my
                                 most ardent prayer invokes her future happiness. That she has saved
                                 herself from a life of shame I cannot doubt; and if I have failed
                                 to carry out a promise I made her before her departure—that of
                                 rescuing her child—the satisfaction of knowing that she at least is
                                 enjoying the reward of freedom partially repays my feelings. Let me
                                 entreat you to repair to the city, and, at least, rescue Annette
                                 from that life of shame and disgrace now pending over her—a shame
                                 and disgrace no less black in the sight of heaven because society
                                 tolerates it as among the common things of social life.
                              "I am now almost heart-broken, and fear it will soon be my lot to
                                 be driven from under the roof of Colonel M'Carstrow, which is no
                                 longer a home, but a mere place of durance to me. It would be
                                 needless for me here to recount his conduct. Were I differently
                                 constituted I might tolerate his abuse, and accept a ruffian's
                                 recompense in consideration of his wealth.
                              "Go, my dear friend, save that child,
                              "Is the prayer of your affectionate
                              
                                 "FRANCONIA."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mrs. Rosebrook reads and re-reads the letter; then heaves a sigh as she lays it
                  upon the table at her side. As if discussing the matter in her mind, her face
                  resumes a contemplative seriousness.
               "And those children are to be sold in the market! Who won't they sell, and
                  sanctify the act? How can I relieve them? how can I be their friend, for
                  Franconia's sake? My husband is away on the plantation, and I cannot brave the
                  coarse slang of a slave mart; I cannot mingle with those who there congregate.
               "And, too, there are so many such cases—bearing on their front the fallacy of this
                  our democracy—that however much one may have claims over another, it were
                  impossible to take one into consideration without inciting a hundred to press
                  their demands. In this sense, then, the whole accursed system would have to be
                  uprooted before the remedy could be applied effectually. Notwithstanding, I will
                  go; I will go: I'll see what can be done in the city," says Mrs. Rosebrook,
                  bristling with animation. "Our ladies must have something to arouse their
                  energies; they all have a deep interest to serve, and can do much:" she will
                  summon resolution and brave all. Rising from her seat, she paces the room several
                  times, and then orders a servant to command Uncle Bradshaw to get the carriage
                  ready, and be prepared for a drive into the city.
               Soon Bradshaw has got the carriage ready, and our good lady is on the road,
                  rolling away toward the city. As they approach a curvature that winds round a
                  wooded hill, Bradshaw intimates to "missus" that he sees signs of a camp a short
                  distance ahead. He sees smoke curling upwards among the trees, and very soon the
                  notes of a long-metre tune fall softly on the ear, like the tinkling of distant
                  bells in the desert. Louder and louder, as they approach, the sounds become more
                  and more distinct. Then our good lady recognises the familiar voice of Elder
                  Pemberton Praiseworthy. This worthy christian of the Southern Church is straining
                  his musical organ to its utmost capacity, in the hope there will be no doubt left
                  on the minds of those congregated around him as to his very sound piety. The
                  carriage rounds the curvature, and there, encamped in a grove of pines by the road
                  side, is our pious Elder, administering consolation to his infirm property. Such
                  people! they present one of the most grotesque and indiscriminate spectacles ever
                  eyes beheld. The cholera has subsided; the Elder's greatest harvest time is gone;
                  few victims are to be found for the Elder's present purposes. Now he is
                  constrained to resort to the refuse of human property (those afflicted with what
                  are called ordinary diseases), to keep alive the Christian motive of his unctuous
                  business. To speak plainly, he must content himself with the purchase of such
                  infirmity as can be picked up here and there about the country.
               A fire of pine knots blazes in the centre of a mound, and over it hangs an iron
                  kettle, on a straddle, filled with corn-grits grits. Around this, and anxiously watching its
                  boiling, are the lean figures of negroes, with haggard and sickly faces, telling
                  but too forcibly the tale of their troubles. They watch and watch, mutter in
                  grumbling accents, stir the homony, and sit down again. Two large mule carts stand
                  in the shade of a pine tree, a few yards from the fire. A few paces further on are
                  the mules tethered, quietly grazing; while, seated on a whiskey-keg, is the Elder,
                  book in hand, giving out the hymn to some ten or a dozen infirm negroes seated
                  round him on the ground. They have enjoyed much consolation by listening with
                  wondrous astonishment to the Elder's exhortations, and are now ready to join their
                  musical jargon to the words of a Watts's hymn.
               On arriving opposite the spot, our good lady requests Bradshaw to stop; which
                  done, the Elder recognises her, and suddenly adjourning his spiritual exercises,
                  advances to meet her, his emotions expanding with enthusiastic joy. In his
                  eagerness, with outstretched hand, he comes sailing along, trips his toe in a
                  vine, and plunges head foremost into a broad ditch that separates the road from
                  the rising ground.
               The accident is very unfortunate at this moment; the Elder's enthusiasm is
                  somewhat cooled, nevertheless; but, as there is seldom a large loss without a
                  small gain, he finds himself strangely bespattered from head to foot with the
                  ingredients of a quagmire.
               "U'h! u'h! u'h! my dear madam, pardon me, I pray;—strange moment to meet with a
                  misfortune of this kind. But I was so glad to see you!" he ejaculates,
                  sensitively, making the best of his way out, brushing his sleeves, and wiping his
                  face with his never-failing India handkerchief. He approaches the carriage,
                  apologising for his appearance.
               He hopes our lady will excuse him, having so far lost himself in his enthusiasm,
                  which, together with the fervency and devotion of the spiritual exercises he was
                  enjoying with his poor, helpless property, made him quite careless of himself.
                  Begging a thousand pardons for presenting himself in such a predicament (his
                  gallantry is proverbially southern), he forgets that his hat and spectacles have
                  been dislodged by his precipitation into the ditch.
               The good lady reaches out her hand, as a smile curls over her face; but Bradshaw
                  must grin; and grin he does, in right good earnest.
               "Bless me, my dear Elder! what trade are you now engaged in?" she enquires.
               "A little devotional exercises, my dear madam! We were enjoying them with so much
                  christian feeling that I was quite carried away, indeed I was!" He rubs his
                  fingers through his bristly hair, and then downwards to his nasal organ, feeling
                  for his devoted glasses. He is surprised at their absence—makes another apology.
                  He affirms, adding his sacred honour, as all real southerners do, that he had
                  begun to feel justified in the belief that there never was a religion like that
                  preached by the good apostles, when such rural spots as this (he points to his
                  encampment) were chosen for its administration. Everything round him made him feel
                  so good, so much like the purest christian of the olden time. He tells her, with
                  great seriousness, that we must serve God, and not forget poor human nature,
                  never! To the world he would seem labouring under the influence of those inert
                  convictions by which we strive to conceal our natural inclinations, while drawing
                  the flimsy curtain of "to do good" over the real object.
               He winks and blinks, rubs his eyes, works his face into all the angles and
                  contortions it is capable of, and commences searching for his hat and spectacles.
                  Both are necessary adjuncts to his pious appearance; without them there is that in
                  the expression of his countenance from which none can fail to draw an unfavourable
                  opinion of his real character. The haggard, care-worn face, browned to the darkest
                  tropical tints; the ceaseless leer of that small, piercing eye, anxiety and
                  agitation pervading the tout ensemble of the
                  man, will not be dissembled. Nay; those acute promontories of the face, narrow and
                  sharp, and that low, reclining forehead, and head covered with bristly iron-grey
                  hair, standing erect in rugged tufts, are too strong an index of character for all
                  the disguises Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy can invent.
               "One minute, my dear madam," he exclaims, in his eagerness for the lost ornaments
                  of his face.
               "Never mind them, Elder; never mind them! In my eyes you are just as well without
                  them," she rejoins, an ironical smile invading her countenance, and a curl of
                  contempt on her lip. "But,—tell me what are you doing here?"
               
               "Here! my dear madam? Doing good for mankind and the truth of religion. I claim
                  merit of the parish, for my pursuit is laudable, and saves the parish much
                  trouble," says the Elder, beginning to wax warm in the goodness of his pursuit,
                  before anyone has undertaken to dispute him, or question the purity of his
                  purpose.
               "Still speculating in infirmity; making a resurrection man of yourself! You are
                  death's strongest opponent; you fight the great slayer for small dollars and
                  cents."
               "Well, now," interrupts the Elder, with a serious smile, "I'd rather face a
                  Mexican army than a woman's insinuating questions,—in matters of this kind! But
                  it's business, ye see! according to law; and ye can't get over that. There's no
                  getting over the law; and he that serveth the Lord, no matter how, deserveth
                  recompense; my recompense is in the amount of life I saves for the nigger."
               "That is not what I asked; you evade my questions, Elder! better acknowledge
                  honestly, for the sake of the country, where did you pick up these poor
                  wretches?"
               "I goes round the district, madam, and picks up a cripple here, and a cancer case
                  there, and a dropsy doubtful yonder; and then, some on em's got diseases what
                  don't get out until one comes to apply medical skill. Shan't make much on these
                  sort o' cases,—"
               The lady interrupts him, by bidding him good morning, and advising him, whenever
                  he affects to serve the Lord, to serve him honestly, without a selfish motive. She
                  leaves the Elder to his own reflections, to carry his victim property to his
                  charnel-house, where, if he save life for the enjoyment of liberty, he may serve
                  the Lord to a good purpose. She leaves him to the care of the christian church of
                  the South,—the church of christian slavery, the rules of which he so strictly
                  follows.
               As our good lady moves quickly away toward the city, the Elder looks up,
                  imploringly, as if invoking the praise of heaven on his good deeds. He is, indeed,
                  astonished, that his dear friend, the lady, should have made such a declaration so
                  closely applied, so insinuating. That such should have escaped her lips when she
                  must know that his very soul and intention are purity! "I never felt like making a
                  wish before now; and now I wishes I was, or that my father had made me, a lawyer.
                  I would defend my position in a legal sense then! I don't like lawyers generally,
                  I confess; the profession's not as honourable as ours, and its members are a set
                  of sharpers, who would upset gospel and everything else for a small fee, they
                  would!" He concludes, as his eyes regrettingly wander after the carriage. The
                  words have moved him; there is something he wishes to say, but can't just get the
                  point he would arrive at. He turns away, sad at heart, to his sadder scenes. "I
                  know that my Redeemer liveth," he sings.
               In the city a different piece is in progress of performance. Papers, and all
                  necessary preparations for procuring the smooth transfer of the youthful property,
                  are completed; customers have begun to gather round the mart. Some are searching
                  among the negroes sent to the warehouse; others are inquiring where this property,
                  advertised in the morning journals, and so strongly commented upon, may be found.
                  They have been incited to examine, in consequence of the many attractions set
                  forth in the conditions of sale.
               There the two children sit, on a little seat near the vender's tribune. Old Aunt
                  Dina, at the prison, has dressed Annette so neatly! Her white pinafore shines so
                  brightly, is so neatly arranged, and her silky auburn locks curl so prettily, in
                  tiny ringlets, over her shoulders; and then her round fair face looks so sweetly,
                  glows with such innocent curiosity, as her soft blue eyes, deep with sparkling
                  vivacity, wander over the strange scene. She instinctively feels that she is the
                  special object of some important event. Laying her little hand gently upon the arm
                  of an old slave that sits by her side, she casts shy glances at those admirers who
                  stand round her and view her as a marketable article only.
               "Auntie, where are they going to take me?" the child inquires, with a solicitous
                  look, as she straightens the folds of her dress with her little hands.
               "Gwine t' sell 'um," mumbles the old slave. "Lor', child, a'h wishes ye wa'h mine;
                  reckon da'h wouldn't sell ye. T'ant much to sell nigger like I, nohow; but e' hurt
                  my feelins just so 'twarnt right t' sell de likes o' ye." The old slave, in
                  return, lays her hand upon Annette's head, and smooths her hair, as if solicitous
                  of her fate. "Sell ye, child—sell ye?" she concludes, shaking her head.
               "And what will they do with me and Nicholas when they get us sold?" continues the child, turning to
                  Nicholas and taking him by the arm.
               "Don' kno': perhaps save ye fo'h sinnin' agin de Lor'," is the old slave's quick
                  reply. She shakes her head doubtingly, and bursts into tears, as she takes Annette
                  in her arms, presses her to her bosom, kisses and kisses her pure cheek. How
                  heavenly is the affection of that old slave— how it rebukes our Christian
                  mockery!
               "Will they sell us where we can't see mother, auntie? I do want to see mother so,"
                  says the child, looking up in the old slave's face. There seemed something too
                  pure, too holy, in the child's simplicity, as it prattled about its mother, for
                  such purposes as it is about to be consigned to. "They do not sell white folks,
                  auntie, do they? My face is as white as anybody's; and Nicholas's aint black. I do
                  want to see mother so! when will she come back and take care of me, auntie?"
               "Lor', child," interrupts the old negro, suppressing her emotions, "no use to ax
                  dem questions ven ye gwine t' market. Buckra right smart at makin' nigger what
                  bring cash."
               The child expresses a wish that auntie would take her back to the old plantation,
                  where master, as mother used to call him, wouldn't let them sell her away off. And
                  she shakes her head with an air of unconscious pertness; tells the old negro not
                  to cry for her.
               The cryer's bell sounds forth its muddling peals to summon the customers; a
                  grotesque mixture of men close round the stand. The old slave, as if from
                  instinct, again takes Annette in her arms, presses and presses her to her bosom,
                  looks compassionately in her face, and smiles while a tear glistens in her eyes.
                  She is inspired by the beauty of the child; her heart bounds with affection for
                  her tender years; she loves her because she is lovely; and she smiles upon her as
                  a beautiful image of God's creation. But the old slave grieves over her fate; her
                  grief flows from the purity of the heart; she knows not the rules of the slave
                  church.
               Annette is born a child of sorrow in this our land of love and liberty; she is a
                  democrat's daughter, cursed by the inconsistencies of that ever-praised democratic
                  goodness. A child! nothing more than an item of common trade. It is even so; but
                  let not happy democracy blush, for the child, being merchandise, has no claims to
                  that law of the soul which looks above the frigidity of slave statutes. What
                  generosity is there in this generous land? what impulses of nature not quenched by
                  force of public opinion, when the associations of a child like this (we are
                  picturing a true story), her birth and blood, her clear complexion, the bright
                  carnatic of her cheek, will not save her from the mercenary grasp of dollars and
                  cents? It was the law; the law had made men demons, craving the bodies and souls
                  of their fellow men. It was the white man's charge to protect the law and the
                  constitution; and any manifestation of sympathy for this child would be in
                  violation of a system which cannot be ameliorated without endangering the whole
                  structure: hence the comments escaping from purchasers are only such as might have
                  been expressed by the sporting man in his admiration of a finely proportioned
                  animal.
               "What a sweet child!" says one, as they close round.
               "Make a woman when she grows up!" rejoins another, twirling his cane, and giving
                  his hat an extra set on the side of his head.
               "Take too long to keep it afore its valuable is developed; but it's a picture of
                  beauty. Face would do to take drawings from, it's so full of delicate outlines,"
                  interposes a third.
               An old gentleman, with something of the ministerial in his countenance, and who
                  has been very earnestly watching them for some time, thinks a great deal about the
                  subject of slavery, and the strange laws by which it is governed just at this
                  moment. He says, "One is inspired with a sort of admiration that unlocks the
                  heart, while gazing at such delicacy and child-like sweetness as is expressed in
                  the face of that child." He points his cane coldly at Annette. "It causes a sort
                  of reaction in one's sense of right, socially and politically, when we see it
                  mixed up with niggers and black ruffians to be sold."
               "Must abide the laws, though," says a gentleman in black, on his left.
               "Yes," returns our friend, quickly, "if such property could be saved the hands of
                  speculators"—
               
               "Speculators! speculators!" rejoins the gentleman in black, knitting his
                  brows.
               "Yes; it's always the case in our society. The beauty of such property makes it
                  dangerous about a well-ordained man's house. Our ladies, generally, have no
                  sympathy with, and rather dislike its ill-gotten tendencies. The piety of the
                  south amounts to but little in its influence on the slave population. The slave
                  population generates its own piety. There is black piety and white piety; but the
                  white piety effects little when it can dispose of poor black piety just as it
                  pleases; and there's no use in clipping the branches off the tree while the root
                  is diseased," concludes our ministerial-looking gentleman, who might have been
                  persuaded himself to advance a bid, were he not so well versed in the tenour of
                  society that surrounded him.
               During the above ad interim at the shambles, our
                  good lady, Mrs. Rosebrook, is straining every nerve to induce a gentleman of her
                  acquaintance to repair to the mart, and purchase the children on her account.
            
            
               CHAPTER 
                     XXVIII.
                     XXIX.
                  
               
               NATURE SHAMES ITSELF.
               MRS. ROSEBROOK sits in Mrs. Pringle's parlour. Mrs. Pringle is thought well of in
                  the city of Charleston, where she resides, and has done something towards
                  establishing a church union for the protection of orphan females. They must,
                  however, be purely white, and without slave or base blood in their veins, to
                  entitle them to admittance into its charitable precincts. This is upon the
                  principle that slave blood is not acceptable in the sight of Heaven; and that
                  allowing its admittance into this charitable earthly union would only be a sad
                  waste of time and Christian love. Mrs. Pringle, however, feels a little softened
                  to the good cause, and does hope Mrs. Rosebrook may succeed at least in rescuing
                  the little girl. She has counselled Mr. Seabrook, commonly called Colonel
                  Seabrook, a very distinguished gentleman, who has a very distinguished opinion of
                  himself, having studied law to distinguish himself, and now and then merely
                  practises it for his own amusement. Mr. Seabrook never gives an opinion, nor acts
                  for his friends, unless every thing he does be considered distinguished, and
                  gratuitously rendered.
               "What will you do with such property, madam?" inquires the gentleman, having
                  listened profoundly to her request.
               "To save them from being sold into the hands of such men as Graspum and Romescos;
                  it's the only motive I have" she speaks, gently: "I love the child; and her mother
                  still loves her: I am a mother."
               "Remember, my dear lady, they are adjudged property by law; and all that you can
                  do for them won't save them, nor change the odour of negro with which it has
                  stamped them."
               "Of that I am already too well aware, Mr. Seabrook; and I know, too, when once
                  enslaved, how hard it is to unslave. Public sentiment is the worst slave we have;
                  unslave that, and the righteousness of heaven will give us hearts to save
                  ourselves from the unrighteousness of our laws.
               
               "Go, Mr. Seabrook, purchase the children for me, and you will soon see what
                  ornaments of society I will make them!"
               "Ornaments to our society!" interrupts Mr. Seabrook, pausing for a moment, as he
                  places the fore-finger of his right hand upon his upper lip. "That would be a
                  pretty consummation—at the south! Make ornaments of our society!" Mr. Seabrook
                  turns the matter over and over and over in his mind. "Of such things as have been
                  pronounced property by law! A pretty fix it would get our society into!" he
                  rejoins, with emphasis. Mr. Seabrook shakes his head doubtingly, and then, taking
                  three or four strides across the room, his hands well down in his nether pockets,
                  relieves himself of his positive opinion. "Ah! ah! hem! my dear madam," he says,
                  "if you undertake the purchase of all that delicate kind of property—I mean the
                  amount total, as it is mixed up—your head'll grow grey afore you get all the bills
                  of sale paid up,—my word for it! That's my undisguised opinion, backed up by all
                  the pale-faced property about the city."
               "We will omit the opinion, Mr. Seabrook; such have kept our society where it now
                  is. I am resolved to have those children. If you hesitate to act for me, I'll
                  brave—"
               "Don't say that, my dear lady. Let me remind you that it ill becomes a lady of the
                  south to be seen at a slave-mart; more especially when such delicate property is
                  for sale. Persons might be present who did not understand your motive, and would
                  not only make rude advances, but question the propriety of your proceedings. You
                  would lose caste, most surely."
               Mrs. Rosebrook cares little for Mr. Seabrook's very learned opinion, knowing that
                  learned opinions are not always the most sensible ones, and is seen arranging her
                  bonnet hastily in a manner betokening her intention to make a bold front of it at
                  the slave-mart. This is rather too much for Mr. Seabrook, who sets great value on
                  his chivalrous virtues, and fearing they may suffer in the esteem of the softer
                  sex, suddenly proffers his kind interposition, becomes extremely courteous, begs
                  she will remain quiet, assuring her that no stone that can further her wishes
                  shall be left unturned. Mr. Seabrook (frequently called the gallant colonel) makes
                  one of his very best bows, adjusts his hat with exquisite grace, and leaves to
                  exercise the wisest judgment and strictest faith at the man-market.
               "Such matters are exceedingly annoying to gentlemen of my standing," says Mr.
                  Seabrook, as deliberately he proceeds to the fulfilment of his promise. He is a
                  methodical gentleman, and having weighed the matter well over in his legal mind,
                  is deeply indebted to it for the conclusion that Mrs. Rosebrook has got a very
                  unsystematised crotchet into her brain. "The exhibition of sympathy for
                  'niggers'—they're nothing else" says Mr. Seabrook—"much adds to that popular
                  prejudice which is already placing her in an extremely delicate position." He will
                  call to his aid some very nice legal tact, and by that never-failing unction
                  satisfy the good lady.
               When Mr. Seabrook enters the mart (our readers will remember that we have already
                  described it) he finds the children undergoing a very minute examination at the
                  hands of several slave-dealers. As Mr. Forshou, the very polite man-seller, is
                  despatching the rougher quality of human merchandise, our hero advances to the
                  children, about whose father he asks them unanswerable questions. How interesting
                  the children look!—how like a picture of beauty Annette's cherub face glows forth!
                  Being seriously concerned about the child, his countenance wears an air of deep
                  thought. "Colonel, what's your legal opinion of such pretty property?" enquires
                  Romescos, who advances to Mr. Seabrook, and, after a minute's hesitation, takes
                  the little girl in his arms, rudely kissing her as she presses his face from her
                  with her left hand, and poutingly wipes her mouth with her right.
               "Pretty as a picture"—Romescos has set the child down—"but I wouldn't give seven
                  coppers for both; for, by my faith, such property never does well." The gentleman
                  shakes his head in return. "It's a pity they're made it out nigger, though,—it's
                  so handsome. Sweet little creature, that child, I declare: her beauty would be
                  worth a fortune on the stage, when she grows up."
               Romescos touches Mr. Seabrook on the arm; remarks that such things are only good
                  for certain purposes; although one can make them pay if they know how to trade in
                  them. But it wants a man with a capable conscience to do the business up
                  profitably. "No chance o' your biddin' on 'um, is there, colonel?" he enquires, with a significant
                  leer, folding his arms with the indifference of a field-marshal. After a few
                  minutes' pause, during which Mr. Seabrook seems manufacturing an answer, he shrugs
                  his shoulders, and takes a few pleasing steps, as if moved to a waltzing humour.
                  "Don't scare up the like o' that gal-nigger every day," he adds. Again, as if
                  moved by some sudden idea, he approaches Annette, and placing his hand on her
                  head, continues: "If this ain't tumbling down a man's affairs by the run! Why,
                  colonel, 'taint more nor three years since old Hugh Marston war looked on as the
                  tallest planter on the Ashley; and he thought just as much o' these young 'uns as
                  if their mother had belonged to one of the first families. Now—I pity the poor
                  fellow!—because he tried to save 'em from being sold as slaves, they—his
                  creditors—think he has got more property stowed away somewhere. They're going to
                  cell him, just to try his talent at putting away things."
               The "prime fellows" and wenches of the darker and coarser quality have all been
                  disposed of; and the vender (the same gentlemanly man we have described selling
                  Marston's undisputed property) now orders the children to be brought forward.
                  Romescos, eagerly seizing them by the arms, brings them forward through the crowd,
                  places them upon the stand, before the eager gaze of those assembled. Strangely
                  placed upon the strange block, the spectators close in again, anxious to gain the
                  best position for inspection: but little children cannot stand the gaze of such an
                  assemblage: no; Annette turns toward Nicholas, and with a childish embrace throws
                  her tiny arms about his neck, buries her face on his bosom. The child of
                  misfortune seeks shelter from that shame of her condition, the evidence of which
                  is strengthened by the eager glances of those who stand round the shambles, ready
                  to purchase her fate. Even the vender,—distinguished gentleman that he is, and
                  very respectably allied by marriage to one of the "first families,"—is moved with
                  a strange sense of wrong at finding himself in a position somewhat repugnant to
                  his feelings. He cannot suppress a blush that indicates an innate sense of
                  shame.
               "Here they are, gentlemen! let no man say I have not done my duty. You have,
                  surely, all seen the pedigree of these children set forth in the morning papers;
                  and, now that you have them before you, the living specimen of their beauty will
                  fully authenticate anything therein set forth," the vender exclaims, affecting an
                  appearance in keeping with his trade. Notwithstanding this, there is a faltering
                  nervousness in his manner, betraying all his efforts at dissimulation. He reads
                  the invoice of human property to the listening crowd, dilates on its specific
                  qualities with powers of elucidation that would do credit to any member of the
                  learned profession. This opinion is confirmed by Romescos, the associations of
                  whose trade have gained for him a very intimate acquaintance with numerous
                  gentlemen of that very honourable profession.
               "Now, gentlemen," continues the vender, "the honourable high sheriff is anxious,
                  and so am I—and it's no more than a feelin' of deserving humanity, which every
                  southern gentleman is proud to exercise—that these children be sold to good, kind,
                  and respectable owners; and that they do not fall into the hands, as is generally
                  the case, of men who raise them up for infamous purposes. Gentlemen, I am
                  decidedly opposed to making licentiousness a means of profit."
               "That neither means you nor me," mutters Romescos, touching Mr. Seabrook on the
                  arm, shaking his head knowingly, and stepping aside to Graspum, in whose ear he
                  whispers a word. The very distinguished Mr. Graspum has been intently listening to
                  the outpouring of the vender's simplicity. What sublime nonsense it seems to him!
                  He suggests that it would be much more effectual if it came from the pulpit,—the
                  southern pulpit!
               "Better sell 'um to some deacon's family," mutters a voice in the crowd.
               "That's precisely what we should like, gentlemen; any bidder of that description
                  would get them on more favourable terms than a trader, he would," he returns,
                  quickly. The man of feeling, now wealthy from the sale of human beings, hopes
                  gentlemen will pardon his nervousness on this occasion. He never felt the delicacy
                  of his profession so forcibly—never, until now! His countenance changes with the
                  emotions of his heart; he blushes as he looks upon the human invoice, glances
                  slily over the corner at the children,
                  and again at his customers. The culminating point of his profession has arrived;
                  its unholy character is making war upon his better feelings. "I am not speaking
                  ironically, gentlemen: any bidder of the description I have named will get these
                  children at a satisfactory figure. Remember that, and that I am only acting in my
                  office for the honourable sheriff and the creditors," he concludes.
               "If that be the case," Mr. Seabrook thinks to himself, "it's quite as well. Our
                  good lady friend will be fully satisfied. She only wants to see them in good
                  hands: deacons are just the fellows." He very politely steps aside, lights his
                  choice habanero, and sends forth its curling fumes as the bidding goes on.
               A person having the appearance of a country gentleman, who has been some time
                  watching the proceedings, is seen to approach Graspum: this dignitary whispers
                  something in his ear, and he leaves the mart.
               "I say, squire!" exclaims Romescos, addressing himself to the auctioneer, "do you
                  assume the responsibility of making special purchasers? perhaps you had better
                  keep an eye to the law and the creditors, you had!" (Romescos's little red face
                  fires with excitement.) "No objection t' yer sellin' the gal to deacons and
                  elders,—even to old Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy, who's always singing, 'I know
                  that my Redeemer cometh!' But the statutes give me just as good a right to buy
                  her, as any first-class deacon. I knows law, and got lots o' lawyer friends."
               "The issue is painful enough, without any interposition from you, my friend,"
                  rejoins the vender, interrupting Romescos in his conversation. After a few minutes
                  pause, during which time he has been watching the faces of his customers, he adds:
                  "Perhaps, seeing how well mated they are, gentlemen will not let them be
                  separated. They have been raised together."
               "Certainly!" again interrupts Romescos, "it would be a pity to separate them, 'cos
                  it might touch somebody's heart."
               "Ah, that comes from Romescos; we may judge of its motive as we please," rejoins
                  the man of feeling, taking Annette by the arm and leading her to the extreme edge
                  of the stand. "Make us a bid, gentlemen, for the pair. I can see in the looks of
                  my customers that nobody will be so hard-hearted as to separate them. What do you
                  offer? say it! Start them; don't be bashful, gentlemen!"
               "Rather cool for a hard-faced nigger-seller! Well, squire, say four hundred
                  dollars and the treats,—that is, sposin' ye don't double my bid cos I isn't a
                  deacon. Wants the boy t' make a general on when he grows up; don't want the gal at
                  all. Let the deacon here (he points to the man who was seen whispering to Graspum)
                  have her, if he wants." The deacon, as Romescos calls him, edges his way through
                  the crowd up to the stand, and looks first at the vender and then at the children.
                  Turning his head aside, as if it may catch the ears of several bystanders,
                  Romescos whispers, "That's deacon Staggers, from Pineville."
               "Like your bid; but I'm frank enough to say I don't want you to have them,
                  Romescos," interposes the auctioneer, with a smile.
               "Four hundred and fifty dollars!" is sounded by a second bidder. The vender
                  enquires, "For the two?"
               "Yes! the pair on 'em," is the quick reply.
               "Four hundred and fifty dollars!" re-echoes the man of feeling. "What good
                  democrats you are! Why, gentlemen, it's not half the value of them. You must look
                  upon this property in a social light; then you will see its immense value. It's
                  intelligent, civil, and promisingly handsome; sold for no fault, and here you are
                  hesitating on a small bid.
               "Only four hundred and fifty dollars for such property, in this enlightened
                  nineteenth century!"
               "Trade will out, like murder. Squire wouldn't sell 'em to nobody but a deacon a
                  few minutes ago!" is heard coming from a voice in the crowd. The vender again
                  pauses, blushes, and contorts his face: he cannot suppress the zest of his
                  profession; it is uppermost in his feelings.
               Romescos says it is one of the squire's unconscious mistakes. There is no use of
                  humbugging; why not let them run off to the highest bidder?
               "The deacon has bid upon them; why not continue his advance?" says Mr. Seabrook,
                  who has been smoking his cigar the while.
               "Oh, well! seein' how it's the deacon, I won't stand agin his bid. It's Deacon
                  Staggers of Pineville; nobody doubts
                  his generosity," ejaculates Romescos, in a growling tone. The bids quicken,—soon
                  reach six hundred dollars.
               "Getting up pretty well, gentlemen! You must not estimate this property upon their
                  age: it's the likeliness and the promise."
               "Six hundred and twenty-five!" mutters the strange gentleman they call Deacon
                  Staggers from Pineville.
               "All right," rejoins Romescos; "just the man what ought to have 'em. I motion
                  every other bidder withdraw in deference to the deacon's claim," rejoins Romescos,
                  laughing.
               The clever vender gets down from the stand, views the young property from every
                  advantageous angle, dwells upon the bid, makes further comments on its choiceness,
                  and after considerable bantering, knocks them down to—"What name, sir?" he
                  enquires, staring at the stranger vacantly.
               "Deacon Staggers," replies the man, with a broad grin. Romescos motions him
                  aside,—slips a piece of gold into his hand; it is the price of his
                  pretensions.
               The clerk enters his name in the sales book: "Deacon Staggers, of Pineville,
                  bought May 18th, 18—.
               "Two children, very likely: boy, prime child, darkish hair, round figure,
                  intelligent face, not downcast, and well outlined in limb. Girl, very pretty,
                  bluish eyes, flaxen hair, very fair and very delicate. Price 625 dollars. Property
                  of Hugh Marston, and sold per order of the sheriff of the county, to satisfy two
                     fi fas issued from the Court of Common Pleas,
                  &c. &c. &c."
               An attendant now steps forward, takes the children into his charge, and leads them
                  away. To where? The reader may surmise to the gaol. No, reader, not to the gaol;
                  to Marco Graspum's slave-pen,—to that pent-up hell where the living are tortured
                  unto death, and where yearning souls are sold to sink!
               Thus are the beauties of this our democratic system illustrated in two innocent
                  children being consigned to the miseries of slave life because a mother is
                  supposed a slave: a father has acknowledged them, and yet they are sold before his
                  eyes. It is the majesty of slave law, before which good men prostrate their love
                  of independence. Democracy says the majesty of that law must be carried out;
                  creditors must be satisfied, even though all that is generous and noble in man
                  should be crushed out, and the rights of free men consigned to oblivion. A stout
                  arm may yet rise up in a good cause; democrats may stand ashamed of the inhuman
                  traffic, and seek to cover its poisoning head with artifices and pretences; but
                  they write only an obituary for the curse.
               "A quaint-faced, good-looking country deacon has bought them. Very good; I can now
                  go home, and relieve Mrs. Rosebrook's very generous feelings," says the very
                  distinguished Mr. Seabrook, shrugging his shoulders, lighting a fresh cigar, and
                  turning toward home with a deliberate step, full of good tidings.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXX.
               THE VISION OF DEATH HAS PAST.
               MR. SEABROOK returns to the mansion, and consoles the anxious lady by assuring her
                  the children have been saved from the hands of obnoxious traders—sold to a good,
                  country deacon. He was so delighted with their appearance that he could not keep
                  from admiring them, and does not wonder the good lady took so great an interest in
                  their welfare. He knows the ministerial-looking gentleman who bought them is a
                  kind master; he has an acute knowledge of human nature, and judges from his looks.
                  And he will further assure the good lady that the auctioneer proved himself a
                  gentleman—every inch of him! He wouldn't take a single bid from a trader, not even
                  from old Graspum (he dreads to come in contact with such a brute as he is, when he
                  gets his eye on a good piece o' nigger property), with all his money. As soon as
                  he heard the name of a deacon among the bidders, something in his heart forbade
                  his bidding against him.
               "You were not as good as your word, Mr. Seabrook," says the good lady, still
                  holding Mr. Seabrook by the hand. "But, are you sure there was no disguise about
                  the sale?"
               "Not the least, madam!" interrupts Mr. Seabrook, emphatically. "Bless me, madam,
                  our people are too sensitive not to detect anything of that kind; and too generous
                  to allow it if they did discover it. The children—my heart feels for them—are in
                  the very best hands; will be brought up just as pious and morally. Can't go astray
                  in the hands of a deacon—that's certain!" Mr. Seabrook rubs his hands, twists his
                  fingers in various ways, and gives utterance to words of consolation, most
                  blandly. The anxious lady seems disappointed, but is forced to accept the
                  assurance.
               We need scarcely tell the reader how intentionally Mr. Seabrook contented himself
                  with the deception practised at the mart, nor with what freedom he made use of
                  that blandest essence of southern assurance,—extreme politeness, to deceive the
                  lady. She, however, had long been laudably engaged in behalf of a down-trodden
                  race; and her knowledge of the secret workings of an institution which could only
                  cover its monstrosity with sophistry and fraud impressed her with the idea of some
                  deception having been practised. She well knew that Mr. Seabrook was one of those
                  very contented gentlemen who have strong faith in the present, and are willing to
                  sacrifice the future, if peace and plenty be secured to their hands. He had many
                  times been known to listen to the advice of his confidential slaves, and even to
                  yield to their caprices. And, too, he had been known to decry the ill-treatment of
                  slaves by brutal and inconsiderate masters; but he never thinks it worth while to
                  go beyond expressing a sort of rain-water sympathy for the maltreated. With those
                  traits most prominent in his character, Annette and Nicholas were to him mere
                  merchandise; and whatever claims to freedom they might have, through the
                  acknowledgments of a father, he could give them no consideration, inasmuch as the
                  law was paramount, and the great conservator of the south.
               Our worthy benefactress felt the force of the above, in his reluctance to execute
                  her commands, and the manner in which he faltered when questioned about the
                  purchase. Returning to her home, weighing the circumstances, she resolves to
                  devise some method of ascertaining the true position of the children. "Women are
                  not to be outdone," she says to herself.
               We must again beg the reader's indulgence while accompanying us in a retrograde
                  necessary to the connection of our narrative. When we left Mr. M'Fadden at the
                  crossing, more than two years ago, he was labouring under the excitement of a
                  wound he greatly feared would close the account of his mortal speculations.
               On the morning following that great political gathering, and during the night
                  Harry had so singularly disappeared, the tavern was rife with conjectures. On the
                  piazza and about the "bar-room" were a few stupefied and half-insensible figures
                  stretched upon benches, or reclining in chairs, their coarse garments rent into
                  tatters, and their besotted faces resembling as many florid masks grouped together
                  to represent some demoniacal scene among the infernals; others were sleeping
                  soundly beside the tables, or on the lawn. With filthy limbs bared, they snored
                  with painful discord, in superlative
                  contempt of everything around. Another party, reeking with the fumes of that
                  poisonous drug upon which candidates for a people's favours had built their high
                  expectations, were leaning carelessly against the rude counter of the "bar-room,"
                  casting wistful glances at the fascinating bottles so securely locked within the
                  lattice-work in the corner. Oaths of touching horror are mingling with loud calls
                  for slave attendants, whose presence they wait to quench their burning thirst.
                  Reader! digest the moral. In this human menagerie—in this sink of besotted
                  degradation—lay the nucleus of a power by which the greatest interests of state
                  are controlled.
               A bedusted party of mounted men have returned from a second ineffectual attempt to
                  recover the lost preacher: the appearance of responsibility haunts mine host. He
                  assured Mr. Lawrence M'Fadden that his property would be perfectly secure under
                  the lock of the corn-shed. And now his anxiety exhibits itself in the readiness
                  with which he supplies dogs, horses, guns, and such implements as are necessary to
                  hunt down an unfortunate minister of the gospel. What makes the whole thing worse,
                  was the report of M'Fadden having had a good sleep and awaking much more
                  comfortable; that there was little chance of the fortunate issue of his death. In
                  this, mine host saw the liability increasing two-fold.
               He stands his important person, (hat off, face red with expectancy, and hands
                  thrust well down into his breeches pocket), on the top step of the stairs leading
                  to the veranda, and hears the unfavourable report with sad discomfiture. "That's
                  what comes of making a preacher of a slave! Well! I've done all I can. It puts all
                  kinds of deviltry about runnin' away into their heads," he ventures to assert, as
                  he turns away, re-enters the "bar-room," and invites all his friends to drink at
                  his expense.
               "Mark what I say, now, Squire Jones. The quickest way to catch that ar' nigger 's
                  just to lay low and keep whist. He's a pious nigger; and a nigger can't keep his
                  pious a'tween his teeth, no more nor a blackbird can his chattering. The feller
                  'll feel as if he wants to redeem somebody; and seeing how 'tis so, if ye just
                  watch close some Sunday ye'll nab the fellow with his own pious bait. Can catch a
                  pious runaway nigger 'most any time; the brute never knows enough to keep it to
                  himself," says a flashily dressed gentleman, as he leaned against the counter,
                  squinted his eye with an air of ponderous satisfaction, and twirled his tumbler
                  round and round on the counter. "'Pears to me," he continues, quizzically,
                  "Squire, you've got a lot o' mixed cracker material here, what it'll be hard to
                  manufactor to make dependable voters on, 'lection day:" he casts a look at the
                  medley of sleepers.
               "I wish the whole pack on 'em was sold into slavery, I do! They form six-tenths of
                  the voters in our state, and are more ignorant, and a great deal worse citizens,
                  than our slaves. Bl— 'em, there is'nt one in fifty can read or write, and they're
                  impudenter than the Governor."
               "Hush! hush! squire. 'Twon't do to talk so. There ain't men nowhere stand on
                  dignity like them fellers; they are the very bone-and-siners of the unwashed,
                  hard-fisted democracy. The way they'd pull this old tavern down, if they heard
                  reflections on their honour, would be a caution to storms. But how's old
                  iron-sided M'Fadden this morning? Begins to think of his niggers, I reckon,"
                  interrupts the gentleman; to which mine host shakes his head, despondingly. Mine
                  host wishes M'Fadden, nigger, candidates and all, a very long distance from his
                  place.
               "I s'pose he thinks old Death, with his grim visage, ain't going to call for him
                  just now. That's ollers the way with northerners, who lives atween the hope of
                  something above, and the love of makin' money below: they never feel bad about the
                  conscience, until old Davy Jones, Esq., the gentleman with the horns and tail,
                  takes them by the nose, and says—'come!'"
               "I have struck an idea," says our worthy host, suddenly striking his hand on the
                  counter. "I will put up a poster. I will offer a big reward. T'other property's
                  all safe; there's only the preacher missing."
               "Just the strike! Give us yer hand, squire!" The gentleman reaches his hand across
                  the counter, and smiles, while cordially embracing mine host. "Make the reward
                  about two hundred, so I can make a good week's work for the dogs and me. Got the
                  best pack in the parish; one on 'em knows as much as most clergymen, he does!" he
                  very deliberately concludes, displaying a wonderful opinion of his own
                  nigger-catching philosophy.
               
               And Mr. Jones, such is mine host's name, immediately commenced exercising his
                  skill in composition on a large, poster, which with a good hour's labour he
                  completes, and posts upon the ceiling of the "bar-room," just below an enormously
                  illustrated Circus bill.
               "There! now's a chance of some enterprise and some sense. There's a deuced nice
                  sum to be made at that!" says Mr. Jones, emphatically, as he stands a few steps
                  back, and reads aloud the following sublime outline of his genius:— 
                     
                        
                           
                              "GREAT INDUCEMENT FOR SPORTSMEN.
                              Two Hundred Dollars Reward.
                              The above reward will be given anybody for the apprehension of the
                                 nigger-boy, Harry, the property of Mr. M'Fadden. Said Harry
                                 suddenly disappeared from these premises last night, while his
                                 master was supposed to be dying. The boy's a well-developed nigger,
                                 'ant sassy, got fine bold head and round face, and intelligent eye,
                                 and 's about five feet eleven inches high, and equally
                                 proportionate elsewhere. He's much giv'n to preachin', and most
                                 likely is secreted in some of the surrounding swamps, where he will
                                 remain until tempted to make his appearance on some plantation for
                                 the purpose of exortin his feller niggers. He is well disposed, and
                                 is said to have a good disposition, so that no person need fear to
                                 approach him for capture. The above reward will be paid upon his
                                 delivery at any gaol in the State, and a hundred and fifty dollars
                                 if delivered at any gaol out of the State.
                              
                                 "JETHRO JONES."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Just the instrument to bring him, Jethro!" intimates our fashionable gent,
                  quizzically, as he stands a few feet behind Mr. Jones, making grimaces. Then,
                  gazing intently at the bill for some minutes, he runs his hands deep into his
                  pockets, affects an air of greatest satisfaction, and commences whistling a tune
                  to aid in suppressing a smile that is invading his countenance. "Wouldn't be in
                  that nigger's skin for a thousand or more dollars, I wouldn't!" he continues,
                  screeching in the loudest manner, and then shaking, kicking, and rousing the
                  half-animate occupants of the floor and benches. "Come! get up here! Prize money
                  ahead! Fine fun for a week. Prize money ahead! wake up, ye jolly sleepers, loyal
                  citizens, independent voters—wake up, I say. Here's fun and frolic, plenty of
                  whiskey, and two hundred dollars reward for every mother's son of ye what wants to
                  hunt a nigger; and he's a preachin nigger at that! Come; whose in for the frolic,
                  ye hard-faced democracy that love to vote for your country's good and a good
                  cause?" After exerting himself for some time, they begin to scramble up like so
                  many bewildered spectres of blackness, troubled to get light through the means of
                  their blurred faculties.
               "Who's dragging the life out o' me?" exclaims one, straining his mottled eyes,
                  extending his wearied limbs, gasping as if for breath; then staggering to the
                  counter. Finally, after much struggling, staggering, expressing consternation,
                  obscene jeering, blasphemous oaths and filthy slang, they stand upright, and
                  huddle around the notice. The picture presented by their ragged garments, their
                  woebegone faces, and their drenched faculties, would, indeed, be difficult to
                  transfer to canvas.
               "Now, stare! stare! with all yer fire-stained eyes, ye clan of motley vagrants—ye
                  sovereign citizens of a sovereign state. Two hundred dollars! aye, two hundred
                  dollars for ye. Make plenty o' work for yer dogs; knowin brutes they are. And
                  ye'll get whiskey enough to last the whole district more nor a year," says our
                  worthy Jones, standing before them, and pointing his finger at the notice. They,
                  as if doubting their own perceptibilities, draw nearer and nearer, straining their
                  eyes, while their bodies oscillate against each other.
               Mine host tells them to consider the matter, and be prepared for action, while he
                  will proceed to M'Fadden's chamber and learn the state of his health.
               He opens the sick man's chamber, and there, to his surprise, is the invalid
                  gentleman, deliberately taking his tea and toast. Mine host congratulates him upon
                  his appearance, extends his hand, takes a seat by his bed-side. "I had fearful
                  apprehensions about you, my friend," he says.
               "So had I about myself. I thought I was going to slip it in right earnest. My
                  thoughts and feelins—how they wandered!" M'Fadden raises his hand to his forehead,
                  and slowly shakes his head. "I would'nt
                  a' given much for the chances, at one time; but the wound isn't so bad, after all.
                  My nigger property gets along all straight, I suppose?" he enquires, coolly,
                  rolling his eyes upwards with a look of serious reflection. "Boy preacher never
                  returned last night. It's all right, though, I suppose?" again he enquired,
                  looking mine host right in the eye, as if he discovered some misgiving. His
                  seriousness soon begins to give place to anxiety.
               "That boy was a bad nigger," says mine host, in a half-whisper; "but you must not
                  let your property worry you, my friend."
               "Bad nigger!" interrupts the invalid. Mine host pauses for a moment, while
                  M'Fadden sets his eyes upon him with a piercing stare.
               "Not been cutting up nigger tricks?" he ejaculates, enquiringly, about to spring
                  from his couch with his usual nimbleness. Mine host places his left hand upon his
                  shoulder, and assures him there is no cause of alarm.
               "Tell me if any thing's wrong about my property. Now do,—be candid:" his eyes
                  roll, anxiously.
               "All right—except the preacher; he's run away," mine host answers, suggesting how
                  much better it will be to take the matter cool, as he is sure to be captured.
               "What! who—how? you don't say! My very choicest piece of property. Well—well! who
                  will believe in religion, after that? He came to my sick chamber, the black
                  vagabond did, and prayed as piously as a white man. And it went right to my heart;
                  and I felt that if I died it would a' been the means o' savin my soul from all
                  sorts of things infernal," says the recovering M'Fadden. He, the black preacher,
                  is only a nigger after all; and his owner will have him back, or he'll have his
                  black hide—that he will! The sick man makes another effort to rise, but is calmed
                  into resignation through mine host's further assurance that the property will be
                  "all right" by the time he gets well.
               "How cunning it was in the black vagrant! I shouldn't be a bit surprised if he
                  cleared straight for Massachusetts—Massachusetts hates our State. Her
                  abolitionists will ruin us yet, sure as the world. We men of the
                  South must do something on a grand scale to protect our rights and our property.
                  The merchants of the North will help us; they are all interested in slave labour.
                  Cotton is king; and cotton can rule, if it will. Cotton can make friendship
                  strong, and political power great.
               "There's my cousin John, ye see; he lives north, but is married to a woman south.
                  He got her with seventeen mules and twenty-three niggers. And there's brother
                  Jake's daughter was married to a planter out south what owns lots o' niggers. And
                  there's good old uncle Richard; he traded a long time with down south folks, made
                  heaps a money tradin niggers in a sly way, and never heard a word said about
                  slavery not being right, that he did'nt get into a deuce of a fuss, and feel like
                  fightin? Two of Simon Wattler's gals were married down south, and all the family
                  connections became down-south in principle. And here's Judge Brooks out here, the
                  very best down-south Judge on the bench; he come from cousin Ephraim's
                  neighbourhood, down east. It's just this way things is snarled up a'tween us and
                  them ar' fellers down New England way. It keeps up the strength of our peculiar
                  institution, though. And southern Editors! just look at them; why, Lord love yer
                  soul! two thirds on' em are imported from down-north way; and they make the very
                  best southern-principled men. I thought of that last night, when Mr. Jones with
                  the horns looked as if he would go with him. But, I'll have that preachin vagrant,
                  I'll have him!" says Mr. M'Fadden, emphatically, seeming much more at rest about
                  his departing affairs. As the shadows of death fade from his sight into their
                  proper distance, worldly figures and property justice resume their wonted
                  possession of his thoughts.
               Again, as if suddenly seized with pain, he contorts his face, and enquires in a
                  half-whisper—"What if this wound should mortify? would death follow quickly? I'm
                  dubious yet!"
               Mine host approaches nearer his bed-side, takes his hand. M'Fadden, with much
                  apparent meekness, would know what he thought of his case?
               He is assured by the kind gentleman that he is entirely out of danger—worth a
                  whole parish of dead men. At the same time, mine host insinuates that he will
                  never do to fight duels until he learns to die fashionably.
               M'Fadden smiles,—remembers how many men have been nearly killed and yet escaped the undertaker,—seems
                  to have regained strength, and calls for a glass of whiskey and water. Not too
                  strong! but, reminding mine host of the excellent quality of his bitters, he
                  suggests that a little may better his case.
               "I didn't mean the wound," resuming his anxiety for the lost preacher: "I meant
                  the case of the runaway?"
               "Oh! oh! bless me! he will forget he is a runaway piece of property in his
                  anxiousness to put forth his spiritual inclinations. That's what'll betray the
                  scamp;—nigger will be nigger, you know! They can't play the lawyer, nohow," mine
                  host replies, with an assurance of his ability to judge negro character. This is a
                  new idea, coming like the dew-drops of heaven to relieve his anxiety. The
                  consoling intelligence makes him feel more comfortable.
               The whiskey-and-bitters—most unpoetic drink—is brought to his bed-side. He
                  tremblingly carries it to his lips, sips and sips; then, with one gulp, empties
                  the glass. At this moment the pedantic physician makes his appearance, scents the
                  whiskey, gives a favourable opinion of its application as a remedy in certain
                  cases. The prescription is not a bad one. Climate, and such a rusty constitution
                  as Mr. M'Fadden is blest with, renders a little stimulant very necessary to keep
                  up the one thing needful—courage! The patient complains bitterly to the man of
                  pills and powders; tells a great many things about pains and fears. What a
                  dreadful thing if the consequence had proved fatal! He further thinks that it was
                  by the merest act of Providence, in such a desperate affray, he had not been
                  killed outright. A great many bad visions have haunted him in his dreams, and he
                  is very desirous of knowing what the man of salts and senna thinks about the true
                  interpretation of such. About the time he was dreaming such dreams he was
                  extremely anxious to know how the spiritual character of slave-holders stood on
                  the records of heaven, and whether the fact of slave-owning would cause the
                  insertion of an item in the mortal warrant forming the exception to a peaceful
                  conclusion with the Father's forgiveness. He felt as if he would surely die during
                  the night past, and his mind became so abstracted about what he had done in his
                  life,—what was to come, how negro property had been treated, how it should be
                  treated,—that, although he had opinions now and then widely-different, it had left
                  a problem which would take him all his life-time to solve,—if he should live ever
                  so long. And, too, there were these poor wretches accidentally shot down at his
                  side; his feelings couldn't withstand the ghostly appearance of their corpses as
                  he was carried past them, perhaps to be buried n the same forlorn grave, the very
                  next day. All these things reflected their results through the morbidity of Mr.
                  M'Fadden's mind; but his last observation, showing how slender is the cord between
                  life and death, proved what was uppermost in his mind. "You'll allow I'm an honest
                  man? I have great faith in your opinion, Doctor! And if I have been rather
                  go-ahead with my niggers, my virtue in business matters can't be sprung," he
                  mutters. The physician endeavours to calm his anxiety, by telling him he is a
                  perfect model of goodness,—a just, honest, fearless, and enterprising planter; and
                  that these attributes of our better nature constitute such a balance in the scale
                  as will give any gentleman slaveholder very large claims to that spiritual
                  proficiency necessary for the world to come.
               Mr. M'Fadden acquiesces in the correctness of this remark, but desires to inform
                  the practitioner what a sad loss he has met with. He is sure the gentleman will
                  scarcely believe his word when he tells him what it is. "I saw how ye felt
                  downright affected when that nigger o' mine prayed with so much that seemed like
                  honesty and christianity, last night," he says.
               "Yes," interrupts the man of medicine, "he was a wonderful nigger that. I never
                  heard such natural eloquence nor such pathos; he is a wonder among niggers, he is!
                  Extraordinary fellow for one raised up on a plantation. Pity, almost, that such a
                  clergyman should be a slave."
               "You don't say so, Doctor, do you? Well! I've lost him just when I wanted him
                  most."
               "He is not dead?" enquires the physician, suddenly interrupting. He had seen Mr.
                  M'Fadden's courage fail at the approach of death, and again recover quickly when
                  the distance widened between that monitor and himself, and could not suppress the
                  smile stealing over his countenance.
               "Dead! no indeed. Worse—he has run away!" Mr. M'Fadden quickly retorted, clenching
                  his right hand, and scowling. In another minute he turns back the sheets, and, with returned strength, makes a
                  successful attempt to sit up in bed. "I don't know whether I'm better or worse;
                  but I think it would be all right if I warn't worried so much about the loss of
                  that preacher. I paid a tremendous sum for him. And the worst of it is, my cousin
                  deacon Stoner, of a down-east church, holds a mortgage on my nigger stock, and he
                  may feel streaked when he hears of the loss;" Mr. M'Fadden concludes, holding his
                  side to the physician, who commences examining the wound, which the enfeebled man
                  says is very sore and must be dressed cautiously, so that he may be enabled to get
                  out and see to his property.
               To the great surprise of all, the wound turns out to be merely a slight cut, with
                  no appearance of inflammation, and every prospect of being cured through a further
                  application of a very small bit of dressing plaster.
               The physician smiled, mine host smiled; it was impossible to suppress the risible
                  faculties. The poor invalid is overpowered with disappointment. His imagination
                  had betrayed him into one of those desperate, fearful, and indubitable brinks of
                  death, upon which it seems the first law of nature reminds us what is necessary to
                  die by. They laughed, and laughed, and laughed, till Mr. M'Fadden suddenly changed
                  countenance, and said it was no laughing affair,—such things were not to be
                  trifled with; men should be thinking of more important matters. And he looked at
                  the wound, run his fingers over it gently, and rubbed it as if doubting the
                  depth.
               "A little more whiskey would'nt hurt me, Doctor?" he enquires, complacently,
                  looking round the room distrustfully at those who were enjoying the joke, more at
                  his expense than he held to be in accordance with strict rules of etiquette.
               "I'll admit, my worthy citizen, your case seemed to baffle my skill, last night,"
                  the physician replies, jocosely. "Had I taken your political enthusiasm into
                  consideration,—and your readiness to instruct an assemblage in the holy democracy
                  of our south,—and your hopes of making strong draughts do strong political work, I
                  might have saved my opiate, and administered to your case more in accordance with
                  the skilfully administered prescriptions of our politicians. Notwithstanding, I am
                  glad you are all right, and trust that whenever you get your enthusiasm fired with
                  bad brandy, or the candidates' bad whiskey, you will not tax other people's
                  feelings with your own dying affairs; nor send for a 'nigger' preacher to redeem
                  your soul, who will run away when he thinks the job completed."
               Mr. M'Fadden seemed not to comprehend the nature of his physician's language, and
                  after a few minutes pause he must needs enquire about the weather? if a coroner's
                  inquest has been held over the dead men? what was its decision? was there any
                  decision at all? and have they been buried? Satisfied on all these points, he gets
                  up, himself again, complaining only of a little muddled giddiness about the head,
                  and a hip so sore that he scarcely could reconcile his mind to place confidence in
                  it.
               "Good by! good by!" says the physician, shaking him by the hand. "Measure the
                  stimulant carefully; and take good care of dumplin depôt No. 1, and you'll be all
                  right very soon. You're a good democrat, and you'll make as good a stump orator as
                  ever took the field."
               The man of medicine, laughing heartily within himself, descends the stairs and
                  reaches the bar-room, where are concentrated sundry of the party we have before
                  described. They make anxious enquiries about Mr. M'Fadden,—how he seemed to "take
                  it;" did he evince want of pluck? had he courage enough to fight a duel? and could
                  his vote be taken afore he died? These, and many other questions of a like nature,
                  were put to the physician so fast, and with so many invitations to drink
                  "somethin'," that he gave a sweeping answer by saying Mac had been more frightened
                  than hurt; that the fear of death having passed from before his eyes his mind had
                  now centered on the loss of his nigger preacher—a valuable piece of property that
                  had cost him no less than fifteen hundred dollars. And the worst of it was, that
                  the nigger had aggravatingly prayed for him when he thought he was going to sink
                  out into the arms of father death.
               So pressing were the invitations to drink, that our man of medicine advanced to
                  the counter, like a true gentleman of the south, and with his glass filled with an
                  aristocratic mixture, made one of his politest bows, toasted the health of all
                  free citizens, adding his hope for the success of the favourite candidate.
               "Drink it with three cheers, standin'!" shouted a formidably dably mustached figure, leaning against the counter
                  with his left hand, while his right was grasping the jug from which he was
                  attempting in vain to water his whiskey. To this the physic gentleman bows assent;
                  and they are given to the very echo. Taking his departure for the city, as the
                  sounds of cheering die away, he emerged from the front door, as Mr. M'Fadden,
                  unexpectedly as a ghost rising from the tomb, made his entrance from the old
                  staircase in the back. The citizens—for of such is our assembly composed—are
                  astonished and perplexed. "Such a set of scapegoats as you are!" grumbles out the
                  debutant, as he stands before them like a disentombed spectre. With open arms they
                  approach him, congratulate him on his recovery, and shower upon him many good
                  wishes, and long and strong drinks.
               A few drinks more, and our hero is quite satisfied with his welcome. His desire
                  being intimated, mine host conducts himself to the corn-shed, where he satisfies
                  himself that his faithful property (the preacher excepted) is all snugly safe.
                  Happy property in the hands of a prodigious democrat! happy republicanism that
                  makes freedom but a privilege! that makes a mockery of itself, and enslaves the
                  noblest blood of noble freemen! They were happy, the victims of ignorance,
                  contented with the freedom their country had given them, bowing beneath the
                  enslaving yoke of justice-boasting democracy, and ready to be sold and shipped,
                  with an invoice of freight, at the beckon of an owner.
               Mr. M'Fadden questions the people concerning Harry's departure; but they are as
                  ignorant of his whereabouts as himself. They only remember that he came to the
                  shed at midnight, whispered some words of consolation, and of his plain fare gave
                  them to eat;—nothing more.
               "Poor recompense for my goodness!" says Mr. M'Fadden, muttering some indistinct
                  words as he returns to the tavern, followed by a humorous negro, making grimaces
                  in satisfaction of "mas'r's" disappointment. Now friends are gathered together,
                  chuckling in great glee over the large reward offered for the lost parson, for the
                  capture of which absconding article they have numerous horses, dogs, confidential
                  negroes, and a large supply of whiskey, with which very necessary liquid they will
                  themselves become dogs of one kine. The game to be played is purely a democratic
                  one; hence the clansmen are ready to loosen their souls' love for the service.
                  M'Fadden never before witnessed such satisfactory proofs of his popularity; his
                  tenderest emotions are excited; he cannot express the fullness of his heart; he
                  bows, puts his hand to his heart, orders the balance of his invoice sent to his
                  plantation, mounts his horse, and rides off at full gallop, followed by his
                  friends.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               A FRIEND IS WOMAN.
               THE reader will again accompany us to the time when we find Annette and Nicholas
                  in the hands of Graspum, who will nurture them for their increasing value.
               Merciless creditors have driven Marston from that home of so many happy and
                  hospitable associations, to seek shelter in the obscure and humble chamber of a
                  wretched building in the outskirts of the city. Fortune can afford him but a small
                  cot, two or three broken chairs, an ordinary deal table, a large chest, which
                  stands near the fire-place, and a dressing-stand, for furniture. Here, obscured
                  from the society he had so long mingled with, he spends most of his time, seldom
                  venturing in public lest he may encounter those indomitable gentlemen who would
                  seem to love the following misfortune into its last stage of distress. His worst
                  enemy, however, is that source of his misfortunes he cannot disclose; over it
                  hangs the mystery he must not solve! It enshrines him with guilt before public
                  opinion; by it his integrity lies dead; it is that which gives to mother rumour
                  the weapons with which to wield her keenest slanders.
               Having seized Marston's real estate, Graspum had no scruples about swearing to the
                  equity of his claim; nor were any of the creditors willing to challenge an
                  investigation; and thus, through fear of such a formidable abettor, Marston
                  laboured under the strongest, and perhaps the most unjust imputations. But there
                  was no limit to Graspum's mercenary proceedings; for beyond involving Marston
                  through Lorenzo, he had secretly purchased many claims of the creditors, and
                  secured his money by a dexterous movement, with which he reduced the innocent
                  children to slavery.
               Reports have spread among the professedly knowing that Marston can never have made
                  away with all his property in so few years. And the manner being so invisible, the
                  charge becomes stronger. Thus, labouring between the pain of misfortune and the
                  want of means to resent suspicion, his cheerless chamber is all he can now call
                  his home. But he has two good friends left—Franconia, and the old negro Bob.
                  Franconia has procured a municipal badge for Daddy; and, through it (disguised) he
                  seeks and obtains work at stowing cotton on the wharfs. His earnings are small,
                  but his soul is large, and embued with attachment for his old master, with whom he
                  will share them. Day by day the old slave seems to share the feelings of his
                  master,—to exhibit a solicitous concern for his comfort. Earning his dollars and
                  twenty-five cents a day, he will return when the week has ended, full of
                  exultation, spread out his earnings with childlike simplicity, take thirty cents a
                  day for himself, and slip the remainder into Marston's pocket. How happy he seems,
                  as he watches the changes of Marston's countenance, and restrains the gushing
                  forth of his feelings!
               It was on one of those nights upon which Daddy had received his earnings, that
                  Marston sat in his cheerless chamber, crouched over the faint blaze of a few
                  pieces of wood burning on the bricks of his narrow fire-place, contemplating the
                  eventful scenes of the few years just passed. The more he contemplated the more it
                  seemed like a dream; his very head wearied with the interminable maze of his
                  difficulties. Further and further, as he contemplated, did it open to his thoughts
                  the strange social and political mystery of that more strange institution for
                  reducing mankind to the level of brutes. And yet, democracy, apparently honest,
                  held such inviolable and just to its creed; which creed it would defend with a
                  cordon of steel. The dejected gentleman sighs, rests his head on his left hand,
                  and his elbow on the little table at his side. Without, the weather is cold and
                  damp; an incessant rain had pattered upon the roof throughout the day, wild and
                  murky clouds hang their dreary festoons along the heavens, and swift scudding
                  fleeces, driven by fierce, murmuring winds, bespread the prospect with gloom that
                  finds its way into the recesses of the heart.
               "Who is worse than a slave!" sighs the rejected man, getting up and looking out of
                  his window into the dreary recesses of the narrow lane. "If it be not a ruined
                  planter I mistake the policy by which we govern our institution! As the slave is born a subject being, so is the
                  planter a dependent being. We planters live in disappointment, in fear, in unhappy
                  uncertainty; and yet we make no preparations for the result. Nay, we even content
                  ourselves with pleasantly contemplating what may come through the eventful issue
                  of political discord; and when it comes in earnest, we find ourselves the most
                  hapless of unfortunates. For myself, bereft of all I had once,—even friends, I am
                  but a forlorn object in the scale of weak mankind! No man will trust me with his
                  confidence,—scarce one knows me but to harass me; I can give them no more, and yet
                  I am suspected of having more. It is so, and ever will be so. Such are the phases
                  of man's downfall, that few follow them to the facts, while rumour rules supreme
                  over misfortune. There may be a fountain of human pain concealed beneath it; but
                  few extend the hand to stay its quickening. Nay, when all is gone, mammon cries,
                  more! until body and soul are crushed beneath the "more" of relentless self.
               "Few know the intricacies of our system; perhaps 'twere well, lest our souls
                  should not be safe within us. But, ah! my conscience chides me here. And betwixt
                  those feelings which once saw all things right, but now through necessity beholds
                  their grossest wrongs, comes the pain of self-condemnation. It is a condemnation
                  haunting me unto death. Had I been ignorant of Clotilda's history, the fiendish
                  deed of those who wronged her in her childhood had not now hung like a loathsome
                  pestilence around my very garments. That which the heart rebukes cannot be
                  concealed; but we must be obedient to the will that directs all things;—and if it
                  be that we remain blind in despotism until misfortune opens our eyes, let the
                  cause of the calamity be charged to those it belongs to," he concludes; and then,
                  after a few minutes' silence, he lights his taper, and sets it upon the table. His
                  care-worn countenance pales with melancholy; his hair has whitened with
                  tribulation; his demeanour denotes a man of tender sensibility fast sinking into a
                  physical wreck. A well-soiled book lies on the table, beside which he takes his
                  seat; he turns its pages over and over carelessly, as if it were an indifferent
                  amusement to wile away the time. "They cannot enslave affection, nor can they
                  confine it within prison walls," he mutters. He has proof in the faithfulness of
                  Daddy, his old slave. And as he contemplates, the words "she will be more than
                  welcome to-night," escape his lips. Simultaneously a gentle tapping is heard at
                  the door. Slowly it opens, and the figure of an old negro, bearing a basket on his
                  arm, enters. He is followed by the slender and graceful form of Franconia, who
                  approaches her uncle, hand extended, salutes him with a kiss, seats herself at his
                  side, says he must not be sad. Then she silently gazes upon him for a few moments,
                  as if touched by his troubles, while the negro, having spread the contents of the
                  basket upon the chest, makes a humble bow, wishes mas'r and missus good night, and
                  withdraws. "There, uncle," she says, laying her hand gently on his arm, "I didn't
                  forget you, did I?" She couples the word with a smile—a smile so sweet, so
                  expressive of her soul's goodness. "You are dear to me, uncle; yes, as dear as a
                  father. How could I forget that you have been a father to me? I have brought these
                  little things to make you comfortable,"—she points to the edibles on the
                  chest—"and I wish I were not tied to a slave, uncle, for then I could do more.
                  Twice, since my marriage to M'Carstrow, have I had to protect myself from his
                  ruffianism."
               "From his ruffianism!" interrupts Marston, quickly: "Can it be, my child, that
                  even a ruffian would dare exhibit his vileness toward you?"
               "Even toward me, uncle. With reluctance I married him, and my only regret is, that
                  a slave's fate had not been mine ere the fruits of that day fell upon me. Women
                  like me make a feeble defence in the world; and bad husbands are the shame of
                  their sex," she returns, her eyes brightening with animation, as she endeavours to
                  calm the excitement her remarks have given rise to: "Don't, pray don't mind it,
                  uncle," she concludes.
               "Such news had been anticipated; but I was cautious not to"—
               "Never mind," she interrupts, suddenly coiling her delicate arm round his neck,
                  and impressing a kiss on his care-worn cheek. "Let us forget these things; they
                  are but the fruits of weak nature. It were better to bear up under trouble than
                  yield to trouble's burdens: better far. Who knows but that it is all for the
                  best?" She rises, and, with seeming cheerfulness, proceeds to spread the little
                  table with the refreshing tokens of her friendship. Yielding to necessity, the table is spread, and they sit down,
                  with an appearance of domestic quietness touchingly humble.
               "There is some pleasure, after all, in having a quiet spot where we can sit down
                  and forget our cares. Perhaps (all said and done) a man may call himself prince of
                  his own garret, when he can forget all beyond it," says Marston affected to tears
                  by Franconia's womanly resignation.
               "Yes," returns Franconia, joyously, "it's a consolation to know that we have
                  people among us much worse off than we are. I confess, though, I feel uneasy about
                  our old slaves. Slavery's wrong, uncle; and it's when one's reduced to such
                  extremes as are presented in this uninviting garret that we realise it the more
                  forcibly. It gives the poor wretches no chance of bettering their condition; and
                  if one exhibits ever so much talent over the other, there is no chance left him to
                  improve it. It is no recompense to the slave that his talent only increases the
                  price of the article to be sold. Look what Harry would have been had he enjoyed
                  freedom. Uncle, we forget our best interests while pondering over the security of
                  a bad system. Would it not be better to cultivate the slave's affections, rather
                  than oppress his feelings?" Franconia has their cause at heart—forgets her own.
                  She is far removed from the cold speculations of the south; she is free from
                  mercenary motives; unstained by that principle of logic which recognises only the
                  man merchandise. No will hath she to contrive ingenious apologies for the wrongs
                  inflicted upon a fallen race. Her words spring from the purest sentiment of the
                  soul; they contain a smarting rebuke of Marston's former misdoings: but he cannot
                  resent it, nor can he turn the tide of his troubles against her noble
                  generosity.
               They had eaten their humble supper of meats and bread, and coffee, when Franconia
                  hears a rap at the lower entrance, leading into the street. Bearing the taper in
                  her hand, she descends the stairs quickly, and, opening the door, recognises the
                  smiling face of Daddy Bob. Daddy greets her as if he were surcharged with the very
                  best news for old mas'r and missus. He laughs in the exuberance of his simplicity,
                  and, with an air of fondness that would better become a child, says, "Lor', young
                  missus, how glad old Bob is to see ye! Seems like long time since old man see'd
                  Miss Frankone look so spry. Got dat badge." The old man shows her his badge,
                  exultingly. "Missus, nobody know whose nigger I'm's, and old Bob arns a right
                  smart heap o' money to make mas'r comfortable." The old slave never for once
                  thinks of his own infirmities; no, his attachment for master soars above every
                  thing else; he thinks only in what way he can relieve his necessities. Honest,
                  faithful, and affectionate, the associations of the past are uppermost in his
                  mind; he forgets his slavery in his love for master and the old plantation.
                  Readily would he lay down his life, could he, by so doing, lighten the troubles he
                  instinctively sees in the changes of master's position. The old plantation and its
                  people have been sold; and he, being among the separated from earth's chosen, must
                  save his infirm body lest some man sell him for the worth thereof. Bob's face is
                  white with beard, and his coarse garments are much worn and ragged; but there is
                  something pleasing in the familiarity with which Franconia accepts his brawny
                  hand. How free from that cold advance, that measured welcome, and that religious
                  indifference, with which the would-be friend of the slave, at the north, too often
                  accepts the black man's hand! There is something in the fervency with which she
                  shakes his wrinkled hand that speaks of the goodness of the heart; something that
                  touches the old slave's childlike nature. He smiles bashfully, and says, "Glad t'
                  see ye, missus; dat I is: 'spishilly ven ye takes care on old mas'r." After
                  receiving her salutation he follows her to the chamber, across which he hastens to
                  receive a welcome from old mas'r. Marston warmly receives his hand, and motions
                  him to be seated on the chest near the fire-place. Bob takes his seat, keeping his
                  eye on mas'r the while. "Neber mind, mas'r," he says, "Big Mas'r above be better
                  dan Buckra. Da'h is somefin' what Buckra no sell from ye, dat's a good heart. If
                  old mas'r on'y keeps up he spirit, de Lor' 'll carry un throu' 'e triblation," he
                  continues; and, after watching his master a few minutes, returns to Franconia, and
                  resumes his jargon.
               Franconia is the same fair creature Bob watched over when she visited the
                  plantation: her countenance wears the same air of freshness and frankness; her
                  words are of the same gentleness; she seems as solicitous of his comfort as
                  before. And yet a shadow of sadness shrouds that vivacity which had made her the
                  welcome guest of the old slaves. He
                  cannot resist those expressions which are ever ready to lisp forth from the negro
                  when his feelings are excited. "Lor, missus, how old Bob's heart feels! Hah, ah!
                  yah, yah! Looks so good, and reminds old Bob how e' look down on dah Astley,
                  yander. But, dah somefin in dat ar face what make old nigger like I know missus
                  don't feel just right," he exclaims.
               The kind woman reads his thoughts in the glowing simplicity of his wrinkled face.
                  "It has been said that a dog was our last friend, Bob: I now think a slave should
                  have been added. Don't you think so, uncle?" she enquires, looking at Marston,
                  and, again taking the old slave by the hand, awaits the reply.
               "We rarely appreciate their friendship until it be too late to reward it," he
                  replies, with an attempt to smile.
               "True, true! but the world is full of ingratitude,—very amiable ingratitude. Never
                  mind, Daddy; you must now tell me all about your affairs, and what has happened
                  since the night you surprised me at our house; and you must tell me how you
                  escaped M'Carstrow on the morning of the disturbance," she enjoins. And while Bob
                  relates his story Franconia prepares his supper. Some cold ham, bread, and coffee,
                  are soon spread out before him. He will remove them to the chest, near the
                  fire-place. "Why, Missus Frankone," he says, "ye sees how I'se so old now dat
                  nobody tink I'se werf ownin; and so nobody axes old Bob whose nigger he is. An't
                  prime nigger, now; but den a' good fo' work some, and get cash, so t' help old
                  mas'r yander (Bob points to old master). Likes t' make old master feel not so
                  bad."
               "Yes," rejoins Marston, "Bob's good to me. He makes his sleeping apartments, when
                  he comes, at the foot of my bed, and shares his earnings with me every Saturday
                  night. He's like an old clock that can keep time as well as a new one, only wind
                  it up with care."
               "Dat I is!" says Daddy, with an exulting nod of the head, as he, to his own
                  surprise, lets fall his cup. It was only the negro's forgetfulness in the moment
                  of excitement. Giving a wistful look at Franconia, he commences picking up the
                  pieces, and drawing his week's earnings from a side pocket of his jacket.
               "Eat your supper, Daddy; never mind your money now" says Franconia, laughing
                  heartily: at which Bob regains confidence and resumes his supper, keeping a
                  watchful eye upon his old master the while. Every now and then he will pause, cant
                  his ear, and shake his head, as if drinking in the tenour of the conversation
                  between Franconia and her uncle. Having concluded, he pulls out his money and
                  spreads it upon the chest. "Old Bob work hard fo' dat!" he says, with emphasis,
                  spreading a five-dollar bill and two dollars and fifty cents in silver into
                  divisions. "Dah!" he ejaculates, "dat old mas'r share, and dis is dis child's."
                  The old man looks proudly upon the coin, and feels he is not so worthless, after
                  all. "Now! who say old Bob aint werf nofin?" he concludes, getting up, putting his
                  share into his pocket, and then, as if unobserved, slipping the balance into
                  Marston's. This done, he goes to the window, affects to be looking out, and then
                  resuming his seat upon the chest, commences humming a familiar plantation tune, as
                  if his pious feelings had been superseded by the recollection of past scenes.
               "What, Daddy,—singing songs?" interrupts Franconia, looking at him enquiringly. He
                  stops as suddenly as he commenced, exchanges an expressive look, and fain would
                  question her sincerity.
               "Didn't mean 'um, missus," he returns, after a moment's hesitation, "didn't mean
                  'um. Was thinkin 'bout somefin back'ards; down old plantation times."
               "You had better forget them times, Bob."
               "Buckra won't sell dis old nigger,—will he, Miss Frankone?" he enquires, resuming
                  his wonted simplicity.
               "Sell you, Bob? You're a funny old man. Don't think your old half-worn-out bones
                  are going to save you. Money's the word: they'll sell anything that will produce
                  it,—dried up of age are no exceptions. Keep out of Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy's
                  way: whenever you hear him singing, 'I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he
                  shall come,' as he always does,—run! He lives on the sale of infirmity, and your
                  old age would be a capital thing for the exercise of his genius. He will put you
                  through a course of regeneration, take the wrinkles smooth out of your face, dye
                  those old grey whiskers, and get a profit for his magic power of transposing the
                  age of negro property," she replied,
                  gravely, while Bob stares at her as if doubting his own security.
               "Why, missus!" he interposes, his face glowing with astonishment; "Buckra don't be
                  so smart dat he make old nigger young, be he?"
               "Traders can do anything with niggers that have got money in them, as they say.
                  Our distinguished people are sensitive of the crime, but excuse themselves with
                  apologies they cannot make cover the shame."
               "Franke!" interrupts Marston, "spare the negro's feelings,—it may have a bad
                  effect." He touches her on the arm, and knits his brows in caution.
               "How strange, to think that bad influence could come of such an inoffensive old
                  man! Truth, I know and feel, is powerfully painful when brought home to the doors
                  of our best people,—it cuts deep when told in broad letters; but they make the
                  matter worse by attempting to enshrine the stains with their chivalry. We are a
                  wondrous people, uncle, and the world is just finding it out, to our shame. We may
                  find it out ourselves, by and by; perhaps pay the penalty with sorrow. We look
                  upon negroes as if they were dropped down from some unaccountable origin,—intended
                  to raise the world's cotton, rice, and sugar, but never to get above the menial
                  sphere we have conditioned for them. Uncle, there is a mistake somewhere,—a
                  mistake sadly at variance with our democratic professions. Democracy needs to
                  reclaim its all-claiming principles of right and justice for the down-trodden. And
                  yet, while the negro generously submits to serve us, we look upon him as an
                  auspicious innovator, who never could have been born to enjoy manhood, and was
                  subjected to bear a black face because God had marked him for servitude. Did God
                  found an aristocracy of colour, or make men to be governed by their distinctive
                  qualifications of colour relationship?" says Franconia, her face resuming a flush
                  of agitation. Touching Marston on the arm with the fore-finger of her right hand,
                  and giving a glance at Bob, who listens attentively to the theme of conversation,
                  she continues: "Say no more of bad influence coming of slaves, when the corruptest
                  examples are set by those who hold them as such,—who crash their hopes, blot out
                  their mental faculties, and turn their bodies into licentious merchandise that
                  they may profit by its degradation! Show me the humblest slave on your plantation,
                  and, in comparison with the slave-dealer, I will prove him a nobleman of God's
                  kind,—of God's image: his simple nature will be his clean passport into heaven.
                  The Father of Mercy will receive him there; he will forgive the crimes enforced
                  upon him by man; and that dark body on earth will be recompensed in a world of
                  light,—it will shine with the brighter spirits of that realm of justice and love.
                  Earth may bring the slavetrader bounties; but heaven will reject the foul
                  offering." The good woman unfolds the tender emotions of her heart, as only woman
                  can.
               Bob listens, as if taking a deep interest in the force and earnestness of young
                  missus's language. He is swayed by her pathos, and at length interposes his
                  word.
               "Nigger ain't so good as white man" (he shakes his head, philosophically). "White
                  man sharp; puzzle nigger to find out what 'e don, know ven 'e mind
                  t'." Thus saying, he takes a small hymn-book from his pocket, and, Franconia
                  setting the light beside him, commences reading to himself by its dim glare.
               "Well! now, uncle, it's getting late, and I've a good way to go, and the night's
                  stormy; so I must prepare for home." Franconia gets up, and evinces signs of
                  withdrawing. She walks across the little chamber three or four times, looks out of
                  the window, strains her sight into the gloomy prospect, and then, as if reluctant
                  to leave her uncle, again takes a seat by his side. Gently laying her left hand
                  upon his shoulder, she makes an effort at pleasantry, tells him to keep up his
                  resolution—to be of good cheer.
               "Remember, uncle," she says, calmly, "they tell us it is no disgrace to be
                  poor,—no shame to work to live; and yet poor people are treated as criminals. For
                  my own part, I would rather be poor and happy than rich with a base husband; I
                  have lived in New England, know how to appreciate its domestic happiness. It was
                  there Puritanism founded true American liberty.—Puritanism yet lives, and may be
                  driven to action; but we must resign ourselves to the will of an all-wise
                  Providence." Thus concluding, she makes another attempt to withdraw.
               "You must not leave me yet!" says Marston, grasping her hand firmly in his. "Franke, I cannot part with
                  you until I have disclosed what I have been summoning resolution to suppress. I
                  know your attachment, Franconia; you have been more than dear to me. You have
                  known my feelings,—what they have already had to undergo." He pauses.
               "Speak it, uncle, speak it! Keep nothing from me, nor make secrets in fear of my
                  feelings. Speak out,—I may relieve you!" she interrupts, nervously: and again
                  encircling her arm round his neck, waits his reply, in breathless suspense.
               He falters for a moment, and then endeavours to regain his usual coolness.
                  "To-morrow, Franconia," he half mutters out, "to-morrow, you may find me not so
                  well situated," (here tears are seen trickling down his cheeks) "and in a place
                  where it will not become your delicate nature to visit me."
               "Nay, uncle!" she stops him there; "I will visit you wherever you may be—in a
                  castle or a prison."
               The word prison has touched the tender chord upon which all his troubles are
                  strung. He sobs audibly; but they are only sobs of regret, for which there is no
                  recompense in this late hour. "And would you follow me to a prison, Franconia?" he
                  enquires, throwing his arms about her neck, kissing her pure cheek with the
                  fondness of a father.
               "Yea, and share your sorrows within its cold walls. Do not yield to melancholy,
                  uncle,—you have friends left: if not, heaven will prepare a place of rest for you;
                  heaven shields the unfortunate at last," rejoins the good woman, the pearly tears
                  brightening in mutual sympathy.
               "To-morrow, my child, you will find me the unhappy tenant of those walls where
                  man's discomfiture is complete."
               "Nay, uncle, nay! you are only allowing your melancholy forebodings to get the
                  better of you. Such men as Graspum—men who have stripped families of their
                  all—might take away your property, and leave you as they have left my poor
                  parents; but no one would be so heartless as to drive you to the extreme of
                  imprisonment. It is a foolish result at best." Franconia's voice falters; she
                  looks more and more intently in her uncle's face, struggles to suppress her rising
                  emotions. She knows his frankness, she feels the pain of his position; but, though
                  the dreadful extreme seems scarcely possible, there is that in his face conveying
                  strong evidence of the truth of his remark.
               "Do not weep, Franconia; spare your tears for a more worthy object: such trials
                  have been borne by better men than I. I am but the merchandise of my creditors.
                  There is, however, one thing which haunts me to grief; could I have saved my
                  children, the pain of my position had been slight indeed."
               "Speak not of them, uncle," Franconia interrupts, "you cannot feel the bitterness
                  of their lot more than myself. I have saved a mother, but have failed to execute
                  my plan of saving them; and my heart throbs with pain when I think that now it is
                  beyond my power. Let me not attempt to again excite in your bosom feelings which
                  must ever be harassing, for the evil only can work its destruction. To clip the
                  poisoning branches and not uproot the succouring trunk, is like casting pearls
                  into the waste of time. My heart will ever be with the destinies of those
                  children, my feelings bound in unison with theirs; our hopes are the same, and if
                  fortune should smile on me in times to come I will keep my word—I will snatch them
                  from the devouring element of slavery."
               "Stop, my child!" speaks Marston, earnestly: "Remember you can do little against
                  the strong arm of the law, and still stronger arm of public opinion. Lay aside
                  your hopes of rescuing those children, Franconia, and remember that while I am in
                  prison I am the property of my creditors, subject to their falsely conceived
                  notions of my affairs," he continues. "I cannot now make amends to the law of
                  nature," he adds, burying his face in his hand, weeping a child's tears.
               Franconia looks solicitously upon her uncle, as he sorrows. She would dry her
                  tears to save his throbbing heart. Her noble generosity and disinterestedness have
                  carried her through many trials since her marriage, but it fails to nerve her
                  longer. Her's is a single-hearted sincerity, dispensing its goodness for the
                  benefit of the needy; she suppresses her own troubles that she may administer
                  consolation to others. "The affection that refuses to follow misfortune to its
                  lowest step is weak indeed. If you go
                  to prison, Franconia will follow you there," she says, with touching pathos, her
                  musical voice adding strength to the resolution. Blended with that soft angelic
                  expression her eyes give forth, her calm dignity and inspiring nobleness show how
                  firm is that principle of her nature never to abandon her old friend.
               The old negro, who had seemed absorbed in his sympathetic reflections, gazes
                  steadfastly at his old master, until his emotions spring forth in kindest
                  solicitude. Resistance is beyond his power. "Neber mind, old mas'r," (he speaks in
                  a devoted tone) "dar's better days comin, bof fo' old Bob and mas'r. Tink 'um sees
                  de day when de old plantation jus so 't was wid mas'r and da' old folks."
                  Concluding in a subdued voice, he approaches Franconia, and seats himself, book in
                  hand, on the floor at her feet. Moved by his earnestness, she lays her hand
                  playfully upon his head, saying: "Here is our truest friend, uncle!"
               "My own heart lubs Miss Frankone more den eber," he whispers in return. How pure,
                  how holy, is the simple recompense! It is nature's only offering, all the slave
                  can give; and he gives it in the bounty of his soul.
               Marston's grief having subsided, he attempts to soothe Franconia's feelings, by
                  affecting an air of indifference. "What need I care, after all? my resolution
                  should be above it," he says, thrusting his right hand into his breast pocket, and
                  drawing out a folded paper, which he throws upon the little table, and says,
                  "There, Franconia, my child! that contains the climax of my unlamented
                  misfortunes; read it: it will show you where my next abode will be—I may be at
                  peace there; and there is consolation at being at peace, even in a cell." He
                  passes the paper into her hand.
               With an expression of surprise she opens it, and glances over its contents; then
                  reads it word by word. "Do they expect to get something from nothing?" she says,
                  sarcastically. "It is one of those soothsayers so valuable to men whose feelings
                  are only with money—to men who forget they cannot carry money to the graves; and
                  that no tribute is demanded on either road leading to the last abode of man."
               "Stop there, my child! stop!" interrupts Marston. "I have given them all, 'tis
                  true; but suspicion is my persecutor—suspicion, and trying to be a father to my
                  own children!"
               "It is, indeed, a misfortune to be a father under such circumstances, in such an
                  atmosphere!" the good woman exclaims, clasping her hands and looking upward, as if
                  imploring the forgiveness of Heaven. Tremblingly she held the paper in her hand,
                  until it fell upon the floor, as she, overcome, swooned in her uncle's arms.
               She swooned! yes, she swooned. That friend upon whom her affections had been
                  concentrated was a prisoner. The paper was a bail writ, demanding the body of the
                  accused. The officer serving had been kind enough to allow Marston his parole of
                  honour until the next morning. He granted this in accordance with Marston's
                  request, that by the lenity he might see Daddy Bob and Franconia once more.
               Lifting Franconia in his arms, her hair falling loosely down, Marston lays her
                  gently on the cot, and commences bathing her temples. He has nothing but water to
                  bathe them with,—nothing but poverty's liquid. The old negro, frightened at the
                  sudden change that has come over his young missus, falls to rubbing and kissing
                  her hands,—he has no other aid to lend. Marston has drawn his chair beside her,
                  sits down upon it, unbuttons her stomacher, and continues bathing and chafing her
                  temples. How gently heaves that bosom so full of fondness, how marble-like those
                  features, how pallid but touchingly beautiful that face! Love, affection, and
                  tenderness, there repose so calmly! All that once gave out so much hope, so much
                  joy, now withers before the blighting sting of misfortune. "Poor child, how fondly
                  she loves me!" says Marston, placing his right arm under her head, and raising it
                  gently. The motion quickens her senses—she speaks; he kisses her pallid
                  cheek—kisses and kisses it. "Is it you uncle?" she whispers. She has opened her
                  eyes, stares at Marston, then wildly along the ceiling. "Yes, I'm in uncle's arms;
                  how good!" she continues, as if fatigued. Reclining back on the pillow, she again
                  rests her head upon his arm. "I am at the mansion—how pleasant; let me rest,
                  uncle; let me rest. Send aunt Rachel to me." She raises her right hand and lays
                  her arms about Marston's ston's neck,
                  as anxiously he leans over her. How dear are the associations of that old mansion!
                  how sweet the thought of home! how uppermost in her wandering mind the remembrance
                  of those happy days!
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               MARSTON IN PRISON.
               WHILE Franconia revives, let us beg the reader's indulgence for not recounting the
                  details thereof. The night continues dark and stormy, but she must return to her
                  own home,—she must soothe the excited feelings of a dissolute and disregarding
                  husband, who, no doubt, is enjoying his night orgies, while she is administering
                  consolation to the downcast. "Ah! uncle," she says, about to take leave of him for
                  the night, "how with spirit the force of hope fortifies us; and yet how seldom are
                  our expectations realised through what we look forward to! You now see the value
                  of virtue; but when seen through necessity, how vain the repentance. Nevertheless,
                  let us profit by the lesson before us; let us hope the issue may yet be
                  favourable!" Bob will see his young missus safe home—he will be her guide and
                  protector. So, preparing his cap, he buttons his jacket, laughs and grins with
                  joy, goes to the door, then to the fire-place, and to the door again, where,
                  keeping his left hand on the latch, and his right holding the casement, he bows
                  and scrapes, for "Missus comin." Franconia arranges her dress as best she can,
                  adjusts her bonnet, embraces Marston, imprints a fond kiss on his cheek,
                  reluctantly relinquishes his hand, whispers a last word of consolation, and bids
                  him good night,—a gentle good night—in sorrow.
               She has gone, and the old slave is her guide, her human watch-dog. Slowly Marston
                  paces the silent chamber alone, giving vent to his pent-up emotions. What may
                  to-morrow bring forth? runs through his wearied mind. It is but the sudden
                  downfall of life, so inseparable from the planter who rests his hopes on the
                  abundance of his human property. But the slave returns, and relieves him of his
                  musings. He has seen his young missus safe to her door; he has received her kind
                  word, and her good, good night! Entering the chamber with a smile, he sets about
                  clearing away the little things, and, when done, draws his seat close to Marston,
                     at the fire-place. As if quite at
                  home beside his old master, he eyes Marston intently for some time,—seems studying
                  his thoughts and fears. At length the old slave commences disclosing his feelings.
                  His well-worn bones are not worth a large sum; nor are the merits of his worthy
                  age saleable;—no! there is nothing left but his feelings, those genuine virtues so
                  happily illustrated. Daddy Bob will stand by mas'r, as he expresses it, in power
                  or in prison. Kindness has excited all that vanity in Bob so peculiar to the
                  negro, and by which he prides himself in the prime value of his person. There he
                  sits—Marston's faithful friend, contemplating his silence with a steady gaze, and
                  then, giving his jet-black face a double degree of seriousness, shrugs his
                  shoulders, significantly nods his head, and intimates that it will soon be time to
                  retire, by commencing to unboot master.
               "You seem in a hurry to get rid of me, Daddy! Want to get your own cranium into a
                  pine-knot sleep, eh?" says Marston, with an encouraging smile, pulling the old
                  slave's whiskers in a playful manner.
               "No, Boss; 'tant dat," returns Bob, keeping on tugging at Marston's boots until he
                  has got them from his feet, and safely stowed away in a corner. A gentle hint that
                  he is all ready to relieve Marston of his upper garments brings him to his feet,
                  when Bob commences upon him in right good earnest, and soon has him stowed away
                  between the sheets. "Bob neber likes to hurry old Boss, but den 'e kno' what's on
                  old Mas'r's feelins, an 'e kno' dat sleep make 'um forget 'um!" rejoins Bob, in a
                  half whisper that caught Marston's ear, as he patted and fussed about his pillow,
                  in order to make him as comfortable as circumstances would admit. After this he
                  extinguishes the light, and, accustomed to a slave's bed, lumbers himself down on
                  the floor beside his master's cot. Thus, watchfully, he spends the night.
               When morning dawned, Bob was in the full enjoyment of what the negro so
                  pertinently calls a long and strong sleep. He cannot resist its soothing powers,
                  nor will master disturb him in its enjoyment. Before breakfast-time arrives,
                  however, he arouses with a loud guffaw, looks round the room vacantly, as if he
                  were doubting the presence of things about him. Rising to his knees, he rubs his
                  eyes languidly, yawns, and stretches his arms, scratches his head, and suddenly
                  gets a glimpse of old master, who is already dressed, and sits by the window, his
                  attention intently set upon some object without. The old slave recognises the same
                  chamber from which he guided Franconia on the night before, and, after saluting
                  mas'r, sets about arranging the domestic affairs of the apartment, and preparing
                  the breakfast table, the breakfast being cooked at Aunt Beckie's cabin, in the
                  yard. Aunt Beckie had the distinguished satisfaction of knowing Marston in his
                  better days, and now esteems it an honour to serve him, even in his poverty.
                  Always happy to inform her friends that she was brought up a first-rate
                  pastry-cook, she now adds, with great satisfaction, that she pays her owner, the
                  very Reverend Mr. Thomas Tippletony, the ever-pious rector of St. Michael's, no
                  end of money for her time, and makes a good profit at her business beside.
                  Notwithstanding she has a large family of bright children to maintain in a
                  respectable way, she hopes for a continuance of their patronage, and will give the
                  best terms her limited means admit. She knows how very necessary it is for a
                  southern gentleman who would be anybody to keep up appearances, and, with little
                  means, to make a great display: hence she is very easy in matters of payment. In
                  Marston's case, she is extremely proud to render him service,—to "do for him" as
                  far as she can, and wait a change for the better concerning any balance
                  outstanding.
               Bob fetches the breakfast of coffee, fritters, homony, and bacon,—a very good
                  breakfast it is, considering the circumstances,—and spreads the little rustic
                  board with an air of comfort and neatness complimentary to the old slave's taste.
                  And, withal, the old man cannot forego the inherent vanity of his nature, for he
                  is, unconsciously, performing all the ceremonies of attendance he has seen Dandy
                  and his satellites go through at the plantation mansion. He fusses and grins, and
                  praises and laughs, as he sets the dishes down one by one, keeping a watchful eye
                  on mas'r, as if to detect an approval in his countenance. "Reckon 'ow dis old
                  nigger can fix old Boss up aristocratic breakfast like Dandy. Now, Boss—da'h he
                  is!" he says, whisking round the table, setting the cups just so, and spreading
                  himself with exultation. "Want to see master smile—laugh some—like 'e used down on
                  da'h old plantation!" he ejaculates, emphatically, placing a chair at Marston's
                  plate. This done, he accompanies his best bow with a scrape of his right foot,
                  spreads his hands,—the gesture being
                  the signal of readiness. Marston takes his chair, as Bob affects the compound
                  dignity of the very best trained nigger, doing the distinguished in waiting.
               "A little less ceremony, my old faithful! the small follies of etiquette ill
                  become such a place as this. We must succumb to circumstances: come, sit down,
                  Bob; draw your bench to the chest, and there eat your share, while I wait on
                  myself," says Marston, touching Bob on the arm. The words were no sooner uttered,
                  than Bob's countenance changed from the playful to the serious; he could see
                  nothing but dignity in master, no matter in what sphere he might be placed. His
                  simple nature recoils at the idea of dispensing with the attention due from slave
                  to master. Master's fallen fortunes, and the cheerless character of the chamber,
                  are nothing to Daddy—master must keep up his dignity.
               "You need'nt look so serious, Daddy; it only gives an extra shade to your face,
                  already black enough for any immediate purpose!" says Marston, turning round and
                  smiling at the old slave's discomfiture. To make amends, master takes a plate from
                  the table, and gives Bob a share of his homony and bacon. This is very pleasing to
                  the old slave, who regains his wonted earnestness, takes the plate politely from
                  his master's hand, retires with it to the chest, and keeps up a regular fire of
                  chit-chat while dispensing its contents. In this humble apartment, master and
                  slave—the former once opulent, and the latter still warm with attachment for his
                  friend—are happily companioned. They finish their breakfast,—a long pause
                  intervenes. "I would I were beyond the bounds of this our south,"
                  says Marston, breaking the silence, as he draws his chair and seats himself by the
                  window, where he can look out upon the dingy little houses in the lane.
               The unhappy man feels the burden of a misspent life; he cannot recall the past,
                  nor make amends for its errors. But, withal, it is some relief that he can
                  disclose his feelings to the old man, his slave.
               "Mas'r," interrupts the old slave, looking complacently in his face, "Bob 'll
                  fowler ye, and be de same old friend. I will walk behind Miss Frankone." His
                  simple nature seems warming into fervency.
               "Ah! old man," returns Marston, "if there be a wish (you may go before me, though)
                  I have on earth, it is that when I die our graves may be side by side, with an
                  epitaph to denote master, friend, and faithful servant lie here." He takes the old
                  man by the hand again, as the tears drop from his cheeks. "A prison is but a grave
                  to the man of honourable feelings," he concludes. Thus disclosing his feelings, a
                  rap at the door announces a messenger. It is nine o'clock, and immediately the
                  sheriff, a gentlemanly-looking man, wearing the insignia of office on his hat,
                  walks in, and politely intimates that, painful as may be the duty, he must request
                  his company to the county gaol, that place so accommodatingly prepared for the
                  reception of unfortunates.
               "Sorry for your misfortunes, sir! but we'll try to make you as comfortable as we
                  can in our place." The servitor of the law seems to have some sympathy in him. "I
                  have my duty to perform, you know, sir; nevertheless, I have my opinion about
                  imprisoning honest men for debt: it's a poor satisfaction, sir. I'm only an
                  officer, you see, sir, not a law-maker—never want to be, sir. I very much dislike
                  to execute these kind of writs," says the man of the law, as, with an expression
                  of commiseration, he glances round the room, and then at Daddy, who has made
                  preparations for a sudden dodge, should such an expedient be found necessary.
               "Nay, sheriff, think nothing of it; it's but a thing of common life,—it may befall
                  us all. I can be no exception to the rule, and may console myself with the
                  knowledge of companionship," replies Marston, as coolly as if he were preparing
                  for a journey of pleasure.
               How true it is, that, concealed beneath the smallest things, there is a
                  consolation which necessity may bring out: how Providence has suited it to our
                  misfortunes!
               "There are a few things here—a very few—I should like to take to my cell; perhaps
                  I can send for them," he remarks, looking at the officer, enquiringly.
               "My name is Martin—Captain Martin, they call me,"—returns that functionary,
                  politely. "If you accept my word of honour, I pledge it they are taken care of,
                  and sent to your apartments."
               "You mean my new lodging-house, or my new grave, I suppose," interrupted Marston,
                  jocosely, pointing out to Daddy the few articles of bedding, chairs, and a
                  window-curtain he desired removed. Daddy has been pensively standing by the fire-place the while, contemplating
                  the scene.
               Marston soon announces his readiness to proceed; and, followed by the old slave,
                  the officer leads the way down the ricketty old stairs to the street. "I's gwine
                  t'see whar dey takes old mas'r, any how, reckon I is," says the old slave, giving
                  his head a significant turn.
               "Now, sir," interrupts the officer, as they arrive at the bottom of the stairs,
                  "perhaps you have a delicacy about going through the street with a sheriff; many
                  men have: therefore I shall confide in your honour, sir, and shall give you the
                  privilege of proceeding to the gaol as best suits your feelings. I never allow
                  myself to follow the will of creditors; if I did, my duties would be turned into a
                  system of tyranny, to gratify their feelings only. Now, you may take a carriage,
                  or walk; only meet me at the prison gate."
               "Thanks, thanks!" returns Marston, grateful for the officer's kindness, "my crime
                  is generosity; you need not fear me. My old faithful here will guide me along."
                  The officer bows assent, and with a respectful wave of the hand they separate to
                  pursue different routes.
               Marston walks slowly along, Bob keeping pace close behind. He passes many of his
                  old acquaintances, who, in better times, would have recognised him with a cordial
                  embrace; at present they have scarcely a nod to spare. Marston, however, is firm
                  in his resolution, looks not on one side nor the other, and reaches the
                  prison-gate in good time. The officer has reached it in advance, and waits him
                  there. They pause a few moments as Marston scans the frowning wall that encloses
                  the gloomy-looking old prison. "I am ready to go in," says Marston; and just as
                  they are about to enter the arched gate, the old slave touches him on the arm, and
                  says, "Mas'r, dat's no place fo'h Bob. Can't stand seein' on ye locked up wid sich
                  folks as in dah!" Solicitously he looks in his master's face. The man of trouble
                  grasps firmly the old slave's hand, holds it in silence for some minutes—the
                  officer, moved by the touching scene, turns his head away—as tears course down his
                  cheeks. He has no words to speak the emotions of his heart; he shakes the old
                  man's hand affectionately, attempts to whisper a word in his ear, but is too
                  deeply affected.
               "Good by, mas'r: may God bless 'um! Ther's a place fo'h old mas'r yet. I'll com t'
                  see mas'r every night," says the old man, his words flowing from the bounty of his
                  heart. He turns away reluctantly, draws his hand from Marston's, heaves a sigh,
                  and repairs to his labour. How precious was that labour of love, wherein the old
                  slave toils that he may share the proceeds with his master!
               As Marston and the sheriff disappear through the gate, and are about to ascend the
                  large stone steps leading to the portal in which is situated the inner iron gate
                  opening into the debtors' ward, the sheriff made a halt, and, placing his arm in a
                  friendly manner through Marston's, enquires, "Anything I can do for you? If there
                  is, just name it. Pardon my remark, sir, but you will, in all probability, take
                  the benefit of the act; and, as no person seems willing to sign your bail, I may
                  do something to relieve your wants, in my humble way." Marston shakes his head;
                  the kindness impedes an expression of his feelings. "A word of advice from me,
                  however, may not be without its effect, and I will give it you; it is this:—Your
                  earnestness to save those two children, and the singular manner in which those
                  slave drudges of Graspum produced the documentary testimony showing them property,
                  has created wondrous suspicion about your affairs. I will here say, Graspum's no
                  friend of yours; in fact, he's a friend to nobody but himself; and even now, when
                  questioned on the manner of possessing all your real estate, he gives out
                  insinuations, which, instead of exonerating you, create a still worse impression
                  against you. His conversation on the matter leaves the inference with your
                  creditors that you have still more property secreted. Hence, mark me! it behoves
                  you to keep close lips. Don't let your right hand know what your left does,"
                  continues the officer, in a tone of friendliness. They ascend to the iron gate,
                  look through the grating. The officer, giving a whistle, rings the bell by
                  touching a spring in the right-hand wall. "My lot at last!" exclaims Marston. "How
                  many poor unfortunates have passed this threshold—how many times the emotions of
                  the heart have burst forth on this spot—how many have here found a gloomy rest
                  from their importuners—how many have here whiled away precious time in a gloomy
                  cell, provided for the punishment of poverty!" The disowned man, for such he is,,
                  struggles to retain his resolution; fain would he, knowing the price of that resolution, repress
                  those sensations threatening to overwhelm him.
               The brusque gaoler appears at the iron gate; stands his burly figure in the
                  portal; nods recognition to the officer; swings back the iron frame, as a number
                  of motley prisoners gather into a semicircle in the passage. "Go back, prisoners;
                  don't stare so at every new comer," says the gaoler, clearing the way with his
                  hands extended.
               One or two of the locked-up recognise Marston. They lisp strange remarks, drawn
                  forth by his appearance in charge of an officer. "Big as well as little fish bring
                  up here," ejaculates one.
               "Where are his worshippers and his hospitable friends?" whispers another.
               "There's not much hospitality for poverty," rejoins a third, mutteringly.
                  "Southern hospitality is unsound, shallow, and flimsy; a little dazzling of
                  observances to cover very bad facts. You are sure to find a people who maintain
                  the grossest errors in their political system laying the greatest claims to
                  benevolence and principle—things to which they never had a right. The phantom of
                  hospitality draws the curtain over many a vice—it is a well-told nothingness
                  ornamenting the beggared system of your slavery; that's my honest opinion," says a
                  third, in a gruff voice, which indicates that he has no very choice opinion of
                  such generosity. "If they want a specimen of true hospitality, they must go to New
                  England; there the poor man's offering stocks the garden of liberty, happiness,
                  and justice; and from them spring the living good of all," he concludes; and
                  folding his arms with an air of independence, walks up the long passage running at
                  right angles with the entrance portal, and disappears in a cell on the left.
               "I knew him when he was great on the turf. He was very distinguished then." "He'll
                  be extinguished here," insinuates another, as he protrudes his eager face over the
                  shoulders of those who are again crowding round the office-door, Marston and the
                  officer having entered following the gaoler.
               The sheriff passes the committimus to the man of keys; that functionary takes his
                  seat at a small desk, while Marston stands by its side, watching the process of
                  his prison reception, in silence. The gaoler reads the commitment, draws a book
                  deliberately from off a side window, spreads it open on his desk, and commences
                  humming an air. "Pootty smart sums, eh!" he says, looking up at the sheriff, as he
                  holds a quill in his left hand, and feels with the fingers of his right for a
                  knife, which, he observes, he always keeps in his right vest pocket. "We have a
                  poor debtor's calendar for registering these things. I do these things different
                  from other gaolers, and it loses me nothin'. I goes on the true principle, that
                  'tant right to put criminals and debtors together; and if the state hasn't made
                  provision for keeping them in different cells, I makes a difference on the books,
                  and that's somethin'. Helps the feelins over the smarting point," says the
                  benevolent keeper of all such troublesome persons as won't pay their debts;—as if
                  the monstrous concentration of his amiability, in keeping separate books for the
                  criminal and poverty-stricken gentlemen of his establishment, must be duly
                  appreciated. Marston, particularly, is requested to take the initiative, he being
                  the most aristocratic fish the gaoler has caught in a long time. But the man has
                  made his pen, and now he registers Marston's name among the state's forlorn
                  gentlemen, commonly called poor debtors. They always confess themselves in
                  dependent circumstances. Endorsing the commitment, he returns it to the sheriff,
                  who will keep the original carefully filed away in his own well-stocked
                  department. The sheriff will bid his prisoner good morning! having reminded the
                  gaoler what good care it was desirable to take of his guest; and, extending his
                  hand and shaking that of Marston warmly, takes his departure, whilst our gaoler
                  leads Marston into an almost empty cell, where he hopes he will find things
                  comfortable, and leaves him to contemplate upon the fallen fruit of poverty. "Come
                  to this, at last!" said Marston, entering the cavern-like place.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               VENDERS OF HUMAN PROPERTY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS MENTAL
                  CAPRICES.
               READER! be patient with us, for our task is complex and tedious. We have but one
                  great object in view—that of showing a large number of persons in the south, now
                  held as slaves, who are by the laws of the land, as well as the laws of nature,
                  entitled to their freedom. These people, for whom, in the name of justice and
                  every offspring of human right, we plead, were consigned to the bondage they now
                  endure through the unrighteous act of one whose name (instead of being execrated
                  by a nation jealous of its honour), a singular species of southern historian has
                  attempted to enshrine with fame. Posterity, ignorant of his character, will find
                  his name clothed with a paragon's armour, while respecting the writer who so
                  cleverly with a pen obliterated his crimes. We have only feelings of pity for the
                  historian who discards truth thus to pollute paper with his kindness; such debts
                  due to friendship are badly paid at the shrine of falsehood. No such debts do we
                  owe; we shall perform our duty fearlessly, avoiding dramatic effect, or aught else
                  that may tend to improperly excite the feelings of the benevolent. No one better
                  knows the defects of our social system—no one feels more forcibly that much to be
                  lamented fact of there being no human law extant not liable to be evaded or
                  weakened by the intrigues of designing men;—we know of no power reposed in man the
                  administration of which is not susceptible of abuse, or being turned to means of
                  oppression: how much more exposed, then, must all these functions be where slavery
                  in its popular sway rides triumphant over the common law of the land. Divine laws
                  are with impunity disregarded and abused by anointed teachers of divinity.
                  Peculation, in sumptuous garb, and with modern appliances, finds itself
                  modestly—perhaps unconsciously—gathering dross at the sacred altar. How saint-like
                  in semblance, and how unconscious of wrong, are ye bishops (holy ones, scarce of
                  earth, in holy lawn) in that land of freedom where the slave's chains fall ere his
                  foot pads its soil! how calmly resigned the freemen who yield to the necessity of
                  making strong the altar with the sword of state! How, in the fulness of an
                  expansive soul, these little ones, in lawn so white, spurn the unsanctified
                  spoiler—themselves neck-deep in the very coffers of covetousness the while! How to
                  their christian spirit it seems ordained they should see a people's ekeings serve
                  their rolling in wealth and luxury! and, yet, let no man question their walking in
                  the ways of a meek and lowly Saviour—that Redeemer of mankind whose seamless garb
                  no man purchaseth with the rights of his fellow. Complacently innocent of
                  themselves, they would have us join their flock and follow them,—their pious eyes
                  seeing only heavenly objects to be gained, and their pure hearts beating in heavy
                  throbs for the wicked turmoil of our common world. Pardon us, brother of the
                  flesh, say they, in saintly whispers,—it is all for the Church and Christ. Boldly
                  fortified with sanctimony, they hurl back the shafts of reform, and ask to live on
                  sumptuously, as the only sought recompense for their christian love. Pious
                  infallibility! how blind, to see not the crime!
               Reader! excuse the diversion, and accompany us while we retrace our steps to where
                  we left the loquacious Mr. M'Fadden, recovered from the fear of death, which had
                  been produced by whiskey in draughts too strong. In company with a numerous party,
                  he is just returning from an unsuccessful search for his lost preacher. They have
                  scoured the lawns, delved the morasses, penetrated thick jungles of brakes, driven
                  the cypress swamps, and sent the hounds through places seemingly impossible for
                  human being to seclude himself, and where only the veteran rattlesnake would seek
                  to lay his viperous head. No preacher have they found. They utter vile
                  imprecations on his head, pit him "a common nigger," declare he has just learned
                  enough, in his own crooked way, to be dubious property—good, if a man can keep him
                  at minister business.
               Mine host of the Inn feels assured, if he be hiding among the swamp jungle, the
                  snakes and alligators will certainly drive him out: an indisputable fact this,
                  inasmuch as alligators and snakes hate niggers. M'Fadden affirms solemnly, that the day he bought that clergyman was
                  one of the unlucky days of his life; and he positively regrets ever having been a
                  politician, or troubling his head about the southern-rights question. The party
                  gather round the front stoop, and are what is termed in southern parlance
                  "tuckered out." They are equally well satisfied of having done their duty to the
                  state and a good cause. Dogs, their tails drooping, sneak to their kennels, horses
                  reek with foam, the human dogs will "liquor" long and strong.
               "Tisn't such prime stock, after all!" says M'Fadden, entering the veranda, reeking
                  with mud and perspiration: "after a third attempt we had as well give it up." He
                  shakes his head, and then strikes his whip on the floor. "I'll stand shy about
                  buying a preacher, another time," he continues; like a man, much against his will,
                  forced to give up a prize.
               The crackers and wire-grass men (rude sons of the sand hills), take the matter
                  more philosophically,—probably under the impression that to keep quiet will be to
                  "bring the nigger out" where he may be caught and the reward secured. Two hundred
                  dollars is a sum for which they would not scruple to sacrifice life; but they have
                  three gods—whiskey, ignorance, and idleness, any one of which can easily gain a
                  mastery over their faculties.
               Mr. M'Fadden requests that his friends will all come into the bar-room—all jolly
                  fellows; which, when done, he orders mine host to supply as much "good strong
                  stuff" as will warm up their spirits. He, however, will first take a glass
                  himself, that he may drink all their very good healths. This compliment paid, he
                  finds himself pacing up and down, and across the room, now and then casting
                  suspicious glances at the notice of reward, as if questioning the policy of
                  offering so large an amount. But sundown is close upon them, and as the bar-room
                  begins to fill up again, each new-comer anxiously enquires the result of the last
                  search,—which only serves to increase the disappointed gentleman's excitement. The
                  affair has been unnecessarily expensive, for, in addition to the loss of his
                  preacher, the price of whom is no very inconsiderable sum, he finds a vexatious
                  bill running up against him at the bar. The friendship of those who have
                  sympathised with him, and have joined him in the exhilarating sport of
                  man-hunting, must be repaid with swimming drinks. Somewhat celebrated for economy,
                  his friends are surprised to find him, on this occasion, rather inclined to extend
                  the latitude of his liberality. His keen eye, however, soon detects, to his sudden
                  surprise, that the hunters are not alone enjoying his liberality, but that every
                  new comer, finding the drinks provided at M'Fadden's expense, has no objection to
                  join in drinking his health; to which he would have no sort of an objection, but
                  for the cost. Like all men suffering from the effect of sudden loss, he begins to
                  consider the means of economising by which he may repay the loss of the preacher.
                  "I say, Squire!" he ejaculates, suddenly stopping short in one of his walks, and
                  beckoning mine host aside, "That won't do, it won't! It's a coming too tough, I
                  tell you!" he says, shaking his head, and touching mine host significantly on the
                  arm. "A fellow what's lost his property in this shape don't feel like drinkin
                  everybody on whiskey what costs as much as your 'bright eye.' You see, every
                  feller what's comin in's 'takin' at my expense, and claiming friendship on the
                  strength on't. It don't pay, Squire! just stop it, won't ye?"
               Mine host immediately directs the bar-keeper, with a sign and a whisper:—"No more
                  drinks at M'Fadden's score, 'cept to two or three o' the most harristocratic." He
                  must not announce the discontinuance openly; it will insult the feelings of the
                  friendly people, many of whom anticipate a feast of drinks commensurate with their
                  services and Mr. Lawrence M'Fadden's distinguished position in political life.
                  Were they, the magnanimous people, informed of this sudden shutting off of their
                  supplies, the man who had just enjoyed their flattering encomiums would suddenly
                  find himself plentifully showered with epithets a tyrant slave-dealer could
                  scarcely endure.
               Calling mine host into a little room opening from the bar, he takes him by the
                  arm,—intimates his desire to have a consultation on the state of his affairs, and
                  the probable whereabouts of his divine:—"You see, this is all the thanks I get for
                  my kindness (he spreads his hands and shrugs his shoulders.) A northern man may do
                  what he pleases for southern rights, and it's just the same; he never gets any
                  thanks for it. These sort o' fellers isn't to be sneered at when a body wants to
                  carry a political end," he adds,
                  touching mine host modestly on the shoulder, and giving him a quizzing look, "but
                  ye can't make 'um behave mannerly towards respectable people, such as you and me
                  is. But 'twould'nt do to give 'um edukation, for they'd just spile society—they
                  would! Ain't my ideas logical, now, squire?" Mr. M'Fadden's mind seems soaring
                  away among the generalities of state.
               "Well!" returns mine host, prefacing the importance of his opinion with an
                  imprecation, "I'm fixed a'tween two fires; so I can't say what would be square
                  policy in affairs of state. One has feelins different on these things: I depends a
                  deal on what our big folks say in the way of setting examples. And, too, what can
                  you expect when this sort a ruff-scuff forms the means of raising their political
                  positions; but, they are customers of mine,—have made my success in
                  tavern-keeping!" he concludes, in an earnest whisper.
               "Now, squire!" M'Fadden places his hand in mine host's arm, and looks at him
                  seriously: "What 'bout that ar nigger preacher gittin off so? No way t' find it
                  out, eh squire?" M'Fadden enquires, with great seriousness.
               "Can't tell how on earth the critter did the thing; looked like peaceable property
                  when he went to be locked up, did!"
               "I think somebody's responsible for him, squire?" interrupts M'Fadden, watching
                  the changes of the other's countenance: "seems how I heard ye say ye'd take the
                  risk—"
               "No,—no,—no!" rejoins the other, quickly; "that never will do. I never receipt for
                  nigger property, never hold myself responsible to the customers, and never run any
                  risks about their niggers. You forget, my friend, that whatever shadow of a claim
                  you had on me by law was invalidated by your own act."
               "My own act?" interrupts the disappointed man. "How by my own act? explain
                  yourself!" suddenly allowing his feelings to become excited.
               "Sending for him to come to your bedside and pray for you. It was when you thought
                  Mr. Jones, the gentleman with the horns, stood over you with a warrant in his
                  hand," mine host whispers in his ear, shrugging his shoulders, and giving his face
                  a quizzical expression. "You appreciated the mental of the property then; but now
                  you view it as a decided defect."
               The disappointed gentleman remains silent for a few moments. He is deeply
                  impressed with the anomaly of his case, but has not the slightest objection to
                  fasten the responsibility on somebody, never for a moment supposing the law would
                  interpose against the exercise of his very best inclinations. He hopes God will
                  bless him, says it is always his luck; yet he cannot relinquish the idea of
                  somebody being responsible. He will know more about the preaching rascal's
                  departure. Turning to mine host of the inn: "But, you must have a clue to him,
                  somewhere?" he says, enquiringly.
               "There's my woman; can see if she knows anything about the nigger!" returns mine
                  host, complacently. Ellen Juvarna is brought into the presence of the injured man,
                  who interrogates her with great care; but all her disclosures only tend to throw a
                  greater degree of mystery over the whole affair. At this, Mr. M'Fadden declares
                  that the policy he has always maintained with reference to education is proved
                  true with the preacher's running away. Nigger property should never be perverted
                  by learning; though, if you could separate the nigger from the preaching part of
                  the property, it might do some good, for preaching was at times a good article to
                  distribute among certain slaves "what had keen instincts." At times, nevertheless,
                  it would make them run away. Ellen knew Harry as a good slave, a good man, a good
                  Christian, sound in his probity, not at all inclined to be roguish,—as most
                  niggers are—a little given to drink, but never bad-tempered. Her honest opinion is
                  that such a pattern of worthy nature and moral firmness would not disgrace itself
                  by running away, unless induced by white "Buckra." She thinks she heard a
                  lumbering and shuffling somewhere about the pen, shortly after midnight. It might
                  have been wolves, however. To all this Mr. M'Fadden listens with marked attention.
                  Now and then he interposes a word, to gratify some new idea swelling his brain.
                  There is nothing satisfactory yet: he turns the matter over and over in his mind,
                  looks Ellen steadfastly in the face, and watches the movement of every muscle.
                  "Ah!" he sighs, "nothing new developing." He dismissed the wench, and turns to
                  mine host of the inn. "Now, squire, (one minute mine host is squire, and the next
                  Mr. Jones) tell ye what 'tis; thar's roguery goin on somewhere among them ar'
                  fellers—them sharpers in the city, I means! (he shakes his head knowingly, and buttons his light
                  sack-coat round him). That's a good gal, isn't she?" he enquires, drawing his
                  chair somewhat closer, his hard face assuming great seriousness.
               Mine host gives an affirmative nod, and says, "Nothin shorter! Can take her word
                  on a turn of life or death. Tip top gal, that! Paid a price for her what u'd make
                  ye wink, I reckon."
               "That's just what I wanted to know," he interrupts, suddenly grasping the hand of
                  his friend. "Ye see how I'se a little of a philosopher, a tall politician, and a
                  major in the brigade down our district,—I didn't get my law akermin for nothin;
                  and now I jist discovers how somebody—I mean some white somebody—has had a hand in
                  helpin that ar' nig' preacher to run off. Cus'd critters! never know nothing till
                  some white nigger fills their heads with roguery."
               "Say, my worthy M'Fadden," interrupts the publican, rising suddenly from his seat,
                  as if some new discovery had just broke forth in his mind, "war'nt that boy sold
                  under a warrant?"
               "Warranted—warranted—warranted sound in every particular? That he was. Just think
                  of this, squire; you're a knowin one. It takes you! I never thought on't afore,
                  and have had all my nervousness for nothin. Warranted sound in every particular,
                  means—"
               "A moment!" mine host interposes, suddenly: "there's a keen point of law there;
                  but it might be twisted to some account, if a body only had the right sort of a
                  lawyer to twist it."
               The perplexed man rejoins by hoping he may not be interrupted just at this moment.
                  He is just getting the point of it straight in his mind. "You see," he says, "the
                  thing begun to dissolve itself in my philosophy, and by that I discovered the pint
                  the whole thing stands on. Its entirely metaphysical, though," he says, with a
                  significant shake of the head. He laughs at his discovery; his father, long since,
                  told him he was exceedingly clever. Quite a match for the publican in all matters
                  requiring a comprehensive mind, he declares there are few lawyers his equal at
                  penetrating into points. "He warranted him in every particular," he mutters, as
                  mine host, watching his seriousness, endeavours to suppress a smile. M'Fadden
                  makes a most learned motion of the fore finger of the right hand, which he presses
                  firmly into the palm of his left, while contracting his brows. He will soon essay
                  forth the point of logic he wishes to enforce. The property being a certain man
                  endowed with preaching propensities, soundness means the qualities of the man,
                  mental as well as physical; and running away being an unsound quality, the
                  auctioneer is responsible for all such contingencies. "I have him there,—I have!"
                  he holds up his hands exultingly, as he exclaims the words; his face brightens
                  with animation. Thrusting his hands into his trowsers pockets he paces the room
                  for several minutes, at a rapid pace, as if his mind had been relieved of some
                  deep study. "I will go directly into the city, and there see what I can do with
                  the chap I bought that feller of. I think when I put the law points to him, he'll
                  shell out."
               Making some preliminary arrangements with Jones of the tavern, he orders a horse
                  to the door immediately, and in a few minutes more is hastening on his way to the
                  city.
               Arriving about noon-day, he makes his way through its busy thoroughfares, and is
                  soon in the presence of the auctioneer. There, in wondrous dignity, sits the
                  seller of bodies and souls, his cushioned arm-chair presenting an air of opulence.
                  How coolly that pomp of his profession sits on the hard mask of his iron features,
                  beneath which lurks a contempt of shame! He is an important item in the political
                  hemisphere of the state, has an honourable position in society (for he is high
                  above the minion traders), joined the Episcopal church not many months ago, and
                  cautions Mr. M'Fadden against the immorality of using profane language, which that
                  aggrieved individual allows to escape his lips ere he enters the door.
               The office of our man of fame and fortune is thirty feet long by twenty wide, and
                  sixteen high. Its walls are brilliantly papered, and painted with landscape
                  designs; and from the centre of the ceiling hangs a large chandelier, with
                  ground-glass globes, on which eagles of liberty are inscribed. Fine black-walnut
                  desks, in chaste carving, stand along its sides, at which genteelly-dressed clerks
                  are exhibiting great attention to business. An oil-cloth, with large flowers
                  painted on its surface, spreads the floor, while an air of neatness reigns
                  throughout the establishment singularly at variance with the outer mart, where Mr.
                  Forshou sells his men, women, and
                  little children. But its walls are hung with badly-executed engravings, in frames
                  of gilt. Of the distinguished vender's taste a correct estimation may be drawn
                  when we inform the reader that many of these engravings represented nude females
                  and celebrated racehorses.
               "Excuse me, sir! I didn't mean it," Mr. M'Fadden says, in reply to the gentleman's
                  caution, approaching him as he sits in his elegant chair, a few feet from the
                  street door, luxuriantly enjoying a choice regalia. "It's the little point of a
                  very nasty habit that hangs upon me yet. I does let out the swear once in a while,
                  ye see; but it's only when I gets a crook in my mind what won't come straight."
                  Thus M'Fadden introduces himself, surprised to find the few very consistent oaths
                  he has made use of not compatible with the man-seller's pious business habits. He
                  will be cautious the next time; he will not permit such foul breath to escape and
                  wound the gentleman's very tender feelings.
               Mr. Lawrence M'Fadden addresses him as squire, and with studious words informs him
                  of the nigger preacher property he sold him having actually run away! "Ye
                  warranted him, ye know, squire!" he says, discovering the object of his visit,
                  then drawing a chair, and seating himself in close proximity.
               "Can't help that—quality we never warrant!" coolly returns the other, turning
                  politely in his arm-chair, which works in a socket, and directing a clerk at one
                  of the desks to add six months' interest to the item of three
                  wenches sold at ten o'clock.
               "Don't talk that ar way, squire! I trades a deal in your line, and a heap o'
                  times, with you. Now we'll talk over the legal points."
               "Make them short, if you please!"
               "Well! ye warranted the nigger in every particular. There's the advertisement; and
                  there's no getting over that! Ye must do the clean thing—no possumin—squire, or
                  there 'll be a long lawsuit what takes the tin. Honour's the word in our trade."
                  He watches the changes that are fast coming over the vender's countenance, folds
                  his arms, places his right foot over his left knee, and awaits a reply.
                  Interrupting the vender just as he is about to give his opinion he draws from his
                  pocket a copy of the paper containing taining the advertisement, and places it in
                  his hand: "If ye'll be good enough to squint at it, ye'll see the hang o' my
                  ideas," he says.
               "My friend," returns the vender, curtly, having glanced over the paper, "save me
                  and yourself any further annoyance. I could have told you how far the property was
                  warranted, before I read the paper; and I remember making some very particular
                  remarks when selling that item in the invoice. A nigger's intelligence is often a
                  mere item of consideration in the amount he brings under the hammer; but we never
                  warrant the exercise or extension of it. Po'h, man! we might just as well attempt
                  to warrant a nigger's stealing, lying, cunning, and all such 'cheating master'
                  propensities. Some of them are considered qualities of much value—especially by
                  poor planters. Warrant nigger property not to run away, eh! Oh! nothing could be
                  worse in our business."
               "A minute, squire!" interrupts the appealing Mr. M'Fadden, just as the other is
                  about to add a suspending clause to his remarks. "If warrantin nigger proper sound
                  in all partiklers is'nt warrantin it not to run away, I'm no deacon! When a
                  nigger's got run-away in him he ain't sound property, no way ye can fix it. Ye may
                  turn all the law and philosophy yer mind to over in yer head, but it won't cum
                  common sense to me, that ye warrant a nigger's body part, and let the head part go
                  unwarranted. When ye sells a critter like that, ye sells all his deviltry; and
                  when ye warrants one ye warrants t'other; that's the square rule o' my law and
                  philosophy!"
               The vender puffs his weed very coolly the while; and then, calling a negro
                  servant, orders a chair upon which to comfortably place his feet. "Are you
                  through, my friend?" he enquires, laconically; and being answered in the
                  affirmative, proceeds—"I fear your philosophy is common philosophy—not the
                  philosophy upon which nigger law is founded. You don't comprehend, my valued
                  friend, that when we insert that negro property will be warranted, we don't
                  include the thinking part; and, of course, running away belongs to that!" he would
                  inform all those curious on such matters. Having given this opinion for the
                  benefit of M'Fadden, and the rest of mankind interested in slavery, he rises from
                  his seat, elongates himself into a consequential position tion, and stands biting his lips, and dangling his
                  watch chain with the fingers of his left hand.
               "Take ye up, there," the other suddenly interrupts, as if he has drawn the point
                  from his antagonist, and is prepared to sustain the principle, having brought to
                  his aid new ideas from the deepest recesses of his logical mind. Grasping the
                  vender firmly by the arm, he looks him in the face, and reminds him that the
                     runaway part of niggers belongs to the heels, and not to the
                  head.
               The vender exhibits some discomfiture, and, at the same time, a decided
                  unwillingness to become a disciple of such philosophy. Nor is he pleased with the
                  familiarity of his importuning customer, whose arm he rejects with a repulsive
                  air.
               There has evidently become a very nice and serious question, of which Mr. M'Fadden
                  is inclined to take a commonsense view. His opponent, however, will not deviate
                  from the strictest usages of business. Business mentioned the mental qualities of
                  the property, but warranted only the physical,—hence the curious perplexity.
               While the point stands thus nicely poised between their logic, Romescos rushes
                  into the office, and, as if to surprise M'Fadden, extends his hand, smiling and
                  looking in his face gratefully, as if the very soul of friendship incited him.
                  "Mighty glad to see ye, old Buck!" he ejaculates, "feared ye war going to kick
                  out."
               The appalled man stands for a few seconds as unmoved as a statue; and then,
                  turning with a half-subdued smile, takes the hand of the other, coldly.
               "Friends again! ain't we, old boy?" breaks forth from Romescos, who continues
                  shaking his hand, at the same time turning his head and giving a significant wink
                  to a clerk at one of the desks. "Politics makes bad friends now and then, but I
                  always thought well of you, Mack! Now, neighbour, I'll make a bargain with you;
                  we'll live as good folks ought to after this," Romescos continues, laconically.
                  His advance is so strange that the other is at a loss to comprehend its purport.
                  He casts doubting glances at his wily antagonist, seems considering how to
                  appreciate the quality of such an unexpected expression of friendship, and is half
                  inclined to demand an earnest of its sincerity. At the same time, and as the
                  matter now stands, he would fain give his considerate friend wide space, and
                  remain within a proper range of etiquette until his eyes behold the substantial.
                  He draws aside from Romescos, who says tremblingly: "Losing that preacher,
                  neighbour, was a hard case—warn't it? You wouldn't a' catched this individual
                  buyin' preachers—know too much about 'em, I reckon! It's no use frettin, though;
                  the two hundred dollars 'll bring him. This child wouldn't want a profitabler
                  day's work for his hound dogs." Romescos winks at the vender, and makes grimaces
                  over M'Fadden's shoulder, as that gentleman turns and grumbles out,—"He warranted
                  him in every partikler; and running away is one of a nigger's partiklers?"
               "My pertinacious friend!" exclaims the vender, turning suddenly towards his
                  dissatisfied customer, seeing you are not disposed to comprehend the necessities
                  of my business, nor to respect my position, I will have nothing further to say to
                  you upon the subject—not another word, now!" The dignified gentleman expresses
                  himself in peremptory tones. It is only the obtuseness of his innate character
                  becoming unnecessarily excited.
               Romescos interposes a word or two, by way of keeping up the zest; for so he calls
                  it. Things are getting crooked, according to his notion of the dispute, but
                  fightin' won't bring back the lost. "'Spose ye leaves the settlin on't to me?
                  There's nothing like friendship in trade; and seeing how I am up in such matters,
                  p'raps I can smooth it down."
               "There's not much friendship about a loss of this kind; and he was warranted sound
                  in every particular!" returns the invincible man, shaking his head, and affecting
                  great seriousness of countenance.
               "Stop that harpin, I say!" the vender demands, drawing himself into a pugnacious
                  attitude; "your insinuations against my honour aggravate me more and more."
               "Well! just as you say about it," is the cool rejoinder. "But you 'll have to
                  settle the case afore lawyer Sprouts, you will!" Stupidly inclined to dog his
                  opinions, the sensitive gentleman, claiming to be much better versed in the mode
                  of selling human things, becomes fearfully enraged. M'Fadden contends purely upon
                  contingencies which may arise in the mental and physical complications of property in man; and this the
                  gentleman man-seller cannot bear the reiteration of.
               "Romescos thinks it is at best but a perplexin snarl, requiring gentlemen to keep
                  very cool. To him they are both honourable men, who should not quarrel over the
                  very small item of one preacher. "This warrantin' niggers' heads never amounts to
                  anything,—it's just like warrantin' their heels; and when one gets bad, isn't
                  t'other sure to be movin? Them's my sentiments, gratis!" Stepping a few feet
                  behind M'Fadden, Romescos rubs his hands in great anxiety, makes curious signs to
                  the clerks at the desk, and charges his mouth with a fresh cut of tobacco.
               "Nobody bespoke your opinion," says the disconsolate M'Fadden, turning quickly, in
                  consequence of a sign he detected one of the clerks making, and catching Romescos
                  bestowing a grimace of no very complimentary character, "Your presence and your
                  opinion are, in my estimation, things that may easily be dispensed with."
               "I say!" interrupts Romescos, his right hand in a threatening attitude, "not quite
                  so fast"—he drawls his words—"a gentleman don't stand an insult o' that sort. Just
                  draw them ar' words back, like a yard of tape, or this individual 'll do a small
                  amount of bruising on that ar' profile, (he draws his hand backward and forward
                  across M'Fadden's face). 'Twon't do to go to church on Sundays with a broken
                  phiz?" His face reddens with anger, as he works his head into a daring attitude,
                  grates his teeth, again draws his fist across M'Fadden's face; and at length rubs
                  his nasal organ.
               "I understand you too well!" replies M'Fadden, with a curt twist of his head. "A
                  man of your cloth can't insult a gentleman like me; you're lawless!" He moves
                  towards the door, stepping sideways, watching Romescos over his left shoulder.
               "I say!—Romescos takes his man by the arm—Come back here, and make a gentleman's
                  apology!" He lets go M'Fadden's arm and seizes him by the collar violently, his
                  face in a blaze of excitement.
               "Nigger killer!" ejaculates M'Fadden, "let go there!" He gives his angry
                  antagonist a determined look, as he, for a moment, looses his hold. He pauses, as
                  if contemplating his next move.
               The very amiable and gentlemanly man-vender thinks it time he interposed for the
                  purpose of reconciling matters. "Gentlemen! gentlemen! respect me, if you do not
                  respect yourselves. My office is no place for such disgraceful broils as these;
                  you must go elsewhere." The modest gentleman, whose very distinguished family
                  connexions have done much to promote his interests, would have it particularly
                  understood that his office is an important place, used only for the very
                  distinguished business of selling men, women, and little children. But Romescos is
                  not so easily satisfied. He pushes the amiable gentleman aside, calls Mr. Lawrence
                  M'Fadden a tyrant what kills niggers by the detestably mean process of starving
                  them to death. "A pretty feller he is to talk about nigger killin! And just think
                  what our state has come to when such fellers as him can make votes for the next
                  election!" says Romescos, addressing himself to the vender. "The Irish influence
                  is fast destroying the political morality of the country."
               Turning to Mr. M'Fadden, who seems preparing for a display of his combativeness,
                  he adds, "Ye see, Mack, ye will lie, and lie crooked too! and ye will steal, and
                  steal dishonourably; and I can lick a dozen on ye quicker nor chain lightnin? I
                  can send the hol batch on ye—rubbish as it is—to take supper t'other side of
                  sundown." To be equal with his adversary, Romescos is evidently preparing himself
                  for the reception of something more than words. Twice or thrice he is seen to pass
                  his right hand into the left breast pocket of his sack, where commonly his shining
                  steel is secreted. In another moment he turns suddenly towards the vender, pushes
                  him aside with his left hand, and brings his right in close proximity with Mr.
                  M'Fadden's left listener. That individual exhibits signs of renewed courage, to
                  which he adds the significant warning: "Not quite so close, if you please!"
               "As close as I sees fit!" returns the other, with a sardonic grin. "Why don't you
                  resent it?—a gentleman would!"
               Following the word, Mr. M'Fadden makes a pass at his antagonist, which, he says,
                  is only with the intention of keeping him at a respectful distance. Scarcely has
                  his arm passed when Romescos cries out, "There! he has struck me! He has struck me
                  again!" and deals M'Fadden a blow with his clenched fist that fells him lumbering
                  to the floor. Simultaneously Romescos
                  falls upon his prostrate victim, and a desperate struggle ensues.
               The vender, whose sacred premises are thus disgraced, runs out to call the police,
                  while the clerks make an ineffectual attempt to separate the combatants. Not a
                  policeman is to be found. At night they may be seen swarming the city, guarding
                  the fears of a white populace ever sensitive of black rebellion.
               Like an infuriated tiger, Romescos, nimble as a catamount, is fast destroying
                  every vestige of outline in his antagonist's face, drenching it with blood, and
                  adding ghastliness by the strangulation he is endeavouring to effect.
               "Try—try—trying to—kill—me—eh? You—you mad brute!" gutters out the struggling man,
                  his eyes starting from the sockets like balls of fire, while gore and saliva foam
                  from his mouth and nostrils as if his struggles are in death.
               "Kill ye—kill ye?" Romescos rejoins, the shaggy red hair falling in tufts about
                  his face, now burning with desperation: "it would be killin' only a wretch whose
                  death society calls for."
               At this, the struggling man, like one borne to energy by the last throes of
                  despair, gives a desperate spring, succeeds in turning his antagonist, grasps him
                  by the throat with his left hand, and from his pocket fires a pistol with his
                  right. The report alarms; the shrill whistle calls to the rescue; but the ball has
                  only taken effect in the flesh of Romescos's right arm. Quick to the moment, his
                  arm dripping with gore from the wound, he draws his glittering dirk, and plunges
                  it, with unerring aim, into the breast of his antagonist. The wounded man starts
                  convulsively, as the other coolly draws back the weapon, the blood gushing forth
                  in a livid stream. "Is not that in self-defence?" exclaims the bloody
                  votary, turning his haggard and enraged face to receive the approval of the
                  bystanders. The dying man, writhing under the grasp of his murderer, utters a
                  piercing shriek. "Murdered! I'm dying! Oh, heaven! is this my last—last—last?
                  Forgive me, Lord,—forgive me!" he gurgles; and making another convulsive effort,
                  wrings his body from under the perpetrator of the foul deed. How tenacious of life
                  is the dying man! He grasps the leg of a desk, raises himself to his feet, and, as
                  if goaded with the thoughts of hell, in his last struggles staggers to the
                  door,—discharges a second shot, vaults, as it were, into the street, and falls
                  prostrate upon the pavement, surrounded by a crowd of eager lookers-on. He is
                  dead! The career of Mr. M'Fadden is ended; his spirit is summoned for trial before
                  a just God.
               The murderer (perhaps we abuse the word, and should apply the more southern, term
                  of renconterist), sits in a chair, calling for water, as a few among
                  the crowd prepare to carry the dead body into Graspum's slave-pen, a few squares
                  below.
               Southern sensibility may call these scenes by whatever name it will; we have no
                  desire to change the appropriateness, nor to lessen the moral tenor of southern
                  society. It nurtures a frail democracy, and from its bastard offspring we have a
                  tyrant dying by the hand of a tyrant, and the spoils of tyranny serving the good
                  growth of the Christian church. Money constructs opinions, pious as well as
                  political, and even changes the feelings of good men, who invoke heaven's aid
                  against the bondage of the souls of men.
               Romescos will not flee to escape the terrible award of earthly justice. Nay, that,
                  in our atmosphere of probity, would be dishonourable; nor would it aid the purpose
                  he seeks to gain.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               A COMMON INCIDENT SHORTLY TOLD.
               THE dead body of Mr. Lawrence M'Fadden, whose heart was strong with love of
                  southern democracy, lies upon two pine-boards, ghastly and unshrouded, in a
                  wretched slave-pen. Romescos, surrounded by admiring friends, has found his way to
                  the gaol, where, as is the custom, he has delivered himself up to its keeper. He
                  has spent a good night in that ancient establishment, and on the following morning
                  finds his friends vastly increased. They have viewed him as rather desperate now
                  and then; but, knowing he is brave withal, have "come to the rescue" on the
                  present occasion. These frequent visits he receives with wonderful coolness and
                  deference, their meats and drinks (so amply furnished to make his stay
                  comfortable) being a great Godsend to the gaoler, who, while they last, will
                  spread a princely table.
               Brien Moon, Esq.—better known as the good-natured coroner—has placed a negro
                  watchman over the body of the deceased, on which he proposes to hold one of those
                  curious ceremonies called inquests. Brien Moon, Esq. is particularly fond of the
                  ludicrous, is ever ready to appreciate a good joke, and well known for his happy
                  mode of disposing of dead dogs and cats, which, with anonymous letters, are in
                  great numbers entrusted to his care by certain waggish gentlemen, who desire he
                  will "hold an inquest over the deceased, and not forget the fees." It is said—the
                  aristocracy, however, look upon the charge with contempt—that Brien Moon, Esq.
                  makes a small per centage by selling those canine remains to the governor of the
                  workhouse, which very humane gentleman pays from his own pocket the means of
                  transferring them into giblet-pies for the inmates. It may be all scandal about
                  Mr. Moon making so large an amount from his office; but it is nevertheless true
                  that sad disclosures have of late been made concerning the internal affairs of the
                  workhouse.
               The hour of twelve has arrived; and since eight in the morning Mr. Moon's time has
                  been consumed in preliminaries necessary to the organisation of a coroner's jury.
                  The reader we know will excuse our not entering into the minutiæ of the
                  organisation. Eleven jurors have answered the summons, but a twelfth seems
                  difficult to procure. John, the good Coroner's negro servant, has provided a
                  sufficiency of brandy and cigars, which, since the hour of eleven, have been
                  discussed without stint. The only objection our worthy disposer of the dead has to
                  this is, that some of his jurors, becoming very mellow, may turn the inquest into
                  a farce, with himself playing the low-comedy part. The dead body, which lies
                  covered with a sheet, is fast becoming enveloped in smoke, while no one seems to
                  have a passing thought for it. Colonel Tom Edon,—who, they say, is not colonel of
                  any regiment, but has merely received the title from the known fact of his being a
                  hogdriver, which honourable profession is distinguished by its colonels proceeding
                  to market mounted, while the captains walk,—merely wonders how much bad whiskey
                  the dead 'un consumed while he lived.
               "This won't do!" exclaims Brien Moon, Esq., and proceeds to the door in the hope
                  of catching something to make his mournful number complete. He happens upon Mr.
                  Jonas Academy, an honest cracker, from Christ's parish, who visits the city on a
                  little business. Jonas is a person of great originality, is enclosed in
                  loosely-setting homespun, has a woe-begone countenance, and wears a large-brimmed
                  felt hat. He is just the person to make the number complete, and is led in,
                  unconscious of the object for which he finds himself a captive. Mr. Brien Moon now
                  becomes wondrous grave, mounts a barrel at the head of the corpse, orders the
                  negro to uncover the body, and hopes gentlemen will take seats on the benches he
                  has provided for them, while he proceeds to administer the oath. Three or four yet
                  retain their cigars: he hopes gentlemen will suspend their smoking during the
                  inquest. Suddenly it is found that seven out of the twelve can neither read nor
                  write; and Mr. Jonas Academy makes known the sad fact that he does not comprehend
                  the nature of an oath, never having taken such an article in his life. Five of the
                  gentlemen, who can read and write, are from New England; while Mr. Jonas Academy declares poor
                  folks in Christ's parish are not fools, troubled with reading and writing
                  knowledge. He has been told they have a thing called a college at Columbia; but
                  only haristocrats get any good of it. In answer to a question from Mr. Moon, he is
                  happy to state that their parish is not pestered with a schoolmaster. "Yes, they
                  killed the one we had more nor two years ago, thank Good! Han't bin trubl'd with
                  one o' the critters since" he adds, with unmoved nerves. The Coroner suggests that
                  in a matter of expediency like the present it may be well to explain the nature of
                  an oath; and, seeing that a man may not read and write, and yet comprehend its
                  sacredness, perhaps it would be as well to forego the letter of the law. "Six used
                  to do for this sort of a jury, but now law must have twelve," says Mr. Moon.
                  Numerous voices assent to this, and Mr. Moon commences what he calls "an
                  halucidation of the nature of an oath." The jurors receive this with great
                  satisfaction, take the oath according to his directions, and after listening to
                  the statement of two competent witnesses, who know but very little about the
                  affair, are ready to render a verdict,—"that M'Fadden, the deceased, came to his
                  death by a stab in the left breast, inflicted by a sharp instrument in the hand or
                  hands of Anthony Romescos, during an affray commonly called a rencontre, regarding which there are many extenuating circumstances." To this
                  verdict Mr. Moon forthwith bows assent, directs the removal of the body, and
                  invites the gentlemen jurors to join him in another drink, which he does in
                  compliment to their distinguished services. The dead body will be removed to the
                  receiving vault, and Mr. Moon dismisses his jurors with many bows and thanks; and
                  nothing more.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               THE CHILDREN ARE IMPROVING.
               THREE years have rolled round, and wrought great changes in the aspect of affairs.
                  M'Fadden was buried on his plantation, Romescos was bailed by Graspum, and took
                  his trial at the sessions for manslaughter. It was scarcely worth while to trouble
                  a respectable jury with the paltry case—and then, they were so frequent! We need
                  scarcely tell the reader that he was honourably acquitted, and borne from the
                  court amid great rejoicing. His crime was only that of murder in self-defence;
                  and, as two tyrants had met, the successful had the advantage of public opinion,
                  which in the slave world soars high above law. Romescos being again on the world,
                  making his cleverness known, we must beg the reader's indulgence, and request him
                  to accompany us while we return to the children.
               Annette and Nicholas are, and have been since the sale, the property of Graspum.
                  They develope in size and beauty—two qualities very essential in the man-market of
                  our democratic world, the South. Those beautiful features, intelligence, and
                  reserve, are much admired as merchandise; for southern souls are not lifted above
                  this grade of estimating coloured worth. Annette's cherub face, soft blue eyes,
                  clear complexion, and light auburn hair, add to the sweetness of a countenance
                  that education and care might make brilliant; and yet, though reared on Marston's
                  plantation, with unrestricted indulgence, her childish heart seems an outpouring
                  of native goodness. She speaks of her mother with the affection of one of maturer
                  years; she grieves for her return, wonders why she is left alone, remembers how
                  kind that mother spoke to her when she said good by, at the cell door. How sweet
                  is the remembrance of a mother! how it lingers, sparkling as a dewdrop, in a
                  child's memory. Annette feels the affliction, but is too young to divine the cause
                  thereof. She recalls the many happy plantation scenes; they are bright to her yet!
                  She prattles about Daddy Bob, Harry,
                  Aunt Rachel, and old Sue, now and then adding a solicitous question about Marston.
                  But she does not realise that he is her father; no, it was not her lot to bestow a
                  daughter's affection upon him, and she is yet too young to comprehend the poison
                  of slave power. Her childlike simplicity affords a touching contrast to that
                  melancholy injustice by which a fair creature with hopes and virtues after God's
                  moulding, pure and holy, is made mere merchandise for the slave-market.
               Annette has learned to look upon Nicholas as a brother; but, like herself, he is
                  kept from those of his own colour by some, to him, unintelligible agency. Strange
                  reflections flit through her youthful imagination, as she embraces him with a
                  sister's fondness. How oft she lays her little head upon his shoulder, encircles
                  his neck with her fair arm, and braids his raven hair with her tiny fingers! She
                  little thinks how fatal are those charms she bears bloomingly into womanhood.
               But, if they alike increase in beauty as they increase in age, their dispositions
                  are as unlike as two opposites can be moulded. Nicholas has inherited that
                  petulant will, unbending determination, and lurking love of avenging wrong, so
                  peculiar to the Indian race. To restlessness he adds distrust of those around him;
                  and when displeased, is not easily reconciled. He is, however, tractable, and
                  early evinced an aptitude for mechanical pursuits that would have done credit to
                  maturer years. Both have been at service, and during the period have created no
                  small degree of admiration—Annette for her promising personal appearance, Nicholas
                  for his precocious display of talent. Both have earned their living; and now
                  Nicholas is arrived at an age when his genius attracts purchasers.
               Conspicuous among those who have been keeping an eye on the little fellow, is Mr.
                  Jonathan Grabguy, a master-builder, largely engaged in rearing dwellings. His
                  father was a builder, and his mother used to help the workmen to make Venetian
                  blinds. Fortune showered her smiles upon their energies, and brought them negro
                  property in great abundance. Of this property they made much; the father of the
                  present Mr. Grabguy (who became a distinguished mayor of the city) viewing it
                  peculiarly profitable to use up his niggers in five years. To this
                  end he forced them to incessant toil, belabouring them with a weapon of raw hide,
                  to which he gave the singular cognomen of "hell-fire." When extra punishment
                  was—according to his policy—necessary to bring out the "digs," he would lock them
                  up in his cage (a sort of grated sentry-box, large enough to retain the body in an
                  upright position), and when the duration of this punishment was satisfactory to
                  his feelings, he would administer a counter quantity of stings with
                  his "hell-fire" wattle. Indeed, the elder Mr. Grabguy, who afterwards became "His
                  Worship the Mayor," was a wonderful disciplinarian, which very valuable traits of
                  character his son retains in all their purity. His acts deserve more specific
                  notice than we are at present able to give them, inasmuch as by them the safety of
                  a state is frequently endangered, as we shall show in the climax.
               Our present Mr. Grabguy is a small man, somewhat slender of person, about five
                  feet seven inches high, who usually dresses in the habiliments of a working man,
                  and is remarkable for his quickness. His features are dark and undefinable, marked
                  with that thoughtfulness which applies only to the getting of 
                     wordly
                     worldly
                   goods. His face is narrow and careworn, with piercing brown eyes, high
                  cheek bones, projecting nose and chin, low forehead, and greyish hair, which he
                  parts in the centre. These form the strongest index to his stubborn character;
                  nevertheless he hopes, ere long, to reach the same distinguished position held by
                  his venerable father, who, peace to his ashes! is dead.
               "Now, good neighbour Graspum," says our Mr. Grabguy, as he stands in Graspum's
                  warehouse examining a few prime fellows, "I've got a small amount to invest in
                  stock, but I wants somethin' choice—say two or three prime uns, handy at tools. I
                  wants somethin' what 'll make mechanics. Then I wants to buy," he continues,
                  deliberately, "a few smart young uns, what have heads with somethin' in 'um, that
                  ye can bring up to larn things. White mechanics, you see, are so independent
                  now-a-days, that you can't keep 'um under as you can niggers.
               "I've bin thinkin' 'bout tryin' an experiment with nigger prentices; and, if it
                  goes, we can dispense with white mechanics entirely. My word for it, they're only
                  a great nuisance at best. When you put 'um to work with niggers they don't feel
                  right, and they have notions that our society don't respect 'um because they must mix with the
                  black rascals in following their trades; and this works its way into their
                  feelings so, that the best on 'um from the north soon give themselves up to the
                  worst dissipation. Ah! our white mechanics are poor wretches; there isn't twenty
                  in the city you can depend on to keep sober two days."
               "Well, sir," interrupts Graspum, with an air of great importance, as, with serious
                  countenance, he stands watching every change in Mr. Grabguy's face, at intervals
                  taking a cursory survey of his merchandise, "can suit you to most anything in the
                  line. You understand my mode of trade, perfectly?" He touches Mr. Grabguy on the
                  arm, significantly, and waits the reply, which that gentleman makes with a bow.
                  "Well, if you do," he continues, "you know the means and markets I have at my
                  command. Can sell you young uns of any age, prime uns of various qualities—from
                  field hands down to watch-makers, clergymen!" He always keeps a good supply on
                  hand, and has the very best means of supply. So Mr. Grabguy makes a purchase of
                  three prime men, whom he intends to transform into first-rate mechanics. He
                  declares he will not be troubled hereafter with those very miserable white workmen
                  he is constrained to import from the north. They are foolish enough to think they
                  are just as good as any body, and can be gentlemen in their profession. They, poor
                  fools! mistake the south in their love of happy New England and its society, as
                  they call it.
               Having completed his bargain, he hesitates, as if there is something more he would
                  like to have. "Graspum!" he says, "What for trade? can we strike for that imp o'
                  yours at Mrs. Tuttlewill's?" Without waiting for Graspum's reply, he adds—"That
                  chap 's goin to make a tall bit of property one of these days!"
               "Ought to," rejoins Graspum, stoically; "he's got right good stock in him." The
                  man of business gives his head a knowing shake, and takes a fresh quid of tobacco.
                  "Give that 'sprout' a chance in the world, and he'll show his hand!" he adds.
               "That's what I wants," intimates our tradesman. He has had his eye on the fellow,
                  and knows he's got a head what 'll make the very best kind of a workman. But it
                  will be necessary to take the stubborn out without injuring the "larning" part.
                  Mr. Grabguy, with great unconcern, merely suggests these trifling matters for the
                  better regulating of Mr. Graspum's price.
               "Can do that easy enough, if you only study the difference between a nigger's hide
                  and head. Can put welts on pretty strong, if you understand the difference a'tween
                  the too," intimates our man of business, as he places his thumbs in his vest, and
                  commences humming a tune. Then he stops suddenly, and working his face into a very
                  learned contortion, continues—"Ye see, Grabguy, a man has to study the human natur
                  of a nigger just the same as he would a mule or a machine. In truth, Grabguy,
                  niggers are more like mules nor anything else, 'cause the brute 'll do everything
                  but what ye wants him to do, afore he's subdued. You must break them when they are
                  young. About ten or a dozen welts, sir, well laid on when ye first begin, and
                  every time he don't toe the mark, will, in the course of a year, make him as
                  submissive as a spaniel—it will! The virtue of submission is in the lash, it
                  supples like seeds."
               "About the stock, Graspum: I don't quite agree with you about that,—I never
                  believed in blood, ye know. As far as this imp goes, I have my doubts about the
                  blood doin on him much good; seein' how it kind o' comes across my mind that
                  there's some Ingin in him. Now, if my philosophy serves me right, Ingin blood
                  makes slave property want to run away (the speaker spreads himself with great
                  nonchalance), the very worst fault."
               "Poh! poh!—isn't a bit o' that about him. That imp 's from Marston's estate, can't
                  scare up nothin so promisin' in the way of likely colour," Graspum interposes,
                  with great assurance of manner. "You didn't see the gal—did you?" he
                  concludes.
               "I reckon I've taken a squint at both on 'em ! Pretty fine and likely. From the
                  same bankrupt concern, I s'pose?" Mr. Grabguy looks quite serious, and waits for a
                  reply.
               "Yes—nothing less," Graspum replies, measuredly. "But won't it make your eye
                  water, neighbour Grabguy, one of these days! Bring a tall price among some of our
                  young bucks, eh!" He gives neighbour Grabguy a significant touch on the arm,, and
                  that gentleman turns his head and smiles. How quaintly modest!
               "By the by, talking of Marston, what has become of him? His affairs seem to have died out in the
                  general levity which the number of such cases occasion. But I tell you what it is,
                  Graspum," (he whispers, accompanying the word with an insinuating look), "report
                  implicates you in that affair."
               "Me?—Me?—Me, Sir? God bless you! why, you really startle me. My honour is above
                  the world's scandal. Ah! if you only knew what I've done for that man,
                  Marston;—that cussed nephew of his came within a feather of effecting my ruin. And
                  there he lies, stubborn as a door-plate, sweating out his obstinacy in gaol. Lord
                  bless your soul, I'm not to blame, you know!—I have done a world of things for
                  him; but he won't be advised."
               "His creditors think he has more money, and money being the upshot of all his
                  troubles, interposes the point of difficulty in the present instance. I tell them
                  he has no more money, but—I know not why—they doubt the fact the more, and refuse
                  to release him, on the ground of my purchasing their claims at some ulterior
                  period, as I did those two fi fas when the right
                  of freedom was being contested in the children. But, you see, Grabguy, I'm a man
                  of standing; and no money would tempt me to have anything to do with another such
                  case. It was by a mere quirk of law, and the friendship of so many eminent
                  lawyers, that I secured that fifteen hundred dollars from M'Carstrow for the gal
                  what disappeared so mysteriously."
               "Graspum!" interrupts Mr. Grabguy, suddenly, accompanying his remark with a laugh,
                  "you're a good bit of a lawyer when it comes to the cross-grained. You tell it all
                  on one side, as lawyers do. I know the risk you run in buying the fi fas on which those children were attached!" Mr.
                  Grabguy smiles, doubtingly, and shakes his head.
               "There are liabilities in everything," Graspum drawls out, measuredly. "Pardon me,
                  my friend, you never should found opinion on suspicion. More than a dozen times
                  have I solicited Marston to file his schedule, and take the benefit of the act.
                  However, with all my advice and kindness to him, he will not move a finger towards
                  his own release. Like all our high-minded Southerners, he is ready to maintain a
                  sort of compound between dignity and distress, with which he will gratify his
                  feelings. It's all pride, sir—pride!—you may depend upon it." (Graspum lays his
                  hands together, and affects wondrous charity). "I pity such men from the very
                  bottom of my heart, because it always makes me feel bad when I think what they
                  have been. Creditors, sir, are very unrelenting; and seldom think that an
                  honourable man would suffer the miseries of a prison rather than undergo the pain
                  of being arraigned before an open court, for the exposition of his poverty.
                  Sensitiveness often founds the charge of wrong. The thing is much misunderstood; I
                  know it, sir! Yes, sir! My own feelings make me the best judge," continues
                  Graspum, with a most serious countenance. He feels he is a man of wonderful parts,
                  much abused by public opinion, and, though always trying to promote public good,
                  never credited for his many kind acts.
               Turning his head aside to relieve himself of a smile, Mr. Grabguy admits that he
                  is quite an abused man; and, setting aside small matters, thinks it well to be
                  guided by the good motto:—'retire from business with plenty of
                  money.' It may not subdue tongues, but it will soften whispers. Money, Mr. Grabguy
                  intimates, upon the strength of his venerable father's experience, is a curious
                  medium of overcoming the ditchwork of society. In fact, he assures Graspum, that
                  with plenty of shiners you may be just such a man as you please; everybody will
                  forget that you ever bought or sold a nigger, and ten chances to one if you do not
                  find yourself sloped off into Congress, before you have had time to study the
                  process of getting there. But, enough of this, Graspum;—let us turn to trade
                  matters. What's the lowest shot ye'll take for that mellow mixture of Ingin and
                  aristocracy. Send up and bring him down: let us hear the lowest dodge you'll let
                  him slide at."
               Mr. Grabguy evinces an off-handedness in trade that is quite equal to Graspum's
                  keen tact. But Graspum has the faculty of preserving a disinterested appearance
                  singularly at variance with his object.
               A messenger is despatched, receipt in hand, for the boy Nicholas. Mrs. Tuttlewell,
                  a brusque body of some sixty years, and with thirteen in a family, having had
                  three husbands (all gentlemen of the highest standing, and connected with first
                  families), keeps a stylish boarding-house, exclusively for the aristocracy, common
                  people not being competent to her style
                  of living; and as nobody could ever say one word against the Tuttlewell family,
                  the present head of the Tuttlewell house has become very fashionably
                  distinguished. The messenger's arrival is made known to Mrs. Tuttlewell, who must
                  duly consider the nature of the immediate demand. She had reason to expect the
                  services of the children would have been at her command for some years to come.
                  However, she must make the very best of it; they are Graspum's property, and he
                  can do what he pleases with them. She suggests, with great politeness, that the
                  messenger take a seat in the lower veranda. Her house is located in a most
                  fashionable street, and none knew better than good lady Tuttlewell herself the
                  value of living up to a fashionable nicety; for, where slavery exists, it is a
                  trade to live.
               Both children have been "waiting on table," and, on hearing the summons, repair to
                  their cabin in the yard. Mrs. Tuttlewell, reconsidering her former decision,
                  thinks the messenger better follow them, seeing that he is a nigger with kindly
                  looks. "Uncle!" says Annette, looking up at the old Negro, as he joins them:
                  "Don't you want me too?"
               "No," returns the man, coolly shaking his head.
               "I think they must be going to take us back to the old plantation, where Daddy Bob
                  used to sing so. Then I shall see mother—how I do want to see her!" she exclaims,
                  her little heart bounding with ecstasy. Three years or more have passed since she
                  prattled on her mother's knee.
               The negro recognizes the child's simplicity. "I on'e wants dat child; but da'h
                  an't gwine t' lef ye out on da plantation, nohow!" he says.
               "Not going to take us home!" she says, with a sigh. Nicholas moodily submits
                  himself to be prepared, as Annette, more vivacious, keeps interposing with various
                  enquiries. She would like to know where they are going to take little Nicholas;
                  and when they will let her go and see Daddy Bob and mother? "Now, you can take me;
                  I know you can!" she says, looking up at the messenger, and taking his hand
                  pertly.
               "No—can't, little 'un! Mus' lef' 'um fo'h nuder time. You isn't broder and
                  sister—is ye?"
               "No!" quickly replies the little girl, swinging his hand playfully; "but I want to
                  go where he goes; I want to see mother when he does."
               "Well, den, little 'un (the negro sees he cannot overcome the child's simplicity
                  by any other means), dis child will come fo'h 'um to-morrow—dat I will!"
               "And you'll bring Nicholas back—won't you?" she enquires, grasping the messenger
                  more firmly by the hand.
               "Sartin! no mistake 'bout dat, little 'uman." At this she takes Nicholas by the
                  hand, and retires to their little room in the cabin. Here, like one of older
                  years, she washes him, and dresses him, and fusses over him.
               He is merely a child for sale; so she combs his little locks, puts on his new
                  osnaburgs, arranges his nice white collar about his neck, and makes him look so
                  prim. And then she ties a piece of black ribbon about his neck, giving him the
                  bright appearance of a school-boy on examination-day. The little girl's feelings
                  seem as much elated as would be a mother's at the prospect of her child gaining a
                  medal of distinction.
               "Now, Nicholas!" she whispers, with touching simplicity, as she views him from
                  head to foot with a smile of exultation on her face, "your mother never dressed
                  you so neat. But I like you more and more, Nicholas, because both our mothers are
                  gone; and maybe we shall never see 'um again." And she kisses him fondly,—tells
                  him not to stay long,—to tell her all he has seen and heard about mother, when he
                  returns.
               "I don't know, 'Nette, but 'pears to me we ain't like other children—they don't
                  have to be sold so often; and I don't seem to have any father."
               "Neither do I; but Mrs. Tuttlewell says I mustn't mind that, because there's
                  thousands just like us. And then she says we ain't the same kind o' white folks
                  that she is; she says we are white, but niggers for all that. I don't know how it
                  is! I'm not like black folks, because I'm just as white as any white folks," she
                  rejoins, placing her little arms round his neck and smoothing his hair with her
                  left hand.
               "I'll grow up, one o' these days."
               "And so will I," she speaks, boldly.
               "And I'm goin' to know where my mother's gone, and why I ain't as good as other
                  folks' white children," he rejoins sullenly, shaking his head, and muttering away
                  to himself. It is quite evident that the many singular stages through which he is
                  passing, serve only to increase the
                  
                     stubborness
                     stubbornness
                   of his nature. The only black distinguishable in his features are his
                  eyes and hair; and, as he looks in the glass to confirm what he has said, Annette
                  takes him by the hand, tells him he must not mind, now; that if he is good he
                  shall see Franconia,—and mother, too, one of these days. He must not be pettish,
                  she remarks, holding him by the hand like a sister whose heart glows with hope for
                  a brother's welfare. She gives him in charge of the messenger, saying, "Good by!"
                  as she imprints a kiss on his cheek, its olive hues changing into deep
                  crimson.
               The negro answers her adieu with "Good by, little dear! God bless 'um!" Nay, the
                  native goodness of his heart will not permit him to leave her thus. He turns
                  round, takes her in his arms, kisses and kisses her fair cheek. It is the truth of
                  an honest soul, expressed with tears glistening in his eyes. Again taking Nicholas
                  by the hand, he hastens through the passage of Mrs. Tuttlewell's house where, on
                  emerging into the street, he is accosted by that very fashionable lady, who
                  desires to know if he has got the boy "all right!" Being answered in the
                  affirmative, she gives a very dignified—"Glad of it," and desires her compliments
                  to Mr. Graspum, who she hopes will extend the same special regards to his family,
                  and retires to the quietude of her richly-furnished parlour.
               The gentleman dealer and his customer are waiting in the man shambles, while the
                  negro messenger with his boy article of trade plod their way along through the
                  busy streets. The negro looks on his charge with a smile of congratulation. "Mas'r
                  'll laugh all over 'e clothes when he sees ye—dat he will!" he says, with an air
                  of exultation.
               "I'd like to know where I'm goin' to afore I go much further," returns the boy,
                  curtly, as he walks along, every few minutes asking unanswerable questions of the
                  negro.
               "Lor, child!" returns the negro, with a significant smile, "take ye down to old
                  massa what own 'um! Fo'h true!"
               "Own me!" mutters the child, surlily. "How can they own me without owning my
                  mother?—and I've no father."
               "White man great 'losipher; he know so much, dat nigger don't know nofin," is the
                  singularly significant answer.
               "But God didn't make me for a nigger,—did he?"
               "Don' know how dat is, child. 'Pears like old mas'r tink da' ain't no God; and
                  what he sees in yander good book lef 'um do just as 'e mind to wid nigger.
                  Sometimes Buckra sell nigger by de pound, just like 'e sell pig; and den 'e say 't
                  was wid de Lord's will."
               "If mas'r Lord be what Buckra say he be, dis child don' want t'be 'quainted wid
                  'um," he coolly dilates, as if he foresees the mournful result of the child's
                  bright endowments.
               The negro tries to quiet the child's apprehensions by telling him he thinks
                  "Buckra, what's waiting down in da'h office, gwine t' buy 'um of old mas'r. Know
                  dat Buckra he sharp feller. Get e' eye on ye, and make up 'e mind what 'e gwine to
                  give fo'h 'um, quicker!" says the negro.
               Graspum has invited his customer, Mr. Grabguy, into his more comfortable
                  counting-room, where, as Nicholas is led in, they may be found discussing the
                  rights of the south, as guaranteed by the federal constitution. The south claim
                  rights independent of the north; and those rights are to secede from the wrongs of
                  the north whenever she takes into her head the very simple notion of carrying them
                  out. Graspum, a man of great experience, whose keen sense of justice is made
                  keener by his sense of practical injustice,—thinks the democracy of the south was
                  never fully understood, and that the most sure way of developing its great
                  principles is by hanging every northerner, whose abolition mania is fast absorbing
                  the liberties of the country at large.
               "That's the feller!" says Mr. Grabguy, as the negro leads Nicholas into his
                  presence, and orders him to keep his hands down while the gentleman looks at him.
                  "Stubborn sticks out some, though, I reckon," Mr. Grabguy adds, rather
                  enthusiastically. "Absalom! Isaac! Joe! eh? what's your name?"
               "He's a trump!" interposes Graspum, rubbing his hands together, and giving his
                  head a significant shake.
               "Nicholas, they call me, master," answers the boy, pettishly.
               Mr. Grabguy takes him by the arms, feels his muscle with great care and caution,
                  tries the elasticity of his body by
                  lifting him from the floor by his two ears. This is too much, which the child
                  announces with loud screams. "Stuff! out and out," says Mr. Grabguy, patting him
                  on the back, in a kind sort of way. At the same time he gives a look of
                  satisfaction at Graspum.
               "Everything a man wants, in that yaller skin," returns that methodical tradesman,
                  with a gracious nod.
               "Black lightnin' eyes—long wiry black hair, a skin full of Ingin devil, and a face
                  full of stubborn," Mr. Grabguy discourses, as he contemplates the article before
                  him.
               "Well, now, about the lowest figure for him?" he continues, again looking at
                  Graspum, and waiting his reply. That gentleman, drawing his right hand across his
                  mouth, relieves it of the virtueless deposit, and supplies it with a fresh
                  quid.
               "Sit down, neighbour Grabguy," he says, placing a chair beside him. They both sit
                  down; the negro attendant stands a few feet behind them: the boy may walk a line
                  backward and forward. "Say the word! You know I'll have a deal o' trouble afore
                  breaking the feller in," Grabguy exclaims, impatiently.
               Graspum is invoking his philosophy. He will gauge the point of value according to
                  the coming prospect and Mr. Grabguy's wants. "Well, now, seeing it's you, and
                  taking the large amount of negro property I have sold to your distinguished father
                  into consideration—I hope to sell forty thousand niggers yet, before I die—he
                  should bring six hundred." Graspum lays his left hand modestly on Mr. Grabguy's
                  right arm, as that gentleman rather starts with surprise. "Take the extraordinary
                  qualities into consideration, my friend; he's got a head what's worth two hundred
                  dollars more nor a common nigger,—that is, if you be going to turn it into
                  knowledge profit. But that wasn't just what I was going to say" (Graspum becomes
                  profound, as he spreads himself back in his chair). "I was going to say, I'd let
                  you—you mustn't whisper it, though—have him for five hundred and twenty; and he's
                  as cheap at that as bull-dogs at five dollars."
               Grabguy shakes his head: he thinks the price rather beyond his mark. He, however,
                  has no objection to chalking on the figure; and as both are good democrats, they
                  will split the difference.
               Graspum, smiling, touches his customer significantly with his elbow. "I never do
                  business after that model," he says. "Speaking of bull-dogs, why, Lord bless your
                  soul, Sam Beals and me traded t'other day: I gin him a young five-year old nigger
                  for his hound, and two hundred dollars to boot. Can't go five hundred and twenty
                  for that imp, nohow! Could o' got a prime nigger for that, two years ago."
               "Wouldn't lower a fraction! He's extraordinary prime, and'll increase fifty
                  dollars a year every year for ten years or more."
               Mr. Grabguy can't help that: he is merely in search of an article capable of being
                  turned into a mechanic, or professional man,—anything to suit the exigencies of a
                  free country, in which such things are sold. And as it will require much time to
                  get the article to a point where it'll be sure to turn the pennies back, perhaps
                  he'd as well let it alone: so he turns the matter over in his head. And yet, there
                  is a certain something about the "young imp" that really fascinates him; his keen
                  eye, and deep sense of nigger natur' value, detect the wonderful promise the
                  article holds forth.
               "Not one cent lower would I take for that chap. In fact, I almost feel like
                  recanting now," says Graspum, by way of breaking the monotony.
               "Well, I'll bid you good day," says the other, in return, affecting preparation to
                  leave. He puts out his hand to Graspum, and with a serious look desires to know if
                  that be the lowest figure.
               "Fact! Don't care 'bout selling at that. Couldn't have a better investment than to
                  keep him!"
               Mr. Grabguy considers and reconsiders the matter over in his mind; paces up and
                  down the floor several times, commences humming a tune, steps to the door, looks
                  up and down the street, and says, "Well, I'll be moving homeward, I will."
               "Like yer custom, that I do; but then, knowing what I can do with the fellow, I
                  feels stiff about letting him go," interposes Graspum, with great indifference,
                  following to the door, with hands extended.
               This is rather too insinuating for Mr. Grabguy. Never did piece of property loom
                  up so brightly, so physically and intellectually valuable. He will return to the
                     table. Taking his seat again, he
                  draws forth a piece of paper, and with his pencil commences figuring upon it. He
                  wants to get at the cost of free and slave labour, and the relative advantages of
                  the one over the other. After a deal of multiplying and subtracting, he gives it
                  up in despair. The fine proportions of the youth before him distract his very
                  brain with contemplation. He won't bother another minute; figures are only
                  confusions: so far as using them to compute the relative value of free and slave
                  labour, they are enough to make one's head ache. "Would ye like to go with me,
                  boy? Give ye enough to eat, but make ye toe the mark!" He looks at Nicholas, and
                  waits a reply.
               "Don't matter!" is the boy's answer. "Seems as if nobody cared for me; and so I
                  don't care for nobody."
               "That's enough," he interrupts, turning to Graspum: "there's a showing of grit in
                  that, eh?"
               "Soon take it out," rejoins that methodical gentleman. "Anyhow, I've a mind to try
                  the fellow, Graspum. I feel the risk I run; but I don't mind—it's neck or nothin
                  here in the south! Ye'll take a long note, s'pose? Good, ye know!"
               Graspum motions his head and works his lips, half affirmatively.
               "Good as old gold, ye knows that," insinuates Mr. Grabguy.
               "Yes, but notes aint cash; and our banks are shut down as tight as steel traps. At
                  all events make it bankable, and add the interest for six months. It's against my
                  rules of business, though," returns Graspum, with great financial emphasis.
               After considerably more very nice exhibitions of business tact, it is agreed that
                  Mr. Grabguy takes the "imp" at five hundred and twenty dollars, for which Graspum
                  accepts his note at six months, with interest. Mr. Grabguy's paper is good, and
                  Graspum considers it equal to cash, less the interest. The "imp" is now left in
                  charge of the negro, while the two gentlemen retire to the private counting-room,
                  where they will settle the preliminaries.
               A grave-looking gentleman at a large desk is ordered to make the entry of sale; as
                  the initiate of which he takes a ponderous ledger from the case, and, with great
                  coolness, opens its large leaves. "Nicholas, I think his name is?" he ejaculates,
                  turning to Graspum, who, unconcernedly, has resumed his seat in the great
                  arm-chair.
               "Yes; but I suppose it must be Nicholas Grabguy, now," returns Graspum, bowing to
                  his book-keeper, and then turning to Mr. Grabguy.
               "One minute, if you please!" rejoins that gentlemen, as the sedate book-keeper
                  turns to his page of N's in the index. Mr. Grabguy will consider that very
                  important point for a few seconds.
               "Better drop the Marston, as things are. A good many high feeling connections of
                  that family remain; and to continue the name might be to give pain." This, Graspum
                  says, he only puts out as a suggestion.
               "Enter him as you say, gentlemen," interposes the clerk, who will mend his pen
                  while waiting their pleasure.
               Mr. Grabguy runs his right hand several times across his forehead, and after a
                  breathless pause, thinks it as well not to connect his distinguished name with
                  that of the nigger,—not just at this moment! Being his property, and associating
                  with his business and people, that will naturally follow. "Just enter him, and
                  make out the bill of sale describing him as the boy Nicholas," he adds.
               "Boy Nicholas!" reiterates the book-keeper, and straight-way enters his name,
                  amount fetched, to whom sold, and general description, on his files. In a few
                  minutes more—Graspum, in his chair of state, is regretting having sold so
                  quick,—Mr. Grabguy is handed his bill of sale, duly made out. At the same time,
                  that sedate official places the note for the amount into Graspum's hands. Graspum
                  examines it minutely, while Mr. Grabguy surveys the bill of sale. "Mr. Benson, my
                  clerk here, does these things up according to legal tenour; he, let me inform you,
                  was brought up at the law business, and was rather celebrated once; but the
                  profession won't pay a man of his ability," remarks Graspum, with an "all right!"
                  as he lays the note of hand down for Mr. Grabguy's signature.
               Mr. Benson smiles in reply, and adjusts the very stiffly starched corners of his
                  ponderous shirt collar, which he desires to keep well closed around his chin. "An
                  honourable man, that's true, sir, can't live honestly by the law, now-a-days," he
                  concludes, with measured sedateness. He will now get his bill-book, in which to make a record of
                  the piece of paper taken in exchange for the human 'imp.'
               "Clap your name across the face!" demands Graspum; and Grabguy seizes a pen, and
                  quickly consummates the bargain by inscribing his name, passing it to Mr. Benson,
                  and, in return, receiving the bill of sale, which he places in his breast pocket.
                  He will not trouble Mr. Benson any further; but, if he will supply a small piece
                  of paper, Mr. Grabguy will very kindly give the imp an order, and send him to his
                  workshop.
               "Will the gentleman be kind enough to help himself," says Mr. Benson, passing a
                  quire upon the table at which Mr. Grabguy sits.
               "I'll trim that chap into a first-rate mechanic," says Mr. Grabguy, as he
                  writes,—"I have bought the bearer, Nicholas, a promising chap, as you will see.
                  Take him into the shop and set him at something, if it is only turning the
                  grindstone; as I hav'nt made up my mind exactly about what branch to set him at.
                  He's got temper—you'll see that in a minute, and will want some breakin in, if I
                  don't calklate 'rong." This Mr. Grabguy envelopes, and directs to his master
                  mechanic. When all things are arranged to his satisfaction, Nicholas is again
                  brought into his presence, receives an admonition, is told what he may expect if
                  he displays his bad temper, is presented with the note, and despatched, with
                  sundry directions, to seek his way alone, to his late purchaser's workshop.
               "Come, boy! ain't you going to say 'good-by' to me 'afore you go? I hav'nt been a
                  bad master to you," says Graspum, putting out his hand.
               "Yes, master," mutters the child, turning about ere he reaches the door. He
                  advances towards Graspum, puts out his little hand; and in saying "good by,
                  master," there is so much childish simplicity in his manner that it touches the
                  tender chord embalmed within that iron frame. "Be a good little fellow!" he says,
                  his emotions rising. How strong are the workings of nature when brought in contact
                  with unnatural laws! The monster who has made the child wretched—who has for ever
                  blasted its hopes, shakes it by the hand, and says—"good by, little 'un!" as it
                  leaves the door to seek the home of a new purchaser. How strange the thoughts
                  invading that child's mind, as, a slave for life, it plods its way through the
                  busy thoroughfares! Forcibly the happy incidents of the past are recalled; they
                  are touching 
                     reclections
                     recollections
                  —sweets in the dark void of a slave's life; but to him no way-marks, to
                  measure the happy home embalmed therein, are left.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               WORKINGS OF THE SLAVE SYSTEM.
               DEMOCRACY! thy trumpet voice for liberty is ever ringing in our ears; but thy
                  strange workings defame thee. Thou art rampant in love of the "popular cause,"
                  crushing of that which secures liberty to all; and, whilst thou art great at
                  demolishing structures, building firm foundations seems beyond thee, for thereto
                  thou forgetteth to lay the cornerstone well on the solid rock of principle. And,
                  too, we love thee when thou art moved and governed by justice; we hate thee when
                  thou showest thyself a sycophant to make a mad mob serve a pestilential ambition.
                  Like a young giant thou graspest power; but, when in thy hands, it becomes a means
                  of serving the baser ends of factious demagogues. Hypocrite! With breath of poison
                  thou hast sung thy songs to liberty while making it a stepping-stone to injustice;
                  nor hast thou ever ceased to wage a tyrant's war against the rights of man. Thou
                  wearest false robes; thou blasphemest against heaven, that thy strength in wrong
                  may be secure—yea, we fear thy end is fast coming badly, for thou art the bastard
                  offspring of Republicanism so purely planted in our land. Clamour and the lash are
                  thy sceptres, and, like a viper seeking its prey, thou charmest with one and
                  goadeth men's souls with the other. Having worked thy way through our simple
                  narrative, show us what thou hast done. A father hast thou driven within the humid
                  wall of a prison, because he would repent and acknowledge his child. Bolts and
                  bars, in such cases, are democracy's safeguards; but thou hast bound with heavy
                  chains the being who would rise in the world, and go forth healing the sick and
                  preaching God's word. Even hast thou turned the hearts of men into stone, and made
                  them weep at the wrong thou gavest them power to inflict. That bond which God gave
                  to man, and charged him to keep sacred, thou hast sundered for the sake of
                  gold,—thereby levelling man with the brutes of the field. Thou hast sent two
                  beautiful children to linger in the
                     ROSEBROOK RETURNS WITH HARRY FROM MAJOR WILEY'S.
                     We left the stolen clergyman on the banks of the Mississippi, where, having
                        purchased his time of his owner, he is not only a very profitable
                        investment, but of great service to the neighboring plantations. Mr.
                        Rosebrook succeeded in purchasing Harry for fourteen hundred dollars, and
                        returned him to his plantation.
                  
                   wickedness of slavery,—to die stained
                  with its infamy! Thou hast robbed many a fair one of her virtue, stolen many a
                  charm; but thy foulest crime is, that thou drivest mothers and fathers from the
                  land of their birth to seek shelter on foreign soil. Would to God thou could'st
                  see thyself as thou art,—make thy teachings known in truth and justice,—cease to
                  mock thyself in the eyes of foreign tyrants, nor longer serve despots who would
                  make thee the shield of their ill-gotten power!
               Within those malarious prison walls, where fast decays a father who sought to save
                  from slavery's death the offspring he loved, will be found a poor, dejected negro,
                  sitting at the bedside of the oppressed man, administering to his wants. His
                  friendship is true unto death,—the oppressed man is his angel, he will serve him
                  at the sacrifice of life and liberty. He is your true republican, the friend of
                  the oppressed! Your lessons of democracy, so swelling, so boastfully arrayed for a
                  world's good, have no place in his soul,—goodness alone directs his examples of
                  republicanism. But we must not be over venturous in calling democracy to account,
                  lest we offend the gods of power and progress. We will, to save ourselves, return
                  to our narrative.
               Marston, yet in gaol, stubbornly refuses to take the benefit of the act,—commonly
                  called the poor debtor's act. He has a faithful friend in Daddy Bob, who has kept
                  his ownership concealed, and, with the assistance of Franconia, still relieves his
                  necessities. Rumour, however, strongly whispers that Colonel M'Carstrow is fast
                  gambling away his property, keeping the worst of company, and leading the life of
                  a debauchee,—which sorely grieves his noble-hearted wife. In fact, Mrs. Templeton,
                  who is chief gossip-monger of the city, declares that he is more than ruined, and
                  that his once beautiful wife must seek support at something.
               An honest jury of twelve free and enlightened citizens, before the honourable
                  court of Sessions, have declared Romescos honourably acquitted of the charge of
                  murder, the fatal blow being given in commendable self-defence.
               The reader will remember that in a former chapter we left the stolen clergyman (no
                  thanks to his white face and whiter necked brethren of the profession), on the
                  banks of the Mississippi, where, having purchased his time of his owner, he is not only a very profitable investment
                  to that gentleman, but of great service on the neighbouring plantations. Earnest
                  in doing good for his fellow bondmen, his efforts have enlisted for him the
                  sympathy of a generous-hearted young lady, the daughter of a neighbouring planter.
                  Many times had he recounted Mrs. Rosebrook's friendship for him to her, and by its
                  influence succeeded in opening the desired communication. Mrs. Rosebrook had
                  received and promptly answered all his fair friend's letters: the answers
                  contained good news for Harry; she knew him well, and would at once set about
                  inducing her husband to purchase him. But here again his profession interposed a
                  difficulty, inasmuch as its enhancing the value of the property to so great an
                  extent would make his master reluctant to part with him. However, as nothing could
                  be more expressive of domestic attachment than the manner in which the Rosebrooks
                  studied each other's feelings for the purpose of giving a more complete happiness,
                  our good lady had but to make known her wish, and the deacon stood ready to
                  execute it. In the present case he was but too glad of the opportunity of
                  gratifying her feelings, having had the purchase of a clergyman in contemplation
                  for some months back. He sought Harry out, and, after bartering (the planter
                  setting forth what a deal of money he had made by his clergyman) succeeded in
                  purchasing him for fourteen hundred dollars, the gentleman producing legalised
                  papers of his purchase, and giving the same. As for his running away, there is no
                  evidence to prove that; nor will Harry's pious word be taken in law to disclose
                  the kidnapping. M'Fadden is dead,—his estate has long since been administered
                  upon; Romescos murdered the proof, and swept away the dangerous contingency.
               Here, then, we find Harry—we must pass over the incidents of his return back in
                  the old district—about to administer the Gospel to the negroes on the Rosebrook
                  estates. He is the same good, generous-hearted black man he was years ago. But he
                  has worked hard, paid his master a deal of money for his time, and laid up but
                  little for himself. His clothes, too, are somewhat shabby, which, in the
                  estimation of the Rosebrook negroes—who are notoriously aristocratic in their
                  notions—is some detriment to his ministerial character. At the same time, they are
                  not quite sure that Harry Marston, as he must now be called, will preach to please
                  their peculiar mode of thinking. Master and missus have given them an interest in
                  their labour; and, having laid by a little money in missus's savings bank, they
                  are all looking forward to the time when they will have gained their freedom,
                  according to the promises held out. With these incitements of renewed energy they
                  work cheerfully, take a deep interest in the amount of crop produced, and have a
                  worthy regard for their own moral condition. And as they will now pay tribute for
                  the support of a minister of the Gospel, his respectability is a particular object
                  of their watchfulness. Thus, Harry's first appearance on the plantation, shabbily
                  dressed, is viewed with distrust. Uncle Bradshaw, and old Bill, the coachman, and
                  Aunt Sophy, and Sophy's two gals, and their husbands, are heard in serious
                  conclave to say that "It won't do!" A clergy gentleman, with no better clothes
                  than that newcomer wears, can't preach good and strong, nohow! Dad Daniel is heard
                  to say. Bradshaw shakes his white head, and says he's goin' to have a short talk
                  with master about it. Something must be done to reconcile the matter.
               Franconia and good Mrs. Rosebrook are not so exacting: the latter has received him
                  with a warm welcome, while the former, her heart bounding with joy on hearing of
                  his return, hastened into his presence, and with the affection of a child shook,
                  and shook, and shook his hand, as he fell on his knees and kissed hers. "Poor
                  Harry!" she says, "how I have longed to see you, and your poor wife and
                  children!"
               "Ah, Franconia, my young missus, it is for them my soul fears."
               "But we have found out where they are," she interrupts.
               "Where they are!" he reiterates.
               "Indeed we have!" Franconia makes a significant motion with her head.
               "It's true, Harry; and we'll see what can be done to get them back, one of these
                  days," adds Mrs. Rosebrook, her soul-glowing eyes affirming the truth of her
                  assertion. They have come out to spend the day at the plantation, and a happy day
                  it is for those whose hearts they gladden with their kind words. How happy would
                  be our south—how desolate the mania for abolition—if such a comity of good feeling
                  between master and slaves existed on every plantation tion! And there is nothing to hinder such happy
                  results of kindness.
               "When that day comes, missus,—that day my good old woman and me will be together
                  again,—how happy I shall be! Seems as if the regaining that one object would
                  complete my earthly desires. And my children,—how much I have felt for them, and
                  how little I have said!" returns Harry, as, seated in the veranda of the
                  plantation mansion, the two ladies near him are watching his rising emotions.
               "Never mind, Harry," rejoins Franconia; "it will all be well, one of these days.
                  You, as well as uncle, must bear with trouble. It is a world of trouble and
                  trial." She draws her chair nearer him, and listens to his narrative of being
                  carried off,—his endeavours to please his strange master down in Mississippi,—the
                  curious manner in which his name was changed,—the sum he was compelled to pay for
                  his time, and the good he effected while pursuing the object of his mission on the
                  neighbouring plantations. Hope carried him through every trial,—hope prepared his
                  heart for the time of his delivery,—hope filled his soul with gratitude to his
                  Maker, and hope, which ever held its light of freedom before him, inspired him
                  with that prayer he so thankfully bestowed on the head of his benefactor, whose
                  presence was as the light of love borne to him on angels' wings.
               Moved to tears by his recital of past struggles, and the expression of natural
                  goodness exhibited in the resignation with which he bore them, ever praying and
                  trusting to Him who guides our course in life, Franconia in turn commenced
                  relating the misfortunes that had befallen her uncle. She tells him how her uncle
                  has been reduced to poverty through Lorenzo's folly, and Graspum, the negro
                  dealer's undiscoverable mode of ensnaring the unwary. He has been importuned,
                  harassed, subjected to every degradation and shame, scouted by society for
                  attempting to save those beautiful children, Annette and Nicholas, from the snares
                  of slavery. And he now welters in a debtor's prison, with few save his old
                  faithful Daddy Bob for friends.
               "Master, and my old companion, Daddy Bob!" exclaims Harry, interrupting her at the
                  moment.
               "Yes: Daddy takes care of him in his prison cell."
               "How often old Bob's expressive face has looked upon me in my dreams! how often he
                  has occupied my thoughts by day!"
               "Goodness belongs to him by nature."
               "And master is in prison; but Daddy is still his friend and faithful! Well, my
                  heart sorrows for master: I know his proud heart bleeds under the burden," he
                  says, shaking his head sorrowfully. There is more sympathy concealed beneath that
                  black exterior than words can express. He will go and see master; he will comfort
                  him within his prison walls; he will rejoin Daddy Bob, and be master's friend once
                  more. Mrs. Rosebrook, he is sure, will grant him any privilege in her power. That
                  good lady is forthwith solicited, and grants Harry permission to go into the city
                  any day it suits his convenience—except Sunday, when his services are required for
                  the good of the people on the plantation. Harry is delighted with this token of
                  her goodness, and appoints a day when he will meet Miss Franconia,—as he yet calls
                  her,—and go see old master and Daddy. How glowing is that honest heart, as it
                  warms with ecstasy at the thought of seeing "old master," even though he be
                  degraded within prison walls!
               While this conversation is going on in the veranda, sundry aged members of negro
                  families—aunties and mammies—are passing backwards and forwards in front of the
                  house, casting curious glances at the affection exhibited for the new preacher by
                  "Miss Franconia." The effect is a sort of reconciliation of the highly
                  aristocratic objections they at first interposed against his reception. "Mus' be
                  somebody bigger dan common nigger preacher; wudn't cotch Miss Frankone spoken wid
                  'um if 'um warn't," says Dad Timothy's Jane, who is Uncle Absalom's wife, and, in
                  addition to having six coal-black children, as fat and sleek as beavers, is the
                  wise woman of the cabins, around whom all the old veteran mammies gather for
                  explanations upon most important subjects. In this instance she is surrounded by
                  six or seven grave worthies, whose comical faces add great piquancy to the
                  conclave. Grandmumma Dorothy, who declares that she is grandmother to she don't
                  know how much little growing-up property, will venture every grey hair in her
                  head—which is as white as the snows of Nova Scotia—that he knows a deal o' things
                  about the gospel, or he wouldn't have missus for such a close acquaintance ance. "But his shirt ain't just da'h
                  fashon fo'h a 'spectable minister ob de gospel," she concludes, with profound
                  wisdom evinced in her measured nod.
               Aunt Betsy, than whose face none is blacker, or more comically moulded, will say
                  her word; but she is very profound withal. "Reckon how tain't de clo' what make e'
                  de preacher tink good" (Aunty's lip hangs seriously low the while). "Lef missus
                  send some calico fum town, and dis old woman son fix 'um into shirt fo'h him," she
                  says, with great assurance of her sincerity.
               Harry—Mister Harry, as he is to be called by the people—finds himself comfortably
                  at home; the only drawback, if such it may be called, existing in the
                  unwillingness exhibited on the part of one of the overseers to his being provided
                  with apartments in the basement of the house instead of one of the cabins. This,
                  however, is, by a few conciliatory words from Mrs. Rosebrook, settled to the
                  satisfaction of all. Harry has supper provided for him in one of the little rooms
                  downstairs, which he is to make his Study, and into which he retires for the
                  night.
               When daylight has departed, and the very air seems hanging in stillness over the
                  plantation, a great whispering is heard in Dad Daniel's cabin—the head quarters,
                  where grave matters of state, or questions affecting the moral or physical
                  interests of the plantation, are discussed, and Dad Daniel's opinion held as most
                  learned—the importance of which over the other cabins is denoted by three windows,
                  one just above the door being usually filled with moss or an old black hat.
                  Singular enough, on approaching the cabin it is discovered that Daniel has
                  convoked a senate of his sable brethren, to whom he is proposing a measure of
                  great importance. "Da'h new precher, gemen! is one ob yer own colur—no more Buckra
                  what on'e gib dat one sarmon,—tank God fo'h dat!—and dat colour geman, my
                  children, ye must look up to fo'h de word from de good book. Now, my bredren, 'tis
                  posin' on ye dat ye make dat geman 'spectable. I poses den, dat we, bredren, puts
                  in a mite apiece, and gib dat ar' geman new suit ob fus' bes'clof', so 'e preach
                  fresh and clean," Dad Daniel is heard to say. And this proposition is carried out
                  on the following morning, when Daddy Daniel—his white wool so cleanly washed, and
                  his face glowing with great good-nature—accompanied by a conclave of his sable
                  companions nions, presents himself in the front veranda, and demands to see
                  "missus." That all-conciliating personage is ever ready to receive deputations,
                  and on making her appearance, and receiving the usual salutations from her people,
                  receives from the hand of that venerable prime minister, Daddy Daniel, a purse
                  containing twelve dollars and fifty cents. It is the amount of a voluntary
                  contribution—a gift for the new preacher. "Missus" is requested, after adding her
                  portion, to expend it in a suit of best black for the newcomer, whom they would
                  like to see, and say "how de, to."
               Missus receives this noble expression of their gratitude with thanks and kind
                  words. Harry is summoned to the veranda, where, on making his appearance, he is
                  introduced to Dad Daniel, who, in return, escorts him down on the plazza where
                  numbers of the people have assembled to receive him. Here, with wondrous ceremony,
                  Dad Daniel doing the polite rather strong, he is introduced to all the important
                  people of the plantation. And such a shaking of hands, earnest congratulations,
                  happy "how des," bows, and joyous laughs, as follow, place the scene so expressive
                  of happiness beyond the power of pen to describe. Then he is led away, followed by
                  a train of curious faces, to see Dad Daniel's neatly-arranged cabin; after which
                  he will see plantation church, and successively the people's cabins. To-morrow
                  evening, at early dusk, it is said, according to invitation and arrangement, he
                  will sup on the green with his sable brethren, old and young, and spice up the
                  evening's entertainment with an exhortation; Dad Daniel, as is his custom,
                  performing the duties of deacon.
               Let us pass over this scene, and—Harry having ingratiated himself with the
                  plantation people, who are ready to give him their distinguished consideration—ask
                  the reader to follow us through the description of another, which took place a few
                  days after.
               Our clergyman has delivered to his sable flock his first sermon, which Dad Daniel
                  and his compatriots pronounce great and good,—just what a sermon should be. Such
                  pathos they never heard before; the enthusiasm and fervency with which it was
                  delivered inspires delight; they want no more earnestness of soul than the
                  fervency with which his gesticulations accompanied the words; and now he has obtained a furlough that he may
                  go into the city and console his old master. A thrill of commiseration seizes him
                  as he contemplates his once joyous master now in prison; but, misgivings being
                  useless, onward he goes. And he will see old Bob, recall the happy incidents of
                  the past, when time went smoothly on.
               He reaches the city, having tarried a while at missus's villa, and seeks
                  M'Carstrow's residence, at the door of which he is met by Franconia, who receives
                  him gratefully, and orders a servant to show him into the recess of the hall,
                  where he will wait until such time as she is ready to accompany him to the county
                  prison. M'Carstrow has recently removed into plainer tenements: some whisper that
                  necessity compelled it, and that the "large shot" gamblers have shorn him down to
                  the lowest imaginable scale of living. Be this as it may, certain it is that he
                  has not looked within the doors of his own house for more than a week: report says
                  he is enjoying himself in a fashionable house, to the inmates of which he is
                  familiarly known. He certainly leads his beautiful wife anything but a pleasant or
                  happy life. Soon Franconia is ready, and onward wending her way for the gaol,
                  closely followed by Harry. She would have no objection to his walking by her side,
                  but custom (intolerant interposer) will not permit it. They pass through busy
                  thoroughfares and narrow streets into the suburbs, and have reached the prison
                  outer gate, on the right hand of which, and just above a brass knob, are the
                  significant words, "Ring the bell."
               "What a place to put master in!" says Harry, in a half whisper, turning to
                  Franconia, as he pulls the brass handle and listens for the dull tinkling of the
                  bell within. He starts at the muffled summons, and sighs as he hears the heavy
                  tread of the officer, advancing through the corridor to challenge his presence.
                  The man advances, and has reached the inner iron gate, situated in a narrow,
                  vaulted arch in the main building. A clanking and clicking sound is heard, and the
                  iron door swings back: a thick-set man, with features of iron, advances to the
                  stoop, down the steps, and to the gate. "What's here now?" he growls, rather than
                  speaks, looking sternly at the coloured man, as he thrusts his left hand deep into
                  his side pocket, while holding the key of the inner door in his right.
               "Visitor," returns Franconia, modestly.
               "Who does the nigger want to see?" he enquires, with pertinacity in keeping with
                  his profession.
               "His old master!" is the quick reply.
               "You both? I guess I know what it is,—you want to see Marston: he used to be a
                  rice-planter, but's now in the debtor's ward for a swimming lot of debts. Well,
                  s'pose I must let you in: got a lot o' things, I s'pose?" he says, looking
                  wickedly through the bars as he springs the bolts, and swings back the gate. "I
                  beg yer pardon a dozen times! but I didn't recognise ye on the outer side,"
                  continues the official, becoming suddenly servile. He makes a low bow as he
                  recognises Franconia—motions his hand for them to walk ahead. They reach the steps
                  leading to the inner gate, and ascending, soon are in the vaulted passage.
               If they will allow him, the polite official will unlock the grated door. Stepping
                  before Franconia, who, as the clanking of the locks grate on her ear, is seized
                  with sensations she cannot describe, he inserts the heavy key. She turns to Harry,
                  her face pallid as marble, and lays her tremulous hand on his arm, as if to
                  relieve the nervousness with which she is seized. Click! click! sounds forth:
                  again the door creaks on its hinges, and they are in the confines of the prison. A
                  narrow vaulted arch, its stone walls moistened with pestilential malaria, leads
                  into a small vestibule, on the right hand of which stretched a narrow aisle lined
                  on both sides with cells. Damp and pestiferous, a hollow gloominess seems to
                  pervade the place, as if it were a pest-house for torturing the living. Even the
                  air breathes of disease,—a stench, as of dead men buried in its vaults, darts its
                  poison deep into the system. It is this, coupled with the mind's discontent, that
                  commits its ravages upon the poor prisoner,—that sends him pale and haggard to a
                  soon-forgotten grave.
               "Last door on the right,—you know, mum," says the official: "boy will follow,
                  lightly: whist! whist!"
               "I know, to my sorrow," is her reply, delivered in a whisper. Ah! her emotions are
                  too tender for prison walls; they are yielding tears from the fountain of her very
                  soul.
               "He's sick: walk softly, and don't think of the prisoners. Knock at the door afore
                  enterin'," says a staid-looking looking
                  warden, emerging from a small door on the left hand of the vestibule.
               "Zist! zist!" returns the other, pointing with the forefinger of his right hand
                  down the aisle, and, placing his left, gently, on Franconia's shoulder, motioning
                  her to move on.
               Slowly, her handkerchief to her face, she obeys the sign, and is moving down the
                  corridor, now encountering anxious eyes peering through the narrow grating of huge
                  black doors. And then a faint, dolorous sound strikes on their listening ears.
                  They pause for a moment,—listen again! It becomes clearer and clearer; and they
                  advance with anxious curiosity. "It's Daddy Bob's voice," whispers Harry; "but how
                  distant it sounds!
               "Even that murmurs in his confinement," returns Franconia.
               "How, like a thing of life, it recalls the past—the past of happiness!" says
                  Harry, as they reach the cell door, and, tremulously, hesitate for a few
                  moments.
               "Listen again!" continues Harry. The sound having ceased a moment or two, again
                  commences, and the word 
                     
                        "There's a place for old mas'r yet,
                        And de Lord will see him dar,"
                     
                   are distinctly audible. "How the old man battles for his good master!"
                  returns Harry, as Franconia taps gently on the door. The wooden trap over the
                  grating is closed; bolts hang carelessly from their staples; and yet, though the
                  door is secured with a hook on the inside, disease and death breathe their morbid
                  fumes through the scarce perceptible crevices. A whispering—"Come in!" is heard in
                  reply to the tap upon the door, which slowly opens, and the face of old Bob,
                  bathed in grief, protrudes round the frame. "Oh, missus—missus—missus—God give
                  good missus spirit!" he exclaims, seizing Franconia fervently by the hand, and
                  looking in her face imploringly. A fœtid stench pervaded the atmosphere of the
                  gloomy cell; it is death spreading its humid malaria. "Good old master is
                  g—g—g—gone!" mutters the negro, in half-choked accents.
               With a wild shriek, the noble woman rushes to the side of his prison cot, seizes
                  his blanched hand that hangs carelessly over the iron frame, grasps his head
                  frantically, and draws it to her bosom, as the last gurgle of life bids adieu to
                  the prostrate body. He is dead!
               The old slave has watched over him, shared his sorrows and his crust, has sung a
                  last song to his departing spirit. How truthful was that picture of the dying
                  master and his slave! The old man, struggling against the infirmities of age, had
                  escaped the hands of the man-seller, served his master with but one object—his
                  soul's love—and relieved his necessities, until death, ending his troubles, left
                  no more to relieve. Now, distracted between joy at meeting Harry, and sorrow for
                  the death of master, the poor old man is lost in the confusion of his feelings.
                  After saluting Franconia, he turned to Harry, threw his arms around his neck,
                  buried his head in his bosom, and wept like a child. "Home—home again,—my Harry!
                  but too late to see mas'r," he says, as the fountains of his soul give out their
                  streams.
               "We must all go where master has gone," returns Harry, as he, more calm, fondles
                  the old man, and endeavours to reconcile his feelings. "Sit there, my old
                  friend—sit there; and remember that God called master away. I must go to his
                  bed-side," whispers Harry, seating the old man on a block of wood near the foot of
                  the cot, where he pours forth the earnest of his grief.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               AN ITEM IN THE COMMON CALENDAR.
               THUS painfully has Marston paid his debtors. Around his lifeless body may spring
                  to life those sympathies which were dead while he lived; but deplorings fall
                  useless on dead men. There is one consideration, however, which must always be
                  taken into account; it is, that while sympathy for the living may cost something,
                  sympathy for the dead is cheap indeed, and always to be had. How simply plain is
                  the dead man's cell! In this humid space, ten by sixteen feet, and arched
                  over-head, is a bucket of water, with a tin cup at the side, a prison tub in one
                  corner, two wooden chairs, a little deal stand, (off which the prisoner ate his
                  meals), and his trunk of clothing. The sheriff, insisting that it was his rule to
                  make no distinction of persons, allowed prison cot and prison matress to which, by
                  the kind permission of the warden, Franconia added sheets and a coverlit. Upon
                  this, in a corner at the right, and opposite a spacious fire-place, in which are
                  two bricks supporting a small iron kettle, lies the once opulent planter,—now with
                  eyes glassy and discoloured, a ghastly corpse. His house once was famous for its
                  princely hospitality,—the prison cot is not now his bequest: but it is all the
                  world has left him on which to yield up his life. "Oh, uncle! uncle! uncle!"
                  exclaims Franconia, who has been bathing his contorted face with her tears, "would
                  that God had taken me too—buried our troubles in one grave! There is no trouble in
                  that world to which he has gone: joy, virtue, and peace, reign triumphant there,"
                  she speaks, sighing, as she raises her bosom from off the dead man. Harry has
                  touched her on the shoulder with his left hand, and is holding the dead man's with
                  his right: he seems in deep contemplation. His mind is absorbed in the melancholy
                  scene; but, though his affection is deep, he has no tears to shed at this moment.
                  No; he will draw a chair for Franconia, and seat her near the head of the cot, for
                  the fountains of her grief have overflown. Discoloured and contorted, what a
                  ghastly picture the dead man's face presents! Glassy, and with vacant glare, those
                  eyes, strange in death, seem wildly staring upward from earth. How unnatural those
                  sunken cheeks—those lips wet with the excrement of black vomit—that throat
                  reddened with the pestilential poison! "Call a warden, Daddy!" says Harry; "he has
                  died of black vomit, I think." And he lays the dead body square upon the cot,
                  turns the sheets from off the shoulders, unbuttons the collar of its shirt. "How
                  changed! I never would have known master; but I can see something of him left
                  yet." Harry remains some minutes looking upon the face of the departed, as if
                  tracing some long lost feature. And then he takes his hands—it's master's hand, he
                  says—and places them gently to his sides, closes his glassy eyes, wipes his mouth
                  and nostrils, puts his ear to the dead man's mouth, as if doubting the
                  all-slayer's possession of the body, and with his right hand parts the matted hair
                  from off the cold brow. What a step between the cares of the world and the peace
                  of death! Harry smooths, and smooths, and smooths his forehead with his hand;
                  until at length his feelings get the better of his resolution; he will wipe the
                  dewy tears from his eyes. "Don't weep, Miss Franconia,—don't weep! master is happy
                  with Jesus,—happier than all the plantations and slaves of the world could make
                  him" he says, turning to her as she sits weeping, her elbow resting on the cot,
                  and her face buried in her handkerchief.
               "Bad job this here!" exclaims the warden, as he comes lumbering into the cell, his
                  face flushed with anxiety. "This yaller-fever beats everything: but he hasn't been
                  well for some time," he continues, advancing to the bed-side, looking on the
                  deceased for a few minutes, and then, as if it were a part of his profession to
                  look on dead men, says: "How strange to die out so soon!"
               "He was a good master," rejoins Harry.
               "He wasn't your master—Was he?" enquires the gaoler, in gruff accents.
               "Once he was."
               "But, did you see him die, boy?"
               "Thank God, I did not."
               
               "And this stupid old nigger hadn't sense to call me!" (he turns threateningly to
                  Bob): "Well,—must 'a drop'd off like the snuff of a tallow candle!"
               Daddy knew master was a poor man now;—calling would have availed nothing; gaolers
                  are bad friends of poverty.
               "Could you not have sent for me, good man?" enquires Franconia, her weeping eyes
                  turning upon the warden, who says, by way of answering her question, "We must have
                  him out o' here."
               "I said mas'r was sicker den ye s'posed, yesterday; nor ye didn't notice 'um!"
                  interposes Bob, giving a significant look at the warden, and again at
                  Franconia.
               "What a shame, in this our land of boasted hospitality! He died neglected in a
                  prison cell!"
               "Truth is, ma'am," interrupts the warden, who, suddenly becoming conscious that it
                  is polite to be courteous to ladies wherever they may be met, uncovers, and holds
                  his hat in his hand,—"we are sorely tried with black-vomit cases; no provision is
                  made for them, and they die on our hands afore we know it, just like sheep with
                  the rot. It gives us a great deal of trouble;—you may depend it does, ma'am; and
                  not a cent extra pay do we get for it. For my own part, I've become quite at home
                  to dead men and prisoners. My name is—you have no doubt heard of me before—John
                  Lafayette Flewellen: my situation was once, madam, that of a distinguished road
                  contractor; and then they run me for the democratic senator from our district, and
                  I lost all my money without getting the office—and here I am now, pestered with
                  sick men and dead prisoners. And the very worst is that ye can't please nobody;
                  but if anything is wanted, ma'am, just call for me: John Lafayette Flewellen's my
                  name, ma'am." The man of nerve, with curious indifference, is about to turn
                  away,—to leave the mourning party to themselves, merely remarking, as he takes his
                  hand from that of the corpse, that his limbs are becoming fridgid,
                  fast.
               "Stay—a—moment,—warden," says Franconia, sobbing: "When was he seized with the
                  fever?"
               "Day afore yesterday, ma'am; but he didn't complain until yesterday. That he was
                  in a dangerous way I'm sure I'd no idea." The warden shrugs his shoulders, and
                  spreads his hands. "My eyes, ma'am, but he drank strongly of late! Perhaps that,
                  combined with the fever, helped slide him off?"
               "Ah! yes,—it was something else—it was grief! His troubles were his destroyer."
                  She wipes her eyes, and, with a look of commiseration, turns from the man whose
                  business it is to look coldly upon unfortunate dead men.
               "There was the things you sent him, ma'am; and he got his gaol allowance, and some
                  gruel. The law wouldn't allow us to do more for him,—no, it wouldn't!" He shakes
                  his head in confirmation.
               "I wanted old mas'r to let 'um bring doctor; but he said no! he would meet de
                  doctor what cured all diseases in another world," interrupts old Bob, as he draws
                  his seat close to the foot of the cot, and, with his shining face of grief, gazes
                  on the pale features of his beloved master.
               "Let him lie as he is, till the coroner comes," says the warden, retiring slowly,
                  and drawing the heavy door after him.
               The humble picture was no less an expression of goodness, than proof of the cruel
                  severity of the law. The news of death soon brought curious debtors into the long
                  aisle, while sorrow and sympathy might be read on every face. But he was gone, and
                  with him his wants and grievances. A physician was called in, but he could not
                  recall life, and, after making a few very learned and unintelligible remarks on
                  the appearance of the body, took his departure, saying that they must not
                  grieve—that it was the way all flesh would go. "He, no doubt, died of the black
                  vomit, hastened by the want of care," he concluded, as he left the cell.
               "Want of care!" rejoins Franconia, again giving vent to her feelings. How deeply
                  did the arrow dart into the recesses of her already wounded heart!
               Mr. Moon, the methodical coroner, was not long repairing to the spot. He felt, and
                  felt, and felt the dead man's limbs, asked a few questions, bared the cold breast,
                  ordered the body to be straightened a little, viewed it from several angles, and
                  said an inquest was unnecessary. It would reveal no new facts, and, as so many
                  were dying of the same disease, could give no more relief to his friends.
                  Concerning his death, no one could doubt the cause being black vomit. With a frigid
                  attempt at consolation for Franconia, he will withdraw. He has not been long gone,
                  when the warden, a sheet over his left arm, again makes his appearance; he passes
                  the sheet to Harry, with a request that he will wind the dead debtor up in it.
               Franconia, sobbing, rises from her seat, opens a window at the head of the cot
                  (the dead will not escape through the iron grating), and paces the floor, while
                  Harry and Daddy sponge the body, lay it carefully down, and fold it in the
                  winding-sheet. "Poor master,—God has taken him; but how I shall miss him! I've
                  spent happy days wid 'im in dis place, I have!" says Bob, as they lay his head on
                  the hard pillow. He gazes upon him with affection,—and says "Mas'r 'll want no
                  more clothes."
               And now night is fast drawing its dark mantle over the scene,—the refulgent
                  shadows of the setting sun play through the grated window into the gloomy cell:
                  how like a spirit of goodness sent from on high to lighten the sorrows of the
                  downcast, seems the light. A faint ray plays its soft tints on that face now
                  pallid in death; how it inspires our thoughts of heaven! Franconia watches, and
                  watches, as fainter and fainter it fades away, like an angel sent for the spirit
                  taking its departure. "Farewell!" she whispers, as darkness shuts out the last
                  mellow glimmer: "Come sombre night, and spread thy stillness!"
               The warden, moved by the spark of generosity his soul possesses, has brought some
                  cologne, and silently places it in Franconia's hands. She advances to the cot,
                  seats herself near the head of her dear departed, encircles his head with her left
                  arm, and with her white 'kerchief bathes his face with the liquid, Harry holding
                  the vessel in his hand, at her request. A candle sheds its sickly light upon the
                  humid walls; faintly it discloses the face of Daddy Bob, immersed in tears,
                  watching intently over the foot of the cot. "Missus Frankone is alw's kind to
                  mas'r!"
               "I loved uncle because his heart was good," returns Franconia.
               "'Tis dat, missus. How kindly old mas'r, long time ago, used to say, 'Good
                  mornin', Bob! Daddy, mas'r lubs you!"
               How firmly the happy recollection of these kind words is sealed in the old man's
                  memory.
               
                  
                     MARSTON DIES IN THE DEBTOR'S CELL. "'Farewell!' she whispers, as darkness
                        shuts out the last mellow glimmer."
                  
               
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVIII.
               IN WHICH REGRETS ARE SHOWN OF LITTLE WORTH.
               THE reader may remember, that we, in the early part of our narrative, made some
                  slight mention of the Rovero family, of which Franconia and Lorenzo were the only
                  surviving children. They, too, had been distinguished as belonging to a class of
                  opulent planters; but, having been reduced to poverty by the same nefarious
                  process through which we have traced Marston's decline, and which we shall more
                  fully disclose in the sequel, had gathered together the remnants of a once
                  extensive property, and with the proceeds migrated to a western province of
                  Mexico, where, for many years, though not with much success, Rovero pursued a
                  mining speculation. They lived in a humble manner; Mrs. Rovero, Marston's
                  sister—and of whom we have a type in the character of her daughter,
                  Franconia—discarded all unnecessary appurtenances of living, and looked forward to
                  the time when they would be enabled to retrieve their fortunes and return to their
                  native district to spend the future of their days on the old homestead. More than
                  four years, however, had passed since any tidings had been received of them by
                  Franconia; and it was strongly surmised that they had fallen victims to the savage
                  incursions of marauding parties, who were at that time devastating the country,
                  and scattering its defenceless inhabitants homeless over the western shores of
                  central America. So strong had this impression found place in Franconia's mind
                  that she had given up all hopes of again meeting them. As for M'Carstrow's
                  friends, they had never taken any interest in her welfare, viewing her marriage
                  with the distinguished colonel as a mere catch on the part of her parents, whose
                  only motive was to secure themselves the protection of a name, and, perhaps, the
                  means of sustaining themselves above the rank disclosure of their real poverty. To
                  keep "above board" is everything in the south; and the family not distinguished soon finds itself
                  well nigh extinguished. Hence that ever tenacious clinging to pretensions,
                  sounding of important names, and maintenance of absurd fallacies,—all having for
                  their end the drawing a curtain over that real state of poverty there existing.
                  Indeed, it was no secret that even the M'Carstrow family (counting itself among
                  the very few really distinguished families of the state, and notorious for the
                  contempt in which they affected to hold all common people), had mortgaged their
                  plantation and all its negroes for much more than their worth in ordinary times.
                  As for tradesmen's bills, there were any quantity outstanding, without the shadow
                  of a prospect of their being paid, notwithstanding importuners had frequently
                  intimated that a place called the gaol was not far distant, and that the squire's
                  office was within a stone's throw of "the corner." Colonel M'Carstrow, reports
                  say, had some years ago got a deal of money by an unexplainable hocus
                     pocus, but it was well nigh gone in gambling, and now he was keeping
                  brothel society and rioting away his life faster than the race-horses he had
                  formerly kept on the course could run.
               Hospitality hides itself when friends are needy; and it will be seen here that
                  Franconia had few friends—we mean friends in need. The Rosebrook family formed an
                  exception. The good deacon, and his ever generous lady, had remained Franconia's
                  firmest friends; but so large and complicated were the demands against Marston,
                  and so gross the charges of dishonour—suspicion said he fraudulently made over his
                  property to Graspum—that they dared not interpose for his relief; nor would
                  Marston himself have permitted it. The question now was, what was to be done with
                  the dead body?
               We left Franconia bathing its face, and smoothing the hair across its temples with
                  her hand. She cannot bury the body from her own home:—no! M'Carstow will not
                  permit that. She cannot consign it to the commissioners for the better regulation
                  of the "poor house,"—her feelings repulse the thought. One thought lightens her
                  cares; she will straightway proceed to Mrs. Rosebrook's villa,—she will herself be
                  the bearer of the mournful intelligence; while Harry will watch over the remains
                  of the departed, until Daddy, who must be her guide through the city, shall
                  return. "I will go to prepare the next resting-place for uncle," says Franconia,
                  as if nerving herself to carry out the resolution.
               "With your permission, missus," returns Harry, touching her on the arm, and
                  pointing through the grated window into the gloomy yard. "Years since—before I
                  passed through a tribulation worse than death—when we were going to be sold in the
                  market, I called my brothers and sisters of the plantation together, and in that
                  yard invoked heaven to be merciful to its fallen. I was sold on that day; but
                  heaven has been merciful to me; heaven has guided me through many weary
                  pilgrimages, and brought me here to-night; and its protecting hand will yet
                  restore me my wife and little ones. Let us pray to-night; let us be grateful to
                  Him who seeth the fallen in his tribulation, but prepareth a place for him in a
                  better world. Let us pray and hope," he continued: and they knelt at the side of
                  the humble cot on which lay the departed, while he devoutly and fervently invoked
                  the Giver of all Good to forgive the oppressor, to guide the oppressed, to make
                  man feel there is a world beyond this, to strengthen the resolution of that fair
                  one who is thus sorely afflicted, to give the old man who weeps at the feet of the
                  departed new hope for the world to come,—and to receive that warm spirit which has
                  just left the cold body into his realms of bliss.
               What of roughness there was in his manner is softened by simplicity and
                  truthfulness. The roughest lips may breathe the purest prayer. At the conclusion,
                  Franconia and Daddy leave for Mrs. Rosebrook's villa, while Harry, remaining to
                  watch over the remains, draws his chair to the stand, and reads by the murky
                  light.
               "I won't be long; take care of old mas'r," says Daddy, as he leaves the cell,
                  solicitously looking back into the cavern-like place.
               It is past ten when they reach the house of Mrs. Rosebrook, the inmates of which
                  have retired, and are sleeping. Everything is quiet in and about the enclosure;
                  the luxuriant foliage bespreading a lawn extending far away to the westward, seems
                  refreshing itself with dew that sparkles beneath the starlight heavens, now arched
                  like a crystal mist hung with diamond lights. The distant watchdog's bark
                  re-echoes faintly over the broad lagoon, to the east; a cricket's chirrup sounds
                  beneath the woodbine arbour; a moody
                  guardsman, mounted on his lean steed, and armed for danger, paces his slow way
                  along: he it is that breaks the stillness while guarding the fears of a watchful
                  community, who know liberty, but crush with steel the love thereof.
               A rap soon brings to the door the trim figure of a mulatto servant. He conveys the
                  name of the visitor to his "missus," who, surprised at the untimely hour Franconia
                  seeks her, loses no time in reaching the ante-room, into which she has been
                  conducted.
               Daddy has taken his seat in the hall, and recognises "missus" as she approaches;
                  but as she puts out her hand to salute him, she recognises trouble seated on his
                  countenance. "Young missus in da'h," he says, pointing to the ante-room while
                  rubbing his eyes.
               "But you must tell me what trouble has befallen you," she returns, as quickly, in
                  her dishabille, she drops his hand and starts back.
               "Missus know 'um all,—missus da'h." Again he points, and she hastens into the
                  ante-room, when, grasping Franconia by the hand, she stares at her with breathless
                  anxiety expressed in her face. A pause ensues in which both seem bewildered. At
                  length Franconia breaks the silence. "Uncle is gone!" she exclaims, following the
                  words with a flow of tears.
               "Gone!" reiterates the generous-hearted woman, encircling Franconia's neck with
                  her left arm, and drawing her fondly to her bosom.
               "Yes,—dead!" she continues, sobbing audibly. There is something touching in the
                  words,—something which recalls the dearest associations of the past, and touches
                  the fountains of the heart. It is the soft tone in which they are uttered,—it
                  gives new life to old images. So forcibly are they called up, that the good woman
                  has no power to resist her violent emotions: gently she guides Franconia to the
                  sofa, seats her upon its soft cushion, and attempts to console her wrecked
                  spirit.
               The men-servants are called up,—told to be prepared for orders. One of them
                  recognises Daddy, and, inviting him into the pantry, would give him food, Trouble
                  has wasted the old man's appetite; he thinks of master, but has no will to eat.
                  No; he will see missus, and proceed back to the prison, there join Harry, and
                  watch over all that is mortal of master. He thanks Abraham for what he gave him,
                  declines the coat he would kindly lend him to keep out the chill, seeks the
                  presence of his mistress (she has become more reconciled), says, "God bless 'um!"
                  bids her good night, and sallies forth.
               Mrs. Rosebrook listens to the recital of the melancholy scene with astonishment
                  and awe. "How death grapples for us!" she exclaims, her soft, soul-beaming eyes
                  glaring with surprise. "How it cuts its way with edge unseen. Be calm, be calm,
                  Franconia; you have nobly done your part,—nobly! Whatever the pecuniary
                  misfortunes,—whatever the secret cause of his downfall, you have played the woman
                  to the very end. You have illustrated the purest of true affection; would it had
                  repaid you better. Before daylight—negroes are, in consequence of their
                  superstition, unwilling to remove the dead at midnight—I will have the body
                  removed here,—buried from my house." The good woman did not disclose to Franconia
                  that her husband was from home, making an effort to purchase Harry's wife and
                  children from their present owner. But she will do all she can,—the best can do no
                  more.
               At the gaol a different scene is presented. Harry, alone with the dead man, waits
                  Daddy's return. Each tap of the bell awakes a new hope, soon to be disappointed.
                  The clock strikes eleven: no Daddy returns. The gates are shut: Harry must wile
                  away the night, in this tomb-like abode, with the dead. What stillness pervades
                  the cell; how mournfully calm in death sleeps the departed! The watcher has read
                  himself to sleep; his taper, like life on its way, has nearly shed out its pale
                  light; the hot breath of summer breathes balmy through the lattice bars;
                  mosquitoes sing their torturous tunes while seeking for the dead man's blood;
                  lizards, with diamond eyes, crawl upon the wall, waiting their ration: but death,
                  less inexorable than creditors, sits pale king over all. The palace and the cell
                  are alike to him; the sharp edge of his unseen sword spares neither the king in
                  his purple robe, nor the starving beggar who seeks a crust at his palace gate,—of
                  all places the worst.
               As morning dawns, and soft fleeting clouds tinge the heavens with light, four
                  negroes may be seen sitting at the prison gate, a litter by their side, now and
                  then casting silent glances upward, as if contemplating the sombre wall that frowns above their heads,
                  enclosing the prison. The guard, armed to the teeth, have passed and repassed
                  them, challenged and received their answer, and as often examined their passes.
                  They—the negroes—have come for a dead man. Guardmen get no fees of dead men,—the
                  law has no more demands to serve: they wish the boys much joy with their booty,
                  and pass on.
               Six o'clock arrives; the first bell rings; locks, bolts, and bars clank in
                  ungrateful medley; rumbling voices are heard within the hollow-sounding aisles;
                  whispers from above chime ominously with the dull shuffle rumbling from below.
                  'Seven more cases,—how it rages!" grumbles a monotonous voice, and the gate opens
                  at the warden's touch. "Who's here?" he demands, with stern countenance unchanged,
                  as he shrugs his formidable shoulders. "I see, (he continues, quickly), you have
                  come for the dead debtor. Glad of it, my good fellow; this is the place to make
                  dead men of debtors. Brought an order, I s'pose?" Saying "follow me," he turns
                  about, hastens to the vestibule, receives the order from the hand of Duncan, the
                  chief negro, reads it with grave attention, supposes it is all straight, and is
                  about to show him the cell where the body lays, and which he is only too glad to
                  release. "Hold a moment!" Mr. Winterflint—such is his name—says. Heaven knows he
                  wants to get rid of the dead debtor; but the laws are so curious, creditors are so
                  obdurate, and sheriffs have such a crooked way of doing straight things, that he
                  is in the very bad position of not knowing what to do. Some document from the
                  sheriff may be necessary; perhaps the creditors must agree to the compromise. He
                  forgets that inexorable Death, as he is vulgarly styled, has forced a compromise:
                  creditors must now credit "by decease." Upon this point, however, he
                  must be satisfied by his superior. He now wishes Mr. Brien Moon would evince more
                  exactness in holding inquests, and less anxiety for the fees. Mr. Winterflint
                  depends not on his own decisions, where the laws relating to debtors are so
                  absurdly mystical. "Rest here, boy," he says; "I won't be a minute or two,—must do
                  the thing straight." He seeks the presence of that extremely high functionary, the
                  gaoler (high indeed wherever slavery rules), who, having weighed the points with
                  great legal impartiality, gives it as his most distinguished opinion that no order
                  of release from the high sheriff is requisite to satisfy the creditors of his
                  death: take care of the order sent, and make a note of the niggers who take him
                  away, concludes that highly important gentleman, as comfortably his head reclines
                  on soft pillow. To this end was Mr. Moon's certificate essential.
               Mr. Winterflint returns; enquires who owns the boys.
               "Mas'r Rosebrook's niggers," Duncan replies, firmly; "but Missus send da
                  order."
               "Sure of that, now? Good niggers them of Rosebrook's: wouldn't a' gin it to nobody
                  else's niggers. Follow me—zist, zist!" he says, crooking his finger at the other
                  three, and scowling, as Duncan relieves their timidity by advancing. They move
                  slowly and noiselessly up the aisle, the humid atmosphere of which, pregnant with
                  death, sickens as it steals into the very blood. "In there—zist! make no noise;
                  the dead debtor lies there," whispers the warden, laying his left hand upon
                  Duncan's shoulder, and, the forefinger of his right extended, pointing toward the
                  last cell on the left. "Door's open; not locked, I meant. Left it unsecured last
                  night. Rap afore ye go in, though." At the methodical warden's bidding Duncan
                  proceeds, his foot falling lightly on the floor. Reaching the door, he places his
                  right hand on the swinging bolt, and for a few seconds seems listening. He hears
                  the muffled sound of a footfall pacing the floor, and then a muttering as of
                  voices in secret communion, or dying echoes from the tomb. He has not mistaken the
                  cell; its crevices give forth odours 
                     pergnant
                     pregnant
                   of proof. Two successive raps bring Harry to the door: they are admitted
                  to the presence of the dead. One by one Harry receives them by the hand, but he
                  must needs be told why Daddy is not with them. They know not. He ate a morsel, and
                  left late last night, says one of the negroes. Harry is astonished at this
                  singular intelligence: Daddy Bob never before was known to commit an act of
                  unfaithfulness; he was true to Marston in life,—strange that he should desert him
                  in death. "Mas'r's death-bed wasn't much at last," says Duncan, as they gather
                  round the cot, and, with curious faces, mingle their more curious remarks. Harry
                  draws back the white handkerchief which Franconia had spread over the face of the
                  corpse, as the negroes start back
                  affrighted. As of nervous contortion, the ghastly face presents an awful picture.
                  Swollen, discoloured, and contracted, no one outline of that once cheerful
                  countenance can be traced. "Don't look much like Mas'r Marston used to look; times
                  must a' changed mightily since he used to look so happy at home," mutters Duncan,
                  shaking his head, and telling the others not to be "fear'd; dead men can't hurt
                  nobody."
               "Died penniless;—but e' war good on e' own plantation," rejoins another. "One ting
                  be sartin 'bout nigger—he know how he die wen 'e time cum; Mas'r don know how 'e
                  gwine to die!"
               Having seen enough of the melancholy finale, they spread the litter in the aisle,
                  as the warden enters the cell to facilitate the dead debtor's exit. Harry again
                  covers the face, and prepares to roll the body in a coverlit brought by Duncan. "I
                  kind of liked him—he was so gentlemanly—has been with us so long, and did'nt seem
                  like a prisoner. He was very quiet, and always civil when spoken to," interposes
                  the warden, as, assisting the second shrouding, he presses the hand of the corpse
                  in his own.
               Now he is ready; they place his cold body on the litter; a few listless prisoners
                  stand their sickly figures along the passage, watch him slowly borne to the iron
                  gate in the arched vault. Death—less inexorable than creditors—has signed his
                  release, thrown back prison bolts and bars, wrested him from the grasp of human
                  laws, and now mocks at creditors, annuls fi fas,
                  bids the dead debtor make his exit. Death pays no gaol fees; it makes that bequest
                  to creditors; but it reserves the keys of heaven for another purpose. "One ration
                  less," says the warden, who, closing the grated door, casts a lingering look after
                  the humble procession, bearing away the remains of our departed.
               With Harry as the only follower, they proceed along, through suburban streets, and
                  soon reach the house of that generous woman. A minister of the gospel awaits his
                  coming; the good man's words are consoling, but he cannot remodel the past for the
                  advantage of the dead. Soon the body is placed in a "ready-made coffin," and the
                  good man offers up the last funeral rites; he can do no more than invoke the great
                  protector to receive the departed into his bosom.
               "How the troubles of this world rise up before me! Oh! uncle! uncle! how I could
                  part with the world and bury my troubles in the same grave!" exclaims Franconia,
                  as, the ceremony having ended, they bear the body away to its last resting-place;
                  and, in a paroxysm of grief, she shrieks and falls swooning to the floor.
               In a neatly inclosed plat, a short distance from the Rosebrook Villa, and near the
                  bank of a meandering rivulet, overhung with mourning willows and clustering vines,
                  they lay him to rest. The world gave the fallen man nothing but a prison-cell
                  wherein to stretch his dying body; a woman gives him a sequestered grave, and
                  nature spreads it with her loveliest offering. It is the last resting-place of the
                  Rosebrook family, which their negroes, partaking of that contentment so
                  characteristic of the family, have planted with flowers they nurture with
                  tenderest care. There is something touching in the calm beauty of the spot;
                  something breathing of rural contentment. It is something to be buried in a pretty
                  grave—to be mourned by a slave—to be loved by the untutored. How abject the slave,
                  and yet how true his affection! how dear his requiem over a departed friend! "God
                  bless master—receive his spirit!" is heard mingling with the music of the gentle
                  breeze, as Harry, sitting at the head of the grave, looks upward to heaven, while
                  earth covers from sight the mortal relics of a once kind master.
               It has been a day of sadness at the villa—a day of mourning and tribulation. How
                  different the scene in the city! There, men whisper strange regrets. Sympathy is
                  let loose, and is expanding itself to an unusual degree. Who was there that did
                  not know Marston's generous, gushing soul! Who was there that would not have
                  stretched forth the helping hand, had they known his truly abject condition! Who
                  that was not, and had not been twenty times, on the very brink of wresting him
                  from the useless tyranny of his obdurate creditors! Who that had not waited from
                  day to day, with purse-strings open, ready to pour forth the unmistakeable tokens
                  of friendship! How many were only restrained from doing good—from giving vent to
                  the fountains of their hospitality—through fear of being contaminated with that
                  scandal rumour had thrown around his decline! Over his death hath sprung to life
                  that curious fabric of living generosity, so ready to bespread a grave with
                  unneeded bounties,—so emblematic of how many false mourners hath the dead. But Graspum would have all such
                  expressions shrink beneath his glowing goodness. With honied words he tells the
                  tale of his own honesty: his business intercourse with the deceased was in
                  character most generous. Many a good turn did Marston receive at his hands; long
                  had he been his faithful and unwearied friend. Fierce are the words with which he
                  would execrate the tyrant creditors; yea, he would heap condign punishment on
                  their obdurate heads. Time after time did he tell them the fallen man was
                  penniless; how strange, then, that they tortured him to death within prison walls.
                  He would sweep away such vengeance, bury it with his curses, and make obsolete
                  such laws as give one man power to gratify his passion on another. His burning,
                  surging anger can find no relief; nor can he tolerate such antiquated debtor laws:
                  to him they are the very essence of barbarism, tainting that enlightened
                  civilisation so long implanted by the State, so well maintained by the people. It
                  is on those ennobling virtues of state, he says, the cherished doctrines of our
                  democracy are founded. Graspum is, indeed, a well-developed type of our modern
                  democracy, the flimsy fabric of which is well represented in the gasconade of the
                  above outpouring philanthropy.
               And now, as again the crimson clouds of evening soften into golden hues—as the
                  sun, like a fiery chariot, sinks beneath the western landscape, and still night
                  spreads her shadowy mantle down the distant hills, and over the broad lagoon to
                  the north—two sable figures may be seen patting, sodding, and bespreading with
                  fresh-plucked flowers the new grave. As the rippling brook gives out its silvery
                  music, and earth seems drinking of the misty dew, that, like a bridal veil,
                  spreads over its verdant hillocks, they whisper their requiem of regret, and mould
                  the grave so carefully. "It's mas'r's last," says one, smoothing the cone with his
                  hands.
               "We will plant the tree now," returns the other, bringing forward a young
                  clustering pine, which he places at the head of the grave, and on which he cuts
                  the significant epitaph—"Good master lies here!"
               Duncan and Harry have paid their last tribute. "He is at peace with this world,"
                  says the latter, as, at the gate, he turns to take a last look over the
                  paling.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIX.
               HOW WE SHOULD ALL BE FORGIVING.
               LET us forget the scenes of the foregoing chapters, and turn to something of
                  pleasanter hue. In the meantime, let us freely acknowledge that we live in a
                  land—our democratic south, we mean—where sumptuous living and abject misery
                  present their boldest outlines,—where the ignorance of the many is excused by the
                  polished education of a very few,—where autocracy sways its lash with bitterest
                  absolutism,—where menial life lies prostrate at the feet of injustice, and
                  despairingly appeals to heaven for succour,—where feasts and funerals rival each
                  other,—and when pestilence, like a glutton, sends its victims to the graveyard
                  most, the ball-room glitters brightest with its galaxy. Even here, where clamour
                  cries aloud for popular government, men's souls are most crushed—not with legal
                  right, but by popular will! And yet, from out all this incongruous substance,
                  there seems a genial spirit working itself upon the surface, and making good its
                  influence; and it is to that influence we should award the credit due. That genial
                  spirit is the good master's protection; we would it were wider exercised for the
                  good of all. But we must return to our narrative.
               The Rosebrook Villa has assumed its usual cheerfulness; but while pestilence makes
                  sad havoc among the inhabitants of the city, gaiety is equally rampant. In a word,
                  even the many funeral trains which pass along every day begin to wear a sort of
                  cheerfulness, in consequence of which, it is rumoured, the aristocracy—we mean
                  those who have money to spend—have made up their minds not to depart for the
                  springs yet awhile. As for Franconia, finding she could no longer endure
                  M'Carstrow's dissolute habits, and having been told by that very distinguished
                  gentleman, but unamiable husband, that he despised the whole tribe of her poor
                  relations, she has retired to private boarding, where, with the five dollars a
                  week, he, in the outpouring of his
                  southern generosity, allows her, she subsists plainly but comfortably. It is,
                  indeed, a paltry pittance, which the M'Carstrow family will excuse to the public
                  with the greatness of their name.
               Harry has returned to the plantation, where the people have smothered him in a new
                  suit of black. Already has he preached three sermons in it, which said sermons are
                  declared wonderful proofs of his biblical knowledge. Even Daddy Daniel, who
                  expended fourteen picayunes in a new pair of spectacles, with which to hear the
                  new parson more distinctly, pronounces the preaching prodigious. He is vehement in
                  his exultation, lavishes his praise without stint; and as his black face glows
                  with happiness, thanks missus for her great goodness in thus providing for their
                  spiritual welfare. The Rosebrook "niggers" were always extremely respectable and
                  well ordered in their moral condition; but now they seem invested with a new
                  impulse for working out their own good; and by the advice of missus, whom every
                  sable son and daughter loves most dearly, Daddy Daniel has arranged a system of
                  evening prayer meetings, which will be held in the little church, twice a week.
                  And, too, there prevails a strong desire for an evening gathering now and then, at
                  which the young shiners may be instructed how to grow. A curiously democratic law,
                  however, offers a fierce impediment to this; and Daddy Daniel shakes his head, and
                  aunt Peggy makes a belligerent muttering when told such gatherings cannot take
                  place without endangering the state's rights. It is, nevertheless, decided that
                  Kate, and Nan, and Dorothy, and Webster, and Clay, and such like young folks, may
                  go to "settings up" and funerals, but strictly abstain from all fandangoes. Dad
                  Daniel and his brother deacons cannot countenance such fiddling and dancing, such
                  break-downs, and shoutings, and whirlings, and flouncing and frilling, and gay
                  ribboning, as generally make up the evening's merriment at these fandangoes, so
                  prevalent on neighbouring plantations about Christmas time. "Da don' mount to no
                  good!" Daniel says, with a broad guffaw. "Nigger what spect t' git hi' way up in
                  da world bes lef dem tings." And so one or two more screws are to be worked up for
                  the better regulation of the machinery of the plantation. As for Master
                  Rosebrook—why, he wouldn't sell a nigger for a world of money; and he doesn't care
                  how much they learn; the more the better, provided they learn on the sly. They are
                  all to be freed at a certain time, and although freedom is sweet, without learning
                  they might make bad use of it. But master has had a noble object in view for some
                  days past, and which, after encountering many difficulties, he has succeeded in
                  carrying out to the great joy of all parties concerned.
               One day, as the people were all busily engaged on the plantation, Bradshaw's
                  familiar figure presents itself at the house, and demands to see Harry. He has
                  great good news, but don't want to tell him "nofin" till he arrives at the Villa.
                  "Ah, good man" (Bradshaw's face beams good tidings, as he approaches Harry, and
                  delivers a note) "mas'r specs ye down da' wid no time loss." Bradshaw rubs his
                  hands, and grins, and bows, his face seeming two shades blacker than ever, but no
                  less cheerful.
               "Master wants me to preach somewhere, next Sunday,—I know he does," says Harry,
                  reading the note, which requests him to come immediately into the city. He will
                  prepare to obey the summons, Dan and Sprat meanwhile taking good care of the horse
                  and carriage, while Bradshaw makes a friendly visit to a few of the more
                  distinguished cabins, and says "how de" to venerable aunties, who spread their
                  best fare before him, and, with grave ceremony, invite him in to refresh before
                  taking his return journey into the city; and Maum Betsy packs up six of her real
                  smart made sweet cakes for the parson and Bradshaw to eat along the road. Betsy is
                  in a strange state of bewilderment to know why master wants to take the new parson
                  away just now, when he's so happy, and is only satisfied when assured that he will
                  be safely returned to-morrow. A signal is made for Dad Daniel, who hastens to the
                  cabin in time to see everything properly arranged for the parson's departure, and
                  say: "God bless 'um,—good by!"
               "Now, what can master want with me?" enquires Harry, as, on the road, they roll
                  away towards the city.
               Bradshaw cracks his whip, and with a significant smile looks Harry in the face,
                  and returns: "Don' ax dis child no mo' sich question. Old mas'r and me neber
                     break secret. Tell ye dis, do'h! Old
                  mas'r do good ting, sartin."
               "You know, but won't tell me, eh?" rejoins Harry, his manly face wearing a
                  solicitous look. Bradshaw shakes his head, and adds a cunning wink in reply.
               It is three o'clock when they arrive at the Villa, where, without reserve, missus
                  extends her hand, and gives him a cordial welcome,—tells him Franconia has been
                  waiting to see him with great patience, and has got a present for him. Franconia
                  comes rushing into the hall, and is so glad to see him; but her countenance wears
                  an air of sadness, which does not escape his notice—she is not the beautiful
                  creature she was years ago, care has sadly worn upon those rounded features. But
                  master is there, and he looks happy and cheerful; and there is something about the
                  house servants, as they gather round him to have their say, which looks of
                  suspiciously good omen. He cannot divine what it is; his first suspicions being
                  aroused by missus saying Franconia had been waiting to see him.
               "We must not call him Harry any longer—it doesn't become his profession: now that
                  he is Elder of my plantation flock, he must, from this time, be called Elder!"
                  says Rosebrook, touching him on the arm with the right hand. And the two ladies
                  joined in, that it must be so. "Go into the parlour, ladies; I must say a word or
                  two to the Elder," continued Rosebrook, taking Harry by the arm, and pacing
                  through the hall into the conservatory at the back of the house. Here, after
                  ordering Harry to be seated, he recounts his plan of emancipation, which, so far,
                  has worked admirably, and, at the time proposed, will, without doubt or danger,
                  produce the hoped-for result. "You, my good man," he says, "can be a useful
                  instrument in furthering my ends; I want you to be that instrument!" His negroes
                  have all an interest in their labour, which interest is preserved for them in
                  missus's savings-bank; and at a given time they are to have their freedom, but to
                  remain on the plantation if they choose, at a stipulated rate of wages. Indeed, so
                  strongly impressed with the good results of his proposed system is Rosebrook, that
                  he long since scouted that contemptible fallacy, which must have had its origin in
                  the very dregs of selfishness, that the two races can only live in proximity by
                  one enslaving the other. Justice to each other, he holds, will solve the problem
                  of their living together; but, between the oppressor and the oppressed, a volcano
                  that may at any day send forth its devouring flame, smoulders. Rosebrook knows
                  goodness always deserves its reward; and Harry assures him he never will violate
                  the trust. Having said thus much, he rises from his chair, takes Harry by the arm,
                  and leading him to the door of the conservatory, points him to a passage leading
                  to the right, and says: "In there!—proceed into that passage, enter a door, first
                  door on the left, and then you will find something you may consider your own."
               Harry hesitated for a moment, watched master's countenance doubtingly, as if
                  questioning the singular command.
               "Fear not! nobody will hurt you," continues Rosebrook.
               "Master never had a bad intention," thinks Harry; "I know he would not harm me;
                  and then missus is so good." Slowly and nervously he proceeds, and on reaching the
                  door hears a familiar "come in" answering his nervous rap. The door opened into a
                  neat little room, with carpet and chairs, a mahogany bureau and prints, all so
                  neatly arranged, and wearing such an air of cleanliness. No sooner has he advanced
                  beyond the threshold than the emaciated figure of a black sister vaults into his
                  arms, crying, "Oh Harry! Harry! Harry!—my dear husband!" She throws her arms about
                  his neck, and kisses, and kisses him, and buries her tears of joy in his bosom.
                  How she pours out her soul's love!—how, in rapturous embraces, her black impulses
                  give out the purest affection!
               "And you!—you!—you!—my own dear Jane! Is it you? Has God commanded us to meet once
                  more, to be happy once more, to live as heaven hath ordained us to live?" he
                  returns, as fervently and affectionately he holds her in his arms, and returns her
                  token of love. "Never! never! I forget you, never! By night and by day I have
                  prayed the protecting hand of Providence to guide you through life's trials. How
                  my heart has yearned to meet you in heaven! happy am I we have met once more on
                  earth; yea, my soul leaps with joy. Forgive them, Father, forgive them who
                  separate us on earth, for heaven makes the anointed!" And while they embrace thus
                  fondly, their tears mingling with joy,
                  children, recognising a returned father as he entered the door, are clinging at
                  his feet beseechingly. He is their father;—how like children they love! "Sam, Sue,
                  and Beckie, too!" he says, as one by one he takes them in his arms and kisses
                  them. But there are two more, sombre and strange. He had caught the fourth in his
                  arms, unconsciously. "Ah, Jane!" he exclaims, turning toward her, his face filled
                  with grief and chagrin, "they are not of me, Jane!" He still holds the little
                  innocent by the hand, as nervously he waits her reply. It is not guilt, but shame,
                  with which she returns an answer.
               "It was not my sin, Harry! It was him that forced me to live with another,—that
                  lashed me when I refused, and, bleeding, made me obey the will," she returns,
                  looking at him imploringly. Virtue is weaker than the lash; none feel it more than
                  the slave. She loved Harry, she followed him with her thoughts; but it was the
                  Christian that reduced her to the level of the brute. Laying her coloured hand
                  upon his shoulder, she besought his forgiveness, as God was forgiving.
               "Why should I not forgive thee, Jane? I would not chide thee, for no sin is on thy
                  garments. Injustice gave master the right to sell thee, to make of thee what he
                  pleased. Heaven made thy soul purest,—man thy body an outcast for the unrighteous
                  to feast upon. How could I withhold forgiveness, Jane? I will be a father to them,
                  a husband to thee; for what thou hast been compelled to do is right, in the land
                  we live in." So saying, he again embraces her, wipes the tears from her eyes, and
                  comforts her. How sweet is forgiveness! It freshens like the dew of morning on the
                  drooping plant; it strengthens the weary spirit, it steals into the desponding
                  soul, and wakes to life new hopes of bliss,—to the slave it is sweet indeed!
               "I will kiss them, too," he ejaculates, taking them in his arms with the embrace
                  of a fond father,—which simple expression of love they return with prattling. They
                  know not the trials of their parents; how blessed to know them not!
               And now they gather the children around them, and seat themselves on a little
                  settee near the window, where Harry, overjoyed at meeting his dear ones once more,
                  fondles them and listens to Jane, as with her left arm round his neck she
                  discloses the sad tale of her tribulation. Let us beg the reader to excuse the
                  recital; there is nothing fascinating in it, nor would we call forth the modest
                  blushes of our generous south. A few words of the woman's story, however, we
                  cannot omit; and we trust the forgiving will pardon their insertion. She tells
                  Harry she was not separated from her children; but that Romescos, having well
                  considered her worth, sold her with her "young uns" to the Rev. Peter ——, who had
                  a small plantation down in Christ's Parish. The reverend gentleman, being born and
                  educated to the degrading socialities of democratic states, always says he is not
                  to blame for "using" the rights the law gives him; nor does he forget to express
                  sundry regrets that he cannot see as preachers at the north see. As for money, he
                  thinks preachers have just as good a right to get it as gentlemen of any other
                  honourable profession. Now and then he preaches to niggers; and for telling them
                  how they must live in the fear of the Lord, be obedient to their master, and pay
                  for redemption by the sweat of their brows, he adds to his pile of coin. But he is
                  strongly of the opinion that niggers are inferior "brutes" of the human species,
                  and in furtherance of this opinion (so popular in the whole south) he expects them
                  to live a week on a peck of corn. As for Jane—we must excuse the reverend
                  gentleman, because of his faith in southern principles—he compelled her to live
                  with the man Absalom ere she had been two days on his plantation, and by the same
                  Absalom she had two children, which materially increased the cash value of the
                  Reverend Peter ——'s slave property. Indeed, so well is the reverend gentleman
                  known for his foul play, that it has been thrown up to him in open court—by wicked
                  planters who never had the fear of God before their eyes—that he more than half
                  starved his niggers, and charged them toll for grinding their corn in his mill.
                  Though the Reverend Peter —— never failed to assure his friends and acquaintances
                  of his generosity (a noble quality which had long been worthily maintained by the
                  ancient family to which he belonged), the light of one generous act had never
                  found its way to the public. In truth, so elastically did his reverend
                  conscientiousness expand when he learned the strange motive which prompted
                  Rosebrook to purchase Jane and her little ones, that he sorely regretted he had
                  not put two hundred dollars more on the
                  price of the lot. Fortunately Jane was much worn down by grief and toil, and was
                  viewed by the reverend gentleman as a piece of property he would rather like to
                  dispose of to the best advantage, lest she should suddenly make a void in his
                  dollars and cents by sliding into some out of the way grave-yard. But Rosebrook,
                  duly appreciating the unchristian qualities of our worthy one's generosity, kept
                  his motive a profound secret until the negociation was completed. Now that it had
                  become known that the Reverend Peter —— (who dresses in blackest black, most
                  sanctimoniously cut, whitest neckcloth wedded to his holy neck, and face so simply
                  serious) assures Rosebrook he has got good people,—they are valuably promising—he
                  will pray for them, that the future may prosper their wayfaring. He cannot,
                  however, part with the good man without admonishing him how dangerous it is to
                  give unto "niggers" the advantage of a superior position.
               Reader, let us hope the clergy of the south will take heed lest by permitting
                  their brethren to be sold and stolen in this manner they bring the profession into
                  contempt. Let us hope the southern church will not much longer continue to bring
                  pure Christianity into disgrace by serving ends so vile that heaven and earth
                  frowns upon them; for false is the voice raised in sanctimony to heaven for power
                  to make a footstool of a fallen race!
            
            
               CHAPTER XL.
               CONTAINING VARIOUS MATTERS.
               GREAT regularity prevails on the Rosebrook plantation, and cheering are the
                  prospects held out to those who toil thereon. Mrs. Rosebrook has dressed Jane
                  (Harry's wife) in a nice new calico, which, with her feet encased in shining
                  calf-skin shoes, and her head done up in a bandana, with spots of great
                  brightness, shows her lean figure to good advantage. Like a good wife, happy with
                  her own dear husband, she pours forth the emotions of a grateful heart, and feels
                  that the world—not so bad after all—has something good in store for her. And then
                  Harry looks even better than he did on Master Marston's plantation; and, with
                  their little ones—sable types of their parents—dressed so neatly, they must be
                  happy. And now that they are duly installed at the plantation, where Harry pursues
                  his duties as father of the flock, and Jane lends her cheering voice and helping
                  hand to make comfort in the various cabins complete—and with Dad Daniel's
                  assurance that the people won't go astray—we must leave them for a time, and beg
                  the reader's indulgence while following us through another phase of the children's
                  history.
               A slave is but a slave—an article subject to all the fluctuations of trade—a mere
                  item in the scale of traffic, and reduced to serving the ends of avarice or
                  licentiousness. This is a consequence inseparable from his sale. It matters not
                  whether the blood of the noblest patriot course in his veins, his hair be of
                  flaxen brightness, his eyes of azure blue, his skin of Norman whiteness, and his
                  features classic,—he can be no more than a slave, and as such must yield to the
                  debasing influences of an institution that crushes and curses wherever it exists.
                  In proof of this, we find the bright eyes of our little Annette, glowing with
                  kindliest love, failing to thaw the frozen souls of man-dealers. Nay, bright eyes
                  only lend their aid to the law that debases her life. She has become valuable only
                  as a finely and delicately developed
                  woman, whose appearance in the market will produce sharp bidding, and a deal of
                  dollars and cents. Graspum never lost an opportunity of trimming up these nice
                  pieces of female property, making the money invested in them turn the largest
                  premium, and satisfying his customers that, so far as dealing in the
                     brightest kind of fancy stock was concerned, he is not a jot
                  behind the most careful selecter in the Charleston market. Major
                  John Bowling—who is very distinguished, having descended from the very ancient
                  family of that name, and is highly thought of by the aristocracy—has made the
                  selection of such merchandise his particular branch of study for more than
                  fourteen years. In consequence of the major's supposed taste, his pen was hitherto
                  most frequented by gentlemen and connoisseur; but now Graspum assures all
                  respectable people, gentlemen of acknowledged taste, and young men who are
                  cultivating their way up in the world, that his selections are second to none; of
                  this he will produce sufficient proof, provided customers will make him a call and
                  look into the area of his fold. The fold itself is most uninviting (it is, he
                  assures us, owing to his determination to carry out the faith of his plain
                  democracy); nevertheless, it contains the white, beautiful, and voluptuous,—all
                  for sale. In fact—the truth must be told—Mr. Graspum assures the world that he
                  firmly believes there is a sort of human nature extant—he is troubled sometimes to
                  know just where the line breaks off—which never by any possibility could have been
                  intended for any thing but the other to traffic in—to turn into the most dollars
                  and cents. In proof of this principle he kept Annette until she had well nigh
                  merged into womanhood, or until such time as she became a choice marketable
                  article, with eyes worth so much; nose, mouth, so much; pretty auburn hair, worth
                  so much; and fine rounded figure—with all its fascinating appurtenances—worth so
                  much;—the whole amounting to so much; to be sold for so much, the nice little
                  profit being chalked down on the credit side of his formidable ledger, in which
                  stands recorded against his little soul (he knows will get to heaven) the sale of
                  ten thousand black souls, which will shine in brightness when his is refused
                  admittance to the portal above.
               Having arrived at the point most marketable, he sells her to Mr. Gurdoin
                  Choicewest, who pays no less a sum than sixteen hundred dollars in hard cash for
                  the unyielding beauty—money advanced to him by his dear papa, who had no objection
                  to his having a pretty coloured girl, provided Madam Choicewest—most indulgent
                  mother she was, too—gave her consent; and she said she was willing, provided—; and
                  now, notwithstanding she was his own, insisted on the preservation of her virtue,
                  or death. Awful dilemma, this! To lash her will be useless; and the few kicks she
                  has already received have not yet begun to thaw her frozen determination. Such an
                  unyielding thing is quite useless for the purpose for which young Choicewest
                  purchased her. What must be done with her? The older Choicewest is consulted, and
                  gives it as his decided opinion that there is one of two things the younger
                  Choicewest must do with this dear piece of property he has so unfortunately got on
                  his hands,—he must sell her, or tie her up every day and pump her with cold water,
                  say fifteen minutes at a time. Pumping niggers, the elder Mr. Choicewest remarks,
                  with the coolness of an Austrian diplomatist, has a wondrous effect upon them; "it
                  makes 'em give in when nothing else will." He once had four prime fellows, who, in
                  stubbornness, seemed a match for Mr. Beelzebub himself. He lashed them, and he
                  burned them, and he clipped their ears; and then he stretched them on planks,
                  thinking they would cry "give in" afore the sockets of their joints were drawn
                  out; but it was all to no purpose, they were as unyielding as granite.
               About that time there was a celebrated manager of negroes keeping the prison. This
                  clever functionary had a peculiar way of bringing the stubbornness out of them; so
                  he consigned the four unbending rascals to his skill. And this very valuable and
                  very skilful gaol-keeper had a large window in his establishment, with iron bars
                  running perpendicular; to the inside of which he would strap the four stubborn
                  rascals, with their faces scientifically arranged between the bars, to prevent the
                  moving of a muscle. Thus caged, their black heads bound to the grating, the
                  scientific gaoler, who was something of a humourist withal, would enjoy a nice bit
                  of fun at seeing the more favoured prisoners (with his kind permission) exercise
                  their dexterity in throwing peas at the faces of the bounden. How he would
                     laugh—how the pea-punishing
                  prisoners would enjoy it—how the fast bound niggers, foaming with rage and
                  maddened to desperation, would bellow, as their very eyeballs darted fire and
                  blood! What grand fun it was! bull-baiting sank into a mere shadow beside it. The
                  former was measuredly passive, because the bull only roared, and pitched, and
                  tossed; whereas here the sport was made more exhilarating by expressions of
                  vengeance or implorings. And then, as a change of pastime, the skilful gaoler
                  would demand a cessation of the pea hostilities, and enjoin the commencement of
                  the water war; which said war was carried out by supplying about a dozen prisoners
                  with as many buckets, which they would fill with great alacrity, and, in
                  succession, throw the contents with great force over the unyielding, from the
                  outside. The effect of this on naked men, bound with chains to iron bars, may be
                  imagined; but the older Choicewest declares it was a cure. It brought steel out of
                  the "rascals," and made them as submissive as shoe-strings. Sometimes the jolly
                  prisoners would make the bath so strong, that the niggers would seem completely
                  drowned when released; but then they'd soon come to with a jolly good rolling, a
                  little hartshorn applied to their nostrils, and the like of that. About a dozen
                  times putting through the pea and water process cured them.
               So says the very respectable Mr. Choicewest, with great dignity of manners, as he
                  seriously advises the younger Choicewest to try a little quantity of the same sort
                  on his now useless female purchase. Lady Choicewest must, however, be consulted on
                  this point, as she is very particular about the mode in which all females about
                  her establishment are chastised. Indeed, Lady Choicewest is much concerned about
                  the only male, heir of the family, to whom she looks forward for very
                  distinguished results to the family name. The family (Lady Choicewest always
                  assures those whom she graciously condescends to admit into the fashionable
                  precincts of her small but very select circle), descended from the very ancient
                  and chivalric house of that name, whose celebrated estate was in Warwickshire,
                  England; and, in proof of this, my Lady Choicewest invariably points to a sad
                  daub, illustrative of some incomprehensible object, suspended over the antique
                  mantelpiece. With methodical grace, and dignity which frowns with superlative
                  contempt upon every thing very vulgar—for she says "she sublimely detests tests
                  them very low creatures what are never brought up to manners at the north, and are
                  worse than haystacks to larn civility"—my lady solicits a near inspection of this
                  wonderful hieroglyphic, which she tells us is the family arms,—an ancient and
                  choice bit of art she would not part with for the world. If her friends evince any
                  want of perception in tracing the many deeds of valour it heralds, on behalf of
                  the noble family of which she is an undisputed descendant, my lady will at once
                  enter upon the task of instruction; and with the beautiful fore-finger of her
                  right hand, always jewelled with great brilliancy, will she satisfactorily
                  enlighten the stupid on the fame of the ancient Choicewest family, thereon
                  inscribed. With no ordinary design on the credulity of her friends, Lady
                  Choicewest has several times strongly intimated that she was not quite sure that
                  one or two of her ancestors in the male line of the family were not reigning dukes
                  as far down as the noble reign of the ignoble Oliver Cromwell! The question,
                  nevertheless, is whether the honour of the ancient Choicewest family descended
                  from Mr. or Mrs. Choicewest. The vulgar mass have been known to say (smilingly)
                  that Lady Choicewest's name was Brown, the father of which very ancient family
                  sold herrings and small pigs at a little stand in the market: this, however, was a
                  very long time ago, and, as my lady is known to be troubled with an exceedingly
                  crooked memory, persons better acquainted with her are more ready to accept the
                  oblivious excuse.
               Taking all these things into consideration, my Lady Choicewest is exceedingly
                  cautious lest young Gourdoin Choicewest should do aught to dishonour the family
                  name; and on this strange perplexity in which her much indulged son is placed
                  being referred to her, she gives it as her most decided opinion that the wench, if
                  as obstinate as described, had better be sold to the highest bidder—the sooner the
                  better. My lady lays great emphasis on "the sooner the better." That something
                  will be lost she has not the slightest doubt; but then it were better to lose a
                  little in the price of the stubborn wretch, than to have her always creating
                  disturbance about the genteel premises. In furtherance of this—my lady's
                  mandate—Annette is sold to Mr. Blackmore Blackett for the nice round sum of
                  fifteen hundred dollars. Gourdoin Choicewest hates to part with the beauty,
                     grieves and regrets,—she is so
                  charmingly fascinating. "Must let her slide, though; critter won't do at all as I
                  wants her to," he lisps, regretting the serious loss of the dollars. His friend
                  Blackmore Blackett, however, is a gentleman, and therefore he would not deceive
                  him in the wench: hence he makes the reduction, because he finds her decidedly
                  faulty. Had Blackmore Blackett been a regular flesh trader, he would not have
                  scrupled to take him in. As it is, gentlemen must always be gentlemen among
                  themselves. Blackett, a gentleman of fortune, who lives at his ease in the city,
                  and has the very finest taste for female beauty, was left, most unfortunately, a
                  widower with four lovely daughters, any one of which may be considered a belle not
                  to be rung by gentlemen of ordinary rank or vulgar pretension. In fact, the
                  Blackett girls are considered very fine specimens of beauty, are much admired in
                  society, and expect ere long, on the clear merit of polish, to rank equal with the
                  first aristocracy of the place.
               Mr. Blackmore Blackett esteems himself an extremely lucky fellow in having so
                  advantageously procured such a nice piece of property,—so suited to his taste. Her
                  price, when compared with her singularly valuable charms, is a mere nothing; and,
                  too, all his fashionable friends will congratulate him upon his good fortune. But
                  as disappointments will come, so Mr. Blackmore Blackett finds he has got something
                  not quite so valuable as anticipated; however, being something of a philosopher,
                  he will improve upon the course pursued by the younger Choicewest: he makes his
                  first advances with great caution; whispers words of tenderness in her ear; tells
                  her his happy jewel for life she must be. Remembering her mother, she turns a deaf
                  ear to Mr. Blackett's pleadings. The very cabin which he has provided for her in
                  the yard reminds her of that familiar domicile on Marston's plantation. Neither by
                  soft pleadings, nor threatenings of sale to plantation life, nor terrors of the
                  lash, can he soften the creature's sympathies, so that the flesh may succumb. When
                  he whispered soft words and made fascinating promises, she would shake her head
                  and move from him; when he threatened, she would plead her abject position; when
                  he resorted to force, she would struggle with him, making the issue her virtue or
                  death. Once she paid the penalty of her struggles with a broken wrist, which she
                  shows us more in sorrow than anger. Annette is beautiful but delicate; has soft
                  eyes beaming with the fulness of a great soul; but they were sold, once,—now,
                  sympathy for her is dead. The law gives her no protection for her virtue; the
                  ruffian may violate it, and Heaven only can shelter it with forgiveness. As for
                  Blackett, he has no forgiveness in his temperament,—passion soars highest with
                  him; he would slay with violent hands the minion who dared oppose its triumph.
               About this time, Mr. Blackett, much to his surprise, finds a storm of mischief
                  brewing about his domestic domain. The Miss Blacketts, dashing beauties, have had
                  it come to their ears over and over again that all the young men about the city
                  say Annette Mazatlin (as she is now called) is far more beautiful than any one of
                  the Blacketts. This is quite enough to kindle the elements of a female war. In the
                  south nothing can spread the war of jealousy and vanity with such undying rage as
                  comparing slave beauty with that of the more favoured of the sexes. A firman of
                  the strongest kind is now issued from the portfolio of the Miss Blacketts,
                  forbidding the wretched girl entering the house; and storms of abuse are
                  plentifully and very cheaply lavished on her head, ere she puts it outside the
                  cabin. She was a nasty, impudent hussy; the very worst of all kind of creatures to
                  have about a respectable mansion,—enough to shock respectable people! The worst of
                  it was, that the miserable white nigger thought she was handsome, and a lot of
                  young, silly-headed men flattered her vanity by telling the fool she was prettier
                  than the Blacketts themselves,—so said the very accomplished Miss Blacketts. And
                  if ever domicile was becoming too warm for man to live in, in consequence of
                  female indignation, that one was Mr. Blackmore Blackett's. It was not so much that
                  the father had purchased this beautiful creature to serve fiendish purposes. Oh
                  no!—that was a thing of every-day occurrence,—something excusable in any
                  respectable man's family. It was beauty rivalling, fierce and jealous of its
                  compliments. Again, the wretch—found incorrigible, and useless for the purpose
                  purchased—is sold. Poor, luckless maiden! she might add, as she passed through the
                  hands of so many purchasers. This time, however, she is less valuable from having
                  fractured her left wrist, deformity being always taken into account when such
                  property is up at the flesh shambles.
                  But Mr. Blackmore Blackett has a delicacy about putting her up under the hammer
                  just now, inasmuch as he could not say she was sold for no fault; while the
                  disfigured wrist might lead to suspicious remarks concerning his treatment of her.
                  Another extremely unfortunate circumstance was its getting all about the city that
                  she was a cold, soulless thing, who declared that sooner than yield to be the
                  abject wretch men sought to make her, she would die that only death. She had but
                  one life, and it were better to yield that up virtuously than die degraded.
                  Graspum, then, is the only safe channel in which to dispose of the like. That
                  functionary assures Mr. Blackmore Blackett that the girl is beautiful, delicate,
                  and an exceedingly sweet creature yet! but that during the four months she has
                  depreciated more than fifty per cent in value. His remarks may be considered out
                  of place, but they are none the less true, for it is ascertained, on private
                  examination, that sundry stripes have been laid about her bare loins. Gurdoin
                  Choicewest declared to his mother that he never for once had laid violent hands on
                  the obstinate wench; Mr. Blackmore Blackett stood ready to lay his hand on the
                  Bible, and lift his eyes to heaven for proof of his innocence; but a record of the
                  infliction, indelible of blood, remained there to tell its sad tale,—to shame, if
                  shame had aught in slavery whereon to make itself known. Notwithstanding this bold
                  denial, it is found that Mr. Blackmore Blackett did on two occasions strip her and
                  secure her hands and feet to the bed-post, where he put on "about six at a time,"
                  remarkably "gently." He admired her symmetrical form, her fine, white, soft,
                  smooth skin—her voluptuous limbs, so beautifully and delicately developed; and
                  then there was so much gushing sweetness, mingled with grief, in her face, as she
                  cast her soft glances upon him, and implored him to end her existence, or save her
                  such shame! Such, he says, laconically, completely disarmed him, and he only
                  switched her a few times.
               "She's not worth a dot more than a thousand dollars. I couldn't give
                  it for her, because I couldn't make it out on her. The fact is, she'll get a bad
                  name by passing through so many hands—a deuced bad name!" says Graspum, whose
                  commercial language is politically cold. "And then there's her broken
                  wrist—doubtful! doubtful! doubtful! what I can do with her. For a plantation she
                  isn't worth seven coppers, and sempstresses and housemaids of her kind are looked
                  on suspiciously. It's only with great nicety of skill ye can work such property to
                  advantage," he continues, viewing her in one of Mr. Blackmore Blackett's
                  ante-rooms.
               The upshot of the matter is, that Mr. Blackmore Blackett accepts the offer, and
                  Graspum, having again taken the damaged property under his charge, sends it back
                  to his pen. As an offset for the broken wrist, she has three new dresses, two of
                  which were presented by the younger Choicewest, and one by the generous Blackmore
                  Blackett.
               Poor Annette! she leaves for her home in the slave-pen, sad at heart, and in
                  tears. "My mother! Oh, that I had a mother to love me, to say Annette so
                  kindly,—to share with me my heart's bitter anguish. How I could love Nicholas, now
                  that there is no mother to love me!" she mutters as she sobs, wending her way to
                  that place of earthly torment. How different are the feelings of the oppressor. He
                  drinks a social glass of wine with his friend Blackett, lights his cigar most
                  fashionably, bids him a polite good morning, and intimates that a cheque for the
                  amount of the purchase will be ready any time he may be pleased to call. And now
                  he wends his way homeward, little imagining what good fortune awaits him at the
                  pen to which he has despatched his purchase.
               Annette has reached the pen, in which she sits, pensively, holding her bonnet by
                  the strings, the heavy folds of her light auburn hair hanging dishevelled over her
                  shoulders. Melancholy indeed she is, for she has passed an ordeal of unholy
                  brutality. Near her sits one Pringle Blowers, a man of coarse habits, who resides
                  on his rice-plantation, a few miles from the city, into which he frequently comes,
                  much to the annoyance of quietly disposed citizens and guardsmen, who are not
                  unfrequently called upon to preserve the peace he threatens to disturb. Dearly
                  does he love his legitimate brandy, and dearly does it make him pay for the insane
                  frolics it incites him to perpetrate, to the profit of certain saloons, and danger
                  of persons. Madman under the influence of his favourite drink, a strange pride
                  besets his faculties, which is only appeased with the demolition of glass and
                  men's faces. For this strange amusement he has become famous and feared; and as
                  the light of his own besotted
                  countenance makes its appearance, citizens generally are not inclined to interpose
                  any obstacle to the exercise of his belligerent propensities.
               Here he sits, viewing Annette with excited scrutiny. Never before has he seen
                  anything so pretty, so bright, so fascinating—all clothed with a halo of
                  modesty—for sale in the market. The nigger is completely absorbed in the beauty,
                  he mutters to himself: and yet she must be a nigger or she would not be here. That
                  she is an article of sale, then, there can be no doubt. "Van, yer the nicest gal
                  I've seen! Reckon how Grasp. paid a tall shot for ye, eh?" he says, in the
                  exuberance of his fascinated soul. He will draw nearer to her, toss her undulating
                  hair, playfully, and with seeming unconsciousness draw his brawny hand across her
                  bosom. "Didn't mean it!" he exclaims, contorting his broad red face, as she puts
                  out her hand, presses him from her, and disdains his second attempt. "Pluck, I
                  reckon! needn't put on mouths, though, when a feller's only quizzin." He shrugs
                  his great round shoulders, and rolls his wicked eyes.
               "I am not for you, man!" she interrupts: "I would scorn you, were I not enslaved,"
                  she continues, a curl of contempt on her lip, as her very soul kindles with grief.
                  Rising quickly from his side she walked across the pen, and seated herself on the
                  opposite side. Here she casts a frowning look upon him, as if loathing his very
                  presence. This, Mr. Pringle Blowers don't altogether like: slaves have no right to
                  look loathingly on white people. His flushed face glows red with excitement; he
                  runs his brawny fingers through the tufted mats of short curly hair that stand
                  almost erect on his head, draws his capacious jaws into a singular angle, and
                  makes a hideous grimace.
               The terrified girl has no answer to make; she is a forlorn outcast of democracy's
                  rule. He takes the black ribbon from round his neck, bares his bosom more broadly
                  than before, throws the plaid sack in which he is dressed from off him, and
                  leaping as it were across the room, seizes her in his arms. "Kisses are cheap, I
                  reckon, and a feller what don't have enough on 'em 's a fool," he ejaculates, as
                  with a desperate struggle she bounds from his grasp, seizes the knife from a
                  negro's hand as she passes him, and is about to plunge the shining steel into her
                  breast. "Oh, mother, mother!—what have I done?—is not God my Saviour?—has he
                  forsaken me?—left me a prey to those who seek my life?"
               "I settle those things," said a voice in the rear, and immediately a hand grasped
                  her arm, and the knife fell carelessly upon the floor. It was Graspum; the sudden
                  surprise overcame her; she sank back in his arms, and swooned. "She swoons,—how
                  limber, how lifeless she seems!" says Graspum, as with great coolness he calls a
                  negro attendant, orders him to remove her to the grass plat, and bathe her well
                  with cold water. "A good dowsing of water is the cure for fainting niggers," he
                  concludes.
               The black man takes her in his arms, and with great kindness, lays her on the
                  plat, bathes her temples, loosens her dress, and with his rough hand manipulates
                  her arms. How soft and silky they seem to his touch! "Him hard to slave ye, miss,"
                  he says, laying his hand upon her temples, gently, as with commiseration he looks
                  intently on her pallid features.
               "Now, Blowers," says Graspum, as soon as they are by themselves, "what in the name
                  of the Gentiles have you been up to?"
               "Wal—can't say its nothin, a'cos that wouldn't do. But, ye see, the critter made
                  my mouth water so; there was no standin on't! And I wanted to be civil, and she
                  wouldn't,—and I went t' fumlin with her hair what looked so inviting, as there was
                  no resistin on't, and she looked just as sassy as sixty; and to stun the whole,
                  when I only wanted to kiss them ar' temptin lips, the fool was going to kill
                  herself. It wasn't how I cared two buttons about it; but then the feelin just came
                  over me at the time," he answers, shaking his huge sides, giving Graspum a
                  significant wink, and laughing heartily.
               "Never at a loss, I see!" returns the other, nodding his head, pertinently: "If I
                  didn't know ye, Blowers, that might go down without sticking."
               "Ye don't tell where ye raised that critter, eh?" he interrupts, inquisitively,
                  pointing his thumb over his right shoulder, and crooking his finger,
                  comically.
               "Raised her with shiners—lots on 'em!" he rejoins, pushing Mr. Pringle Blowers in
                  the stomach, playfully, with his forefinger.
               
               "Graspum! yer a wicked 'un."
               "Suit ye, kind 'a—eh, Blowers?" he rejoins, enquiringly, maintaining great gravity
                  of manner as he watches each change of Blowers' countenance.
               Blowers laughs in reply. His laugh has something sardonic in it, seeming more
                  vicious as he opens his great wicked mouth, and displays an ugly row of coloured
                  teeth.
               "Sit down, Blowers, sit down!" says Graspum, motioning his hand, with a studied
                  politeness. The two gentlemen take seats side by side, on a wooden bench,
                  stretched across the centre of the pen, for negroes to sit upon. "As I live,
                  Blowers, thar ain't another individual like you in the county. You can whip a file
                  of common guardsmen, put the Mayor's court through a course of affronts, frighten
                  all the females out of the fashionable houses, treat a regiment of volunteers,
                  drink a bar-room dry—"
               "Compliments thick, long and strong," interposes Blowers, winking and wiping his
                  mouth. "Can elect half the members of the assembly!" he concludes.
               "True! nevertheless," rejoins Graspum, "a great man cannot be
                  flattered—compliments are his by merit! And the city knows you're a man of
                  exquisite taste."
               Blowers interrupts with a loud laugh, as he suggests the propriety of seeing the
                  "gal get round again."
               "Not so fast, Blowers; not so fast!" Graspum ejaculates, as Blowers is about to
                  rise from his seat and follow Annette.
               "Well, now!" returns Blowers, remaining seated, "Might just as well come square to
                  the mark,—ye want to sell me that wench?"
               "Truth's truth!" he replies. "Blowers is the man who's got the gold to do it."
               "Name yer price; and no rounding the corners!" exclaims Blowers, his countenance
                  quickening with animation. He takes Graspum by the arm with his left hand, turns
                  him half round, and waits for a reply.
               Seeing it's Blowers, (the keen business man replies, in an off-hand manner), who's
                  a trump in his way, and don't care for a few dollars, he'll take seventeen hundred
                  for her, tin down; not a fraction less! He will have no bantering, inasmuch as his
                  friends all know that he has but one price for niggers, from which it is no use to
                  seek a discount. Mr. Blowers, generally a good judge of such articles, would like
                  one more view at it before fully making up his mind. Graspum calls "Oh, boy!" and
                  the negro making his appearance, says: "Dat gal 'um all right agin; went mos
                  asleep, but am right as parched pen now."
               "Have her coming," he returns, facing Blowers. "Nothing the matter with that gal,"
                  he exclaims, touching his elbow. It is merely one of her flimsy fits; she hasn't
                  quite come to maturity."
               Slowly the negro leads her, weeping (Graspum says they will cry—it's
                  natural!) into the presence of the far-famed and much-feared Mr. Pringle Blowers.
                  Her hair hangs carelessly about her neck and shoulders, the open incision of her
                  dress discloses a neatly worked stomacher; how sweetly glows the melancholy that
                  broods over her countenance! "I'll take her—I'll take her!" exclaims Blowers, in
                  spasmodic ecstasy.
               "I know'd you would; I'll suit you to a charm," rejoins the man of trade,
                  laconically, as the negro steps a few feet backward, and watches the process.
                  "Considers it a trade," is the reply of Blowers, as he orders his waggon to be
                  brought to the door.
               "Oh! master, master! save me-save me! and let me die in peace. Don't, good master,
                  don't sell me again!" Thus saying she falls on her knees at Graspum's feet, and
                  with hands uplifted beseeches him to save her from the hands of a man whose very
                  sight she loathes. She reads the man's character in his face; she knows too well
                  the hellish purpose for which he buys her. Bitter, bitter, are the tears of
                  anguish she sheds at his feet, deep and piercing are her bemoanings. Again her
                  soft, sorrowing eyes wander in prayer to heaven: as Graspum is a husband, a
                  brother, and a father,—whose children are yet in the world's travel of
                  uncertainty, she beseeches him to save her from that man.
               "Don't be mad, girl," he says, pushing her hand from him.
               "Frightened, eh? Make ye love me, yet! Why, gal, ye never had such a master in the
                  world as I'll be to ye. I lay I makes a lady on ye, and lets ye have it all yer
                  own way, afore a fortnight," he rejoins, spreading his brawny arms over her, as
                  she, in an attitude of fright, vaults from beneath them, and, uttering a faint cry, glides
                  crouching into a corner of the pen. There is no protection for her now; her
                  weepings and implorings fall harmless on the slavedealer's ears; heaven will
                  protect her when earth knows her no more!
               "There's two can play a game like that, gal!" exclaims Blowers. "Rough play like
                  that don't do with this ere citizen. Can just take the vixen out on a dozen on ye
                  as what don't know what's good for 'em." Blowers is evidently allowing his temper
                  to get the better of him. He stands a few feet from her, makes grim his florid
                  face, gesticulates his hands, and daringly advances toward her as the negro
                  announces the arrival of his waggon.
               "You must go with him, girl; stop working yourself into a fever; stop it, I say,"
                  interposes Graspum, peremptorily. "The waggon! the waggon! the waggon! to carry me
                  away, away;—never, never to return and see my mother?" she exclaims, as well nigh
                  in convulsions she shrieks, when Blowers grasps her in his arms (Graspum saying,
                  be gentle, Blowers), drags her to the door, and by force thrusts her into the
                  waggon, stifling her cries as on the road they drive quickly away. As the last
                  faint wail dies away, and the vehicle bearing its victim disappears in the
                  distance, we think how sweet is liberty, how prone to injustice is man, how
                  crushing of right are democracy's base practices.
               "Does seem kind of hard; but it's a righteous good sale. Shouldn't wonder if she
                  played the same game on him she did with t'other two fools. Get her back then, and
                  sell her over again. Well! come now; there's no great loss
                  without—some—small—gain!" says Graspum, as, standing his prominent figure in the
                  door of his man pen, he watches the woman pass out of sight, thrusts his hands
                  deep into his breeches pockets, and commences humming an air for his own special
                  amusement.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLI.
               NICHOLAS'S SIMPLE STORY.
               THE reader will remember that we left Nicholas seeking his way to Mr. Grabguy's
                  workshop, situated in the outskirts of the city. And we must here inform him that
                  considerable change in the social position of the younger Grabguy family has taken
                  place since we left them, which is some years ago. The elder Grabguy, who, it will
                  be remembered, was very distinguished as his Worship the Mayor of the City (that
                  also was some years ago), has departed this life, leaving the present principal of
                  the Grabguy family a large portion of his estate, which, being mostly of "nigger
                  property," requires some little transforming before it can be made to suit his
                  more extended business arrangements. This material addition to the already
                  well-reputed estate of Mr. Grabguy warrants his admittance into very respectable,
                  and, some say, rather distinguished society. Indeed, it is more than whispered,
                  that when the question of admitting Mr. and Mrs. Grabguy to the membership of a
                  very select circle, the saintly cognomen of which is as indefinable as its system
                  of selecting members, or the angles presented by the nasal organs of a few ladies
                  when anything short of the very first families are proposed, there were seven very
                  fashionable ladies for, and only three against. The greatest antagonist the
                  Grabguys have to getting into the embrace of this very select circle is Mrs. Chief
                  Justice Pimpkins, a matronly body of some fifty summers, who declares there can be
                  no judge in the world so clever as her own dear Pimpkins, and that society was
                  becoming so vulgar and coarse, and so many low people—whose English was as
                  hopefully bad as could be, and who never spoke when they didn't impugn her risible
                  nerves—were intruding themselves upon its polished sanctity, that she felt more
                  and more every day the necessity of withdrawing entirely from it, and enjoying her
                  own exclusively distinguished self. In the case of Grabguy's admittance to the St.
                  Cecilia, my Lady Pimpkins—she is
                  commonly called Lady Chief Justice Pimpkins—had two most formidable black balls;
                  the first because Mrs. Grabguy's father was a bread-baker, and the second that the
                  present Grabguy could not be considered a gentleman while he continued in
                  mechanical business. Another serious objection Mrs. Pimpkins would merely suggest
                  as a preventive;—such people were ill suited to mix with titled and other
                  distinguished society! But, Grabguy, to make up for the vexatious rejection, has
                  got to be an alderman, which is a step upward in the scale of his father's
                  attained distinction. There is nothing more natural, then, than that Grabguy
                  should seek his way up in the world, with the best means at his hands; it is a
                  worthy trait of human nature, and is as natural to the slave. In this
                  instance—when master and slave are both incited to a noble purpose—Grabguy is a
                  wealthy alderman, and Nicholas—the whiter of the two—his abject slave. The master,
                  a man of meagre mind, and exceedingly avaricious, would make himself distinguished
                  in society; the slave, a mercurial being of impassioned temper, whose mind is
                  quickened by a sense of the injustice that robs him of his rights, seeks only
                  freedom and what may follow in its order.
               Let us again introduce the reader to Nicholas, as his manly figure, marked with
                  impressive features, stands before us, in Grabguy's workshop. Tall, and finely
                  formed, he has grown to manhood, retaining all the quick fiery impulses of his
                  race. Those black eyes wandering irresistibly, that curl of contempt that sits
                  upon his lip, that stare of revenge that scowls beneath those heavy eyebrows, and
                  that hate of wrong that ever and anon pervades the whole, tell how burns in his
                  heart the elements of a will that would brave death for its rights—that would bear
                  unmoved the oppressor's lash—that would embrace death rather than yield to
                  perfidy. He tells us—"I came here, sold—so they said—by God's will. Well. I
                  thought to myself, isn't this strange, that a curious God—they tell me he loves
                  everybody—should sell me? It all seemed like a misty waste to me. I remembered
                  home—I learned to read, myself—I remembered mother, I loved her, but she left me,
                  and I have never seen her since. I loved her, dear mother! I did love her; but
                  they said she was gone far away, and I musn't mind if I never see'd her again. It
                  seemed hard and strange, but I had to put up with it, for they said I never had a
                  father, and my mother had no right to me" (his piercing black eyes glare, as
                  fervently he says, mother!). "I thought, at last, it was true, for
                  everybody had a right to call me nigger,—a blasted white nigger, a nigger as
                  wouldn't be worth nothing. And then they used to kick me, and cuff me, and lash
                  me; and if nigger was nigger I was worse than a nigger, because every black nigger
                  was laughing at me, and telling me what a fool of a white nigger I was;—that white
                  niggers was nobody, could be nobody, and was never intended for nobody, as nobody
                  knew where white niggers come from. But I didn't believe all this; it warn't
                  sensible. Something said—Nicholas! you're just as good as anybody: learn to read,
                  write, and cypher, and you'll be something yet. And this something—I couldn't tell
                  what it was, nor could I describe it—seemed irresistible in its power to carry me
                  to be that somebody it prompted in my feelings. I was white, and when I looked at
                  myself I knew I wasn't a nigger; and feeling that everybody could be somebody, I
                  began to look forward to the time when I should rise above the burden of
                  misfortune that seemed bearing me down into the earth. And then, Franconia, like a
                  sister, used to come to me, and say so many kind things to me that I felt
                  relieved, and resolved to go forward. Then I lost sight of Franconia, and saw
                  nobody I knew but Annette; and she seemed so pretty, and loved me so
                  affectionately. How long it seems since I have seen her! She dressed me so nicely,
                  and parted my hair, and kissed me so kindly; and said good-by, when I left her, so
                  in regret, I never can forget it. And it was then they said I was sold. Mr.
                  Graspum said he owned me, and owning me was equal to doing what he pleased with
                  me. Then I went home to Mr. Grabguy's; and they said Mr. Grabguy owned me just as
                  he owned his great big dog they called a democratic bull-dog, the foreman said he
                  paid a democratic ten-dollar gold piece for. They used to say the only difference
                  between me and the dog was, that the dog could go where he pleased without being
                  lashed, and I couldn't. And the dog always got enough to eat, and seemed a great
                  favourite with everybody, whereas I got only more kicks than cucumbers, didn't
                  seem liked by anybody, and if I got enough to eat I had nobody to thank but good
                  old Margery, the cook, who was kind to me now and then, and used to say—"I like you, Nicholas!" And
                  that used to make me feel so happy! Old Margery was coal-black; but I didn't care
                  for that,—the knowledge of somebody loving you is enough to light up the happy of
                  life, and make the heart feel contented. In this manner my thoughts went here and
                  there and everywhere; and the truth is, I had so many thoughts, that I got
                  completely bewildered in thinking how I was to better myself, and be like other
                  folks. Mr. Grabguy seemed kind to me at first,—said he would make a great mechanic
                  of me, and give me a chance to buy myself. I didn't know what this "buy myself"
                  meant, at first. But I soon found out—he tells us he must speak with caution—that
                  I must pay so many hundred dollars afore I could be like other folks. The kindness
                  Mr. Grabguy at first exhibited for me didn't last long; he soon began to kick me,
                  and cuff me, and swear at me. And it 'pear'd to me as if I never could please
                  anybody, and so my feelings got so embittered I didn't know what to do. I was put
                  into the shop among the men, and one said Nigger, here! and another said, Nigger,
                  get there!—and they all seemed not to be inclined to help me along. And then I
                  would get in a passion: but that never made things better. The foreman now and
                  then said a kind word to me; and whenever he did, it made my heart feel so good
                  that I seemed a new being with brighter hopes. Well, Mr. Grabguy put me to turning
                  the grindstone, first; and from turning the grindstone—the men used to throw water
                  in my face when they ground their chisels, and their plane irons, and axes and
                  adzes—I was learned to saw, and to plain boards, and then to mortice and frame,
                  and make mouldings, and window-sashes, and door-frames. When I could do all these,
                  master used to say I was bound to make a great workman, and, laughingly, would say
                  I was the most valuable property he ever owned. About this time I began to find
                  out how it was that the other white folks owned themselves and master owned me;
                  but then, if I said anything about it, master might tie me up and lash me as he
                  used to do; and so I remained quiet, but kept up a thinking. By and by I got
                  perfect at the carpenter's trade, and I learned engineering; and when I had got
                  engineering perfect, I took a fancy for making stucco work and images. And people
                  said I learned wondrously fast, and was the best workman far or near. Seeing these
                  things, people used to be coming to me, and talking to me about my value, and then
                  end by wanting me to make them specimens of stucco. I seemed liked by everybody
                  who came to see me, and good people had a kind word for me; but Mr. Grabguy was
                  very strict, and wouldn't allow me to do anything without his permission. People
                  said my work was perfect, and master said I was a perfect piece of property; and
                  it used to pain deep into my heart when master spoke so. Well! I got to be a man,
                  and when the foreman got drunk master used to put me in his place. And after a
                  while I got to be foreman altogether: but I was a slave, they said, and men
                  wouldn't follow my directions when master was away; they all acknowledged that I
                  was a good workman, but said a nigger never should be allowed to direct and order
                  white people. That made my very blood boil, as I grew older, because I was whiter
                  than many of them. However, submit was the word; and I bore up and trusted to
                  heaven for deliverance, hoping the day would come soon when its will would be
                  carried out. With my knowledge of mechanics increased a love of learning, which
                  almost amounted to a passion. They said it was against the law for a nigger to
                  read; but I was raised so far above black niggers that I didn't mind what the law
                  said: so I got 'Pilgrim's Progress,' and the Bible, and 'Young's Night Thoughts,'
                  and from them I learned great truths: they gave me new hopes, refreshed my weary
                  soul, and made me like a new-clothed being ready to soar above the injustice of
                  this life. Oh, how I read them at night, and re-read them in the morning, and
                  every time found something new in them, something that suited my case! Through the
                  sentiments imbibed from them I saw freedom hanging out its light of love,
                  fascinating me, and inciting me to make a death struggle to gain it.
               "One day, as I was thinking of my hard fate, and how I did all the work and master
                  got all the money for it—and how I had to live and how he lived, master came
                  in—looking good-natured. He approached me, shook hands with me, said I was worth
                  my weight in gold; and then asked me how I would like to be free. I told him I
                  would jump for joy, would sing praises, and be glad all the day long.
               "'Aint you contented where you are, Nicholas?' he enquired. I told him I didn't
                  dislike him; but freedom was sweetest.
                  'Give me a chance of my freedom, master, and yet you may know me as a man,' says
                  I, feeling that to be free was to be among the living; to be a slave was to be
                  among the moving dead. To this he said, he always had liked me, was proud of me,
                  had unbounded confidence in my directions over the men, and always felt safe when
                  he went from home leaving things in my charge. 'In this view of the case,
                  Nicholas,' he says, 'I have come to the conclusion,—and it's Mrs. Grabguy's
                  conclusion, too,—to let you work evenings, on overtime, for yourself. You can earn
                  a deal of money that way, if you please; just save it up, and let me keep it for
                  you, and in consideration of your faithfulness I will set you free whenever you
                  get a thousand dollars to put into my hands. Now that's generous—I want to do the
                  straight thing, and so Mrs. Grabguy wants to do the straight thing; and what money
                  you save you can put in Mrs. Grabguy's hands for safe keeping. She's a
                  noble-minded woman, and 'll take good care of it.' This was to me like entering
                  upon a new life of hope and joy. How my heart yearned for the coming day, when I
                  should be free like other folks! I worked and struggled by night and day; and good
                  Mr. Simons befriended me, and procured me many little orders, which I executed,
                  and for which I got good pay. All my own earnings I put into Mrs. Grabguy's hands;
                  and she told me she would keep it for me, safe, till I got enough to buy my
                  freedom. My confidence in these assurances was undivided. I looked upon Mrs.
                  Grabguy as a friend and mother; and good Mr. Simons, who was poor but honest, did
                  many kind things to help me out. When I got one hundred dollars in missus' hands I
                  jumped for joy; with it I seemed to have got over the first difficult step in the
                  great mountain. Then missus said I must take Jerushe for my wife. I didn't like
                  Jerushe at first—she was almost black; but missus said we were both slaves; hence,
                  that could be no objection. As missus's order was equally as positive as master's,
                  there was no alternative but to obey it, and Jerushe became my wife. We were
                  lawfully married, and missus made a nice little party for us, and Jerushe loved
                  me, and was kind to me, and her solicitude for my welfare soon made me repay her
                  love. I pitied her condition, and she seemed to pity mine; and I soon forgot that
                  she was black, and we lived happily together, and had two children, which missus
                  said were hers. It was hard to reconcile this, and yet it was so, by law as well
                  as social right. But then missus was kind to Jerushe, and let her buy her time at
                  four dollars a week, which, having learned to make dresses, she could pay and have
                  a small surplus to lay by every week. Jerushe knew I was struggling for freedom,
                  and she would help me to buy that freedom, knowing that, if I was free, I would
                  return her kindness, and struggle to make her free, and our children free.
               "Years rolled on,—we had placed nearly five hundred dollars in missus's hands: but
                  how vain were the hopes that had borne us through so many privations for the
                  accumulation of this portion of our price of freedom! Master has sold my
                  children,—yes, sold them! He will not tell me where nor to whom. Missus will
                  neither see nor hear me; and master threatens to sell me to New Orleans if I
                  resent his act. To what tribunal can I appeal for justice? Shut from the laws of
                  my native land, what justice is there for the slave where injustice makes its law
                  oppression? Master may sell me, but he cannot vanquish the spirit God has given
                  me; never, never, will I yield to his nefarious designs. I have but one life to
                  yield up a sacrifice for right—I care not to live for wrong!" Thus he speaks, as
                  his frenzied soul burns with indignation. His soul's love was freedom; he asked
                  but justice to achieve it. Sick at heart he has thrown up that zeal for his
                  master's welfare which bore him onward, summoned his determination to resist to
                  the last—to die rather than again confront the dreary waste of a slave's life.
                  Grabguy has forfeited the amount deposited by Nicholas as part of the price of his
                  freedom,—betrayed his confidence.
               He tells us his simple story, as the workmen, with fear on their countenances,
                  move heedlessly about the room. As he concludes, Grabguy, with sullen countenance,
                  enters the great door at the end of the building; he is followed by three men in
                  official garbs, two of whom bear manacles in their hands. Nicholas's dark eye
                  flashes upon them, and with an instinctive knowledge of their errand, he seizes a
                  broad axe, salutes them, and, defiantly, cautions their advance. Grabguy heeds
                  not; and as the aggrieved man slowly retreats backward to protect himself with the wall, still keeping his eye
                  set on Grabguy, two negroes make a sudden spring upon him from behind, fetter his
                  arms as the officers rush forward, bind him hand and foot, and drag him to the
                  door, regardless of his cries for mercy: they bind him to a dray, and drive
                  through the streets to the slave pen of Graspum. We hear his pleading voice, as
                  his ruffian captors, their prey secure, disappear among the busy crowd.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLII.
               HE WOULD DELIVER HER FROM BONDAGE.
               ABOUT twelve o'clock of a hazy night, in the month of November, and while Annette,
                  in the hands of Mr. Pringle Blowers, with death-like tenacity refuses to yield to
                  his vile purposes, a little taunt-rigged schooner may be seen stealing her way
                  through the grey mist into Charleston inner harbour. Like a mysterious messenger,
                  she advances noiselessly, gibes her half-dimmed sails, rounds to a short distance
                  from an old fort that stands on a ridge of flats extending into the sea, drops her
                  anchor, and furls her sails. We hear the rumble of the chain, and "aye, aye!"
                  sound on the still air, like the murmur of voices in the clouds. A pause is
                  followed by the sharp sound of voices echoing through the hollow mist; then she
                  rides like a thing of life reposing on the polished water, her masts half obscured
                  in mist, looming high above, like a spectre in gauze shroud. The sound dies away,
                  and dimly we see the figure of a man pacing the deck from fore-shroud to taffrail.
                  Now and then he stops at the wheel, casts sundry glances about the horizon, as if
                  to catch a recognition of some point of land near by, and walks again. Now he
                  places his body against the spokes, leans forward, and compares the "lay" of the
                  land with points of compass. He will reach his hand into the binnacle, to note the
                  compass with his finger, and wait its traversing motion. Apparently satisfied, he
                  moves his slow way along again; now folding his arms, as if in deep study, then
                  locking his hands behind him, and drooping his head. He paces and paces for an
                  hour, retires below, and all is still.
               Early on the following morning, a man of middle stature, genteelly dressed, may be
                  seen leaving the craft in a boat, which, rowed by two seamen, soon reaches a
                  wharf, upon the landing slip of which he disembarks. He looks pale, and his
                  countenance wears a placidness indicating a mind absorbed in reflection. With a
                  carpet-bag in his right hand does he ascend the steps to the crown of the wharf,
                  as the boat returns to the
                  mysterious-looking craft. Standing on the capsill for a few minutes, his blue eyes
                  wander over the scene, as if to detect some familiar object. The warehouses along
                  the wharfs wear a dingy, neglected air; immense piles of cotton bales stand under
                  slender sheds erected here and there along the line of buildings which form a
                  curvature declining to the east and west. Again, open spaces are strewn with bales
                  of cotton waiting its turn through the press (a large building near by, from which
                  steam is issuing in successive puffings and roarings); from which compressed bales
                  emerge out of the lower story, followed by a dozen half-naked negroes, who,
                  half-bent, trundle it onward into piles, or on board ships. Far above these is
                  spread out a semicircle of dwellings, having a gloomy and irregular appearance,
                  devoid of that freshness and brightness which so distinguish every New England
                  city. The bustle of the day is just commencing, and the half-mantled ships, lying
                  unmoved at the wharfs, give out signs of activity. The new comer is about to move
                  on up the wharf, when suddenly he is accosted by a negro, who, in ragged garb,
                  touches his hat politely, and says, with a smile, "Yer sarvant, mas'r!"
               "Your name, my boy?" returns the man, in a kind tone of voice. The negro,
                  thrusting his hands deep into the pockets of his old sack coat, seems
                  contemplating an answer. He has had several names, both surname and Christian;
                  names are but of little value to a slave. "Pompe they once called me, but da'
                  calls me Bill now," he answers, eyeing the stranger, suspiciously. "Pompe, Pompe!
                  I've heard that name: how familiar it sounds!" the stranger says to himself.
               "One mas'r call me Turtle Tom," rejoins the negro, scratching his head the
                  while.
               "Turtle Tom!" reiterates the stranger. "Had you no other name coupled with Pompe,
                  when that was the name by which you were recognised?"
               The negro will not wait his finishing the sentence. He says he had good old
                  mas'r's name; but good old mas'r—"so dey tells"—dead and gone long time ago. "His
                  name was Marston; and dat war dis child's name den, God bless 'um!" he answers the
                  stranger.
               "Marston, who lived on the banks of the Ashley?" again he enquires, as his face
                  crimsons with excitement.
               "Dat war my mas'r; and dem war good old times when I lived dar," returns the
                  negro, significantly nodding his head.
               "Then you are the first man I have met, the first I want to see," exclaimed the
                  stranger, grasping the negro by the hand, and, much to his surprise, shaking it
                  heartily.
               "'Taint Lorenzo," returns the negro, contemplating the stranger with
                  astonishment.
               The stranger is not Lorenzo, but he has heard much of him. What happy
                  recollections its familiar sound recalls: how it strengthens his hopes of success
                  in his mission. The negro tells him he is a labourer on the wharf, and cannot
                  leave to conduct him to an hotel; he will, however, direct the stranger to a
                  comfortable abode in Church Street. It is quiet and unostentatious, but will serve
                  his purpose. Placing a piece of money in the negro's hand, he assures him that he
                  is his friend—has much need of his services—will pay him well for their
                  employment. He has equally aroused the negro's curiosity; and, were it nothing
                  more than satisfying that, he would be faithful to his promise to call the same
                  night at seven o'clock. Precisely at that hour the negro will fulfil his
                  engagement. The stranger wends his way to Church Street, and up a narrow alley, on
                  the left hand side, finds comfortable apartments, as directed. Here he makes his
                  toilet, and sallies out to reconnoitre the city. Meanwhile the little craft is
                  entered at the custom-house as a fruiter, bound from New Providence to New York,
                  and put in for a harbour. There is something suspicious about a fruiter putting in
                  for a harbour at this season, and many curious glances are cast upon the little
                  captain as he bows to the truth of his entry before the deputy collector.
               The stranger has spent the day in viewing the city, and at nightfall, the negro,
                  true to his engagement, presents his sable figure at his lodgings. A servant
                  having shown him up stairs, he is ushered into his presence, where, seeming
                  bewildered, he looks about inquiringly, as if doubting the object for which he has
                  been summoned. Abjectly he holds his tattered cap in his hand, and tremblingly
                  inquires what master wants with him.
               "Have confidence, my good fellow," the stranger speaks, with a smile; "my mission
                  is love and peace." He places a chair beside a small table in the centre of the
                     room; bids the negro sit down, which
                  he does with some hesitation. The room is small; it contains a table, bureau,
                  washstand, bed, and four chairs, which, together with a few small prints hanging
                  from the dingy walls, and a square piece of carpet in the centre of the room,
                  constitute its furniture. "You know Marston's plantation—know it as it was when
                  Marston resided thereon, do you?" enquires the stranger, seating himself beside
                  the negro, who evidently is not used to this sort of familiarity.
               "Know 'um well, dat I does," answers the negro, quickly, as if the question had
                  recalled scenes of the past.
               "And you know the people, too, I suppose?"
               "Da'h people!" ejaculates the negro, with a rhapsody of enthusiasm; "reckon I
                  does."
               "Will you recount them."
               The negro, commencing with old master, recounts the names of Miss Franconia,
                  Clotilda, Ellen, Aunt Rachel, old Daddy Bob, and Harry.
               "It is enough," says the stranger, "they are all familiar names."
               "Did you know my good old master?" interrupts the negro, suddenly, as if detecting
                  some familiar feature in the stranger's countenance.
               "No," he replies, measuredly; "but his name has sounded in my ears a thousand
                  times. Tell me where are the children, Annette and Nicholas? and where may I find
                  Franconia?"
               The negro shakes his head, and remains silent for a few minutes. At length he
                  raises his hand, and in a half-whisper says, "Gone, gone, gone; sold and
                  scattered, good mas'r. Habn't see dem child dis many a day: reckon da'h done gone
                  down south." He hesitates suddenly, as if calling something to memory; and then,
                  placing his left hand on the stranger's right arm, as he rubs his left across his
                  forehead, stammers out—"Mas'r, mas'r, I reckon dis child do know somefin 'bout
                  Miss Frankone. Anyhow, mas'r (ye knows I'se nigger do'h, and don't keep up
                  'quaintance a'ter mas'r sell um), can put ye straight 'bout Missus Rosebrook's
                  house, and reckon how dat lady can put ye straight on Miss Frankone's where'bout."
                  It is what the stranger wants. He has heard of Mrs. Rosebrook before; she will
                  give him the information he seeks; so, turning again to the negro, he tells him
                  that, for a few days at least, he shall require his presence at the same hour in
                  the evening: tonight he must conduct him to Mrs. Rosebrook's sequestered
                  villa.
               The watch-tower bell of the guard-house sounds forth nine o'clock. The
                  soldier-like sentinel, pacing with loaded musket, and armed with sharpest steel,
                  cries out in hoarse accents, "All's well!" The bell is summoning all negroes to
                  their habitations: our guide, Bill, informs the stranger that he must have a
                  "pass" from a white man before he can venture into the street. "Mas'r may write
                  'um," he says, knowing that it matters but little from whom it comes, so long as
                  the writer be a white man. The pass is written; the negro partakes of refreshment
                  that has been prepared for him at the stranger's request, and they are wending
                  their way through the city. They pass between rows of massive buildings, many of
                  which have an antique appearance, and bear strong signs of neglect; but their
                  unique style of architecture denotes the taste of the time in which they were
                  erected. Some are distinguished by heavy stone colonnades, others by verandas of
                  fret-work, with large gothic windows standing in bold outline. Gloomy-looking
                  guard-houses, from which numerous armed men are issuing forth for the night's
                  duty,—patrolling figures with white cross belts, and armed with batons, standing
                  at corners of streets, or moving along with heavy tread on the uneven
                  side-walk,—give the city an air of military importance. The love of freedom is
                  dangerous in this democratic world; liberty is simply a privilege. Again the
                  stranger and his guide (the negro) emerge into narrow lanes, and pass along
                  between rows of small dwellings inhabited by negroes; but at every turn they
                  encounter mounted soldiery, riding two abreast, heavily armed. "Democracy, boast
                  not of thy privileges! tell no man thou governest with equal justice!" said the
                  stranger to himself, as the gas-light shed its flickers upon this military array
                  formed to suppress liberty.
               They have reached the outskirts of the city, and are approaching a pretty villa,
                  which the negro, who has been explaining the nature and duties of this formidable
                  display of citizen soldiery, points to, as the peaceful home of the Rosebrook
                  family. Brighter and brighter, as they approach, glares the bright light of a
                  window in the north front. "I wish
                  Mas'r Rosebrook owned me," says the negro, stopping at the garden gate, and
                  viewing the pretty enclosure ere he opens it. "If ebery mas'r and missus war as
                  kind as da'h is, dar wouldn't be no need o' dem guard-houses and dem guardmen wid
                  dar savage steel," he continues, opening the gate gently, and motioning the
                  stranger to walk in. Noiselessly he advances up the brick walk to the hall
                  entrance, and rings the bell. A well-dressed negro man soon makes his appearance,
                  receives him politely, as the guide retires, and ushers him into a sumptuously
                  furnished parlour. The Rosebrook negroes quickly recognise a gentleman, and
                  detecting it in the bearing of the stranger they treat him as such. Mrs.
                  Rosebrook, followed by her husband, soon makes her appearance, saluting the
                  stranger with her usual suavity. "I have come, madam," he says, "on a strange
                  mission. With you I make no secret of it; should I be successful it will remove
                  the grief and anxiety of one who has for years mourned the fate of her on whom all
                  her affections seem to have centred. If you will but read this it will save the
                  further recital of my mission." Thus saying, he drew a letter from his pocket,
                  presented it, and watched her countenance as line by line she read it, and, with
                  tears glistening in her eyes, passed it to her husband.
               "I am, good sir, heartily glad your mission is thus laudable. Be at home, and
                  while you are in the city let our home be yours. Franconia is here with us
                  to-night; the child you search after is also with us, and it was but to-day we
                  learned the cruelties to which she has been subjected during the last few years.
                  Indeed, her fate had been kept concealed from us until a few weeks ago, and
                  to-day, having escaped the brutal designs of a ruffian, she fled to us for
                  protection, and is now concealed under our roof—"
               "Yes, poor wretch—it is too true!" rejoins Rosebrook. "But something must be done
                  as quickly as possible, for if Pringle Blowers regains her she will be subjected
                  to tortures her frame is too delicate to bear up under. There must be no time
                  lost, not a day!" he says, as Mrs. Rosebrook quickly leaves the room to convey the
                  news to Franconia, who, with Annette, is in an adjoining apartment.
               Like a hunted deer, Annette's fears were excited on hearing the stranger enter;
                  Franconia is endeavoring to quiet them. The poor slave fears the ruffian's
                  pursuit, trembles at each foot-fall upon the door-sill, and piteously turns to her
                  old friend for protection. Blowers, maddened with disappointment, would rather
                  sacrifice her to infamy than sell her for money to a good master. The price of a
                  pretty slave is no object with this boasting democrat,—the gratification of his
                  carnal desires soars supreme. Rosebrook knows this, as the abject woman does to
                  her sorrow.
               As Rosebrook and the stranger sit conversing upon the object of his mission, and
                  the best way to effect it, this good woman returns leading by the arm a
                  delicately-formed girl, whose blonde countenance is shadowed with an air of
                  melancholy which rather adds to her charms than detracts from her beauty. The
                  stranger's eye rests upon her,—quickly he recognises Clotilda's features,
                  Clotilda's form, and gentleness; but she is fairer than Clotilda, has blue eyes,
                  and almost golden hair. She hesitates as her eyes meet the stranger's. "Do not
                  fear, my child," speaks Franconia, whose slender figure follows her into the room.
                  Assured that the stranger is her friend, she is introduced to him, and modestly
                  takes her seat on a chair by the window. The stranger's name is Maxwell, and on
                  hearing it announced Franconia anticipated the pleasure of meeting with her old
                  friend, through whose agency she effected Clotilda's escape. Advancing towards him
                  with extended hand, she looks enquiringly in his face, saying, "Am I mistaken?"
                  She shakes her head, doubtingly. "No! it is not my friend Maxwell," she
                  continues.
               "No!" rejoins the stranger; "he is my cousin: by his directions I have come here.
                  I have brought a letter from his wife Clotilda, whose dear deliverer you were; and
                  whose thoughts now daily recur to you, to your love and kindness to her, with
                  undying brightness." "Ah!" interrupts Franconia, welcoming him with a fervent
                  heart, "I knew Clotilda would never forget Annette; I knew she would remember me;
                  I knew her ardent soul would give forth its measure of gratitude. Happy am I that
                  you have come—though years have rolled by since I gave up all hopes of the joyous
                  consummation—to relieve this sorrowing child," she says, running to Annette, and
                  with tears of joy in her eyes, exclaiming, "My child! my child! you 'll yet be
                  saved. The ruffian who tortured you to-day will torture you no more—no more!" And she kisses the sorrowing
                  girl's cheek, as tears of sympathy gush into her eyes.
               Rosebrook handed Franconia the letter, which she read as her face brightened with
                  joy. "Good Clotilda! how happy she must be! How generous, how kind, how true dear
                  Maxwell was to her; and they are living together so comfortably, and have such a
                  nice family growing up; but she wants her slave child! A slave mother never
                  forgets her slave offspring!" she exclaims, with enthusiastic delight, as she
                  reads and re-reads the letter. Back she paces to Annette, lays her right arm
                  gently over her shoulder, and pats her cheek with her left hand: "Annette will see
                  her mother, yet. There is an all-protecting hand guiding us through every ill of
                  life. Be of good cheer, my child; never despond while there is a hope left; bury
                  the horrors of the past in the brighter prospect of the future." And leading her
                  to the table she seats her by her side and reads the letter aloud, as with joy the
                  forlorn girl's feelings bound forth. We need scarcely tell the reader that
                  Clotilda's letter was read in listening silence, and ran thus:—

                              "My Dear Franconia,
                              "My thoughts have never ceased to recur to you, nor to my dear
                                 Annette. You were a mother and a deliverer to me; I know—though I
                                 have not received a word in reply to any of my letters—you have
                                 been a mother to my child. As you know, I dare not write as much as
                                 I would, lest this letter fall into the hands of those whose
                                 interest it is to perpetuate our enslavement. I hope you are happy
                                 with a good husband, as I am. Years have rolled by since we parted,
                                 and many have been the scenes and changes through which I have
                                 passed, but they were all pleasant changes, each for brighter and
                                 happier prospects. I was married to him who, with you, effected my
                                 escape, a few weeks after landing at Harbour Island. Since then we
                                 have resided in Nassau, where my husband, who loves me dearly,
                                 pursues an extensive and lucrative business, and we both move in
                                 the best society of the place. We have a pretty family of three
                                 children, the oldest nine years old, and the youngest five. How my
                                 heart would leap with joy if I thought you would accept an
                                 invitation to come and see me, to spend a few weeks with me, and
                                 see yourself how comfortable and happy a slave may be! Perhaps I
                                 should not say happy, for I never can be truly happy without my
                                 Annette. Something haunts my mind whenever I recur to her,—which is
                                 every day. And then I have written so many letters to which no
                                 answers have been returned; but, a whispering angel, as if to
                                 console me, says, Franconia will be her mother, and you will yet
                                 see her.
                              "The gentleman who bears this letter is my husband's cousin. He has
                                 all my husband's generosity of character, and will seek you for the
                                 purpose of finding Annette, and bearing her safely to me. He has
                                 proffered his services, and sworn to carry out his object; and
                                 being on his way to New York for the purpose of entering into
                                 business with his uncle now in that city, will touch at Charleston,
                                 for the object herein stated. Further his object, my dear
                                 Franconia, and that heaven will reward the hand that in mercy helps
                                 the enslaved,

               "I knew mother would never forget me; I knew she would come back to me, would be
                  kind to me, as she used to be, and save me from such cruelty as I have suffered.
                  Several times have I resolved on putting an end to my unhappy existence, but as
                  often did something say to me, 'live hoping—there is a better day coming.' God
                  guides, governs, and raises up the weary soul," says Annette, in touching accents,
                  as Franconia finished reading the letter.
               While this conversation is progressing, and the plan of getting Annette out of the
                  city being devised, a nice supper, at Mrs. Rosebrook's request, is being prepared
                  in the adjoining room. To this the stranger is invited, and all sit down in a
                  happy circle. Franconia seems invested with new life; Annette forgets for the time
                  her troubles; Mrs. Rosebrook, who does the honours of the table, wishes every
                  ill-used slave could find means of escaping into freedom; and Deacon Rosebrook
                  says he will join heart and hand in getting the forlorn girl free from her base
                  purchaser.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLIII.
               OTHER PHASES OF THE SUBJECT.
               WE must leave to the reader's imagination much that transpired at the Rosebrook
                  Villa during the night above mentioned, and ask him to accompany us on the
                  following morning, when curious placards may be seen posted here and there at
                  corners of streets and other conspicuous places about the city. Mr. Pringle
                  Blowers has lost a beautiful female slave, whose fair hair, beautiful complexion,
                  deep blue eyes, delicate features, and charming promise, is in large type and
                  blackest printer's ink set forth most glowingly. Had Mr. Pringle Blowers been a
                  poet instead of a chivalric rice-planter, he might have emblazoned his loss in
                  sentimental rhyme. But Pringle Blowers says poets always make fools of themselves;
                  and, although the south is a sweet and sunny land, he is happy indeed that it is
                  troubled with none of the miscreants. He owned niggers innumerable; but they were
                  only common stock, all of whom he could have lost without feeling any more than
                  ordinary disappointment at the loss of their worth in money. For this one,
                  however, he had a kind of undefined love, which moved his heart most
                  indescribably. Disappointed in the gratification of his desires, he is mortified
                  and maddened to desperation. Why should a slave he had invested so much money in,
                  and felt so like making a lady of, and never would have thought of setting at
                  field labour, run away? He only wanted her for the most aristocratic purpose the
                  south can provide for a beautiful slave. Hence Mr. Pringle Blowers, through the
                  medium of his knowledge of letters, puts forward his placard—a copy of which he
                  inserts in all the most respectable morning journals—in which the fair outlines of
                  his lost woman are simply set forth. He will give three hundred dollars for her
                  apprehension, fifty dollars more for proof to convict any person of harbouring
                  her, and an additional sum for lodging her in any gaol in the country. This large
                  reward Mr. Pringle Blowers will pay in hard cash; and he has no doubt the offering
                  will be quite enough to excite the hunting propensities of fashionable young
                  gentlemen, as well as inveterate negro hunters. Beside this, negro hunting being
                  rather a democratic sport than otherwise, Mr. Pringle Blowers reconciles his
                  feelings with the fact of these sports being uncommonly successful.
               The reader will naturally conclude that the offer of this large reward produced
                  some sensation in and about the city. People stopped along the streets, read the
                  curious hand-bill, smiled, and made various remarks. Ladies, always curious to
                  know what is prominent among the current events of the day, sent servants to
                  ascertain what so attractive the posters contained. It was, indeed, a regular bit
                  of self-enjoyed fun for them; for the ladies had all heard of Pringle Blowers, and
                  that a female slave for whose capture he would give three hundred dollars had run
                  away from him they were heartily glad to learn.
               The day-police were equally happy to hear of the loss, and anxious to make the
                  capture. In this position it was doubly necessary to be cautious in proceeding to
                  effect the escape of the fair girl. If discovered in the act the stranger might be
                  subjected to a series of 
                     inprisonments
                     imprisonments
                   that would sacrifice his life. Again, he might be assassinated by some
                  disguised hand; or, if an infuriated mob were let loose upon him, no police
                  interference could save his life. As suspicion is ever on the point of giving out
                  its dangerous caprices where a community live fearing one another, so the stranger
                  became sensible of the shafts of suspicion that might at any moment be darted at
                  him. Despatching his schooner on her voyage, he continued for several days walking
                  about the city, as if indifferent to what was passing. He read the curious poster
                  in which was offered the goodly reward for the apprehension of a lost slave,
                  affected great coolness, and even ignorance of the mode by which such articles
                  were recovered.
               Fortunate was it for the stranger that he despatched the schooner without the
                  prize he intended to carry off, for no sooner had she got under way and begun to
                  move down the harbour, than she was boarded by four men, who, producing their
                  authority, searched her from stem to stern. Such were their suspicions, that they
                  would not be satisfied until they had opened a few boxes and bales that were stowed away in the hold. This done, the
                  schooner was permitted to continue her voyage, and the stranger, unmolested,
                  continues his walks about the city. A few days pass and the excitement has calmed
                  down. Pringle Blowers, although chagrined at the loss of his valuable piece of
                  woman property, resolves to wait the issue with patience and forbearance. If she,
                  fool like, has made away with herself, he cannot bring her to life; if she be
                  carried off by villainous kidnappers, they must eventually suffer the
                  consequences. Her beauty will expose their plots. He will absorb his usual
                  requirement of spirit, keep the nerve up, and never despond of regaining her while
                  his reward of three hundred dollars stands before a money-loving public. He would
                  rather have lost two dozen common niggers than this one he set so much by,
                  intended to make so much of, and upon whom he had set his very heart, soul, and
                  burning passions. But there is no profit in grief, no use in giving way to
                  disappointment. Philosophers bear disappointments with fortitude; he must be a
                  philosopher, keep a sharp look out and not despair.
               How different is the scene presented at Rosebrook's Villa! There, Annette is seen,
                  prepared to take her departure. Dressed in male attire, with frock coat and
                  trousers setting so neatly, dress boots, white vest, and brightly arranged
                  shirt-bosom, she is the type of perfection of a youthful southron. Franconia has
                  expended her skill in completing the fair girl's toilet, when Mrs. Rosebrook
                  places a pair of green spectacles over her eyes, bids her look in the glass, and
                  tells her she will pass for a planter's son among a million.
               "Nobody will know me, now," she answers, viewing herself in the mirror. Her neat
                  setting suit, Panama hat, and green spectacles, give a peculiar air to her lithe
                  figure. And though her emotions are well nigh ready to give forth tears, she
                  cannot suppress a smile at the singular transformation of her person.
               "It'll take sharper eyes than policemen's to discover the disguise," says
                  Rosebrook, who, having ordered a carriage to the door, enters the room and takes
                  her kindly by the hand. "Keep up a good heart; don't despond, my child, and the
                  chances are that you'll be safe—you'll be in Wilmington to-morrow morning" he
                  continues: then, turning to Franconia, who will accompany her to that place, he
                  awaits her pleasure. "I am ready!" returns that generous woman, as, arrayed in her
                  travelling dress, she takes Annette by the hand, and is about to proceed to the
                  gate where the carriage waits. Mrs. Rosebrook must take one more fond parting.
                  Laying her right arm over her shoulder, and pressing her to her bosom, she kisses
                  and kisses her fair cheek, bids her remember that God alone is her protector, her
                  guide to a happy future. In freedom may she live to freedom's God; in slavery,
                  hope ever, and trust in his mercy! With this admonition, the excited girl,
                  trembling, leaves the Villa, leaning on Franconia's arm. Bradshaw has the carriage
                  at the door, piled with sundry boxes and portmanteaus, giving it the appearance of
                  a gentleman's travelling equipage. He has orders to drive to the steam-boat
                  landing, where the young invalid planter will embark for New York via Wilmington and the land route. Soon they have
                  taken their seats, and with Rosebrook's good-natured face shining beside Bradshaw,
                  on the front seat, they say their happy adieu! and bound over the road for the
                  steamer.
               It is now within fifteen minutes of the starting time. The wharf presents a
                  bustling scene: carriages and coaches are arriving with eager-looking passengers,
                  who, fearing they are a little behind time, stare about as if bewildered, scold
                  heedless drivers, point out heir baggage to awkward porters who run to and fro
                  with trunks and boxes on their heads, and then nervously seek the ticket-office,
                  where they procure the piece of paper that insures them through to New York.
                  Albeit, finding they have quite time enough on their hands, they escort their
                  female voyagers on board, and loiter about in the way of every one else, enjoying
                  that excitement in others which they have fortunately passed through. Here and
                  there about the wharf, leaning their head carelessly over black piles, are
                  sly-looking policemen, who scan every voyager with a searching eye. They are
                     incog., but the initiated recognise them at a
                  glance. The restless leer of that lynx eye discovers their object; anything, from
                  a runaway nigger to a houseless debtor, is to them acceptable prey. Atween decks
                  of the steamer, secured at the end of the wharf, another scene of bustle and
                  confusion presents itself. A passenger is not quite sure his baggage is all on
                  board, and must needs waste his breath in oaths at the dumb porter, who works at his utmost
                  strength, under the direction of Mr. Mate, whose important figure is poised on the
                  wharf. Another wants to "lay over" at Richmond, and is using most abusive language
                  to a mulatto waiter, who has put his trunk on one side of the boat and carpet bag
                  on the other. A third, a fussy old lady with two rosy-faced daughters she is,
                  against her southern principles, taking to the north to be educated, is making a
                  piteous lamentation over the remains of two bonnets—just from the hands of the
                  milliner—hopelessly smashed in her bandbox. The careless porter set it on a pile
                  of baggage, from where it tottled over under the feet of an astonished gentleman,
                  who endeavours to soothe the good lady's feelings with courteous apologies. On the
                  upper deck, heeding no one, but now and then affecting to read a newspaper, as
                  passengers pace to and fro, is the stranger, seated on one of the side seats. The
                  engineer moves his valve now and then, the cross-head ascends, the steam hisses
                  below, the condenser rumbles, the steam from the funnel roars furiously forth,
                  spreading its scalding vapour through the air. Again, the man, almost
                  imperceptibly touches the iron rod with his finger, the magic monster again moves
                  its piston downward, the wheels make a turn, the massive vessel surges upon her
                  lines, as if eager to press forward on her course. Another gentle touch, and,
                  obeying the summons, the motive power is still; the man subjects the monster with
                  his little finger. He has stopped her near the centre, where, with a slight touch,
                  he can turn back or forward. Again, he lifts a small key, and the steam, with a
                  deafening roar, issues from the escape: he is venting his chest. Simultaneously
                  the second bell sounds forth its clanking medley: two minutes more, and the
                  snake-like craft will be buffeting the waves, on her daily errand. As passengers
                  begin to muster on board, their friends clustering round the capsill of the wharf,
                  obstructing the way, the sturdy figure of Mr. Pringle Blowers may be seen behind a
                  spile near the capsill, his sharp, peering eyes scanning the ship from fore to
                  aft. He is not sure she will get off by this route; common sense tells him that,
                  but there exists a prompting something underneath common sense telling him it's
                  money saved to keep a sharp look-out. And this he does merely to gratify that
                  inert something, knowing at the same time that, having no money, no person will
                  supply her, and she must be concealed in the swamps, where only "niggers" will
                  relieve her necessities. At this moment Rosebrook's carriage may be seen driving
                  to the ticket office at the head of the wharf, where Rosebrook, with great
                  coolness, gets out, steps within the railing, and procures the tickets in his own
                  name. Again taking his seat, the mate, who stands on the capsill of the wharf, now
                  and then casting a glance up, cries out, "Another carriage coming!" Bradshaw
                  cracks his whip, and the horses dash down the wharf, scatter the people who have
                  gathered to see the boat off, as a dozen black porters, at the mate's command,
                  rush round the carriage, seize the baggage, and hurry it on board. Rosebrook,
                  fearing his friends will lose their passage, begs people to clear the gangway, and
                  almost runs on board, his fugitive charge clinging to his arms. The captain stands
                  at the gangway, and recognising the late comer, makes one of his blandest bows: he
                  will send a steward to show them a good state-room. "Keep close till the boat
                  leaves, and remember there is a world before you," Rosebrook says, shaking Annette
                  by the hand, as she returns, "God bless good master!" They are safe in the
                  state-room: he kisses Franconia's cheek, shuts the door, and, hurrying back,
                  regains the wharf just as the last bell strikes, and the gangway is being carried
                  on board.
               "Not going along with us, eh?" ejaculates the captain, as, from the capsill,
                  Rosebrook looks round to bid him good-by.
               "Not to-day (he returns, laconically). "Take good care of my friends; the young
                  invalid from 
                     Lousiana
                     Louisiana
                   in particular." Just then he catches the stranger's eye, and, with a
                  significant motion of his fingers, says, "All safe!" With a nod of recognition the
                  stranger makes his adieu; the fastenings are cast away, the faint tinkle of a bell
                  is heard amid the roar of steam; the man at the valves touches the throttle bar;
                  up mounts the piston rod—down it surges again; the revolving wheels rustle the
                  water; the huge craft moves backward easy, and then ahead; a clanking noise
                  denotes the connections are "hooked on," and onward she bounds over the sea. How
                  leaps with joy that heart yearning for freedom, as the words "She's away!" gladden
                  Annette's very soul! Her enraptured feelings gush forth in prayer to her deliverers; it is as a
                  new spring of life, infusing its refreshing waters into desert sands. She seems a
                  new being, with hope, joy, and happiness brightening the future for her. But,
                  alas! how vain are hopes,—how uncertain the future!
               Rosebrook watched the steaming craft as she crosses the bar, and dwindles out of
                  sight. "Thou art safe, poor slave," he says to himself, as she passes from view
                  behind the distant peak.
               Something touches him on the shoulder as he returns to his carriage. "Ah! this
                  you, Pringle Blowers?" he exclaims, turning round suddenly, as the full face of
                  that important personage presented itself. "Been seeing some friends off to
                  ——?"
               "No," replies Blowers, with seeming indifference. He is just shying round,—keeping
                  an eye out for a smart kind of "a gal," lost last week.
               "Quite a misfortune, that, Blowers! God bless me, I'm sorry," returns Rosebrook,
                  dryly. Rosebrook invites him to get in and ride a short distance. Blowers has not
                  the slightest objection; seats his square frame on the left side of the carriage.
                  "Those were clever posters you put out for the apprehension of that girl,
                  Blowers!"
               "Took some genius, I reckon," interrupts Blowers, with broad laugh.
               "They say she was very handsome, and, if it be true, I hope you may get her,
                  Blowers," continues Rosebrook, naively.
               The disappointed man shakes his head, touches the other on the arm, and says,
                  "Nothing is more sure!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XLIV.
               HOW DADDY BOB DEPARTED.
               LET us again beg the indulgence of the reader, while we go back to the night when
                  Marston was found dead in his cell, and when that old negro, whose eventful
                  history we shall here close, sat by his bed-side, unconscious that the spirit of
                  master had winged its way to another world. Bob, faithful unto death, remained his
                  lone watcher. Disguising his ownership, he has toiled from day to day that the
                  fruits thereof might relieve master's necessities; and he had shared them with the
                  flowing goodness of a simple heart. In a malarious cell, how happy was he to make
                  his bed on the cold plank beside his master's cot, where he might watch over his
                  declining spirit. Kindness was his by nature,—no cruel law could rob his heart of
                  its treasure: he would follow master to the grave, and lavish it upon the soil
                  that covered him.
               Having accompanied Franconia to the Rosebrook Villa, he will return to the prison
                  and join Harry, alone watching over the dead. The city clock strikes the hour of
                  eleven as he leaves the outer gate, and turns into the broad road leading to the
                  city. The scene before him is vamped in still darkness; a murky light now and then
                  sheds its glimmers across the broad road; and as he hurries onward, contemplating
                  the sad spectacle presented in the prison, happy incidents of old plantation life
                  mingle their associations with his thoughts. He muses to himself, and then, as if
                  bewildered, commences humming his favourite tune—"There's a place for old mas'r
                  yet, when all 'um dead and gone!" His soul is free from suspicion: he fears not
                  the savage guardsman's coming; the pure kindliness of his heart is his shield. How
                  often has he scanned this same scene,—paced this same road on his master's
                  errands! How death has changed the circumstances of this his nightly errand! Far
                  away to the east, on his left, the broad landscape seems black and ominous; before
                  him, the sleeping city spreads its panorama, broken and sombre, beneath heavy clouds; the fretted
                  towers on the massive prison frown dimly through the mist to the right, from which
                  a low marshy expanse dwindles into the dark horizon. And ever and anon the forked
                  lightning courses its way through the heavens, now tinging the sombre scene with
                  mellow light, then closing it in deeper darkness.
               Onward the old man wends his way. If he be shut out from the prison, he will find
                  shelter at Jane's cabin near by, from whence he may reach the cell early next
                  morning. Presently the dull tramp of horses breaks upon his ear,—the sound
                  sharpening as they advance. Through the dimming haze he sees two mounted guardsmen
                  advancing: the murmuring sound of their conversation floats onward through the
                  air,—their side arms rattle ominously. Now their white cross belts are disclosed;
                  their stalwart figures loom out. Nearer and nearer they approach: as the old man,
                  trembling with fear, remembers he is without a pass, a gruff voice cries out,
                  "Stop there!"
               "A prowling nigger!" rejoins another, in a voice scarcely less hoarse. The old man
                  halts in the light of a lamp, as the right-hand guard rides up, and demands his
                     pass.
               "Whose nigger are you?" again demands the first voice. "Your pass, or come with
                  us!"
               The old man has no pass; he will go to his master, dead in the county
                  prison!
               Guardsmen will hear neither falsehoods nor pleading. He doesn't know "whose nigger
                  he is! he is a runaway without home or master," says the left-hand guardsman, as
                  he draws his baton from beneath his coat, and with savage grimace makes a
                  threatening gesture. Again he poises it over the old man's head, as he, with hand
                  uplifted, supplicates mercy. "Nobody's nigger, and without a pass!"
                  he grumbles out, still motioning his baton.
               "He says his master is in gaol; that's enough! Stop, now, no more such nonsense!"
                  rejoins the other, as the old man is about to explain. "Not another word." He is
                  good prey, made and provided by the sovereign law of the state. Placing him
                  between their horses, they conduct him in silence forward to the guard-house. He
                  is a harmless captive, in a world where democracy with babbling tongue boasts of
                  equal justice. "A prowler!" exclaims one of the guardsmen men, as, dismounting in
                  front of the massive building, with frowning facade of stone, they disappear,
                  leading the old man within its great doors, as the glaring gas-light reflects upon
                  his withered features.
               "Found prowling on the neck, sir!" says the right-hand guardsman, addressing
                  himself to the captain, a portly-looking man in a military suit, who, with
                  affected importance, casts a look of suspicion at the old man. "Have seen you
                  before, I think?" he enquires.
               "Reckon so, mas'r; but neber in dis place," replies Bob, in half-subdued
                  accents.
               You are nobody's nigger, give a false account of yourself, and have no home, I
                  hear," interrupts the captain, at the same time ordering a clerkly-looking
                  individual who sits at a desk near an iron railing enclosing a tribune, to make
                  the entry in his book.
               "Your name?" demands the clerk.
               "Bob!"
               "Without owner, or home?"
               "My master's cell was my home."
               "That won't do, my man!" interrupts the portly-looking captain. "Mr. Clerk"
                  (directing himself to that functionary) "you must enter him—nobody's nigger,
                  without home or master." And as such he is entered upon that high record of a
                  sovereign state—the guard-house calendar. If this record were carried before the
                  just tribunal of heaven, how foul of crime, injustice, and wrong, would its pages
                  be found! The faithful old man has laboured under an assumed ownership. His badge,
                  procured for him through the intercession of Franconia, shows him as the property
                  of Mr. Henry Frazer. That gentleman is many hundred miles away: the old man,
                  ignorant of the barbarous intricacy of the law, feels it to his sorrow. The
                  production of the badge, and the statement, though asserting that Miss Franconia
                  is his friend, show a discrepancy. His statement has no truth for guardsmen; his
                  poor frame is yet worth something, but his oath has no value in law: hence he must
                  march into a cold cell, and there remain till morning.
               Before that high functionary, the mayor—whose judgments the Russian Czar might
                  blush to acknowledge or affirm,—he is arraigned at ten o'clock on the following
                  morning. He has plenty of accusers,—no one to plead the justice of his case. A plain story he would tell, did the
                  law and his honour grant the boon. The fatal badge shows him the property of Mr.
                  Henry Frazer: Mr. Henry Frazer is nowhere to be found, and the statement that
                  master was in prison tends to increase the suspicions against him. Against this
                  increasing force of proof, the old man begs his honour will send to the prison,
                  where master will be found,—dead! In his love of clemency that functionary yields
                  to the request. There looks something harmless about the old negro, something that
                  warms his honour's legal coldness. An officer is despatched, and soon returns with
                  a description that corresponds with the old man's. "He waited on Marston, made
                  Marston's cell his home; but, your honour—and I have the assurance of the
                  gaoler—he was not Marston's nigger; all that man's niggers were sold for the
                  benefit of his creditors." So says the official, returning to his august master
                  with cringing servility. His honour, in the fulness of his wisdom, and with every
                  regard for legal straightforwardness (his honour searched into the profoundest
                  depths of the "nigger statutes" while learning the tailoring trade, which he now
                  pursues with great success), is now doubly satisfied that the negro before him is
                  a vagabond—perhaps, and he is more than half inclined to believe he is, the very
                  marauder who has been committing so many depredations about the city. With a
                  profound admonition, wisdom glowing from his very countenance the while, he orders
                  him twenty-nine paddles on his bare posteriors,—is sorry the law does not give him
                  power to extend the number. And with compliments for the lucky fellows who have
                  thus timely relieved the public of such a dangerous outlaw, his honour orders him
                  to be taken away to that prison-house where even-handed democracy has erected a
                  place for torturing the souls of men who love liberty.
               He will get the stripes—large, democratic stripes,—generously laid on. How much
                  more he will get remains for a proud state, in its sovereign littleness, to
                  provide. His honour, feeling his duties toward the state discharged, and his
                  precautionary measures for the protection of the people fully exemplified in this
                  awful judgment, orders one of the officers to summon Mr. Ford Fosdick, a
                  distinguished gentleman of the state's own, who, he is quite sure, will not
                  neglect her more important interests. Bob has no interests in this world, nor doth
                  he murmur that he hath not eaten bread for fourteen hours. Kindliness yet lingers
                  in his withered face as he goes forth, yields submission to a state's 
                     lnjustice
                     injustice
                  , and bares his back before he eats.
               "Return him after administering the dressing," says his honour, directing his
                  remarks to the official about to lead his victim away. That functionary, half
                  turning, replies with a polite bow.
               The reader, we feel assured, will excuse a description of this unsavoury dressing,
                  beautifully administered on behalf of a republican state that makes it a means of
                  crushing out the love of liberty. Bob has received his dressing and returned; but
                  he has no tears to shed for democrats who thus degrade him.
               Mr. Ford Fosdick, a gentleman of the learned profession, very straight of person,
                  and most bland of manners, is what may be called escheator in ordinary to the
                  state. Keeping a sharp eye on her interests, he has anticipated the commands of
                  his august master, presents his polite person very unexpectedly in his honour's
                  court-room. Fosdick, in addition to an excellent reputation for being the very
                  best gentleman "nigger grabber" the state ever had, is well thought of in
                  fashionable circles, having fought two duels of the most desperate character. He
                  is of middle stature, with a face finely oval, and to which are added features of
                  much softness, altogether giving him more the appearance of a well-ordained
                  divine, than the medium of those high functions by which the state's "grab-all" of
                  homeless negroes distinguishes himself. If the state tolerated an ignominy, Ford
                  Fosdick—between whom there exists a mutual partnership—found in it an apology for
                  the part he played; for—let no man blush when we tell it—the sum total for which
                  friendless, homeless, and ownerless negroes sold for in the market was equally
                  divided between them. Generous as was this copartnership, there were few
                  well-disposed persons independent enough to sanction it; while here and there an
                  outspoken voice said it was paying a premium for edging Fosdick's already sharp
                  appetite for apprehending the wretched, who—God save the state's honour!—having no
                  means of protecting themselves, would be sold for the sovereign interests of his
                  own pocket, instead of the peace of the
                  dear people, of which the state was ever jealous. Mr. Fosdick is present,—thanks
                  his honour the mayor: he thinks he has seen the negro before; that he is a prowler
                  not a doubt can exist. Quite indifferent as to his own interests, he says the city
                  is literally beset with such vermin: in his own mind, however, he has not a doubt
                  but that something handsome will be realised from the sale of the old fellow.
                  There is now a most fearful case in the city,—a negro belonging to Mr. Grabguy has
                  become mad with disobedience: they have chained him to the floor, but he sets
                  everything at defiance, threatens the lives of all who come near him,—says he will
                  die or be free. Against this there is little hope for old Bob; his crooked story
                  will not suit the high considerations of these amiable worthies of state: he must
                  be 
                     siezed
                     seized
                   and dragged to the workhouse, there to await the result. It is a
                  profitable morning's work for Mr. Ford Fosdick, who makes a large note in his
                  ledger, and will soon carry out a very acceptable item on behalf of his dear self.
                  So, while Bob eats his corn-grits in a cell, and his heart beats high with purity,
                  Mr. Ford Fosdick revels in luxury he thinks not ill-gotten.
               Due notice, in accordance with the statutes, is given to all persons whomsoever
                  may claim a piece of property answering the description of Daddy Bob, as herein
                  set forth. Weeks pass, but no one comes to claim Bob. In the eyes of an ignoble
                  law he is a cast out, homeless upon the world; and as such must be sold. He is put
                  up at the man-shambles, and, by order of Mr. Ford Fosdick, sold to Mr. Cordes Kemp
                  for the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, one half of which sum is the state's
                  own, the other Mr. Ford Fosdick's. Mr. Cordes Kemp had seen Bob working about the
                  wharf, and learned that the old man was of more value than his outward appearance
                  indicated, inasmuch as he was a good carpenter; which we have not before informed
                  the reader. But Bob had never been accustomed to a cruel master: such Cordes Kemp
                  was to the fullest extent of the term. A few months passed, and Bob became
                  heartily sick of his new master, who gave him little to eat, and had nearly ended
                  his life with labour and the lash. Finding he could no longer stand such
                  treatment, he fled to the swamp; and for two years did he make his home among the
                  morasses and hillocks, now making his bed by the trunk of a fallen tree, then
                  seeking shelter in a temporary camp built with the axe he carried away with him.
                  At times he was forced to make food of roots, nuts, and such wild fruit as the
                  woods afforded; and as the ravens found food, so the outcast man did not suffer
                  while an all-wise Providence watched over him. And then he found a kind friend in
                  old Jerushe—Aunt Jerushe, as she was commonly called, who lived on a plantation a
                  few miles from his hiding-place, and met him at night, and shared her coarse meal
                  with him. Jerushe's heart was full of kindness; she would have given him more, but
                  for the want thereof. Full two years did even-handed democracy drive the old man
                  homeless to seek a shelter among the poisonous reptiles of the morass. Mr. Cordes
                  Kemp must regain his property, and to that generous end he puts forth the
                  following extremely southern proclamation, which may be found in all respectable
                  morning journals, on posters hung at the "Rough and Ready," at "Your House," and
                  at "Our House":—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "SEVENTY-FIVE (75) DOLLARS REWARD is offered for the delivery of my
                              old negro carpenter man named BOB, in gaol in Charleston, within a
                              month from this date. The said BOB is a complete carpenter, about
                              sixty-five years of age, has a fine, full, good-natured face,
                              knock-kneed, bald-headed, and ran away about two years ago: he is
                              thought to be harboured in Charleston or James' Island. He was bought
                              of Mr. Ford Fosdick, on behalf of the state.
                           
                              June 28, —— CORDES KEMP."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mr. Cordes Kemp, sorely grieved at the loss of so venerable and valuable a piece
                  of property,—and which he bought of the state, for the rights of which he is a
                  great champion,—will give the above sum in hard cash to the clever fellow who will
                  secure it within a prison, so he may get it. If this cannot be done, he will
                  declare him an outlaw, offer a premium for the old man's head, and, with the
                  bleeding trophy, demand the premium paid by the state. However, seventy-five
                  dollars is no mean offer for so old a negro, and as the said negro cannot be a
                  fast runner, the difficulty of catching him will not be very great, while the
                  sport will be much more exciting. Romescos and Dan Bengal keep a sharp look-out
                  for all such little chances of making money; and as their dogs are considered the very best and savagest in the
                  country, they feel certain they will be able to deliver the article over to Mr.
                  Kemp in a very few days.
               A few days after the appearance of Mr. Cordes Kemp's proclamation, these two
                  worthies may be seen riding along the Camden Road, a sandy level, with little to
                  indicate its tortuous course save a beaten and irregular path through a forest of
                  stately pines. Their reddish-coloured home-spun clothes, set loosely, and their
                  large, felt hats, slouching over their bearded faces, give their figures a
                  brigand-like appearance which excites apprehension. They are heavily armed with
                  rifles, revolvers, and bowie-knives; and as their horses move along at a quick
                  walk, the riders may be heard keeping up an animated discussion on matters of
                  state policy. The state and its policy is a matter of deep interest to
                  slave-dealer and slave-hunter; none discuss them with more pertinacity. And as
                  every great measure is supposed to have some bearing, directly or indirectly, on
                  the right of one class to enslave the other, a never-ceasing political jar is kept
                  up by these worthies, and too often finds its way into the public acts of men who
                  should be far removed above their selfishness.
               The horse on which Romescos rides, a sprightly dark-bay, seeming to have an
                  instinctive knowledge of his master's pursuit, pricks his ears erect, and keeps
                  his head turning from one side to the other, as if watching the approach of some
                  object in the forest. A few paces ahead are seven fierce hounds, now scenting
                  about the ground, then scampering through the trees, and again, quickly obeying
                  the call, return to the horses. Not a bark is heard, not a growl escapes them!
                  Nothing could be under more explicit subjection—not even those northern dogs who
                  pollute their own free soil by making it a forest, where the souls of men are
                  humbled, and where, willing allies of the sport, they desecrate that holy
                  sentence, "Our Pilgrim Fathers!"
               Presently the lean figure of a man is seen advancing from a thicket in the
                  distance. Rifle in hand he advances a few paces, leans against the trunk of a pine
                  tree, relieves his shoulders of a well-filled haversack, and supports his arms on
                  the stock of his weapon, the muzzle of which he sets in the ground. He will wait
                  the horsemen's coming. With lightning quickness the hounds start suddenly, prick
                  up their ears, make a bound forward. "Hold there!" exclaims Romescos, at the same
                  time directing Bengal's attention to the figure far away to the right. His horse
                  shies, an imprecation quickly follows; the dogs as suddenly obey the word, and
                  crouch back to await another signal.
               "Nothing, I reckon!" returns Bengal, coolly, as the figure in the distance is seen
                  with smoking fusee lighting a cigar.
               Romescos thinks he is a gentleman returning from hunting in the big swamp, to the
                  north. He has a kind of presentiment, nevertheless, that some lucky prize will
                  turn up before sunset.
               "Well, strangers, what luck to day?" enquires the hunter, as they run up their
                  horses. At the same time he gracefully raises a delicate hand, relieves his mouth
                  of the cigar, twists a well-trimmed mustache, and lifts his hunting-cap from off
                  his head, disclosing a finely-chiselled face.
               "Not a shy!" replies Romescos, taking a cigar from his side pocket, and motioning
                  his hand: the hunter politely extends his habanna, with which he communicates a
                  light to his own. It is well nigh noon-day, and at the hunter's invitation do they
                  dismount, seat themselves at the foot of the tree, and regale with bread, cheese,
                  and brandy, he draws from his haversack.
               "Thought ye'd got game in that," remarks Bengal, measuredly. He has scoured the
                  woods, but found little game of the kind he hunts. "Our game is of a different
                  species: you, I take it, hunt niggers, I'm in search of birds."
               "Would have no objection to a stray deer or two!" is the reply, as he passes his
                  horn and flask to Romescos, who helps himself to a dose of the
                  liquid, which, he says, smacking his lips, is not bad to take.
               "Especially when yer on a hunting excursion!" rejoins Bengal.
               "Now," says the gentleman hunter, quietly resuming his cigar, "as you do not hunt
                  my game, nor I yours, I think I can give you a scent that may prove
                  profitable."
               "Where away?" interrupts Bengal. Romescos respects the stranger—he has dignity
                  concealed beneath his hunting garb, which the quick eye recognised as it flashed
                  upon him. He gives Bengal a significant wink, the meaning of which he instinctively understands—"Don't be
                  rude,—he belongs to one of the first families!"
               The stranger lays his left hand on Romescos' arm, and with the fore finger of his
                  right hand pointing to the south-west, says, "My plantation is nine miles in that
                  direction. I left it this morning, early. In crossing an inlet of the Pedee, I discovered white smoke, far ahead, curling upward through the trees,
                  and expanding itself in the clear blue atmosphere. Feeling sure it indicated the
                  haunt of runaways,I approached it stealthily, and had almost unconsciously come
                  upon a negro, who, suddenly springing from his hiding-place, ran to the water's
                  edge, plunged in, and swam to a little island a few yards in the stream. It did
                  not become me to pursue him, so I passed on heedlessly, lest he might have
                  companions, who would set upon me, and make me an easy prey to their revengeful
                  feelings." As each word fell from the stranger's lips, Romescos and his companion
                  became irresistibly excited.
               Again repeating the directions, which the stranger did with great precision, they
                  drank a parting social glass: the mounted huntsmen thanked the pedestrian for his
                  valuable information, gave him a warm shake of the hand, and, as he . arranged his
                  haversack, rode off at full gallop in the direction indicated. The dogs, cunning
                  brutes, trained to the state's brutality, mutely kept in advance. "In luck yet!"
                  exclaims Bengal, as they rode onward, in high glee, anticipating the valuable game
                  about to fall into their hands.
               "Ho! dogs—and back!" shrieked Romescos, at the top of his shrill voice, his sandy
                  hair hanging in tufts over his little reddened face, now glowing with excitement.
                  Instantly the dogs started off through the thicket, and after making a circle of
                  about a mile, returned with heads up, and eyes fiercely flashing. Trailing in a
                  semicircle ahead they seemed eager for another command.
               "Better keep them back," mutters Bengal; and as Romescos gives the word,—"Come
                  back!" they form a trail behind.
               Now white fleecy clouds begin to obscure the sun; then it disappears in a murky
                  haze, and is no longer their guide. After two hours' riding they find a wrong turn
                  has led them far away from their course, and to avoid retracing their steps they
                  make a short cut through the thicket. In another hour they have reached the bank
                  of the stream they sought. Dogs, horses, and men, together drink of its limpid
                  waters, and proceed onward. They have yet several miles of travel before reaching
                  the spot designated by the strange hunter; and seeking their way along the bank is
                  a slow and tedious process. The prize—that human outcast, who has no home where
                  democracy rules,—is the all-absorbing object of their pursuit; money is the god of
                  their hellish purpose.
               It is near night-fall, when they, somewhat wearied of the day's ride, halt on a
                  little slope that extends into the river, and from which a long view of its course
                  above opens out. It seems a quiet, inviting spot, and so sequestered that Bengal
                  suggests it be made a resting-place for the night.
               "Not a whisper," says Romescos, who, having dismounted, is nervously watching some
                  object in the distance. It is a pretty spot, clothed in softest verdure. How
                  suddenly the quick eye of Romescos discovered the white smoke curling above the
                  green foliage! "See! see!" he whispers again, motioning his hand behind, as Bengal
                  stretches his neck, and looks eagerly in the same direction. "Close dogs-close!"
                  he demands, and the dogs crouch back, and coil their sleek bodies at the horses'
                  feet. There, little more than a mile ahead, the treacherous smoke curls lazily
                  upward, spreading a white haze in the blue atmosphere. Daddy Bob has a rude camp
                  there. A few branches serve for a covering, the bare moss is his bed; the fires of
                  his heart would warm it, were nothing more at hand! Near by is the island on which
                  he seeks refuge when the enemy approaches; and from this lone spot—his home for
                  more than two years—has he sent forth many a fervent prayer, beseeching Almighty
                  God to be his shield and his deliverer. It was but yesterday he saw Jerushe, who
                  shared with him her corn-cakes, which, when she does not meet him at his
                  accustomed spot, she places at the foot of a marked tree. Bob had added a few
                  chips to his night fire, (his defence against tormenting mosquitoes), and made his
                  moss bed. Having tamed an owl and a squirrel, they now make his rude camp their
                  home, and share his crumbs. The squirrel nestles above his head, as the owl,
                  moping about the camp entrance, suddenly hoots a warning and flutters its way into the thicket. Starting to his feet
                  with surprise—the squirrel chirping at the sudden commotion—the tramp of horses
                  breaks fearfully upon the old man's ear; bewildered he bounds from the camp. Two
                  water oaks stand a few feet from its entrance, and through them he descries his
                  pursuers bearing down upon him at full speed, the dogs making the very forest echo
                  with their savage yelps. They are close upon him; the island is his only refuge!
                  Suddenly he leaps to the bank, plunges into the stream, and with death-like
                  struggles gains the opposite shore, where he climbs a cedar, as the dogs, eager
                  with savage pursuit, follow in his wake, and are well nigh seizing his extremities
                  ere they cleared their vicious spring. The two horsemen vault to the spot from
                  whence the old man plunged into the water; and while the dogs make hideous ravings
                  beneath the tree, they sit upon their horses, consulting, as the old man, from the
                  tree top, looks piteously over the scene. Life has few charms for him; death would
                  not be unwelcome.
               The tedious journey, and disappointment at seeing the old man's resolution, has
                  excited Romescos' ire. "He's an old rack—not worth much, but he doesn't seem like
                  Kemp's old saw-horse," Romescos remarks to Bengal, as his hawk eye scans the old
                  man perched among the cedar branches. They are not more than forty yards apart,
                  and within speaking distance. Bengal, less excited, thinks it better to secure the
                  old "coon" without letting the dogs taste of him.
               "They'll only hold him with a firm grip, when he dismounts, and swim him safe
                  back," grumblingly returns Romescos. "Now! old nig"—Romescos shouts at the top of
                  his voice, directing himself to the old man—"just trot back here—come along!"
               The old man shakes his head, and raises his hands, as if pleading for mercy.
               "You won't, eh?" returns the angry man, raising his rifle in an attitude of
                  preparation. Bengal reminds Romescos that his horse is not accustomed to firing
                  from the saddle.
               "I will larn him, then," is the reply.
               "Mas'r," says Bob, putting out his hand and uncovering his bald head, "I can harm
                  no white man. Let me live where 'um is, and die where 'um is."
               "None o' that ar kind o' nigger talk;—just put it back here, or ye'll get a plug
                  or two out o' this long Bill." (He points to his rifle.) "Ye'll come down out of
                  that—by heavens you will!"
               "Wing him; don't shoot the fool!" suggests Bengal, as the old man, pleading with
                  his pursuers, winds his body half round the tree. Tick! tick! went the cock of
                  Romescos' rifle; he levelled it to his eye,—a sharp whistling report rung through
                  the air, and the body of the old man, shot through the heart, lumbered to the
                  earth, as a deadly shriek sounds high above the echoes over the distant
                  landscape—"M'as'r in heaven take 'um and have mercy on 'um!" gurgles on the air:
                  his body writhes convulsively—the devouring dogs spring savagely upon the
                  ration—all is over with the old slave!
               Instantly with the report of the rifle, Romescos' horse darts, vaults toward the
                  oaks, halts suddenly, and, ere he has time to grasp the reins, throws him headlong
                  against one of their trunks. An oath escapes his lips as from the saddle he
                  lifted; not a word more did he lisp, but sank on the ground a corpse. His boon
                  companion, forgetting the dogs in their banquet of flesh, quickly dismounts,
                  seizes the body in his arms, the head hanging carelessly from the shoulders: a few
                  quivering shrugs, and all is over. "Neck broken, and dead!" ejaculates the
                  affrighted companion, resting the dead hunter's back against his left knee, and
                  with his right hand across the breast, moving the head to and fro as if to make
                  sure life has left.
               "Poor Anthony,—it's a bad end; but the state should bury him with honours; he ware
                  the best 'un at this kind o' business the state ever had," mutters Bengal,
                  glancing revengefully toward the island, where his democratic dogs are busy in the
                  work of destruction. Then he stretches the lifeless body on the ground, crosses
                  those hands full of blood and treachery, draws a handkerchief from his pocket,
                  spreads it over the ghastly face fast discolouring, as the riderless horse, as if
                  by instinct, bounds back to the spot and suddenly halts over his dead master,
                  where he frets the ground with his hoof, and, with nostrils extended, scents along
                  the body. Having done this, as if in sorrow, he will rest on the ground beside
                  him; slowly he lumbers his body down,
                  his head and neck circled toward that of the lifeless ruffian on the ground.
               The disconsolate hunter here leaves his useless companion, swims the stream,
                  recalls the gory-mouthed dogs, looks with satisfaction on the body of the torn
                  slave. "You're settled for," says Bengal, as with his right foot he kicks together
                  the distended and torn limbs. "Not all loss, yet!" he adds, a glow of satisfaction
                  infusing his face. With the ghastly head for proof, he will apply for, and perhaps
                  obtain, the state's reward for the despatch of outlaws; and with the gory trophy
                  he returns across the limpid stream to his hapless companion, who, having watched
                  over during the night, he will convey into the city to-morrow morning. Over his
                  body the very humorous Mr. Brien Moon will hold one of those ceremonies called
                  inquests, for which, fourteen dollars and forty cents being paid into his own
                  pocket, he will order the valueless flesh under the sod, handsomely treating with
                  cigars and drinks those who honour him with their presence.
               In the old man's camp, a hatchet, a few bits of corn-bread, (old Jerushe's gift),
                  and two fresh caught fish, are found; they constituted his earthly store. But he
                  was happy, for his heart's impulses beat high above the conflict of a State's
                  wrongs. That spirit so pure has winged its way to another and better world, where,
                  with that of the monster who wronged nature while making cruelty his pastime, it
                  will appear before a just God, who sits in glory and judgeth justly.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLV.
               HOW SLAVEHOLDERS FEAR EACH OTHER.
               THE reader will please remember that we left Nicholas, maddened to distraction at
                  the perfidy of which Grabguy makes him the victim, chained to an iron ring in the
                  centre of Graspum's slave pen. In addition to this very popular mode of subduing
                  souls that love liberty, his wife and children are sold from him, the ekings of
                  his toil, so carefully laid up as the boon of his freedom, are confiscated, and
                  the wrong-doer now seeks to cover his character by proclaiming to a public without
                  sympathy that no such convention existed, no such object entertained. Grabguy is a
                  man of position, and lady Grabguy moves well in society no way vulgar; but the
                  slave (the more honourable of the two) hath no voice—he is nothing in the
                  democratic world. Of his origin he knows not; and yet the sting pierces deeper
                  into his burning heart, as he feels that, would justice but listen to his tale,
                  freedom had not been a stranger. No voice in law, no common right of commoners, no
                  power to appeal to the judiciary of his own country, hath he. Overpowered,
                  chained, his very soul tortured with the lash, he still proclaims his
                  resolution—"death or justice!" He will no longer work for him who has stripped
                  away his rights, and while affecting honesty, would crush him bleeding into the
                  earth.
               Grabguy will counsel an expedient wherewith further to conceal his perfidy; and to
                  that end, with seeming honesty lady Grabguy would have her fashionable neighbours
                  believe sincere, he will ship the oppressed man to New Orleans, there to be
                  sold.—"Notwithstanding, he is an extremely valuable nigger," he says, affecting
                  superlative indifference.
               "I'd rather sell him for a song than he should disturb the peace of the city
                  thus." To New Orleans Mr. Grabguy sends his unsubdued property; but that the
                  threatened sale is only a feint to more effectually dissolve the contract and forfeit the money paid as part of his
                  freedom, he soon becomes fully sensible. Doubly incensed at such conduct the fire
                  of his determination burns more fiercely; if no justice for him be made manifest
                  on earth his spirit is consoled with the knowledge of a reward in heaven. Having
                  tortured for months the unyielding man, Grabguy, with blandest professions of
                  kindness, commands that the lacerated servant be brought back to his domicile.
                  Here, with offers of kindness, and sundry pretexts of his sincerity, the master
                  will pledge his honour to keep faith with his slave. The defrauded wretch knows
                  but too well how little confidence he can place in such promises; to such promises
                  does he turn a deaf ear. Grabguy, if serious, must give him back his wife, his
                  children, and his hard earnings, in which the joyous hope of gaining freedom was
                  centred: that hope had carried him through many trials. Sad is the dilemma in
                  which Mr. Grabguy finds himself placed; simple justice to the man would have long
                  since settled the question.
               And now Nicholas is a second time sent to Graspum's pen, where living men are
                  chained to rings of fierce iron for loving freedom and their country. For
                  twenty-two days and nights is he chained to that floor where his soul had before
                  been tortured. Threats of being returned to New Orleans again ring their leaden
                  music in his ears; but they have no terrors for him; his indignant spirit has
                  battled with torture and vanquished its smart—he will defend himself unto death
                  rather than be made the object of a sham sale. A vessel for New Orleans waits in
                  the harbour a fair wind for sailing. On board of her Mr. Grabguy will carry out
                  his resolve; and to which end the reader will please accompany us to a small cell
                  in Graspum's pen, about fourteen by sixteen feet, and seven in height— in the
                  centre of which is chained to a ring that man, once so manly of figure, whose
                  features are now worn down by sorrow or distorted by torture,—as three policemen
                  enter to carry out the order of shipment. The heavy chain and shackle with which
                  his left foot is secured yield to him a circuit of some four feet. As the
                  officials advance his face brightens up with animation; his spirit resumes its
                  fiery action, and with a flashing knife, no one knows by whom provided, he bids
                  them advance no further.
               "You must go to the whipping-post, my good fellow! I know it's kind of hard; but
                  obey orders we must. Ye see, I've gin ye good advice, time and agin; but ye won't
                  take it, and so ye must abide the consequences," says one of the officials, who
                  advances before the others, and addresses himself to the chained man.
               "I'll go to a whipping-post no more!" exclaims Nicholas, his angry spirit flashing
                  in his face, as in an attitude of defence he presses his right hand into his
                  bosom, and frowns defiantly upon the intruders.
               "My name is Monsel, an officer! Not a word of disobedience," returns the officer,
                  in a peremptory voice.
               Another suggests that he had better be throated at once. But the chained victim of
                  democracy's rule warns them against advancing another step. "Either must die if
                  you advance. I have counselled death, and will lay my prostrate body on the cold
                  floor rather than be taken from this cell to the whipping-post. It is far better
                  to die defending my right, than to yield my life under the lash! I appeal to you,
                  officers of the state, protectors of the peace, men who love their right as life's
                  boons!" The men hesitate, whisper among themselves, seem at a loss as to what
                  course to pursue. "You are setting the laws of the state at defiance, my good
                  fellow!" rejoins Monsel.
               "I care not for the law of the state! Its laws for me are founded in wrong,
                  exercised with injustice!" Turning towards the door, Mr. Monsel despatches his
                  fellow-officers for a reinforcement. That there will be a desperate struggle he
                  has no doubt. The man's gestures show him fully armed; and he is stark mad. During
                  the interim, Mr. Monsel will hold a parley with the boy. He finds,
                  however, that a few smooth words will not subdue him. One of the officials has a
                  rope in his hand, with which he would make a lasso, and, throwing it over his
                  head, secure him an easy captive. Mr. Monsel will not hear of such a cowardly
                  process. He is a wiry man, with stunted features, and has become enured to the
                  perils of negro catching. Hand to hand he has had many an encounter with the
                  brutes, and always came off victor; never did he fail to serve the interests of
                  the state, nor to protect the property of his client. With a sort of bravado he
                  makes another advance. The city esteems him for the valuable services he has rendered its safety; why should
                  he shrink in this emergency?
               
                  *
                  The chained man, drawing his shining steel from his bosom, says, "You take
                  me not from here, alive." Mr. Monsel's face becomes pale, while Nicholas's flashes
                  angry scowls; an irresistible nervousness seizes him,—for a moment he hesitates,
                  turns half round to see if his companions stand firm. They are close behind, ready
                  for the spring, like sharp-eyed catamounts; while around the door anxious visitors
                  crowd their curious faces. The officers second in command file off to the right
                  and left, draw their revolvers, and present them in the attitude of firing. "Use
                  that knife, and you fall!" exclaims one, with a fearful imprecation. At the next
                  moment he fires, as Monsel rushes upon the chained man, followed by half a dozen
                  officials. An agonising shriek is heard, and Monsel, in guttural accents, mutters,
                  "I am a murdered man—he has murdered me! Oh, my God,—he has murdered me!" Nicholas
                  has plunged the knife into the fleshy part of Monsel's right arm; and while the
                  bloody weapon, wrested from his hand, lies on the floor, an official drags the
                  wounded man from his grasp. As some rise, others fall upon him like infuriated
                  animals, and but for the timely presence of Grabguy and Graspum would have
                  despatched him like a bullock chained to a stake. The presence of these important
                  personages produces a cessation of hostilities; but the victim, disarmed, lies
                  prostrate on the ground, a writhing and distorted body, tortured beyond his
                  strength of endurance. A circle where the struggle ensued is wet with blood, in
                  which Nicholas bathes his poor writhing body until it becomes one crimson
                  mass.
               All attention is now directed to the wounded man, who, it is found, although he
                  has bled freely of good red blood, is neither fatally nor seriously wounded. It is
                  merely a flesh wound in the arm, such as young gentlemen of the south frequently
                  inflict upon each other for the purpose of sustaining their character for bravery.
                  But the oppressed slave has raised his hand against a white man,—he must pay the
                  penalty with his life; he no longer can live to keep peaceful citizens in fear and
                  trembling. Prostrate on the floor, the 
                  
                     
                     *Our southern readers, in a certain state, will readily recognise the scene
                        we here describe.
                  victors gather round him again, as Graspum
                  stoops down and unlocks the shackle from his leg. "It's the Ingin, you see: the
                  very devil wouldn't subdue it, and when once its revenge breaks out you might just
                  as well try to govern a sweeping tornado," Graspum remarks, coolly, as he calls a
                  negro attendant, and orders the body to be drawn from out the puddle of
                  disfiguring gore. Languidly that poor bosom heaves, his eyes half close, and his
                  motionless lips pale as death.
               "Had I know'd it when I bargained for him, he would never have pested me in this
                  way, never! But he looked so likely, and had such a quick insight of
                  things,—Ingin's Ingin, though!" says Grabguy.
               "The very look might have told you that, my dear fellow; I sold him to you with
                  your eyes open, and, of course, expected you to be the judge," interrupts Graspum,
                  his countenance assuming great commercial seriousness.
               Mr. Grabguy politely says, he meant no insinuations. "Come, Nicholas! I told you
                  this would be the end on't," he continues, stooping down and taking him by the
                  shoulders, with an air of commiseration.
               The bruised body, as if suddenly inspired with new life, raises itself half up,
                  and with eyes opening, gazes vacantly at those around, at its own hands besmeared
                  with gore; then, with a curl of contempt on his lip, at the shackle just released
                  from his limb—"Ah, well, it's ended here; this is the last of me, no doubt," he
                  murmurs, and makes another attempt to rise.
               "Don't move from where you are!" commands an official, setting his hand firmly
                  against his right shoulder, and pressing him back. He has got the infective
                  crimson on his hands, chafes them one against the other, perpendicularly, as
                  Nicholas looks at him doubtingly. "It's all over—I'll not harm you; take me to a
                  slaughter-house if you will,—I care not," he says, still keeping his eye on the
                  official.
               Grabguy, somewhat moved at the sight, would confirm his harmlessness. "You'll give
                  up now, won't you?" he enquires, and before Nicholas has time to answer, turns to
                  the official, saying, "Yes, I know'd he would!"
               The official bows his head significantly, but begs to inform Mr. Grabguy, that the
                  negro, having violated the most sacred
                  law of the state, is no longer under his care. He is a prisoner, and must, as the
                  law directs, answer for the heinous crime just committed. Mr. Grabguy, if he
                  please, may forward his demand to the state department, and by yielding all claim
                  to his criminal property, receive its award—two hundred round dollars, or
                  thereabouts.
               "Stand back, gentlemen—stand back, I say!" commands the officer, as the crowd from
                  the outside come pressing in, the news of the struggle having circulated through
                  the city with lightning speed. Rumour, ever ready to spread its fears in a slave
                  state, reported an insurrection, and many were they who armed themselves to the
                  very teeth.
               The officer, in answer to a question why he does not take the man away, says he
                  has sent for means to secure him. He had scarcely given out the acceptable
                  information, when an official, followed by a negro man, bearing cords over his
                  right arm, makes his appearance. The oppressed man seems subdued, and as they make
                  the first knot with the cord they wind about his neck, he says, sarcastically,
                  "'Twouldn't be much to hang a slave! Now round my hands. Now, with a half hitch,
                  take my legs!" thus mocking, as it were, while they twist the cords about his
                  yielding limbs. Now they draw his head to his knees, and his hands to his feet,
                  forming a curve of his disabled body. "How I bend to your strong ropes, your
                  strong laws, and your still stronger wills! You make good slip-nooses, and better
                  bows of human bodies," he says, mildly, shaking his head contemptuously. The
                  official, with a brutal kick, reminds him that there will be no joking when he
                  swings by the neck, which he certainly will, to the great delight of many.
               "I welcome the reality,—by heaven I do, for only in heaven is there justice for
                  me!" With these words falling from his lips, four negro men seize the body, bear
                  it to the door: an excited crowd having assembled, place it upon a common dray,
                  amid shouts and furious imprecations of "D—— him, kill him at once!" Soon the dray
                  rolls speedily away for the county prison, followed by the crowd, who utter a
                  medley of yells and groans, as it disappears within the great gates, bearing its
                  captive to a cell of torture.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVI.
               SOUTHERN ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
               IT is just a week since Nicholas committed the heinous offence of wounding officer
                  Monsel in the arm. That distinguished personage, having been well cared for, is—to
                  use a common phrase—about again, as fresh as ever. With Nicholas the case is very
                  different. His bruised and lacerated body, confined in an unhealthy cell, has
                  received little care. Suspicion of treachery has been raised against him; his name
                  has become a terror throughout the city; and all his bad qualities have been
                  magnified five-fold, while not a person can be found to say a word in praise of
                  his good. That he always had some secret villainy in view no one for a moment
                  doubts; that he intended to raise an insurrection among the blacks every one is
                  quite sure; and that confession of all his forelaid evil designs may be extorted
                  from him, the cruellest means have been resorted to.
               The day upon which the trial is to take place has arrived. On the south side of
                  Broad Street there stands a small wooden building, the boarding discoloured and
                  decayed, looking as if it had been accidentally dropped between the walls of two
                  brick buildings standing at its sides. In addition, it has the appearance of one
                  side having been set at a higher elevation than the other for some purpose of
                  convenience known only to its occupants. About fifteen feet high, its front
                  possesses a plain door, painted green, two small windows much covered with dust,
                  and a round port-hole over the door. A sheet of tin, tacked above the door,
                  contains, in broad yellow letters, the significant names of "Fetter and Felsh,
                  Attorneys at Law." Again, on a board about the size of a shingle, hanging from a
                  nail at the right side of the door, is "Jabez Fetter, Magistrate."
                  By these unmistakeable signs we feel assured of its being the department where the
                  legal firm of Fetter and Felsh do their customers—that is, where they dispose of
                  an immense amount of legal filth for
                  which the state pays very acceptable fees. Squire Fetter, as he is usually called,
                  is extremely tall and well-formed, and, though straight of person, very crooked in
                  morals. With an oval and ruddy face, nicely trimmed whiskers, soft blue eyes,
                  tolerably good teeth, he is considered rather a handsome man. But (to use a vulgar
                  phrase) he is death on night orgies and nigger trials. He may be seen any day of
                  the week, about twelve o'clock, standing his long figure in the door of his legal
                  domicile, his hat touching the sill, looking up and then down the street, as if
                  waiting the arrival of a victim upon whom to pronounce one of his awful judgments.
                  Felsh is a different species of person, being a short, stunted man, with a flat,
                  inexpressive face. He has very much the appearance of a man who had been clumsily
                  thrown together for any purpose future circumstances might require. Between these
                  worthies and one Hanz Von Vickeinsteighner there has long existed a business
                  connection, which is now being transferred into a fraternity of good fellowship.
                  Hanz Von Vickeinsteighner keeps a small grocery, a few doors below: that is, Von,
                  in a place scarcely large enough to turn his fat sides without coming in contact
                  with the counter, sells onions, lager-beer, and whiskey; the last-named article is
                  sure to be very bad, inasmuch as his customers are principally negroes. Von is
                  considered a very clever fellow, never a very bad citizen, and always on terms of
                  politeness with a great many squires, and other members of the legal profession. A
                  perfect picture of the good-natured Dutchman is Von, as seen standing his square
                  sides in his doorway, stripped to his sleeves, his red cap tipped aside, a crooked
                  grin on his broad fat face, and his hands thrust beneath a white apron into his
                  nether pockets. Von has a great relish for squires and police officers, esteems
                  them the salt of all good, nor ever charges them a cent for his best-brewed
                  lager-beer. There is, however, a small matter of business in the way, which Von,
                  being rather a sharp logician, thinks it quite as well to reconcile with beer. The
                  picture is complete, when of a morning, some exciting negro case being about to be
                  brought forward, Fetter and Von may be seen, as before described, standing
                  importantly easy in their respective doors; while Felsh paces up and down the
                  side-walk, seemingly in deep study. On these occasions it is generally said Von
                  makes the criminal "niggers," Felsh orders them caught and brought before Fletter,
                  and Fetter passes awful judgment upon them. Now and then, Felsh will prosecute on
                  behalf of the state, for which that generous embodiment of bad law is debtor the
                  fees.
               The city clock has struck twelve; Fetter stands in his doorway, his countenance
                  wearing an air of great seriousness. Felsh saunters at the outside, now and then
                  making some legal remark on a point of the negro statutes, and at every turn
                  casting his bleared eye up the street. Presently, Nicholas is seen, his hands
                  pinioned, and a heavy chain about his neck, approaching between two officials. A
                  crowd follows; among it are several patriotic persons who evince an inclination to
                  wrest him from the officials, that they may, according to Judge Lynch's much-used
                  privileges, wreak their vengeance in a summary manner. "The boy Nicholas is to be
                  tried to-day!" has rung through the city: curious lookers-on begin to assemble
                  round the squire's office, and Hanz Von Vickeinsteighner is in great good humour
                  at the prospect of a profitable day at his counter.
               "Bring the criminal in!" says Squire Fetter, turning into his office as Nicholas
                  is led in,—still bearing the marks of rough usage. Rows of board seats stretch
                  across the little nook, which is about sixteen feet wide by twenty long, the floor
                  seeming on the verge of giving way under its professional burden. The plaster
                  hangs in broken flakes from the walls, which are exceedingly dingy, and decorated
                  with festoons of melancholy cobwebs. At the farther end is an antique book-case of
                  pine slats, on which are promiscuously thrown sundry venerable-looking works on
                  law, papers, writs, specimens of minerals, branches of coral, aligators' teeth,
                  several ship's blocks, and a bit of damaged fishing-tackle. This is Felsh's
                  repository of antique collections; what many of them have to do with his rough
                  pursuit of the learned profession we leave to the reader's discrimination. It has
                  been intimated by several waggishly-inclined gentlemen, that a valuable record of
                  all the disobedient "niggers" Fetter had condemned to be hung might be found among
                  this confused collection of antiquities. A deal table, covered with a varnished
                     cloth, standing on the right side of
                  the room, and beside which a ponderous arm-chair is raised a few inches, forms
                  Fetter's tribune. Hanging from the wall, close behind this, is a powder-horn and
                  flask, several old swords, a military hat somewhat broken, and sundry other
                  indescribable things, enough to make one's head ache to contemplate.
               The office is become crowded to excess, the prisoner (his hands unpinioned, but
                  the heavy chain still about his neck!) is placed in a wooden box fronting the
                  squire's table, as a constable is ordered to close the court. It is quite evident
                  that Fetter has been taking a little too much on the previous night; but, being a
                  "first-rate drinker," his friends find an apology in the arduousness of his legal
                  duties. In answer to a question from Felsh, who has been looking at the prisoner
                  somewhat compassionately, the serving constable says two of the jury of
                  "freeholders" he has summoned have not yet made their appearance. Fetter, who was
                  about to take his seat in the great chair, and open court, politely draws forth
                  his watch, and after addressing a few words to the persons present, on the
                  necessity of keeping order in a court with such high functions, whispers a few
                  words in Felsh's ear, holding his hand to his mouth the while.
               "Maintain order in court!" says Fetter, nodding his head to the official; "we will
                  return in five minutes." Soon they are seen passing into Von's crooked
                  establishment, where, joined by a number of very fashionable friends, they "take"
                  of the "hardware" he keeps in a sly place under the counter, in a
                  special bottle for his special customers. Having taken several special glasses,
                  Fetter is much annoyed at sundry remarks made by his friends, who press round him,
                  seeming anxious to instruct him on intricate points of the "nigger statutes." One
                  hopes he will not let the nigger off without a jolly good hanging; another will
                  bet his life Felsh takes care of that small item, for then his claim on the state
                  treasury will be doubled. And now, Fetter finding that Felsh, having imbibed
                  rather freely of the liquid, hath somewhat diminished his brilliant faculties,
                  will take him by the arm and return into court. With all the innate dignity of
                  great jurists they enter their sanctum of justice, as the usher exclaims, "Court!
                  Court!—hats off and cigars out!"
               "Jury are present?" enquires Fetter, with great gravity, bowing to one side and
                  then to the other, as he resumes his seat on the tribune.
               "Present, yer 'oner;" the officer answers in a deep, gruff voice, as he steps
                  forward and places a volume of the revised statutes before that high jurist.
                  Fetter moves the book to his left, where Felsh has taken his seat. With placid
                  countenance and softest accents, Fetter orders the prisoner at the bar to stand up
                  while our constable calls the names of the jurymen.
               Our victim of democracy's even-handed justice obeys the summons, rising as his
                  dark eyes flash angrily, and that hatred wrong which lurks in his bosom seems
                  kindling anew. "James M'Neilty! Terrance M'Quade! Harry Johanna! Baldwin Dobson!
                  Patrick Henessy! Be dad and I have um all now, yer 'oner," ejaculates the
                  official, exultingly, as one by one the "nigger jurymen" respond to the call and
                  take their seats on a wooden slab at the right of his Honour, squire Fetter. "You
                  are, I may be sure, gentlemen, freeholders?" enquires his honour, with a
                  mechanical bow. They answer simultaneously in the affirmative, and then, forming
                  in a half circle, lay their hands on a volume of Byron, which Fetter makes do for
                  a Bible, and subscribe to the sacred oath Felsh administers. By the Giver of all
                  Good will they return a verdict according to the evidence and the facts.
                  "Gentlemen will take their seats" (the officer must preserve order in the court!)
                  "the prisoner may also sit down," says Felsh, the words falling from his lips with
                  great gravity, as, opening the revised statutes, he rises to address the jury.
               "Gentlemen of the Jury!"—suddenly hesitates for a moment—"the solemn duties which
                  you are now called upon to perform" (at this moment Terrance M'Quade draws a small
                  bottle from his pocket, and after helping himself to a portion of its contents
                  passes it to his fellows, much to the surprise of the learned Felsh, who hopes
                  such indecorum will cease) "and they are duties which you owe to the safety of the
                  state as well as to the protection of your own families, are much enhanced by the
                  superior mental condition of the criminal before you." Here Mr. Felsh calls for a
                  volume of Prince's Digest, from which he instructs the jury upon several important
                  points of the law made and provided for making the striking a white person by a slave or person of
                  colour a capital offence. "Your honour, too, will see the case to which I
                     refer—'State and Prudence!'" The learned gentleman extends the
                  book, that his august eyes may have a near view.
               "Your word is quite sufficient, Mr. Felsh," returns Fetter, his eyes half closed,
                  as he waves his hand, adding that he is perfectly posted on the case cited. "Page
                  499, I think you said?" he continues, placing his thumbs in his waistcoat armlets,
                  with an air of indifference.
               "Yes, your honour," rejoins Felsh, with a polite bow. His honour, ordering a glass
                  of water mixed with a little brandy, Mr. Felsh continues:—"The case, gentlemen,
                  before you, is that of the 'State v. Nicholas.' This case, gentlemen, and the
                  committal of the heinous crime for which he stands arraigned before you, has
                  excited no small amount of interest in the city. It is one of those peculiar cases
                  where intelligence creeps into the property interest of our noble institution—the
                  institution of slavery—makes the property restless, disobedient to the will and
                  commands of the master, disaffected to the slave population, and dangerous to the
                  peace and the progress of the community. Now, gentlemen" (his honour has dropped
                  into a moderate nap—Mr. Felsh pauses for a moment, and touches him gently on the
                  shoulder, as he suddenly resumes his wonted attention, much to the amusement of
                  those assembled) "you will be told by the witnesses we shall here produce, that
                  the culprit is an exceedingly intelligent and valuable piece of property, and as
                  such might, even now, be made extremely valuable to his master"—Mr. Grabguy is in
                  court, watching his interests!—"who paid a large sum for him, and was more than
                  anxious to place him at the head of his manufacturing establishment, which office
                  he was fully capable of filling. Now, gentlemen—his honour will please observe
                  this point—much as I may consider the heavy loss the master will suffer by the
                  conviction of the prisoner, and which will doubtless be felt severely by him, I
                  cannot help impressing upon you the necessity of overlooking the individual loss
                  to the master, maintaining the law, and preserving the peace of the community and
                  stability of our noble institution. That the state will only allow the master two
                  hundred dollars for his valuable slave you have nothing to do with—you must sink
                  that from your minds, listen to the testimony, and form your verdict in accordance
                  with that and the law. That he is a dangerous slave, has long
                  maintained a disobedience towards his owner, set the authorities at defiance,
                  attempted to create an insurrection, and made a dangerous assault on a white
                  man—which constitutes a capital offence—we shall now call witnesses to prove." The
                  learned gentleman having finished his opening for the prosecution, sits down.
                  After a moment's pause, he orders an attendant to bring something "to
                  take"—"Similar to the squire's!" he ejaculates, hoarsely.
               "Gentlemen!" says his honour, as if seized with the recollection of some important
                  appointment, the time for which was close at hand, drawing out his watch, "Call
                  witnesses as fast as possible! The evidence in this case, I reckon, is so direct
                  and positive, that the case can be very summarily despatched."
               "I think so, too! yer 'oner," interrupts Terrance M'Quade, starting from his seat
                  among the five jurors. Terrance has had what in vulgar parlance is termed a "tough
                  time" with several of his own stubborn negroes; and having already heard a deal
                  about this very bad case, is prepared to proclaim him fit only to be hanged. His
                  honour reminds Terrance that such remarks from a juror are neither strictly legal
                  nor in place.
               The first witness called is Toby, a slave of Terrance M'Quade, who has worked in
                  the same shop with Nicholas. Toby heard him say he got his larnin' when he was
                  young,—that his heart burned for his freedom—that he knew he was no slave by
                  right—that some day would see him a great man; that if all those poor wretches now
                  in slavery knew as much as he did, they would rise up, have their liberties, and
                  proclaim justice without appealing to heaven for it!—"
               "I said all that, and more!" interrupted the criminal bondman, rising quickly to
                  his feet, and surveying those around him with a frown of contempt.
               "Silence! sit down!" resounds from the officer.
               He will sit down, but they cannot quench the fires of his soul; they may deny him
                  the commonest right of his manhood, but they cannot take from him the knowledge
                     that God gave him those rights; they
                  may mock with derision the firm mien with which he disputes the power of his
                  oppressors, and their unjust laws, but they cannot make him less than a man in his
                  own feelings!
               His honour, squire Fetter, reminds him that it were better he said nothing, sit
                  down,—or be punished instanter. Turning to Felsh, who is sipping his quencher, he
                  enquires what that gentleman means to prove by the witness Toby?
               "His intention to raise an insurrection, yer honour!" Felsh, setting his glass
                  aside, quickly responds, wiping his lips as he adds, "It is essentially necessary,
                  yer honour!"
               His honour, leaning forward, places the fore-finger of his right hand to his lip,
                  and making a very learned gesture, says, "Toby has said enough to establish that
                  point."
               The next witness is Mr. Brien Calligan, a criminal in the prison, who for his good
                  behaviour has been promoted to the honourable post of under-warden. Mr. Brien
                  Calligan testifies that the prisoner, while in prison, confined in a cell under
                  his supervision, admitted that he intended to kill Mr. Monsel when he inflicted
                  the wound. He must qualify this statement, however, by saying that the prisoner
                  added he was altogether beside himself with rage.
               Grabguy, who has been intently watching the proceedings, suddenly springs to his
                  feet. He would like to know if that admission was not extorted from the culprit by
                  cruelty!
               Mr. Brien Calligan pauses a moment, looks innocently at the court, as one of the
                  jurors suggests that quite enough evidence has already been put in to warrant a
                  conviction. It's a pity to hang such valuable property; but, being bent on
                  disturbing the peace of the community, what else can be done?
               His honour listens with great concern to the juror's remarks, but suggests that
                  Mr. Grabguy had better not interrupt the court with questions. That he has an
                  indirect interest in the issue of the suit, not a doubt exists, but if he be not
                  satisfied with the witness's statement, he has his remedy in the court of appeals,
                  where, upon the ground of testimony having been elicited by coercion or cruelty, a
                  new trial will probably be granted.
               Mr. Grabguy would merely suggest to his honour that although sentencing a negro to
                  be hung may be a matter of small consequence to him, yet his position in society
                  gives him a right to be heard with proper respect. Aware that he does not move in
                  that exclusively aristocratic sphere of society awarded to lawyers in general, he
                  is no less entitled to respect, and being a man of honour, and an alderman as
                  well, he shall always insist on that respect.
               "Order, order!" demand a dozen voices. His honour's face flashing with
                  indignation, he seizes the statutes, and rising to his feet, is about to throw
                  them with unerring aim at the unhandsome head of the municipal functionary. A
                  commotion here ensues. Felsh is esteemed not a bad fighting man; and rising almost
                  simultaneously, his face like a full moon peeping through a rain cloud, attempts
                  to pacify his colleague, Fetter. The court is foaming with excitement; Mr. Felsh
                  is excited, the jury are excited to take a little more drink, the constables are
                  excited, the audience are excited to amusement; Messrs. Fetter and Felsh's court
                  rocks with excitement: the only unexcited person present is the criminal, who
                  looks calmly on, as if contemplating with horror the debased condition of those in
                  whose hands an unjust law has placed his life.
               As the uproar and confusion die away, and the court resumes its dignity, Mr.
                  Grabguy, again asserting his position of a gentleman, says he is not ashamed to
                  declare his conviction to be, that his honour is not in a fit state to try a
                  "nigger" of his: in fact, the truth must be told, he would not have him sit in
                  judgment upon his spaniel.
               At this most unwarranted declaration Fetter rises from his judicial chair, his
                  feelings burning with rage, and bounds over the table at Grabguy, prostrating his
                  brother Felsh, tables, benches, chairs, and everything else in his way,—making the
                  confusion complete. Several gentlemen interpose between Fetter; but before he can
                  reach Grabguy, who is no small man in physical strength—which he has developed by
                  fighting his way "through many a crowd" on election days—that municipal dignitary
                  is ejected, sans ceremonie, into the street.
               "Justice to me! My honest rights, for which I laboured when he gave me no bread,
                  would have saved him his compunction
                  punction of conscience: I wanted nothing more," says Nicholas, raising the side of
                  his coarse jacket, and wiping the sweat from his brow.
               "Silence there!" demands an official, pointing his tipstaff, and punching him on
                  the shoulder.
               Grabguy goes to his home, considering and reconsidering his own course. His heart
                  repeats the admonition, "Thou art the wrong-doer, Grabguy!" It haunts his very
                  soul; it lays bare the sources from whence the slave's troubles flow; places the
                  seal of aggression on the state. It is a question with him, whether the state,
                  through its laws, or Messrs. Fetter and Felsh, through the justice meted out at
                  their court, play the baser part.
               A crowd of anxious persons have gathered about the door, making the very air
                  resound with their shouts of derision. Hans Von Vickeinsteighner, his fat
                  good-natured face shining like a pumpkin on a puncheon, and his red cap dangling
                  above the motley faces of the crowd, moves glibly about, and says they are having
                  a right jolly good time at the law business within.
               Fetter, again taking his seat, apologises to the jury, to the persons present, and
                  to his learned brother, Felsh. He is very sorry for this ebullition of passion;
                  but they may be assured it was called forth by the gross insult offered to all
                  present. "Continue the witnesses as fast as possible," he concludes, with a
                  methodical bow.
               Mr. Monsel steps forward: he relates the fierce attempt made upon his life; has no
                  doubt the prisoner meant to kill him, and raise an insurrection. "It is quite
                  enough; Mr. Monsel may stand down," interposes Felsh, with an air of dignity.
               Paul Vampton, an intelligent negro, next bears testimony. The criminal at the bar
                  (Paul does not believe he has a drop of negro blood in his veins) more than once
                  told him his wife and children were sold from him, his rights stripped from him,
                  the hopes of gaining his freedom for ever gone. Having nothing to live for, he
                  coveted death, because it was more honourable to die in defence of justice, than
                  live the crawling slave of a tyrant's rule.
               "I feel constrained to stop the case, gentlemen of the jury," interposes his
                  honour, rising from his seat. "The evidence already adduced is more than
                  sufficient to establish the conviction."
               A juror at Terrance M'Quade's right, touches that gentleman on the shoulder: he
                  had just cooled away into a nice sleep: "I think so, too, yer 'oner," rejoins
                  Terrance, in half bewilderment, starting nervously and rubbing his eyes.
               A few mumbled words from his honour serve as a charge to the jury. They know the
                  law, and have the evidence before them. "I see not, gentlemen, how you can render
                  a verdict other than guilty; but that, let me here say, I shall leave to your more
                  mature deliberation." With these concluding remarks his honour sips his mixture,
                  and sits down.
               Gentlemen of the jury rise from their seats, and form into a circle; Mr. Felsh
                  coolly turns over the leaves of the statutes; the audience mutter to themselves;
                  the prisoner stares vacantly over the scene, as if heedless of the issue.
               "Guilty! it's that we've made it; and the divil a thing else we could make out of
                  it," exclaims Terrance M'Quade, as they, after the mature length of two minutes'
                  consultation, turn and face his honour. They pause for a reply.
               "Stand up, prisoner!"
               "Hats off during the sentence!" rejoins a constable.
               "Guilty." His honour rises to his feet with ponderous dignity to pronounce the
                  awful sentence. "Gentlemen, I must needs compliment your verdict; you could have
                  come to no other." His honour bows gracefully to the jury, reminds gentlemen
                  present of the solemn occasion, and will hear what the prisoner has to say for
                  himself.
               An angry frown pervades the prisoner's face. He has nothing to say. Burning tears
                  course down his cheeks; but they are not tears of contrition,—Oh, no! he has no
                  such tears to shed. Firmly and resolutely he says, "Guilty! guilty! yes, I am
                  guilty—guilty by the guilty laws of a guilty land. You are powerful—I am weak; you
                  have might—I have right. Mine is not a chosen part. Guilty on earth, my soul will
                  be innocent in heaven; and before a just judge will my cause be proclaimed, before
                  a holy tribunal my verdict received, and by angels my soul be enrolled among the
                  righteous. Your earthly law seals my lips; your black judgment—enough to make
                  heaven frown and earth tremble, fearing justice—crushes the man; but you cannot
                  judge the spirit. In fear and trembling your wrongs will travel broken paths—give
                  no man rest. I am guilty with you; I am
                  innocent in heaven. He who judgeth all things right, receives the innocent soul
                  into his bosom; and He will offer repentance to him who takes the innocent life."
                  He pauses, as his eye, with intense stare, rests upon his honour.
               "You are through?" enquires his honour, raising his eyebrows.
               "In this court of justice," firmly replies the prisoner.
               "Order in the court!" is echoed from several voices.
               "Nicholas—Nicholas Grabguy! the offence for which you stand convicted is one for
                  which I might, according to the laws of the land, pronounce a more awful sentence
                  than the one now resolved upon. But the advanced and enlightened spirit of the age
                  calls for a more humane manner of taking life and inflicting punishments. Never
                  before has it been my lot to pass sentence—although I have pronounced the awful
                  benediction on very many—on so valuable and intelligent a slave. I regret your
                  master's loss as much as I sympathise with your condition; and yet I deplore the
                  hardened and defiant spirit you yet evince. And permit me here to say, that while
                  you manifest such an unyielding spirit there is no hope of pardon. Nicholas! you
                  have been tried before a tribunal of the land, by the laws of your state, and
                  found guilty by a tribunal of competent men. Nothing is now left for me but to
                  pass sentence upon you in accordance with the law. The sentence of the court is,
                  that you be taken hence to the prison from whence you came, and on this day week,
                  at twelve o'clock, from thence to the gallows erected in the yard thereof, and
                  there and then be hanged by the neck until you are dead; and may the Lord have
                  mercy on your soul!"
               His honour, concluding nervously, orders the jury to be dismissed, and the court
                  adjourned.
               How burns the inward hate of the oppressed culprit, as mutely, his hands pinioned,
                  and the heavy chain about his neck, he is led away to his prison-house, followed
                  by a deriding crowd. "Come that happy day, when men will cease to make their wrong
                  fire my very blood!" he says, firmly marching to the place of death.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVII.
               PROSPERITY THE RESULT OF JUSTICE.
               TEN years have rolled into the past since the Rosebrook family—moved by a sense of
                  right to enquire into the errors of a bad system of labour—resolved to try the
                  working of a new scheme. There was to be no cutting, nor lashing, nor abusing with
                  overburdening tasks. Education was to regulate the feelings, kindness to expand
                  the sympathies, and justice to bind the affections and stimulate advancement.
                  There were only some fifty negroes on the Rosebrook plantation, but its fame for
                  raising great crops had resounded far and wide. Some planters said it "astonished
                  everything," considering how much the Rosebrooks indulged their slaves. With a
                  third less in number of hands, did they raise more and better cotton than their
                  neighbours; and then everything was so neat and bright about the plantation, and
                  everybody looked so cheerful and sprightly. When Rosebrook's cotton was sent into
                  the market, factors said it was characteristic of his systemised negroes; and when
                  his negroes rolled into the city, as they did on holidays, all brightened up with
                  new clothes, everybody said—There were Rosebrook's dandy, fat, and saucy
                  "niggers." And then the wise prophets, who had all along predicted that
                  Rosebrook's project would never amount to much, said it was all owing to his lady,
                  who was worth her weight in gold at managing negroes. And she did conceive the
                  project, too; and her helping hand was felt like a quickening spring, giving new
                  life to the physical being. That the influence might not be lost upon others of
                  her sex in the same sphere of life, she was ever reasoning upon the result of
                  female sympathy. She felt that, were it exercised properly, it could raise up the
                  menial slave, awaken his inert energies, give him those moral guides which elevate
                  his passive nature, and regenerate that manhood which provides for its own
                  good.
               They had promised their people that all children born at and after a given date
                  should be free; that all those over
                  sixty should be nominally free, the only restriction being the conditions imposed
                  by the state law; that slaves under fifteen years of age, and able to do
                  plantation work, should, during the ten years prescribed, be allowed for their
                  extra labour at a given rate, and expected to have the sum of two hundred and
                  fifty dollars set to their credit; that all prime people should be required to
                  work a given number of hours, as per task, for master, beyond which they would be
                  allotted a "patch" for cultivation, the products of which were entrusted to
                  Rosebrook for sale, and the proceeds placed in missus' savings bank to their
                  credit. The people had all fulfilled the required conditions ere the ten years
                  expired; and a good round sum for extra earnings was found in the bank. The
                  Rosebrooks kept faith with their slaves; and the happy result is, that Rosebrook,
                  in addition to the moral security he has founded for the good of his people—and
                  which security is a boon of protection between master and slave—has been doubly
                  repaid by the difference in amount of product, the result of encouragement incited
                  by his enlightened system. The family were bound in affection to their slaves; and
                  the compact has given forth its peaceful products for a good end. Each slave being
                  paid for his or her labour, there is no decline of energy, no disaffection, no
                  clashing of interests, no petulant disobedience. Rosebrook finds his system the
                  much better of the two. It has relieved him of a deal of care; he gets more work
                  for less money; he laughs at his neighbours, who fail to raise as much cotton with
                  double the number of negroes; and he knows that his negroes love instead of fear
                  him. And yet, notwithstanding the proof he has produced, the whole district of
                  planters look upon him with suspicion, consider him rather a dangerous innovator,
                  and say, that while his foolish system cannot be other than precarious to the
                  welfare of the state, time will prove it a monster fallacy.
               A happy moment was it when the time rolled round, and the morning of the day upon
                  which Rosebrook would proclaim the freedom of his people broke serenely forth. The
                  cabins looked bright and airy, were sanded and whitewashed, and, surrounded by
                  their neatly attired inhabitants, presented a picturesque appearance. It was to be
                  a great gala-day, and the bright morning atmosphere seemed propitious of the
                  event. Daddy Daniel had got a new set of shiny brass buttons put on his long blue
                  coat, and an extremely broad white cravat for his neck. Daniel was a sort of
                  lawgiver for the plantation, and sat in judgment over all cases brought before
                  him, with great gravity of manner. As to his judgments, they were always
                  pronounced with wondrous solemnity, and in accordance with what he conceived to be
                  the most direct process of administering even-handed justice. Daddy was neither a
                  democrat nor an unjust judge. Believing that it were better to forgive than
                  inflict undue punishments, he would rather shame the transgressor, dismiss him
                  with a firm admonition to do better, and bid him go, transgress no more!
               Harry had prepared a new sermon for the eventful day; and with it he was to make
                  his happy flock remember the duty which they would henceforth owe to those who had
                  been their kind protectors, as well as the promoters of that system which would
                  result in happier days. How vivid of happiness was that scene presented in the
                  plantation church, where master and missus, surrounded by their faithful old
                  slaves, who, with a patriarchal attachment, seemed to view them with reverence,
                  sat listening to the fervent discourse of that once wretched slave, now, by
                  kindness, made a man! Deep, soul-stirring, and affecting to tears, were the words
                  of prayer with which that devout negro invoked the all-protecting hand of Almighty
                  God, that he would guide master and slave through the troubles of this earthly
                  stage, and receive them into his bosom. How in contrast with that waging of
                  passion, and every element of evil that has its source in injustice, so rife of
                  plantation life, was the picture here presented!
               The service ended, Rosebrook addresses a few remarks to his people; after which
                  they gather around him and pour forth their gratitude in genial sentiments. Old
                  and young have a "Heaven save master!" for Rosebrook, and a "God bless missus!"
                  for his noble-hearted lady, to whom they cling, shaking her hand with warmest
                  affection.
               How enviable to her sex is the position of that woman who labours for the fallen,
                  and whose heart yields its kindred sympathy for the oppressed!
               After congratulations and tokens of affection had been exchanged, master, missus,
                  and the people—for such they now were—repaired to the green in front
                  of the plantation mansion, where a sumptuous collation was spread out, to which all sat down in one harmonious
                  circle. Then the festivities of the day—a 4th of July in miniature—ended with a
                  gathering at Dad Daniel's cabin, where he profoundly laid down a system of rules
                  for the future observance of the people.
               Six months have passed under the new régime; and Rosebrook, feeling that to
                  require labour of his people for a sum much beneath its value must in time become
                  a source from which evil results would flow, awarded them a just and adequate
                  remuneration, and finds it work well. Harry had not been included among those who
                  were enrolled as candidates for the enjoyment offered by the new system; but
                  missus as well as master had confidentially promised him he should be free before
                  many years, and with his family, if he desired, sent to Liberia, to work for the
                  enlightenment of his fellow Africans. Harry was not altogether satisfied that the
                  greater amount of labour to be done by him for the unfortunate of his race was
                  beyond the southern democratic states of America; and, with this doubt
                  instinctively before him, he was not restless for the consummation.
               Some three months after the introduction of the new state of affairs, Dad Daniel
                  was observed to have something weighing heavily on his mind. At times he was seen
                  consulting seriously with Harry; but of the purport of these consultations no one,
                  except themselves, was made acquainted. That very many venerable uncles and aunts
                  were curious to know Daddy's secret contemplations was equally evident. At length
                  Daniel called a meeting of his more aged and sagacious brethren, and with sage
                  face made known his cherished project. Absalom and Uncle Cato listened with
                  breathless suspense as the sage sayings fell from his lips. His brethren had all
                  felt the sweet pleasures of justice, right, freedom, and kindness. "Well, den,
                  broderin, is't 'um right in de sight ob de Lord, dat ye forgets dat broder what
                  done so much fo'h ye body and ye soul too?"
               "No, No! dat tisn't!" interrupted a dozen voices.
               "Well, den!—I know'd, broderin, ye hab got da' bright spirit in ye, and wouldn't
                  say 'twas!" Daniel continues, making a gesture with his left hand, as he raises
                  the spectacles from his eyes with his right, and in his fervency lets them speed
                  across the room. Daniel is only made conscious of his ecstasy when his broken eyes
                  are returned to him. Turning to his brethren, he makes one of his very best
                  apologies, and continues—"Dis ar poposition I'se gwine to put! And dat is, dat all
                  ye broderin ere present put up somefin ob he arnin, and wid dat somefin, and what
                  mas'r gib, too, we sarve dat geman what preach the gospel dat do 'em good wid 'e
                  freedom for sef and family. Tain't right in de sight ob de Lor, nohow, to have
                  preacher slave and congration free: I tell ye dat, my broderin, tain't!" With
                  these sage remarks, Daddy Daniel concluded his proposition, leaned his body
                  forward, spread his hands, and, his wrinkled face filled with comicality, waited
                  the unanimous response which sounded forth in rapturous medley. Each one was to
                  put in his mite, the preacher was to have a fund made up for him, which was to be
                  placed in the hands of missus, and when sufficiently large (master will add his
                  mite) be handed over for the freedom of the clergyman and his family. But missus,
                  ever generous and watchful of their interests, had learned their intentions, and
                  forestalled their kindness by herself setting them free, and leaving it to their
                  own discretion to go where they will. There were many good men at the south—men
                  whose care of their slaves constituted a bond of good faith; but they failed to
                  carry out means for protecting the slave against the mendacity of the tyrant. None
                  more than Harry had felt how implicated was the state for giving great power to
                  tyrant democracy—that democracy giving him no common right under the laws of the
                  land, unless, indeed, he could change his skin. Ardently as he was attached to the
                  plantation and its people—much as he loved good master and missus, he would prefer
                  a home in happy New England, a peaceful life among its liberty-loving people. To
                  this end the Rosebrooks provided him with money, sent him to the land he had
                  longed to live in. In Connecticut he has a neat and comfortable home, far from the
                  cares of slave life; no bloodhounds seek him there, no cruel slave-dealer haunts
                  his dreams. An intelligent family have grown up around him; their smiles make him
                  happy; they welcome him as a father who will no more be torn from them and sold in
                  a democratic slave mart. And, too, Harry is a hearty worker in the cause of
                  freedom, preaches the gospel, and is the inventor of a system of education by
                  which he hopes to elevate the fallen of his race. He has visited foreign lands, been listened to by dukes
                  and nobles, and enlisted the sympathies of the lofty in the cause of the lowly.
                  And while his appeals on behalf of his race are fervent and fiery, his expositions
                  of the wrongs of slavery are equally fierce; but he is not ungrateful to the good
                  master, whom he would elevate high above the cruel laws he is born and educated to
                  observe. With gratitude and affection does he recur to the generous Rosebrooks; he
                  would hold them forth as an example to the slave world, and emblazon their works
                  on the pages of history, as proof of what can be done. Bright in his eventful
                  life, was the day, when, about to take his departure from the slave world, he bid
                  the Rosebrooks a long, long good by. He vividly remembers how hope seemed lighting
                  up the prospect before him—how good missus shook his hand so motherly—how kindly
                  she spoke to Jane, and how fondly she patted his little ones on the head. "The
                  Rosebrooks," says our restored clergyman, "have nothing to fear save the laws of
                  the state, which may one day make 
                     tyrranny
                     tyranny
                   crumble beneath its own burden."
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVIII.
               IN WHICH THE FATE OF FRANCONIA IS SEEN.
               THE reader may remember that in a former chapter we left Annette and Franconia, in
                  company of the stranger, on board the steamer for Wilmington, swiftly gliding on
                  her course. Four bells struck as the surging craft cleared the headlands and
                  shaped her course. The slender invalid, so neat of figure, and whose dress
                  exhibited so much good taste, has been suddenly transformed into a delicate girl
                  of some seventeen summers. As night spreads its shadows over the briny scene, and
                  the steaming craft surges onward over rolling swells, this delicate girl may be
                  seen emerging from her cabin confines, leaning on Franconia's arm as she
                  approaches the promenade deck. Her fawn-coloured dress, setting as neatly as it is
                  chastefully cut, displays a rounded form nicely compact; and, together with a
                  drawn bonnet of green silk, simply arranged, and adding to her fair oval face an
                  air of peculiar delicacy, present her with personal attractions of no ordinary
                  character. And then her soft blue eyes, and her almost golden hair, hanging in
                  thick wavy folds over her carnatic cheeks, add to the symmetry of her features
                  that sweetness which makes modesty more fascinating. And though she has been but a
                  slave, there is a glow of gentleness pervading her countenance, over which a
                  playful smile now sheds a glow of vivacity, as if awakening within her bosom new
                  hopes of the future.
               The suddenness with which they embarked served to confuse and dispel all traces of
                  recognition; and even the stranger, as they advanced toward him, hesitated ere he
                  greeted Annette and extended his hand. But they soon joined in conversation,
                  promenaded and mingled with the passengers. Cautious not to enter the main cabin,
                  they remained, supperless, on the upper deck, until near midnight. That social
                  prejudice which acts like a crushing weight upon the slave's mind was no longer to
                  deaden her faculties; no, she seemed like a new being, as, with childish
                  simplicity, her soul bounded forth in rhapsody of praise and thankfulness. Holding Franconia by the hand, she
                  would kiss her, fondle her head on her bosom, and continue to recount the pleasure
                  she anticipated when meeting her long-lost mother. "They'll sell me no more,
                  Franconia, will they?" she would exclaim, looking enquiringly in her face.
               "No, my poor child; you won't be worth selling in a land of freedom!" Franconia
                  would answer, jocosely. After charging Maxwell to be a father and a brother to the
                  fugitive girl,—to remember that a double duty was to be performed in his
                  guardianship over the being who had just escaped from slavery, they retired below,
                  and on the following morning found themselves safely landed at Wilmington, where,
                  after remaining about six hours, Franconia bid Annette and Maxwell adieu! saw them
                  on their way to New York, and returned to Charleston by the same steamer.
               On reaching her home, she was overjoyed at finding a letter from her parents, who,
                  as set forth, had many years resided on the west coast of Mexico, and had amassed
                  a considerable fortune through a connection with some mining operations. Lorenzo,
                  on the first discovery of gold in California, having joined a marauding party who
                  were traversing that country, was amongst the earliest who enriched themselves
                  from its bountiful yield. They gave up their wild pursuits, and with energy and
                  prudence stored-up their diggings, and resolved to lead a new life. With the
                  result of one year's digging, Lorenzo repaired to San Francisco, entered upon a
                  lucrative business, increased his fortune, and soon became a leading man of the
                  place. The hope that at some day he would have means wherewith to return home,
                  wipe away the stain which blotted his character, and relieve his parents from the
                  troubles into which his follies had brought them, seemed like a guiding star ever
                  before him. And then there was his generous-hearted uncle in the hands of
                  Graspum,—that man who never lost an opportunity of enriching himself while
                  distressing others. And now, by one of those singularities of fortune which give
                  persons long separated a key to each other's wayfaring, Lorenzo had found out the
                  residence of his parents on the west coast of Mexico. Yes; he was with them,
                  enjoying the comforts of their domicile, at the date of their letter. How happy
                  they would be to see their Franconia, to have her with them, and once more enjoy
                  their social re-unions so pleasantly given on brother Marston's plantation!
                  Numberless were the letters they had written her, but not an answer to one had
                  been received. This had been to them a source of great misgiving; and as a last
                  resource they had sent this letter enclosed to a friend, through whose kindness it
                  reached her.
               The happy intelligence brought by this letter so overjoyed Franconia that she
                  could with difficulty restrain her feelings. Tears of gladness coursed down her
                  cheeks, as she rested her head on Mrs. Rosebrook's bosom, saying, "Oh, how happy I
                  am! Sweet is the forgiveness which awaits us,—strong is the hope that through
                  darkness carries us into brighter prospects of the future." Her parents were yet
                  alive—happy and prosperous; her brother, again an honourable man, and regretting
                  that error which cost him many a tear, was with them. How inscrutable was the will
                  of an all-wise Providence: but how just! To be ever sanguine, and hope for the
                  best, is a passion none should be ashamed of, she thought. Thus elated in spirits
                  she could not resist the temptation of seeking them out, and enjoying the comforts
                  of their parental roof."
               But we must here inform the reader that M'Carstrow no longer acted the part of a
                  husband towards Franconia. His conduct as a debauchee had driven her to seek
                  shelter under the roof of Rosebrook's cottage, while he, a degraded libertine,
                  having wasted his living among cast-out gamblers, mingled only with their
                  despicable society. Stripped of all arts and disguises, and presented in its best
                  form, the result of Franconia's marriage with Colonel M'Carstrow was but one of
                  those very many unhappy connections so characteristic of southern life.
               Provided with funds which the generous Rosebrooks kindly furnished her, a
                  fortnight after the receipt of her father's letter found her embarked on board a
                  steamer bound for the Isthmus, from whence she would seek her parents overland.
                  With earnest resolution she had taken a fond leave of the Rosebrooks, and bid
                  adieu to that home and its associations so dear to her childhood; and with God and
                  happy associations her guide and her protector, was bounding over the sea. For
                  three days the gallant ship sped
                  swiftly onward, and the passengers, among whom she made many friends, seemed to
                  enjoy themselves with one accord, mingling together for various amusements,
                  spreading their social influence for the good of all, and, with elated spirits at
                  the bright prospect, anticipating a speedy voyage. All was bright, calm, and
                  cheering—the monster machines working smoothly, pressing the leviathan forward
                  with curling brine at her bows, until the afternoon of the fourth day, when the
                  wind in sharp gusts from the south-west, and the sudden falling of the barometer,
                  admonished the mariner of the approaching heavy weather. At sunset a heavy bank in
                  the west hung its foreboding festoons along the horizon, while light, fleecy
                  clouds gathered over the heavens, and scudded swiftly into the east. Steadily the
                  wind increased, the sea became restless, and the sharp chops thundering at the
                  weather bow, veering the ship from her course, rendering it necessary to keep her
                  head a point nearer the westward, betokened a gale. To leeward were the Bahamas,
                  their dangerous banks spreading awe among the passengers, and exciting the fears
                  of the more timid. On the starboard bow was Key West, with its threatening and
                  deceptive reefs, but far enough ahead to be out of danger. At midnight, the wind,
                  which had increased to a gale, howled in threatening fierceness. Overhead, the
                  leaden clouds hung low their massive folds, and thick spray buried the decks and
                  rigging; beneath, the angry ocean spread out in resistless waves of phosphorous
                  light, and the gallant craft surged to and fro like a thing of life on a plain of
                  rolling fire. Now she yields to the monster wave threatening her bow, over another
                  she rides proudly, and to a third her engines slowly rumble round, as with
                  half-buried deck she careens to its force. The man at the wheel, whose head we see
                  near a glimmering light at the stern, watches anxiously for the word of command,
                  and when received, executes it with quickness. An intruding sea has driven the
                  look-out from the knight-heads to a post at the funnel, where, near the foremast,
                  he clings with tenacious grip. Near him is the first officer, a veteran seaman,
                  who has seen some twenty years' service, receiving orders from the captain, who
                  stands at the weather quarter. Noiselessly the men proceed to execute their
                  duties. There is not that bustle nor display of seamanship, in preparing a steamer
                  for encountering a gale, so necessary in a sailing-ship; and all, save the angry
                  elements, move cautiously on. The engineer, in obedience to the captain's orders,
                  has slowed his engines. The ship can make but little headway against the fierce
                  sea; but still, obedient to her command, it is thought better to maintain power
                  just sufficient to keep her head to the sea. The captain says it is necessary, as
                  well to ease her working as not to strain her machinery. He is supposed the better
                  judge, and to his counsel all give ear. Now and then a more resolute passenger
                  shoots from no one knows where, holds struggling by the jerking shroud, and, wrapt
                  in his storm cloak, his amazed eyes, watching the scudding elements overhead, peer
                  out upon the raging sea: then he mutters, "What an awful sight! how madly grand
                  with briny light!" How sublimely terrific are the elements here combined to wage
                  war against the craft he thought safe from their thunders! She is but a pigmy in
                  their devouring sweep, a feeble prey at their mercy. The starboard wheel rumbles
                  as it turns far out of water; the larboard is buried in a deep sea the ship
                  careens into. Through the fierce drear he sees the black funnel vomiting its fiery
                  vapour high aloft; he hears the chain braces strain and creak in its support; he
                  is jerked from his grasp, becomes alarmed for his safety, and suddenly disappears.
                  In the cabin he tells his fellow voyagers how the storm rages fearfully: but it
                  needed not his word to confirm the fact: the sudden lurching, creaking of
                  panel-work, swinging to and fro of lamps, sliding from larboard to starboard of
                  furniture, the thumping of the sea against the ship's sides, prostrate passengers
                  made helpless by sea sickness, uncouched and distributed about the floor, moaning
                  females, making those not ill sick with their wailings, timid passengers in
                  piteous accents making their lamentations in state rooms, the half frightened
                  waiter struggling timidly along, and the wind's mournful music as it plays through
                  the shrouds, tell the tale but too forcibly. Hope, fear, and prayer, mingle in
                  curious discord on board this seemingly forlorn ship on an angry sea. Franconia
                  lies prostrate in her narrow berth, now bracing against the panels, then startled
                  by an angry sea striking at her pillow, like death with his warning mallet
                  announcing, "but sixteen inches separate us!"
               Daylight dawns forth, much to the relief of mariners and passengers; but neither the wind nor the sea have
                  lessened their fierceness. Slowly and steadily the engines work on; the good ship
                  looks defiantly at each threatening sea, as it sweeps along irresistibly; the
                  yards have been sent down, the topmasts are struck and housed; everything that can
                  render her easy in a sea has been stowed to the snuggest compass; but the broad
                  ocean is spread out a sheet of raging foam. The drenched captain, his whiskers
                  matted with saline, and his face glowing and flushed (he has stood the deck all
                  night), may be seen in the main cabin, cheering and dispelling the fears of his
                  passengers. The storm cannot last—the wind will soon lull—the sea at meridian will
                  be as calm as any mill-pond—he has seen a thousand worse gales; so says the
                  mariner, who will pledge his prophecy on his twenty years' experience. But in this
                  one instance his prophecy failed, for at noon the gale had increased to a
                  hurricane, the ship laboured fearfully, the engines strained and worked
                  unsteadily, while the sea at intervals made a breach of the deck. At two o'clock a
                  more gloomy spectacle presented itself; and despondency seemed to have seized all
                  on board, as a sharp, cone-like sea boarded the ship abaft, carried away the
                  quarter-boats from the starboard davys, and started several stancheons. Scarcely
                  was the work of destruction complete, when the condenser of the larboard engine
                  gave out, rendering the machine useless, and spreading dismay among the
                  passengers. Thus, dragging the wheel in so fearful a sea strained the ship more
                  and more, and rendered her almost unmanageable. Again a heavy, clanking noise was
                  heard, the steam rumbled from the funnel, thick vapour escaped from the hatchways,
                  the starboard engine stopped, and consternation reigned triumphant, as a man in
                  oily fustian approached the captain and announced both engines disabled. The
                  unmanageable monster now rolled and surged at the sweep of each succeeding sea,
                  which threatened to engulph her in its sway. A piece of canvas is set in the main
                  rigging, and her helm put hard down, in the hope of keeping her head to the wind.
                  But she obeys not its direction. Suddenly she yaws off into the trough of the sea,
                  lurches broad on, and ere she regains her way, a fierce sea sweeps
                  the house from the decks, carrying those within it into a watery grave. Shrieks
                  and moans, for a moment, mingle their painful discord with the murmuring wind, and
                  all is buried in the roar of the elements. By bracing the fore-yard
                  hard-a-starboard the unwieldy wreck is got before the wind; but the smoke-funnel
                  has followed the house, and so complete is the work of demolition that it is with
                  difficulty she can be kept afloat. Those who were in the main, or lower cabin,
                  startled at the sudden crash which had removed the house above, and leaving the
                  passages open, exposing them to the rushing water that invaded their state-rooms,
                  seek the deck, where a more dismal sight is presented in the fragments of wreck
                  spread from knight-head to taffrail. The anxious captain, having descended from
                  the upper deck a few minutes before the dire calamity, is saved to his passengers,
                  with whom and his men he labours to make safe what remains of his noble ship. Now
                  more at ease in the sea, with canvas brought from the store-rooms, are the hatches
                  and companions battened down, the splintered stancheons cleared away, and extra
                  pumps prepared for clearing the water fast gaining in the lower hold. Lumbering
                  moves the heavy mass over the mounting surge; but a serious leak having sprung in
                  the bow, consternation and alarm seem on the point of adding to the sources of
                  danger. "Coolness is our safeguard," says the captain. Indeed, the exercise of
                  that all-important virtue when destruction threatens would have saved thousands
                  from watery graves.
               His admonition was heeded,—all worked cheerfully, and for some time the water was
                  kept within bounds of subjection. As night approached the sea became calmer, a
                  bright streak gleamed along the western horizon; hearts that had sorrowed
                  gladdened with joy, as the murky clouds overhead chased quickly into the east and
                  dissolved, and the blue arch of heaven—hung with pearly stars of hope—shed its
                  peaceful glows over the murmuring sea.
               Again the night was passed in incessant labour of pumping and clearing up the
                  dismantled hull; but when daylight appeared, the wind having veered and increased,
                  the sea ran in short swells, rocking the unwieldly hull, and fearfully straining
                  every timber in its frame. The leak now increased rapidly, as also did the water
                  in the hold, now beyond their exertions to clear. At ten o'clock all hopes of
                  keeping the wreck afloat had disappeared; and the last alternative of a watery
                  grave, or launching upon the broad
                  ocean, presented its stern terms for their acceptance. A council decided to adopt
                  the latter, when, as the hulk began to settle in the sea, and with no little
                  danger of swamping, boats were launched, supplied with such stores as were at
                  hand, the passengers and crew embarked, and the frail barks sent away with their
                  hapless freight to seek a haven of safety. The leviathan hulk soon disappeared
                  from sight. Franconia, with twenty-five fellow unfortunates, five of whom were
                  females, had embarked in the mate's boat, which now shaped her course for Nassau,
                  the wind having veered into the north-west, and that seeming the nearest and most
                  available point. The clothing they stood in was all they saved; but with that
                  readiness to protect the female, so characteristic and noble of the sailor, the
                  mate and his men lightened the sufferings of the women by giving them a portion of
                  their own: incasing them with their jackets and fearnoughts, they would shield
                  them from the night chill. For five days were sufferings endured without a murmur
                  that can only be appreciated by those who have passed through shipwreck, or,
                  tossed upon the ocean in an open boat, been left to stare in the face grim hunger
                  and death. At noonday they sighted land ahead; and as each eager eye strained for
                  the welcome sight, it seemed rising from the ocean in a dim line of haze. Slowly,
                  as they neared, did it come bolder and bolder to view, until it shone out a long
                  belt of white panoramic banks. Low, and to the unpractised eye deceptive of
                  distance, the mate pronounced it not many miles off, and, the wind freshening
                  fair, kept the little bark steadily on her course, hoping thereby to gain it
                  before night came on: but the sun sank in a heavy cloud when yet some four miles
                  intervened. Distinctly they saw a cluster of houses on a projecting point nearly
                  ahead; but not a sail was off shore, to which the increasing wind was driving them
                  with great violence.
               And now that object which had been sighted with so much welcome in the
                  morning—that had cheered many a drooping heart, and seemed a haven of safety,
                  threatened their destruction. The water shoaled; the sea broke and surged in sharp
                  cones; the little craft tippled and yawed confusedly; the counter eddies twirled
                  and whirled in foaming concaves; and leaden clouds again hung their threatening
                  festoons over the awful sea. To lay her head to the sea was impracticable—an
                  attempt to "lay-to" under the little sail would be madness; onward she rode,
                  hurrying to an inevitable fate. Away she swept through the white crests, as the
                  wind murmured and the sea roared, and the anxious countenance of the mate, still
                  guiding the craft with a steady hand, seemed masked in watchfulness. His hand
                  remained firm to the helm, his eyes peered into the black prospect ahead: but not
                  a word did he utter.
               It was near ten o'clock, when a noise as of thunder rolling in the distance, and
                  re-echoing in booming accents, broke fearfully upon their ears. The sea, every
                  moment threatening to engulph the little craft, to sweep its freight of human
                  beings into eternity, and to seal for ever all traces of their fate, was now the
                  lesser enemy. Not a word had escaped the lips of a being on board for several
                  minutes; all seemed resigned to whatever fate Providence awarded.
               "The beach roars, Mr. Slade—"
               The mate interrupted before the seaman in the sheets had time to finish his
                  sentence: "I have not been deaf to the breakers; but there is no hope for us but
                  upon the beach; and may heaven save us there! Passengers, be calm! let me enjoin
                  you to remain firm to your places, and, if it be God's will that we strike, the
                  curling surf may be our deliverer. If it carry you to the sand in its sweep, press
                  quickly and resolutely forward, lest it drag you back in its grasp, and bury you
                  beneath its angry surge. Be firm, and hope for the best!" he said, with great
                  firmness. The man who first spoke sat near Franconia, and during the five days
                  they had been in the boat exhibited great sympathy and kindness of heart. He had
                  served her with food, and, though a common sailor, displayed those traits of
                  tenderness for the suffering which it were well if those in higher spheres of life
                  did but imitate. As the mate ceased speaking, the man took his pilot coat from his
                  shoulder and placed it about Franconia's, saying, "I will save this lady, or die
                  with her in the very same sea."
               "That's well done, Mr. Higgins!" (for such was the man's name). "Let the hardiest
                  not forget the females who have shown so much fortitude under trying
                  circumstances; let the strong not forget the weak, but all save who can," returned
                  the mate, as he scanned through the stormy elements ahead, in the hope of catching a glimpse
                  of the point.
               Drenched with the briny spray that swept over the little bark, never did woman
                  exhibit fortitude more resolute. Franconia thanked the man for his solicitude,
                  laid her hand nervously upon his arm, and, through the dark, watched his
                  countenance as if her fate was in its changes.
               The din and murmur of the surf now rose high above the wail of the sea. Fearful
                  and gloomy, a fretted shore stood out before them, extending from a bold jut on
                  the starboard hand away into the darkness on the left. Beneath it the angry surf
                  beat and lashed against the beach in a sheet of white foam, roaring in dismal
                  cadences.
               "Hadn't you better put her broad on, Mr. Slade?" enquired the young
                  seaman, peering along the line of surf that bordered the shore with its deluging
                  bank.
               "Ask no questions!" returned the mate, in a firm voice: "Act to the moment, when
                  she strikes—I will act until then." At the moment a terrific rumbling broke forth;
                  the din of elements seemed in battle conflict; the little bark, as if by some
                  unforeseen force, swept through the lashing surge, over a high curling wave, and
                  with a fearful crash lay buried in the boiling sand. Agonising shrieks sounded
                  amid the rage of elements; and then fainter and fainter they died away on the
                  wind's murmurs. Another moment, and the young sailor might have been seen,
                  Franconia's slender form in his arms, struggling against the devouring surf; but
                  how vain against the fierce monster were his noble efforts! The receding surge
                  swept them far from the shore, and buried them in its folds,—a watery grave
                  received the fair form of one whose life of love had been spotless, just, and
                  holy. The white wave was her winding-sheet,—the wind sang a requiem over her
                  watery grave,—and a just God received her spirit, and enthroned it high among the
                  angels.
               Of the twenty-seven who embarked in the little craft, but two gained the beach,
                  where they stood drenched and forlorn, as if contemplating the raging surf that
                  had but a minute before swallowed up their fellow voyagers. The boat had driven on
                  a flat sandy beach some two miles from the point on which stood the cluster of
                  dwellings before described; and from which two bright lights glimmered, like
                  beacons to guide the forlorn mariner. For them, the escaped men—one a passenger,
                  the other a seaman—shaped their course, wet, and sad at heart.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLIX.
               IN WHICH IS A SAD RECOGNITION.
               THE mate did not mistake his position, for the jut of land we described in the
                  last chapter is but a few hours' ride from Nassau, and the houses are inhabited by
                  wreckers. With desponding hearts did our unfortunates approach one of the rude
                  cabins, from the window of which a faint light glimmered, and hesitate at the
                  door, as if doubting the reception they were about to receive. The roaring of the
                  beach, and the sharp whistling of the wind, as in clouds it scattered the sand
                  through the air, drowned what sound might otherwise be heard from within. "This
                  cabin seems deserted," says one, as he taps on the door a second time. "No, that
                  cannot be!" returns the other, peering through a small window into the
                  barrack-like room. It was from this window the light shone, and, being a bleak
                  November night, a wood fire blazed on the great hearth, shedding its lurid glows
                  over everything around. It is the pale, saline light of wreckwood. A large
                  binnacle lamp, of copper, hung from the centre of the ceiling, its murky light
                  mingling in curious contrast to the pale shadows of the wreckwood fire. Rude
                  chains, and chests, and boxes, and ropes, and canvas, and broken bolts of copper,
                  and pieces of valuable wood, and various nautical relics—all indicating the trade
                  of shipwreck, lie or stand promiscuously about the room; while in the centre is a
                  table surrounded by chairs, some of which are turned aside, as if the occupants
                  had just left. Again, there may be seen hanging from the unplastered walls
                  numerous teeth of fish, bones and jaws of sharks, fins and flukes of curious
                  species, heads of the Floridian mamalukes, and preserved dolphins—all is
                  interspersed here and there with coloured prints, illustrative of Jack's leaving
                  or returning to his favourite Mary, with a lingering farewell or fond embrace.
               Louder and louder, assured of some living being within they knock at the door,
                  until a hoarse voice rather roars than speaks—"Aye, aye! hold hard a bit! I'se
                  bearin' a hand!" The sound came as if from the clouds, for not a living being was
                  visible. A pause followed; then suddenly a pair of dingy legs and feet descended
                  from a small opening above the window, which, until that moment, had escaped their
                  notice. The sight was, indeed, not the most encouraging to weak nerves. Clumsily
                  lowered the legs, the feet making a ladder of cleets of wood nailed to the window,
                  until the burly figure of the wrecker, encased with red shirt and blue trousers,
                  stood out full to view. Over his head stood bristly hair in jagged tufts; and as
                  he drew his brawny hand over the broad disc of his sun-scorched face, winking and
                  twisting his eyes in the glare, there stood boldly outlined on his features the
                  index of his profession. He shrugged his shoulders, gathered his nether garments
                  quickly about him, paused as if half confused and half overjoyed, then ran to the
                  fire-place, threw into a heap the charred wood with a long wooden poker, and
                  sought the door, saying—"Avast heavin a bit, Tom!" Having removed a wooden bar, he
                  stands in the opening, braving out the storm. "A screachin nor'easter this,
                  Tom—what'r ye sighted away, eh!" he concludes. He is—to use a vulgar term—aghast
                  with surprise. It was Tom Dasher's watch to-night; but no Tom stands before him.
                  "Hallo!—From whence came you?" he enquires of the stranger, with an air of anxious
                  surprise. He bids them come in, for the wind carries the sand rushing into his
                  domicile.
               "We are shipwrecked men in distress," says the passenger—the wrecker, with an air
                  of kindness, motioning them to sit down: "Our party have been swallowed up in the
                  surf a short distance below, and we are the only survivors here seeking
                  shelter."
               "Zounds you say—God be merciful!" interrupts the hardy wrecker, ere the stranger
                  had time to finish his sentence. "It was Tom's look-out to-night. Its ollers the
                  way wi' him—he gits turned in, and sleeps as niver a body see'd, and when time
                  comes to unbunk himself, one disn't know whether 'ts wind or Tom's snoarin cracks
                  hardest. Well, well,—God help us! Think ye now, if wife and I, didn't, in a half
                  sort of dream, fancy folks murmuring and crying on the beach about twelve, say. But the wind and the surf kept up such a
                  piping, and Tom said ther war nought a sight at sundown." With a warm expression
                  of good intention did our hardy host set about the preparing something to cheer
                  their drooping spirits. "Be at home there wi' me," says he; "and if things b'nt as
                  fine as they might be, remember we're poor folks, and have many a hard knock on
                  the reefs for what we drag out. Excuse the bits o' things ye may see about; and
                  wife 'll be down in a fip and do the vary best she can fo'h ye." He had a warm
                  heart concealed beneath that rough exterior; he had long followed the daring
                  profession, seen much suffering, lightened many a sorrowing heart. Bustling about
                  among old boxes and bags, he soon drew forth a lot of blankets and quilts, which
                  he spread upon the broad brick hearth, at the same time keeping up a series of
                  questions they found difficult to answer, so rapidly were they put. They had
                  indeed fallen into the hands of a good Samaritan, who would dress their wounds
                  with his best balms.
               "An' now I tak it ye must be famished; so my old woman must get up an' help mak ye
                  comfortable," says he, bringing forth a black tea-kettle, and filling it from a
                  pail that stood on a shelf near the fire-frame. He will hang it on the fire. He
                  had no need of calling the good dame; for as suddenly as mysteriously does the
                  chubby figure of a motherly-looking female of some forty years shoot from the
                  before described opening, and greeting the strangers with a hearty welcome, set
                  about preparing something to relieve their exhaustion. A gentle smile pervades her
                  little red face, so simply expressive; her peaked cap shines so brightly in
                  contrast with the black ribbon with which she secures it under her mole-bedecked
                  chin; and her short homespun frock sets so comely, showing her thick knit
                  stockings, and her feet well protected in calfskin laces, with heels a trooper
                  might not despise; and then, she spreads her little table with a heartiness that
                  adds its value to simple goodness,—her invitingly clean cups and saucers, and
                  knives and forks, as she spreads them, look so cheerful. The kettle begins to
                  sing, and the steam fumes from the spout, and the hardy wrecker brings his bottle
                  of old Jamaica, and his sugar; and such a bowl of hot punch was never made before.
                  "Come now," he says, "ye're in my little place; the wrecker as don't make the
                  distressed comfortable aneath his ruf 's a disgrace to the craft." And now he
                  hands each a mug of steaming punch, which they welcomely receive, a glow of
                  satisfaction bespreading his face, telling with what sincerity he gives it. Ere
                  they commenced sipping, the good dame brought pilot bread and set it before them;
                  and while she returned to preparing her supper the wrecker draws his wooden seat
                  by their side, and with ears attentive listens to the passenger as he recites the
                  disaster.
               "Only two out of twenty-seven saved—a sorry place that gulf!" he exclaims; "you
                  bear away, wife. Ah, many a good body's bones, too, have whitened the beach beside
                  us; many 's the bold fellow has been dashed upon it to die unknown," he continues,
                  with serious face. "And war ner onny wemen amang ye, good man?" interposes the
                  good dame.
               "Seven; they have all passed into eternity!" rejoins the seaman, who, till then,
                  had been a mute looker-on.
               "Poor souls! how they mun' 'ave suffered!" she sighs, shaking her head, and
                  leaning against the great fire frame, as her eyes fill with tears. The wrecker
                  must needs acquaint Tom Dasher, bring him to his aid, and, though the storm yet
                  rages, go search the beating surf where roll the unfortunates. Nay, the good dame
                  will herself execute the errand of mercy, while he supplies the strangers with dry
                  clothes; she will bring Tom hither. She fears not the tempest while her soul warms
                  to do good; she will comfort the distressed who seek shelter under her roof. With
                  the best his rough wardrobe affords does the wrecker clothe them, while his good
                  wife, getting Tom up, relates her story, and hastens back with him to her
                  domicile. Tom is an intrepid seafarer, has spent some seven years wrecking, saved
                  many a life from the grasp of the grand Bahama, and laid up a good bit of money
                  lest some stormy day may overtake him and make the wife a widow.
               "This is a hard case, Stores!" says Tom, addressing himself to our wrecker, as
                  with sharp, hairy face, and keen black eyes, his countenance assumes great
                  seriousness. Giving his sou'-wester a cant back on his head, running his left hand
                  deep into the pocket of his pea-jacket,
                  and supplying his mouth with tobacco from his right, he stands his tall figure
                  carelessly before the fire, and in a contemplative mood remains silent for a few
                  minutes.
               "Aye, but somethin' mun' be done, Tom," says the first wrecker, breaking
                  silence.
               "Yes; as my name is Tom Dasher, there must. We must go to the beach, and see what
                  it's turned up,—what there is to be seen, an' the like o' that." Then, turning to
                  the strangers, he continued, "Pity yer skipper hadn't a headed her two points
                  further suthard, rounded the point just above here a bit, and made a lee under the
                  bend. Our craft lies there now,—as snug as Tompkins' wife in her chamber!"
               "Yes, but, Tom! ye dinna think as the poor folks could know all things," speaks up
                  the woman, as Tom was about to add a few items more, merely to give the strangers
                  some evidence of his skill.
               "Aye, aye,—all right; I didn't get the balance on't just then," returned Tom,
                  nodding his head with an air of satisfaction.
               A nice supper of broiled fish, and toast, and tea, and hot rum punch—of which Tom
                  helped himself without stint—was set out, the strangers invited to draw up, and
                  all partook of the plain but cheering fare. As daylight was fast approaching, the
                  two wreckers dispatched their meal before the others, and sought the spot on the
                  beach described as where the fatal wreck took place, while the good dame put the
                  shipwrecked to sleep in the attic, and covered them with her warmest rugs and
                  blankets.
               Not a vestige of the wreck was to be seen—not a fragment to mark the spot where
                  but a few hours before twenty-five souls were hurried into eternity. They stood
                  and stood, scanning over the angry ocean into the gloom: nothing save the wail of
                  the wind and the sea's roar greeted their ears. Tom Dasher thinks either they have
                  been borne out into the fathomless caves, or the men are knaves with false stories
                  in their mouths.
               Stores,—for such is our good man's name—turning from the spot, says daylight will
                  disclose a different scene; with the wind as it is the bodies will be drawn into
                  the eddy on the point, and thrown ashore by the under-current, for burial. "Poor
                  creatures! there's no help for them now;" he adds, sighing, as they wend their way
                  back to the cabin, where the good dame waits their coming. Their search was in
                  vain; having no news to bring her, she must be contented until morning. If the
                  bodies wash ashore, the good woman of the Humane Society will come down from the
                  town, and see them decently buried. Stores has several times spoken of this good
                  woman; were she a ministering angel he could not speak of her name with more
                  reverence. For years, he tells us, has she been a harbinger of good, ever
                  relieving the sick and needy, cheering the downcast, protecting the unfortunate.
                  Her name has become a symbol of compassion; she mingles with the richest and the
                  poorest, and none know her but to love and esteem her. "And she, too, is an
                  American lady!" Stores says, exultingly. And to judge from his praise, we should
                  say, if her many noble deeds were recorded on fair marble, it would not add one
                  jot to that impression of her goodness made on the hearts of the people among whom
                  she lives.
               "Ah, man! she's a good woman, and everybody loves and looks up to her. And she's
                  worth loving, too, because she's so kind," adds the good dame, significantly
                  canting her head.
               Daylight was now breaking in the east, and as there seemed no chance of making a
                  search on the bank that day, such was the fierceness of the wind, the two men
                  drank again of the punch, spread their blankets before the fire, lay their hardy
                  figures down, and were soon in a profound sleep. The woman, more watchful, coiled
                  herself in a corner of the room on some sail-cloth, but did not sleep.
               At ten o'clock they were aroused by the neighbours, who, in great anxiety, had
                  come to inform them of an event they were already conscious of,—adding, however,
                  as an evidence of what had taken place, that sixteen male and three female bodies,
                  borne to the rips at the point, had been thrown upon the shore. The
                  denizens of the point were indeed in a state of excitement; a messenger had been
                  sent into the town for the coroner, which said functionary soon spread the news
                  about, creating no little commotion among the inhabitants, many of whom repaired
                  to the scene of the disaster.
               
               When it became known that two witnesses to the dire misfortune had been spared to
                  tell the tale, and were now at Stores' house, the excitement calmed into sympathy.
                  The wrecker's little village resounded with curious enquiries, and few were they
                  who would be satisfied without a recital of the sad tale by the rescued men.
               Carefully they brought the dead bodies from the shore, and laid them in an
                  untenanted house, to await the coroner's order. Among them was the slender form of
                  Franconia, the dark dress in which she was clad but little torn, and the rings yet
                  remaining on her fingers. "How with fortitude she bore the suffering!" said the
                  rescued passenger, gazing on her blanched features as they laid her on the floor:
                  the wrecker's wife covered her with a white sheet, and spread a pillow carefully
                  beneath her head.
               "Yes!" returns the unfortunate seaman, who stood by his side, "she seemed of great
                  goodness and gentleness. She said nothing, bore everything without a murmur; she
                  was Higgins' pet; and I'll lay he died trying to save her, for never a braver
                  fellow than Jack Higgins stood trick at a wheel."
               The coroner arrives as the last corpse is brought from the sand: he holds his
                  brief inquest, orders them buried, and retires. Soon, three ladies—Stores' wife
                  tells us they are of the Humane Society—make their appearance in search of the
                  deceased. They enter Stores' house, greet his good dame familiarly, and remain
                  seated while she relates what has happened. One of the three is tall and stately
                  of figure, and dressed with that quiet taste so becoming a lady. And while to the
                  less observing eye no visible superiority over the others is discernible, it is
                  evident they view her in such a light, always yielding to her counsels. Beneath a
                  silk bonnet trimmed with great neatness, is disclosed a finely oval face, glowing
                  with features of much regularity, large dark eyes of great softness, and silky
                  hair, laid in heavy wavy folds across a beautifully arched brow—to which is added
                  a sweet smile that ever and anon plays over her slightly olive countenance. There,
                  boldly outlined, is the unmistakeable guide to a frank and gentle nature. For
                  several minutes does she listen to the honest woman's recital of the sad event,
                  which is suspended by the passenger making his appearance. The wrecker's wife
                  introduces him by motioning her hand, and saying, "This is the kind lady of whose
                  goodness I spoke so last night." Anxiously does she gather from the stranger each
                  and every incident of the voyage: this done, she will go to the house where lay
                  the dead, our good Dame Stores leading the way, talking from the very honesty of
                  her heart the while. In a small dilapidated dwelling on the bleak sands, the dead
                  lay. Children and old men linger about the door,—now they make strange mutterings,
                  and walk away, as if in fear. Our messengers of mercy have entered the abode of
                  the dead. The wrecker's wife says, "They are to be buried to-morrow, ma'am;" while
                  the lady, with singular firmness, glances her eye along the row of male bodies,
                  counting them one by one. She has brought shrouds, in which to bury them like
                  Christians.
               "Them three females is here, ma'am," says Dame Stores, touching the lady on the
                  elbow, as she proceeds to uncover the bodies. The passenger did, indeed, tell our
                  Lady of Mercy there was one handsome lady from Carolina. One by one she views
                  their blanched and besanded features.
               "A bonny figure that, mum; I lay she's bin a handsome in her day," with honest
                  simplicity remarks Dame Stores, as, bent over the lifeless body of Franconia, she
                  turns back the sheet, carefully. "Yes," is the quick reply: the philanthropic
                  woman's keen eye scans along the body from head to foot. Dame Stores will part the
                  silken hair from off that cold brow, and smooth it with her hand. Suddenly our
                  lady's eyes dart forth anxiety; she recognises some familiar feature, and
                  trembles. The rescued seaman had been quietly viewing the bodies, as if to
                  distinguish their different persons, when a wrecker, who had assisted in removing
                  the bodies, entered the room and approached him, "Ah!" exclaims the seaman,
                  suddenly, "yonder's poor Jack Higgins." He points to a besanded body at the right,
                  the arms torn and bent partly over the breast, adding, "Jack had a good heart, he
                  had." Turning half round, the wrecker replies, "That 'un had this 'un fast
                  grappled in his arms; it was a time afore we got 'um apart."
               "Was it this body?" enquires the lady, looking at the lifeless form before her. He
                  says, "That same, ma'am; an' it looked as if he had tried to save the slender
                  woman." He points to the body which Dame Stores has just uncovered. The good lady
                  kneels over the body: her face suddenly
                  becomes pale; her lips purple and quiver; she seems sinking with nervous
                  excitement, as tremulously she seizes the blanched hand in her own. Cold and
                  frigid, it will not yield to her touch "That face—those brows, those pearly teeth,
                  those lips so delicate,—those hands,—those deathless emblems! how like Franconia
                  they seem," she ejaculates frantically, the bystanders looking on with surprise.
                  "And are they not my Franconia's—my dear deliverer's?" she continues. She smooths
                  the cold hands, and chafes them in her own. The rings thereon were a present from
                  Marston. "Those features like unto chiselled marble are hers; I am not deceived:
                  no! oh no! it cannot be a dream" (in sorrow she shakes her head as the tears begin
                  to moisten her cheeks), "she received my letter, and was on her way seeking me."
                  Again she smooths and smooths her left hand over those pallid cheeks, her right
                  still pressing the cold hand of the corpse, as her emotions burst forth in
                  agonising sobs.
               The wrecker's wife loosens the dress from about deceased's neck—bares that bosom
                  once so fair and beautiful. A small locket, attached to a plain black necklace,
                  lies upon it, like a moat on a snowy surface. Nervously does the good woman grasp
                  it, and opening it behold a miniature of Marston, a facsimile of which is in her
                  own possession. "Somethin' more 'ere, mum," says Dame Stores, drawing from beneath
                  a lace stomacher the lap of her chemise, on which is written in indelible
                  ink—"Franconia M'Carstrow." The doubt no longer lent its aid to hope; the lady's
                  sorrowing heart can no longer withstand the shock. Weeping tears of anguish, she
                  says, "May the God of all goodness preserve her pure spirit, for it is my
                  Franconia! she who was my saviour; she it was who snatched me from death, and put
                  my feet on the dry land of freedom, and gave me—ah, me!" she shrieked,—and fell
                  swooning over the lifeless body, ere Dame Stores had time to clasp her in her
                  arms.
               My reader can scarcely have failed to recognise in this messenger of mercy,—this
                  good woman who had so ennobled herself by seeking the sufferer and relieving his
                  wants, and who makes light the cares of the lowly, the person of that
                  slave-mother, Clotilda. Having drank of the bitterness of slavery, she the more
                  earnestly cheers the desponding. That lifeless form, once so bright of beauty, so
                  buoyant of heart and joyous of spirit, is Franconia; she it was who delivered the
                  slave-mother from the yoke of bondage, set her feet on freedom's heights, and on
                  her head invoked its genial blessings. Her soul had yearned for the slave's good;
                  she had been a mother to Annette, and dared snatch her from him who made the slave
                  a wretch,—democracy his boast! It was Franconia who placed the miniature of
                  Marston about Clotilda's neck on the night she effected her escape,—bid her God
                  speed into freedom. All that once so abounded in goodness now lies cold in death.
                  Eternity has closed her lips with its strong seal,—no longer shall her soul be
                  harassed with the wrongs of a slave world: no! her pure spirit has ascended among
                  the angels.
               We will not longer pain the reader's feelings with details of this sad
                  recognition, but inform him that the body was removed to Clotilda's peaceful
                  habitation, from whence, with becoming ceremony, it was buried on the following
                  day. A small marble tablet, standing in a sequestered churchyard near the
                  outskirts of Nassau, and on which the traveller may read these simple words:—"Franconia, my friend, lies here!" over which, in a circle, is
                  chiseled the figure of an angel descending, and beneath, "How happy
                  in Heaven are the Good!" marks the spot where her ashes rest in peace.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER L.
               IN WHICH A DANGEROUS PRINCIPLE IS ILLUSTRATED.
               SHOULD the sagacious reader be disappointed in our hero Nicholas, who, instead of
                  being represented as a model of disinterestedness, perilling his life to save
                  others, sacrificing his own interests for the cause of liberty, and wasting on
                  hardened mankind all those amiable qualities which belong only to angels, but with
                  which heroes are generally invested for the happy purpose of pleasing the lover of
                  romance, has evinced little else than an unbending will, he will find a palliation
                  in that condition of life to which his oppressors have forced him to submit. Had
                  Nicholas enjoyed his liberty, many incidents of a purely disinterested character
                  might have been recorded to his fame, for indeed he had noble traits. That we have
                  not put fiery words into his mouth, with which to execrate the tyrant, while
                  invoking the vengeance of heaven—and, too, that we are guilty of the crime of thus
                  suddenly transferring him from boyhood to manhood, nor have hanged him to please
                  the envious and vicious,—will find excuse with the indulgent reader, who will be
                  kind enough to consider that it is our business to relate facts as they are, to
                  the performance of which—unthankful though it may be—we have drawn from the
                  abundance of material placed in our hand by the southern world. We may misname
                  characters and transpose scenes, but southern manners and customs we have
                  transcribed from nature, to which stern book we have religiously adhered. And, too
                  (if the reader will pardon the digression), though we never have agreed with our
                  very best admirers of the gallows, some of whom hold it a means of correcting
                  morals—nor, are yet ready to yield assent to the opinions of the many, so
                  popularly laid down in favour of what we consider a medium of very unwholesome
                  influence, we readily admit the existence of many persons who have well merited a
                  very good hanging. But, were the same rules of evidence admissible in a court of
                  law when a thief is on trial, applied against the practice of "publicly hanging,"
                  there would be little difficulty in convicting it of inciting to crime. Not only
                  does the problem of complex philosophy—the reader may make the philosophy to suit
                  his taste—presented in the contrariety of scenes on and about the gallows offer
                  something irreconcileable to ordinary minds, but gives to the humorous large means
                  with which to feast their love of the ludicrous. On the scaffold of destruction,
                  our good brothers of the clergy would, pointing to the "awful example," assure the
                  motley assembly gathered beneath, that he hath purified that soul, which will
                  surely be accepted in heaven; but, he can in no wise condescend to let it, still
                  directing the flesh, live on the less pure platform of earth. With eager eyes, the
                  mass beneath him, their morbid appetites curiously distended, heed not the good
                  admonition; nay, the curious wait in breathless suspense the launching a human
                  being into eternity; the vicious are busy in crime the while; the heedless make
                  gay the holiday. Sum up the invention and perpetration of crime beneath the
                  gallows on one of those singular gala-days, and the culprit expiating his guilt at
                  the rope's end, as an "awful warning," will indeed have disclosed a shallow
                  mockery. Taking this view of the hanging question, though we would deprive no man
                  of his enjoyment, we deem it highly improper that our hero should die by any other
                  means than that which the chivalrous sons of the south declared "actually
                  necessary."
               But before proceeding further with Nicholas, it may be proper here to state that
                  Annette and the stranger, in whose hands we left her, have arrived safe at New
                  York. Maxwell—for such is his name—is with his uncle engaged in a lucrative
                  commercial business; while Annette, for reasons we shall hereafter explain,
                  instead of forthwith seeking the arms of an affectionate mother, is being educated
                  at a female seminary in a village situated on the left bank of the Hudson
                  River.
               In returning to Nicholas, the reader will remember that Grabguy was something of a
                  philosopher, the all-important functions of which medium he invoked on the
                  occasion of his ejectment from Fetter's court, for an interference which might at
                  that moment have been taken as evidence of repentance. The truth, however, was,
                  that Grabguy, in the exercise of his philosophy, found the cash value of his slave
                  about to be obliterated by the carrying
                  out of Fetter's awful sentence. Here there rose that strange complexity which the
                  physical action and mental force of slave property, acting in contrariety, so
                  often produce. The physical of the slave was very valuable, and could be made to
                  yield; but the mental being all powerful to oppose, completely annulled the
                  monetary worth. But by allowing the lacerations to heal, sending him to New
                  Orleans, and making a positive sale, some thousand or twelve hundred dollars might
                  be saved; whereas, did Fetter's judgment take effect, Mr. Grabguy must content
                  himself with the state's more humble award of two hundred dollars, less the
                  trouble of getting. In this democratic perplexity did our economical alderman find
                  himself placed, when, again invoking his philosophy—not in virtue of any
                  sympathetic admonition, for sympathy was not of Grabguy—he soon found means of
                  protecting his interests. To this end he sought and obtained an order from the
                  Court of Appeals, which grave judiciary, after duly considering the evidence on
                  which the criminal was convicted before Fetter's tribunal, was of opinion that
                  evidence had been improperly extorted by cruelty; and, in accordance with that
                  opinion, ordered a new trial, which said trial would be 
                     dististinguished
                     distinguished
                   above that at Fetter's court by being presided over by a
                     judicial magistrate. This distinguished functionary, the judicial
                  magistrate, who generally hears the appeals from Fetter's court, is a man of the
                  name of Fairweather Fuddle, a clever wag, whose great good-nature is only equalled
                  by the rotundity of his person, which is not a bad portraiture of our much-abused
                  Sir John Falstaff, as represented by the heavy men of our country theatres. Now,
                  to enter upon an analysis of the vast difference between Fetter's court in
                  ordinary, and Fuddle's court in judiciary, would require the aid of more
                  philosophy than we are capable of summoning; nor would the sagacious reader be
                  enlightened thereby, inasmuch as the learned of our own atmosphere have spent much
                  study on the question without arriving at any favourable result. Very low people,
                  and intelligent negroes—whose simple mode of solving difficult problems frequently
                  produces results nearest the truth—do say without fear or trembling that the
                  distinction between these great courts exists in the fact of Justice Fuddle
                  drinking the more perfect brandy. Now, whether the quality of brandy has anything
                  to do with the purity of ideas, the character of the judiciary, or the tempering
                  of the sentences, we will leave to the reader's discrimination; but true it is,
                  that, while Fetter's judgments are always for the state, Fuddle leans to mercy and
                  the master's interests. Again, were Fuddle to evince that partiality for the
                  gallows which has become a trait of character with his legal brother, it would
                  avail him nothing, inasmuch as by confirming Fetter's judgments the fees would
                  alike remain that gentleman's. If, then, the reader reason on the philosophy of
                  self-interest, he may find the fees, which are in no wise small, founding the
                  great distinction between the courts of Messrs. Fuddle and Fetter; for by
                  reversing Fetter's judgments fees accrue to Fuddle's own court, and belong to his
                  own well-lined pocket; whereas, did he confirm them, not one cent of fees could he
                  claim. The state should without delay remedy this great wrong, and give its
                  judicial gentlemen a fair chance of proving their judgments well founded in
                  contrariety. We should not, forsooth, forget to mention that Fuddle, in his love
                  of decorum—though he scarce ever sat in judgment without absorbing his punch the
                  while—never permitted in his forum the use of those knock-down arguments which
                  were always a prelude to Fetter's judgments.
               Before Fuddle's court, then, Grabguy has succeeded in getting a hearing for his
                  convicted property, still mentally obstinate. Not the least doubt has he of
                  procuring a judgment tempered by mercy; for, having well drunk Fuddle on the
                  previous night, and improved the opportunity for completely winning his
                  distinguished consideration, he has not the slightest apprehension of being many
                  months deprived of his property merely to satisfy injured justice. And, too, the
                  evidence upon which Nicholas was convicted in Fetter's court, of an attempt to
                  create an insurrection—the most fatal charge against him—was so imperfect that the
                  means of overthrowing it can be purchased of any of the attendant constables for a
                  mere trifle,—oaths with such fellows being worth about sixty-two and a half cents
                  each.
               If the reader will be pleased to fancy the trial before Fetter's tribunal—before
                  described—with the knock-down arguments omitted, he will have a pretty clear idea
                     of that now proceeding before
                  Fuddle's; and having such will excuse our entering into details. Having heard the
                  case with most, learned patience, the virtue of which has been well sustained by
                  goodly potions of Paul and Brown's perfect "London Dock," Fuddle, with grave
                  deportment, receives from the hands of the clerical-looking clerk—a broken-down
                  gentleman of great legal ability—the charge he is about to make the jury.
                  "Gentlemen," he says, "I might, without any detriment to perfect impunity, place
                  the very highest encomiums on the capabilities displayed in the seriousness you
                  have given to this all-important case, in which the state has such deep and
                  constitutional interests; but that I need not do here. The state having placed in
                  my possession such responsible functions, no one more than me can feel the
                  importance of the position; and which position has always been made the judicial
                  medium of equity and mercy. I hold moderation to be the essential part of the
                  judiciary, gentlemen! And here I would say" (Fuddle directs himself to his
                  gentlemanly five) "and your intelligence will bear me out in the statement, that
                  the trial below seems to have been in error from beginning to end. I say
                  this—understand, gentlemen!—with all deference to my learned brother, Fetter,
                  whose judgments, in the exercise of the powers in me invested, and with that
                  respect for legal equity by which this court is distinguished, it has become me so
                  often to reverse. On the charge of creating an insurrection—rather an absurdity,
                  by the way—you must discharge the prisoner, there being no valid proof; whereas
                  the charge of maiming or raising his hand to a white man, though clearly proved,
                  and according to the statutes a capital offence, could not in the spirit of mercy
                  which now prevails in our judiciary—and, here, let me say, which is emulated by
                  that high state of civilisation for which the people of this state are
                  distinguished—be carried rigidly into effect. There is only this one point, then,
                  of maiming a white gentleman, with intention—Ah! yes (a pause) the intention the
                  court thinks it as well not to mind! open to you for a conviction. Upon this point
                  you will render your verdict, guilty; only adding a recommendation to the mercy of
                  the court." With this admonition, our august Mr. Fuddle, his face glowing in
                  importance, sits down to his mixture of Paul and Brown's best. A few moments'
                  pause—during which Fetter enters looking very anxious—and the jury have made up
                  their verdict, which they submit on a slip of paper to the clerk, who in turn
                  presents it to Fuddle. That functionary being busily engaged with his punch, is
                  made conscious of the document waiting his pleasure by the audience bursting into
                  a roar of laughter at the comical picture presented in the earnestness with which
                  he regards his punch—some of which is streaming into his bosom—and disregards the
                  paper held for some minutes in the clerk's hand, which is in close proximity with
                  his nasal organ. Starting suddenly, he lets the goblet fall to the floor, his face
                  flushing like a broad moon in harvest-time, takes the paper in his fingers with a
                  bow, making three of the same nature to his audience, as Fetter looks over the
                  circular railing in front of the dock, his face wearing a facetious smile. "Nigger
                  boy will clear away the break,—prisoner at the bar will stand up for the sentence,
                  and the attending constable will reduce order!" speaks Fuddle, relieving his
                  pocket of a red kerchief with which he will wipe his capacious mouth. These
                  requests being complied with, he continues—having adjusted his glasses most
                  learnedly—making a gesture with his right hand—"I hold in my hand the solemn
                  verdict of an intelligent jury, who, after worthy and most mature deliberation,
                  find the prisoner at the bar, Nicholas Grabguy, guilty of the heinous offence of
                  raising his hand to a white man, whom he severely maimed with a sharp-edged tool;
                  and the jury in their wisdom, recognising the fact of their verdict involving
                  capital punishment, have, in the exercise of that enlightened spirit which is
                  inseparable from our age, recommended him to the mercy of this court, and, in the
                  discretion of that power in me invested, I shall now pronounce sentence." Prepare,
                  then, ye lovers of civilisation, ye friends of humanity, ye who would temper the
                  laws of our land of freedom to the circumstance of offences—prepare, I say, to
                  have your ears and hearts made glad over the swelling sound of this most
                  enlightened sentence of a court, where judgments are tempered with mercy." Our
                  hero, a chain hanging loosely from his left arm, stands forward in the dock, his
                  manly deportment evincing a stern resolution to meet his fate unsubdued. Fuddle
                  continues:—"There is no appeal from this court!" (he forgot the court of a
                  brighter world) "and a reversing the
                  decision of the court below, I sentence the prisoner to four years' imprisonment
                  with hard labour, two months' solitary confinement in each year, and thirty blows
                  with the paddle, on the first day of each month until the expiration of the
                  sentence." Such, reader, was Fuddle's merciful sentence upon one whose only crime
                  was a love of freedom and justice. Nicholas bowed to the sentence; Mr. Grabguy
                  expressed surprise, but no further appeal on earth was open to him; Squire Fetter
                  laughed immeasurably; and the officer led his victim away to the place of durance
                  vile.
               To this prison, then, must we go with our hero. In this magnificent establishment,
                  its princely exterior seeming like a modern fort with frowning bastions, are some
                  four hundred souls for sale and punishment. Among them Nicholas is initiated,
                  having, for the time being, received his first installment of blows, and takes his
                  first lesson in the act of breaking stone, which profession is exclusively
                  reserved for criminals of his class. Among the notable characters connected with
                  this establishment is Philip Fladge, the wily superintendent, whose power over the
                  criminals is next to absolute. Nicholas has been under Philip's guardianship but a
                  few months, when it is found that he may be turned into an investment which will
                  require only the outlay of kindness and amelioration on his part to become
                  extremely profitable. Forthwith a convention is entered into, the high contracting
                  parties being Nicholas and himself. Mr. Fladge stipulates on his part that the
                  said Nicholas, condemned by Fairweather Fuddle's court to such punishments as are
                  set forth in the calendar, shall be exempt from all such punishments, have the
                  free use of the yard, comfortable apartments to live in, and be invested with a
                  sort of foremanship over his fellow criminals; in consideration of which it is
                  stipulated on the part of Nicholas that he do work at the more desirable
                  profession of stucco-making, together with the execution of orders for sculpture,
                  the proceeds of which were to be considered the property of Fladge, he allowing
                  the generous stipend of one shilling a week to the artist. Here, then, Mr. Fladge
                  becomes sensible of the fact that some good always come of great evils, for indeed
                  his criminal was so far roving a mine of wealth that he only hoped it might be his
                  fortune to receive many more such enemies of the state: he cared not whether they
                  came from Fetter or Fuddle's court. With sense enough to keep his heart-burnings
                  well stored away in his own bosom, Nicholas soon became a sort of privileged
                  character. But if he said little, he felt much; nor did he fail to occupy every
                  leisure moment in inciting his brother bondmen to a love of freedom. So far had he
                  gained complete control over their feelings, that scarce two months of his
                  sentence had expired ere they would have followed his lead to death or
                  freedom.
               Among those human souls stored for sale was one Sal Stiles, an olive wench of
                  great beauty, and daughter of one of the very first families. This Sal Stiles, who
                  was indeed one of the most charming creatures to look upon, had cousins whom the
                  little world of Charleston viewed as great belles; but these said belles were never known to ring out a word in
                  favour of poor Sal, who was, forsooth, only what—in our vulgar parlance—is called
                  a well-conditioned and very marketable woman. Considering, then, that Nicholas had
                  been separated by Grabguy from his wife and children, the indulgent reader, we
                  feel assured, will excuse our hero for falling passionately in love with this
                  woman. That it was stipulated in the convention between himself and Fladge, he
                  should take her unto himself, we are not justified in asserting; nevertheless,
                  that that functionary encouraged the passion rather than prevented their meetings
                  is a fact our little world will not pretend to deny.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LI.
               A CONTINUATION OF THE LAST CHAPTER.
               A YEAR and two months have rolled by, since Nicholas, a convict, took up his abode
                  within the frowning walls of a prison: thus much of Fuddle's merciful sentence has
                  he served out. In the dreary hours of night, fast secured in his granite cell, has
                  he cherished, and even in his dreams contemplated, the means of escaping into that
                  freedom for which his soul yearns. But, dearly does he love Sal Stiles, to whose
                  keeping he confides the secret of his ambition; several times might he, having
                  secured the confidence of Fladge, have effected his own escape; but the
                  admonitions of a faithful heart bid him not leave her behind in slavery. To that
                  admonition of his bosom did he yield, and resolve never to leave her until he
                  secured her freedom. A few days after he had disclosed to her his resolution, the
                  tall figure of Guy Grantham, a broker of slaves by profession, appeared in the
                  prison yard, for the purpose of carrying away the woman, whom he had sold for the
                  Washington market, where her charms would indeed be of much value during the
                  session, when congress-men most do riot. Already were the inseparable chains about
                  her hands, and the miserable woman, about to be led away, bathed in grief.
                  Nicholas, in his studies, had just finished a piece of scroll-work for Mrs.
                  Fladge, as a companion approached him in great haste, and whispered the word of
                  trouble—"they're taking her away"—in his ear. Quick as lightning did the anger of
                  his very soul break forth like a tempest: he rushed from his place of labour,
                  vaulted as it were to the guard gate, seized the woman as she stepped on the
                  threshold in her exit, drew her back with great force, and in a defiant attitude,
                  drawing a long stiletto from his belt, placed himself between her and her
                  destroyer. "Foes of the innocent, your chains were not made for this woman; never
                  shall you bear her from this; not, at least, while I have arm to defend her, and a
                  soul that cares not for your vengeance!" spake he, with curling contempt on his
                  lip, as his adversaries stood aghast with fear and trembling. "Nay!—do not advance
                  one step, or by the God of justice I make ye feel the length of this steel!" he
                  continued, as Grantham nervously motioned an attempt to advance. Holding the woman
                  with his left hand pressed backward, he brandished his stiletto in the faces of
                  his opponents with his right. This was rebellion in its most legal acceptation,
                  and would have justified the summary process Grantham was about adopting for the
                  disposal of the instigator, at whose head he levelled his revolver, and, without
                  effect, snapped two caps, as Nicholas bared his bosom with the taunt—"Coward,
                  shoot!" Mr. Fladge, who was now made sensible of the error his indulgence had
                  committed, could not permit Grantham the happy display of his bravery; no, he has
                  called to his aid some ten subguardsmen, and addressing the resolute Grantham,
                  bids him lay aside his weapon. Albeit he confesses his surprise at such strange
                  insolence and interference; but, being responsible for the life, thinks it well to
                  hold a parley before taking it. Forsooth his words fall useless on the ears of
                  Nicholas, as defiantly he encircles the woman's waist with his left arm, bears her
                  away to the block, dashes the chains from her hands, and, spurning the honied
                  words of Fladge, hurls them in the air, crying: "You have murdered the
                  flesh;—would you chain the soul?" As he spoke, the guard, having ascended the
                  watch tower, rings out the first alarm peal. "Dogs of savage might! ring your
                  alarms; I care not," he continued, casting a sardonic glance at the tower as the
                  sound died away on his ear. His pursuers now made a rush upon him, but ere they
                  had secured him he seized a heavy bludgeon, and repelling their attack, found some
                  hundred of his companions, armed with stone hammers, rallying in his defence.
                  Seeing this formidable force thus suddenly come to his rescue, Mr. Fladge and his
                  force were compelled to fall back before the advance. Gallantly did Nicholas lead
                  on his sable band, as the woman sought refuge in one of the cells, Mr. Fladge and
                  his posse retreating into the guard-house. Nicholas, now in full possession of the
                  citadel, and with consternation and confusion triumphant within the walls, found
                  it somewhat difficult to restrain his forces from taking possession of the
                  guardhouse, and putting to death those who had sought shelter therein. Calmly but firmly did he appeal to them,
                  and beseech them not to commit an outrage against life. As he had placed himself
                  between the woman and her pursuers, so did he place himself before a file of his
                  sable companions, who, with battle hammers extended, rushed for the great gates,
                  as the second alarm rung out its solemn peal. Counselling his compatriots to stand
                  firm, he gathered them together in the centre of the square, and addressed them in
                  a fervent tone, the purport of which was, that having thus suddenly and
                  unexpectedly become plunged into what would be viewed by the laws of the land as
                  insurrection, they must stand on the defensive, and remember it were better to die
                  in defence of right than live under the ignorance and sorrow of slavery.
               While our hero—whose singular exploit we have divested of that dramatic effect
                  presented in the original—addressed his forlorn band in the area of the prison,
                  strange indeed was the scene of confusion presenting along the streets of the
                  city. The alarm peals had not died ineffectual on the air, for as a messenger was
                  despatched to warn the civil authorities of the sad dilemma at the prison, the
                  great bell of St. Michael's church answered the warning peal with two loud rings;
                  and simultaneously the city re-echoed the report of a bloody insurrection. On the
                  long line of wharfs half circling the city, stood men aghast with fright; to the
                  west all was quiet about the battery; to the south, the long rampart of dark
                  moving pines that bordered on that side the calm surface of a harbour of
                  unsurpassed beauty, seemed sleeping in its wonted peacefulness; to the east, as if
                  rising from the sea to mar the beauty of the scene, stood fort Sumpter's sombre
                  bastions, still and quiet like a monster reposing; while retracing along the north
                  side of the harbour, no sign of trouble flutters from Fort Moultrie or Castle
                  Pinkney—no, their savage embrasures are closed, and peace hangs in mists over
                  their dark walls. The feud is in the city of democrats, wherein there are few who
                  know not the nature of the warning peal; nor, indeed, act on such occasions like a
                  world in fear, waiting but the tap of the watchman's baton ere it rushes to
                  bloodshed.
               In the busy portion of the city have men gathered at the corners of the street to
                  hold confused controversy; with anxious countenances and most earnest
                  gesticulations do they discuss the most certain means of safety. Ladies, in
                  fright, speedily seek their homes, now asking questions of a passerby, whose
                  intense excitement has carried off his power of speech, then shunning every
                  luckless negro who chances in their way. The rumour of an insurrection, however
                  falsely founded, turns every negro (of skin there is no distinction) into an
                  enemy; whilst the second sound of the alarm peal makes him a bloody votary, who it
                  needs but the booming of the cannon ere he be put to the sword. Guardsmen, with
                  side-arms and cross-belts, are eager and confused, moving to and fro with heavy
                  tread; merchants and men of more easy professions hasten from their labours, seek
                  their homes, prepare weapons for the conflict, and endeavour to soothe the fears
                  of their excited families, beseeching protection. That a deadly struggle is near
                  at hand no one doubts, for men have gathered on the house-tops to watch the moving
                  mass, bearing on its face the unmistakeable evidence of fear and anxiety, as it
                  sweeps along the streets. Now the grotesque group is bespotted with forms half
                  dressed in military garb; then a dark platoon of savage faces and ragged figures
                  brings up the rear; and quickly catching the sound "To the Workhouse!" onward it
                  presses to the scene of tumult. Firemen in curious habiliment, and half-accoutred
                  artillerymen, at the alarm peal's call are rallying to their stations, as if some
                  devouring element, about to break over the city, demanded their strongest arm;
                  while eager and confused heads, protruded from green, masking shutters, and in
                  terror, would know whither lies the scene of the outbreak. Alarm has beset the
                  little world, which now moves a medley of fear and trembling.
               The clock in St. Michael's tall spire has just struck two, as, in the arena of the
                  prison, Nicholas is seen, halted in front of his little band, calmly awaiting the
                  advance of his adversaries, who, fearing to open the great gates, have scaled the
                  long line of wall on the north side. Suddenly the sound of an imploring voice
                  breaks upon his ear, and his left hand is firmly grasped, as starting with
                  surprise he turns and beholds the slave woman, her hair hanging loosely over her
                  shoulders, and her face bathed in tears. With simple but earnest words does she
                  admonish him against his fatal resolution. Fast, and in the bitter anguish of her
                  soul, fall her implorings; she would have him yield and save his life, that she may love him still. Her
                  words would melt his resolution, had he not taken the rash step. "In my soul do I
                  love thee, woman!" he says, raising her gently to her feet, and imprinting a kiss
                  upon her olive brow; "but rather would I die a hero than live a crawling slave:
                  nay, I will love thee in heaven!" The woman has drawn his attention from his
                  adversaries, when, in that which seems a propitious moment, they rush down from
                  the walls, and ere a cry from his band warn him of the danger, have well nigh
                  surprised and secured him. With two shots of a revolver pierced through the fleshy
                  part of his left arm, does he bound from the grasp of his pursuers, rally his men,
                  and charge upon the miscreants with undaunted courage. Short but deadly is the
                  struggle that here ensues; far, indeed, shrieks and horrid groans rend the very
                  air; but the miscreants are driven back from whence they came, leaving on the
                  ground five dead bodies to atone for treble the number dead of our hero's band. In
                  the savage conflict did the woman receive a fatal bullet, and now lies writhing in
                  the agonies of death (a victim of oppression in a land of liberty) at our hero's
                  feet. Not a moment is there to spare, that he may soothe her dying agonies, for a
                  thundering at the great gates is heard, the bristling of fire-arms falls upon his
                  ear, and the drums of the military without beat to the charge. Simultaneously the
                  great gates swing back, a solid body of citizen soldiery, ready to rush in, is
                  disclosed, and our hero, as if by instinct moved to rashness, cries aloud to his
                  forces, who, following his lead, dash recklessly into the soldiery, scatter it in
                  amazement, and sweep triumphantly into the street. The first line of soldiery did
                  not yield to the impetuous charge without effect, for seven dead bodies, strewn
                  between the portals of the gate, account for the sharp report of their rifles.
                  Wild with rage, and not knowing whither to go, or for what object they have rushed
                  from the bounds of their prison house, our forlorn band, still flourishing their
                  battle hammers, have scarcely reached the second line of military, stationed, in
                  war order, a few squares from the prison, when our hero and nine of his forlorn
                  band fall pierced through the hearts with rifle bullets. Our Nicholas has a sudden
                  end; he dies, muttering, "My cause was only justice!" as twenty democratic
                  bayonets cut into shreds his quivering body. Oh, Grabguy! thou wilt one day be
                  made to atone for this thy guilt. Justice to thy slave had saved the city its
                  foreboding of horror, and us the recital of a bloody tragedy we would spare the
                  feelings of our readers by ending here.
               Having informed the reader that Ellen Juvarna was mother of Nicholas, whom she
                  bore unto Marston, we will now draw aside the veil, that he may know her real
                  origin and be the better prepared to appreciate the fate of her child. This name,
                  then, was a fictitious one, which she had been compelled to take by Romescos, who
                  stole her from her father, Neamathla, a Creek Indian. In 1820, this brave warrior
                  ruled chief of the Mickasookees, a tribe of brave Indians settled on the borders
                  of the lake of that name, in Florida. Old in deeds of valour, Neamathla sank into
                  the grave in the happy belief that his daughter, the long-lost Nasarge, had been
                  carried into captivity by chiefs of a hostile tribe, in whose chivalrous spirit
                  she would find protection, and religious respect for her caste. Could that proud
                  spirit have condescended to suppose her languishing in the hands of mercenary
                  slave-dealers, his tomahawk had been first dipped in the blood of the miscreant,
                  to avenge the foul deed. From Romescos, Nasarge, who had scarce seen her twelve
                  summers, passed into the hands of one Silenus, who sold her to Marston, for that
                  purpose a fair slave seems born to in our democratic world.
               And now again must we beg the indulgence of the reader, while we turn to the
                  counter-scene of this chapter. The influence of that consternation which had
                  spread throughout the city, was not long in finding its way to the citadel, a
                  massive fort commanding the city from the east. On the plat in front are three
                  brass field-pieces, which a few artillery-men have wheeled out, loaded, and made
                  ready to belch forth that awful signal, which the initiated translate
                  thus:—"Proceed to the massacre! Dip deep your knives in the heart of
                     every negro!"*
                   At the alarm-bell's first tap were the guns made
                  
                     
                     *Certain alarm bells are rung in case of an insurrection of the negroes,
                        which, if accompanied by the firing of three guns at the citadel, is the
                        signal for an onslaught of the whites. The author, on asking a gentleman why
                        he exhibited so much fear, or why he deemed it necessary to put to the sword
                        his faithful servants, answered,—"Slaves, no matter of what colour,
                        sympathise with each other in [con't on p.558]their general condition of slavery. I could
                        not, then, leave my family to the caprice of their feelings, while I sought
                        the scene of action to aid in suppressing the outbreak."
                  
                   ready—at the second peal
                  were matchlocks lighted—and nervous men waited in breathless suspense the third
                  and last signal peal from the Guard Tower. But, in a moment that had nearly proved
                  fatal to thousands, and as the crash of musketry echoed in the air, a confused
                  gunner applied the match: two vivid flashes issued from the cannon, their peals
                  booming successively over the city. It was at that moment, citizens who had sought
                  in their domiciles the better protection of their families might be seen in the
                  tragic attitude of holding savage pistols and glistening daggers at the breasts of
                  their terrified but faithful servants,—those, perhaps, whose only crime was
                  sincerity, and an earnest attachment to master's interests. The booming of a third
                  cannon, and they had fallen, victims of fear, at the feet of their deluded
                  victors. Happily, an act of heroism (which we would record to the fame of the
                  hero) saved the city that bloody climax we sicken while contemplating. Ere the
                  third gun belched its order of death, a mounted officer, sensible of the result
                  that gun would produce, dashed before its angry mouth, and at the top of his voice
                  cried out—"In Heaven's name, lay your matchlock down: save the city!" Then
                  galloping to the trail, the gunner standing motionless at the intrepid sight, he
                  snatched the fiery torch from his hand, and dismounting, quenched it on the
                  ground. Thus did he save the city that awful massacre the misdirected laws of a
                  democratic state would have been accountable for to civilisation and the
                  world.
               
                  
                     VIEW FROM THE PROMENADE BATTERY, CHARLESTON.
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LII.
               IN WHICH ARE PLEASURES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS.
               IN a former chapter of this narrative, have we described our fair fugitive,
                  Annette, as possessing charms of no ordinary kind; indeed, she was fair and
                  beautiful, and even in the slave world was by many called the lovely blonde. In a
                  word, to have been deeply enamoured of her would have reflected the highest credit
                  on the taste and sentiment of any gallant gentleman. Seeming strange would it be,
                  then, if the stranger to whose care we confided her (and hereafter to be called
                  Montague, that being his Christian name) should render himself liable to the
                  charge of stupidity did these attractions not make a deep impression on his heart.
                  And here we would not have the reader lay so grave a charge at his door; for, be
                  it known, ye who are not insensible to love's electric force, that scarce had they
                  reached New York, ere Montague began to look upon Annette with that species of
                  compassion which so often, in the workings of nature's mystery, turns the
                  sympathies of the heart into purest love. The misery or happiness of this poor
                  girl he viewed as dependent on himself: this, forsooth, was strengthened by the
                  sad recital of her struggles, which caused his sympathies to flow in mutual
                  fellowship with her sorrows. As he esteemed her gentleness, so was he enamoured of
                  her charms; but her sorrows carried the captive arrow into his bosom, where she
                  fastened it with holding forth that wrist broken in defence of her virtue: nay,
                  more, he could not refrain a caress, as in the simplicity of her heart she looked
                  in his face smilingly, and said she would he were the father of her future in this
                  life. But, when did not slavery interpose its barbarous obstacles?—when did it not
                  claim for itself the interests of federal power, and the nation's indulgence?—when
                  did it not regard with coldest indifference the good or ill of all beyond its own
                  limits? The slave world loves itself; but, though self-love may now and then give
                  out a degree of virtue, slavery has
                  none to lead those beyond its own atmosphere. To avoid, then, the terrors to
                  which, even on the free soil of the north, a fugitive slave is constantly liable,
                  as also that serpent-like prejudice—for into the puritanic regions of New England,
                  forsooth, does slavery spread its more refined objections to colour—which makes
                  the manners of one class cold and icy, while acting like a dagger in the hearts of
                  the other, was it necessary to change her name. How many of my fair readers, then,
                  will recur to and recognise in the lovely Sylvia De Lacy—whose vivacity made them
                  joyous in their school days, and whose charms all envied—the person of Annette
                  Mazatlin. Nothing could be more true than that the pretty blonde, Sylvia De Lacy,
                  who passed at school as the daughter of a rich Bahamian, was but the humble slave
                  of our worthy wag, Mr. Pringle Blowers. But we beg the reader to remember that, as
                  Sylvia De Lacy, with her many gallant admirers, she is a far different person from
                  Annette the slave.
               Clotilda is made acquainted with the steps Montague has taken in behalf of his
                  charge, as also of a further intention he will carry out at the expiration of two
                  years; which said intention is neither more nor less than the making Sylvia De
                  Lacy his bride ere her school days have ended. In the earnestness of a heart
                  teeming of joy, does Clotilda respond to the disclosures she is pleased to term
                  glad tidings. Oft and fervently has she invoked the All-protecting hand to save
                  her child from the licentious snares of slavery; and now that she is rescued, her
                  soul can rest satisfied. How her heart rejoices to learn that her slave child will
                  hereafter be happy in this life! ever will she pray that peace and prosperity
                  reward their virtues. Her own prospects brighten with the thought that she may,
                  ere long, see them under her own comfortable roof, and bestow a mother's love on
                  the head of her long-lost child.
               And now my reader will please to suppose these two years of school-days
                  passed—that nuptial ceremony in which so many mingled their congratulations, and
                  showered blandest smiles upon the fair bride, celebrated in a princely mansion not
                  far from the aristocratic Union Square of New York—and our happy couple launched
                  upon that path of matrimony some facetious old gentlemen have been pleased to
                  describe as so crooked that others fear to journey upon it. They were indeed a
                  happy couple, with each future prospect golden of fortune's sunshine. Did we
                  describe in detail the reign of happiness portended on the bright day of that
                  nuptial ceremony, how many would recognise the gay figures of those who enlivened
                  the scene—how deceptive would seem the fair face of events—how obscured would be
                  presented the life of a slave in this our world of freedom—how false that
                  democracy so boastful of its even-handed rule!
               Two years have rolled into the past, since Montague led the fair Sylvia to the
                  altar. Pringle Blowers has pocketed the loss of his beauty, the happy couple have
                  lost all thought of slavery, and a little responsibility coming in due time adds
                  to make their happiness complete. Now the house to which Montague was connected in
                  New York had an agent in New Orleans; which agent was his brother. In the course
                  of time, then, and as the avenues of business expanded, was it deemed necessary to
                  establish a branch house at Memphis, the affairs of which it was agreed should be
                  conducted by Montague. To this new scene of life my reader will please suppose our
                  happy couple, having journeyed by railroad to 
                     Cincinnatti
                     Cincinnati
                  , and with hearts gladdened of hope for the future, now gliding down that
                  river of gorgeous banks, on 
                     THE OHIO.
                   board the good steamer bearing its name. As our young mother again
                  enters the atmosphere of slavery, misgivings force themselves irresistibly upon her feelings.
                  The very face of nature wears a sluggish air; the fresh, bright offspring of
                  northern energy, so forcibly illustrated in the many cheerful looking villages
                  here and there dotting its free soil, is nowhere to be seen,—society again puts
                  forth its blighting distinctions: there is the man-owner's iron deportment
                  contrasting with the abjectness of his slave: forcibly does the change recall
                  scenes of the past. But, with the certain satisfaction that no one will recognize
                  the slave in her, do those misgivings give way to the happier contemplation of her
                  new home affording the means of extending a succouring hand to some poor mortal,
                  suffering in that condition of life through which she herself has passed.
               After a pleasant passage, then, do we find them comfortably settled in Memphis,
                  that city of notorious character, where the venerable Lynch presides judge over
                  all state cases, and administers summary justice according to the most independent
                  of bar rules. Montague pursues the ordinary routine of a flourishing business, and
                  moves among the very best society of the little fashionable world; with which his
                  Sylvia, being the fair belle of the place, is
                  not only a great favourite, but much sought after and caressed. Gentle as a slave,
                  so was she an affectionate mother and dutiful wife. Some twelve months passed
                  pleasantly at their new home, when there came to the city a Jew of the name of
                  Salamons Finch. This Finch, who was "runner" to a commercial firm in the city of
                  Charleston (he was lank of person, with sallow, craven features), knew Annette
                  when but a child. Indeed, he was a clerk of Graspum when that gentleman sold the
                  fair slave to Gurdoin Choicewest; in addition to which he had apartments at Lady
                  Tuttlewell's most fashionable house, where the little doll-like thing used to be
                  so sprightly in waiting at table. The quick eye of this harpy, as may readily be
                  supposed, was not long in detecting the person of Annette the slave in our fair
                  mother; which grand discovery he as soon communicated to Montague, pluming himself
                  a generous fellow for being first to disclose what he supposed a valuable secret.
                  Indeed, such was the force of association on this fellow, that he could not bring
                  his mind to believe such a match possible, unless the fair fugitive—of the
                  circumstances of whose escape he was well posted) had, by the exercise of
                  strategy, imposed herself on the gentleman. The reader may easily picture to
                  himself the contempt in which Montague held the fellow's generous exposé; but he
                  as readily became sensible of the nature of the recognition, and of its placing
                  him in a dangerous position. At first he thought of sending his wife and child
                  immediately to her mother, in Nassau; but having intimations from the fellow that
                  the matter might be reconciled with golden eagles, he chose rather to adopt that
                  plan of procuring peace and quietness. With a goodly number of these gold eagles,
                  then, did he from time to time purchase the knave's secrecy; but, with that
                  singular propensity so characteristic of the race, was he soon found making
                  improper advances to the wife of the man whose money he received for keeping
                  secret her early history. This so exasperated Montague, that in addition to
                  sealing the fellow's lips with the gold coin, he threatened his back with stripes
                  of the raw hide, in payment of his insolence. Albeit, nothing but the fear of
                  exposure, the consequences of which must prove fatal, caused him to bear with pain
                  the insult while withholding payment of this well-merited debt. With keen
                  instincts, and a somewhat cultivated taste for the beautiful, Finch might with
                  becoming modesty have pleaded them in extenuation of his conduct; but the truth
                  was, he almost unconsciously found himself deeply enamoured of the fair woman,
                  without being able to look upon her as a being elevated above that menial sphere
                  his vulgar mind conditioned for her when in slavery. Here, then, the reader will
                  more readily conceive than we can describe the grievous annoyances our otherwise
                  happy couple were subjected to; nor, if a freeman's blood course in his veins, can
                  he fail to picture the punishment it so dearly merited. However, it came to pass
                  that in the course of a few months this fellow disappeared suddenly, and nearly at
                  the same time was Montague summoned to New Orleans to direct some complicated
                  affairs of his brother, who lay a victim to that fearful scourge which so often
                  devastates that city of balmy breezes. After due preparations for an absence of
                  some two months, Montague set out on his journey; but had not been forty-eight
                  hours gone, when Finch again made his appearance, and taking advantage of a
                  husband's absence, pressed his advances with grossest insult, threatening at the same time to convey
                  information of the discovery to Pringle Blowers. Successively did these
                  importunities fail to effect Mr. Finch's purpose; but he was of an indomitable
                  temper, and had strong faith in that maxim of his race, which may be transcribed
                  thus:—"If one effort fail you, try another." To carry out this principle, then,
                  did Finch draw from the cunning inventive of his brain a plan which he could not
                  doubt for a moment would be successful. The reader may blush while we record the
                  fact, of Finch, deeming a partner necessary to the gaining his purpose, finding a
                  willing accomplice in one of Montague's clerks, to whom he disclosed the secret of
                  the fair woman being nothing more than a fugitive slave, whose shame they would
                  share if the plan proved successful. This ingenious plan, so old that none but a
                  fellow of this stamp would have adopted it, was nothing more than the intercepting
                  by the aid of the clerk all Montague's letters to his wife. By this they came in
                  possession of the nature of his family affairs; and after permitting the receipt
                  of two letters by Sylvia, possessed themselves of her answers that they might be
                  the better able to carry out the evil of their scheme. After sufficient time had
                  passed, did Sylvia receive a letter, duly posted at New Orleans, purporting to
                  have been written by a clerk in the employ of the firm, and informing her, having
                  acknowledged becomingly the receipt of her letter, that Montague had been seized
                  with the epidemic, and now lay in a precarious state. Much concerned was she at
                  the painful intelligence; but she almost as soon found consolation in the
                  assurances of the clerk who brought her the letter, and, to strengthen his own
                  cause, told her he had seen a captain just arrived up, who had met her husband a
                  day after the date of the letter, quite well. Indeed, this was necessary to that
                  functionary's next move, for he was the conspirator of Finch, and the author of
                  the letter which had caused so much sadness to the woman who now sought his
                  advice. In suspense did the anxious woman wait the coming tidings of her
                  affectionate husband: alas! in a few days was the sad news of his death by the
                  fatal scourge brought to her in an envelope with broad black border and
                  appropriate seal. Overwhelmed with grief, the good woman read the letter,
                  describing her Montague to have died happy, as the conspirator looked on with
                  indifference. The confidential clerk of the firm had again performed a painful and
                  unexpected duty. The good man died, said he, invoking a blessing on the head of
                  his child, and asking heaven to protect his wife; to which he would add, that the
                  affairs of the house were in the worst possible condition, there not being assets
                  to pay a fraction of the debts. And here we would beg the reader to use his
                  imagination, and save us the description of much that followed. Not all their
                  threats nor persuasions, however, could induce her to yield to their designs;
                  defiantly did she repulse the advances of the crawling Finch; nobly did she spurn
                  his persuasions; firmly did she, heedless of his threat to acquaint Pringle
                  Blowers of her whereabouts, bid him be gone from her door. The fellow did go,
                  grievously disappointed; and, whether from malice or mercenary motives we will not
                  charge, sought and obtained from Pringle Blowers, in exchange for his valuable
                  discovery, a promise of the original reward. Shudder not, reader, while we tell
                  it! It was not many days ere the notorious Blowers set out for Memphis, recovered
                  his lost property, who, like a lamb panting in the grasp of a pursuing wolf, was,
                  with her young child, dragged back, a wretch, into the melancholy waste of
                  slavery. Long and loudly was the grand discovery resounded through the little
                  world of Memphis; not in sympathy for the slave, for many hearts were made glad
                  with joy over what the fashionable were pleased to term a fortunate disclosure and
                  a happy removal. Many very grave gentlemen said the miscreant who dared impose a
                  slave on society, well merited punishment at the hands of the venerable Lynch,—a
                  judge of that city whose celebrity is almost world wide.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LIII.
               A FAMILIAR SCENE, IN WHICH PRINGLE BLOWERS HAS BUSINESS.
               OF a bright morning, not many days after Pringle Blowers returned with his fair
                  slave to Charleston (which said slave he would not sell for gold), there sat on a
                  little bench at the entrance gate of the "upper workhouse," the brusque figure of
                  a man, whose coarse and firmly knit frame, to which were added hard and
                  weather-stained features, indicated his having seen some fifty summers. But, if he
                  was brusque of figure and coarse of deportment, he had a good soft heart in the
                  right place; nor did he fail to exercise its virtues while pursuing the duties of
                  a repulsive profession; albeit, he was keeper of the establishment, and
                  superintended all punishments. Leisurely he smoked of a black pipe; and with shirt
                  sleeves rolled up, a grey felt hat almost covering his dark, flashing eyes, and
                  his arms easily folded, did he seem contemplating the calm loveliness of morning.
                  Now he exhaled the curling fume, then scanned away over the bright landscape to
                  the east, and again cast curious glances up and down the broad road stretching in
                  front of his prison to the north and south. It was not long before a carriage and
                  pair appeared on the hill to the south, advancing at a slow pace towards the city.
                  The keeper's keen eye rested upon it intently, as it neared, bearing in a back
                  seat what seemed to be a lady fine of figure and deportment; while on the front
                  drove a figure of great rotundity, the broad, full face shining out like a ripe
                  pumpkin in a sun shower. "It's Pringle Blowers, I do believe in my soul! but it's
                  seeming strange how he's got a lady to ride with him," mused the man, who, still
                  watching the approach, had quite forgotten the escape of the fair slave. The man
                  was not mistaken, for as he touched his hat, on the carriage arriving opposite the
                  gate, it halted, and there, sure enough, was our valiant democrat, who, placing
                  his whip in the socket, crooked his finger and beckoned the keeper. "Broadman!"
                  said he, (for that was the man's name) "I'ze a bit of something in your way of
                  business this morning." The honest functionary, with seeming surprise, again
                  touching his hat as he approached the vehicle, replied: "Your servant, sir!"
                  Blowers motioned his hand to the woman, whose tears were now, to Broadman's
                  surprise, seen coursing down her pale cheeks. To use a vulgar phrase, Broadman was
                  entirely "taken aback" by the singularity of Blowers' manner; for the woman, whose
                  dress and deportment the honest man conceived to be nothing less than that of a
                  lady of one of the "first families," obeying the motion, began to descend from the
                  carriage. "Now, Broadman," continued Blowers, arranging his reins, and with clumsy
                  air making his descent over the fore wheels, "take that 'ar wench o' mine, and, by
                  the State's custom, give her the extent of the law, well laid on."*
                   The man hesitated, as if doubting his senses; rather would he have been
                  courteous to what he still viewed as a lady, than extend his rude hand to lead her
                  away.
               "Pardon me, Sir! but you cannot mean what you say," nervously spoke the man, as in
                  doubt he exchanged glances first with the fair woman and then with Blowers. "I
                  means just what I says," returned that gentleman, peremptorily; "you'ze hearn o'
                  that 'un afore. She's a nigger o' mine, what runned away more nor six years ago;
                  come, do the job for her, and no fussing over't." "Nigger!" interrupted the man,
                  in surprise. "Yes!" rejoined Blowers, emphasising his assurance with oaths, of
                  which he had a never-failing supply, "that's the cussed white nigger what's gin me
                  all the bother. The whiter niggers is, the more devil's in em; and that ar' one's
                  got devil enough for a whole plantation; 'tisn't the licks I cares about, but it's
                  the humblin' on her feelings by being punished in the workhouse!" The man of duty
                  was now brought to his senses, when, seeing Blowers was inclined to relieve his
                  anger on what he was pleased to consider the stupidity of a keeper, he took the
                  weeping but resolute woman by the arm, and called a negro attendant, into whose
                  charge he handed her, with an order to "put her in the slings." Soon she
                  disappeared within the gate, following the mulatto man. And here we will again
                  spare the reader's feelings, by
                  
                     
                     *The author here writes the incident as given by the prison-keeper.
                  
                  omitting much that followed. Blowers and Broadman follow the hapless woman, as she
                  proceeds through a narrow passage leading to the punishment room, and when about
                  half way to that place of torture, a small, square door opens on the right, into a
                  dingy office, the keeper says is where he keeps his accounts with the State, which
                  derives a large revenue from the punishments. Into this does the worthy man invite
                  his patron, whom he would have be seated while the criminal is got "all right" in
                  the slings. Fain would Blowers go and attend the business himself; but Broadman
                  saying "that cannot be," he draws from his pocket a small flask, and, seemingly
                  contented, invites him to join in "somethin" he says is the very choicest.
                  Broadman has no objection to encouraging this evidence of good feeling, which he
                  will take advantage of to introduce the dialogue that follows. "Good sir," says
                  he, "you will pardon what I am about to say, for indeed I feel the weakness of my
                  position when addressing you, fortune having made a wide distinction between us;
                  but judge me not because I am coarse of flesh, nor have polished manners, for I
                  have a heart that feels for the unfortunate." Here Blowers interrupted the keeper
                  by saying he would hear no chicken-hearted interpositions. "Remember, keeper," he
                  added, "you must not presume on the small familiarity I have condescended to admit
                  in drinking with you. I hold no controversies with prison-keepers (again he gulps
                  his brandy) or their subs; being a servant of the state, I order you to give that
                  wench the extent of the law. She shall disclose the secret of her escape, or I'll
                  have her life; I'm a man what won't stand no nonsense, I am!" The keeper,
                  rejoining, hopes he will pardon the seeming presumption; but, forsooth,
                  notwithstanding necessity has driven him to seek a livelihood in his repulsive
                  occupation, there is a duty of the heart he cannot betray, though the bread of his
                  maintenance be taken from him. Blowers again assumes his dignity, rises from his
                  seat, scowls significantly at the keeper, and says he will go put through the
                  business with his own hands. "Good friend," says Broadman, arresting Blowers'
                  progress, "by the state's ruling you are my patron; nevertheless, within these
                  walls I am master, and whatever you may bring here for punishment shall have the
                  benefit of my discretion. I loathe the law that forces me to, in such cases,
                  overrule the admonitions nitions of my heart. I, sir, am low of this world,—good!
                  but, in regret do I say it, I have by a slave mother two fair daughters, who in
                  the very core of my heart I love; nor would I, imitating the baser examples of our
                  aristocracy, sell them hapless outcasts for life." Here Blowers again interrupted
                  by allowing his passion to manifest itself in a few very fashionable oaths; to
                  which he added, that he (pacing the room several times) would no longer give ear
                  to such nonsense from a man of Broadman's position,—which was neither socially nor
                  politically grand. "No doubt, good sir, my humble and somewhat repulsive calling
                  does not meet your distinguished consideration; but I am, nevertheless, a man. And
                  what I was about to say—I hope you will grant me a hearing—was, that having these
                  two daughters—poverty only prevents my purchasing them—has made me sensible of
                  these slaves having delicate textures. The unhappy possession of these daughters
                  has caused me to reflect—to study constitutions, and their capacity to endure
                  punishments. The woman it has pleased you to bring here for chastisement, I take
                  it, is not coarse of flesh; but is one of those unfortunates whom kindness might
                  reform, while the lash never fails to destroy. Why, then, not consider her in the
                  light of a friendless wretch, whom it were better to save, than sink in shame? One
                  word more and I am done" (Blowers was about to cut short the conversation); "the
                  extent of the law being nothing less than twenty blows of the paddle, is most
                  severe punishment for a woman of fine flesh to withstand on her naked loins. Nor,
                  let me say—and here I speak from twelve years' experience—can the lady—I beg
                  pardon, the slave you bring me!—bear these blows: no, my lips never spoke truer
                  when I say she'll quiver and sink in spasms ere the second blow is laid on."
                  Here—some twenty minutes having passed since the fair slave was led into the
                  punishment room—Blowers cut short the conversation which had failed to thaw his
                  resolution, by saying Broadman had bored his ears in spinning out his long song,
                  and if he were unwilling to fulfil the duties of his office, such should be
                  reported to the authorities, who would not permit workhouse-keepers so to modify
                  their ordnances that black and white niggers have different punishments. "Nay,
                  sir!" says the honest man, with an air of earnestness, as he rises from his seat;
                  "follow me, and with the reality will I prove the truth of my words." Here he proceeds to that place of
                  torments, the punishment-room, followed by Blowers; who says, with singular
                  indifference—"Can do the job in five minutes; then I'll leave her with you for
                  two, three, or four days or so. Then if she's civilly humbled down, I'll send my
                  nigger fellow, Joe, with an order for her. Joe'll be the fellow's name; now, mind
                  that: but you know my Joe, I reckon?" The keeper led the way, but made no reply;
                  for indeed he knew nothing of his Joe, there being innumerable niggers of that
                  name. As the men left the little office, and were sauntering up the passage, our
                  worthy friend Rosebrook might be seen entering in search of Broadman; when,
                  discovering Blowers in his company, and hearing the significant words, he shot
                  into a niche, unobserved by them, and calling a negro attendant, learned the
                  nature of his visit. And here it becomes necessary that we discover to the reader
                  the fact of Rosebrook having been apprised of the forlorn woman's return, and her
                  perilous position in the hands of Pringle Blowers; and, further, that the
                  communication was effected by the negro man Pompe, who we have before described in
                  connection with Montague at the time of his landing from the witch-like schooner.
                  This Pompe was sold to Blowers but a few months before Annette's recovery, and
                  acting upon the force of that sympathy which exists among fellow slaves of a
                  plantation, soon renewed old acquaintance, gained her confidence, and, cunningly
                  eluding the owner's watchfulness, conveyed for her a letter to the Rosebrooks. In
                  truth, Pompe had an inveterate hatred of Blowers, and under the incitement would
                  not have hesitated to stake his life in defence of the fair woman. Now, the
                  exacting reader may question Rosebrook's intrepidity in not proceeding at once to
                  the rescue of the victim; but when we say that he was ignorant of the positive
                  order given the keeper, and only caught distinctly the words—"I'll send my nigger
                  fellow, Joe, with an order for her!" they may discover an excuse for his hastily
                  withdrawing from the establishment. Indeed, that my reader may withhold his
                  censure, it may be well to add that he did this in order to devise more
                  strategical means of effecting her escape.
               And now, ye who have nerves—let them not be shaken; let not your emotions rise, ye
                  who have souls, and love the blessings of liberty; let not mothers nor fathers
                  weep over democracy's wrongs; nor let man charge us with picturing the horrors of
                  a black romance when we introduce the spectacle in the room of punishments: such,
                  be it known, is not our business, nor would we trifle unjustly with the errors of
                  society; but, if chivalry have blushes, we do not object to their being used here.
                  The keeper, followed by Blowers, enters a small room at the further end of the
                  passage. It is some sixteen feet long by twelve wide, and proportionately high of
                  ceiling. The pale light of a tallow candle, suspended from the ceiling by a wire,
                  and from which large flakes of the melted grease lay cone-like on the pine floor,
                  discloses the gloom, and discovers hanging from the walls, grim with smoke, sundry
                  curious caps, cords, leathern cats, and the more improved paddles of wood, with
                  flat blades. The very gloom of the place might excite the timid; but the
                  reflection of how many tortures it has been the scene, and the mysterious
                  stillness pervading its singularly decorated walls, add still more to increase
                  apprehension. A plank, some two feet wide, and raised a few inches, stretches
                  across the floor, and is secured at each end with cleets. About midway of this are
                  ropes securing the victim's feet; and through the dim light is disclosed the half
                  nude body of our fair girl, suspended by the wrists, which are clasped in bands of
                  cord, that, being further secured to a pulley block, is hauled taut by a tackle.
                  Suddenly the wretched woman gives vent to her feelings, and in paroxysms of grief
                  sways her poor body to and fro, imploring mercy! "Nay, master! think that I am a
                  woman—that I have a heart to feel and bleed; that I am a mother and a wife, though
                  a slave. Let your deeds be done quickly, or end me and save me this shame!" she
                  supplicates, as the bitter, burning anguish of her goaded soul gives out its flood
                  of sorrow. Chivalry, forsooth, lies cold and unmoved—Blowers has no relish for
                  such inconsistency;—such whinings, he says, will not serve southern principles.
                  The mulatto attendant has secured the fall, and stands a few feet behind Blowers
                  and the keeper, as that functionary says, laying his coarse hands on the woman's
                  loins, "How silky!" The mulatto man shakes his head, revengefully, making a
                  grimace, as Broadman, having selected the smallest paddle (reminding us of the
                  curious sympathy now budding between the autocratic knout and democratic lash) again addresses Blowers. "I doubt,
                  sir," he says, "if the woman stand a blow. Necessity 's a hard master, sir; and in
                  this very act is the test more trying than I have ever known it. I dissemble
                  myself when I see a wretch of fine flesh—a woman with tender senses, in distress,
                  and I am made the instrument of adding to her suffering. Indeed, sir, when I
                  contemplate the cause of such wretchedness, and the poverty forcing me to remain
                  in this situation, no imagination can represent the horror of my feelings."
               "We have no demand on your feelings, my man! we want your duty—what the state put
                  you here to perform," interrupted Blowers, placing his thumbs in his vest, and
                  making a step backward. Another second, and the attendant lighted a hand-lamp,—a
                  sharp, slapping blow was heard, a death-like shriek followed; the flesh quivered
                  and contracted into a discoloured and inflamed pustule; the body writhed a few
                  seconds in convulsive spasms; a low moaning followed, and that fair form hung
                  swooning in the slings, as the keeper, in fright, cried out, at the top of his
                  voice, to the attendant—"Lower away the fall!" As if the fiend had not yet
                  gratified his passion, no sooner was the seemingly lifeless body lowered clumsily
                  to the floor, than he grasped the weapon from Broadman's hand, and like a tiger
                  seeking its banquet of flesh, was about to administer a second blow. But Broadman
                  had a good heart, the admonitions of which soared high above the state's mandate:
                  seizing Blowers in his arms, he ejected him from the door, ran back to the
                  prostrate woman, released her bruised limbs from the fastenings, gathered her to
                  his arms; and with nervous hands and anxious face did he draw from his pocket the
                  well-timed hartshorn, by the application of which he sought to restore her, as the
                  mulatto man stood by, bathing her temples with cold water. "Ah! shame on the thing
                  called a man who could abuse a sweet creature of fine flesh, like thee! it's not
                  many has such a pretty sweet face," says Broadman, with an air of compassion,
                  resting her shoulder against his bended knee as he encircles it with his left arm,
                  and looks upon the pale features, tears glistening in his honest eyes. We might
                  say with Broadman—"It's not the finest, nor the polished of flesh, that hath the
                  softest hearts." But, reader, having performed our duty, let us drop the curtain
                  over this sad but true scene; and when you have conjectured the third and fourth
                  acts of the drama, join with us in hoping the chivalry of our State may yet awake
                  to a sense of its position, that, when we again raise it, a pleasanter prospect
                  may be presented.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LIV.
               IN WHICH ARE DISCOVERIES AND PLEASANT SCENES.
               ST. PATRICK'S night closed the day on which the scenes of the foregoing chapter
                  were enacted; and that patron saint being of aristocratic descent, which caused
                  him to be held in high esteem by our "very first families," than among whom better
                  admirers could nowhere be found, his anniversary was sure to be celebrated with
                  much feasting and drinking. But while this homage to the good saint made glad the
                  hearts of thousands—while the city seemed radiant of joy, and reeling men from
                  Hibernia's gorgeous hall found in him an excuse for their revelries—there sat in
                  the box of a café, situated on the west side of
                  Meeting Street, two men who seemed to have a deeper interest at heart than that of
                  the Saint's joy on his road to paradise. The one was a shortish man, coarse of
                  figure, and whose browned features and figured hands bespoke him a sailor; the
                  other was delicate of figure, with pale, careworn countenance and nervous
                  demeanour. Upon the marble slab, on which they rested their elbows, sat a bottle
                  of old Madeira, from which they sipped leisurely, now and then modulating their
                  conversation into whispers. Then the man of brown features spoke out more at ease,
                  as if they had concluded the preliminaries of some important business.
               "Well, well,—now isn't that strange?" said he, sighing as he spread his brawny
                  hands upon the white marble. "Natur's a curious mystery, though" (he looked
                  intently at the other): "why, more nor twenty years have rolled over since I did
                  that bit of a good turn, and here I is the very same old Jack Hardweather, skipper
                  of the Maggy Bell. But for all that—and I'd have folks know it!—the Maggy's as
                  trim a little craft as ever lay to on a sou'-easter; and she can show as clean a
                  pair of heels as any other—barring her old top timbers complain now and then—to
                  the best cutter as ever shook Uncle Sam's rags." His hard features softened, as in
                  the earnest of his heart he spoke. He extended his hand across the table, grasping
                  firmly that of his nervous friend, and continued—"And it was no other witch than
                  the taunt Maggy Bell that landed that good woman safe on the free sands of old
                  Bahama!" The Maggy, he tells the other, is now at the wharf, where the good wife,
                  Molly Hardweather, keeps ship while the boys take a turn ashore.
               "There's always a wise provision to relieve one's feelings when sorrow comes
                  unexpectedly," returns the nervous man, his hand trembling as he draws forth the
                  money to pay the waiter who answered his call.
               "Yes!" quickly rejoined the other, "but keep up a good heart, like a sailor hard
                  upon a lee shore, and all 'll be bright and sunny in a day or two. And now we'll
                  just make a tack down the bay—street—and sight the Maggy. There's a small drop of
                  somethin' in the locker, that'll help to keep up yer spirits, I reckon—a body's
                  spirits has to be tautened now and then, as ye do a bobstay,—and the wife (she's a
                  good sort of a body, though I say it) will do the best she can in her hard way to
                  make ye less troubled at heart. Molly Hardweather has had some hard ups and downs
                  in life, knows well the cares of a mother, and has had twins twice; yes"—adds the
                  hardy seafarer—"we arn't polished folks, nor high of blood, but we've got hearts,
                  and as every true heart hates slavery, so do we, though we are forced to dissemble
                  our real feelings for the sake of peace in the trade." Here the delicate man took
                  the sailor's arm, and sallied out to seek the little Maggy Bell, the former saying
                  the meeting was as strange as grateful to his very soul. Down Market Street,
                  shaded in darkness, they wended their way, and after reaching the wharf, passed
                  along between long lines of cotton bales, piled eight and ten feet high, to the
                  end, where lay motionless the pretty Maggy Bell, as clipper-like a craft as ever
                  spread canvas. The light from the cabin shed its faint gleams over the
                  quarter-deck, as Hardweather halted on the capsill, and with a sailor's pride run
                  his quick black eye along her pirate-like hull, then aloft along the rigging.
                  Exultingly, he says, "She is the sauciest witch that ever faced sea or showed a
                  clean pair of heels. The Maggy Bell!"—he pats his friend on the shoulder—"why,
                  sir, she has—just between ourselves now—slided many a poor slave off into
                     freedom; but folks here don't think
                  it of me. Now, if I reckon right"—he bites his tobacco, and extends it to the
                  stranger—"and I believe I do, it's twenty years since the Maggy, of one dark
                  night, skimmed it by that point, with Fort Pinkney on it, yonder, that good
                  creature on board." He points to the murky mass, scarce visible in the distance,
                  to the east. "And now she's one of the noblest women that ever broke bread to the
                  poor; and she's right comfortable off, now,—alwa's has a smile, and a kind word,
                  and something good for old Jack Hardweather whenever she sees him. Lord bless yer
                  soul!"—here he shakes his head earnestly, and says he never was a lubber—"Jack
                  Hardweather didn't care about the soft shot for his locker; it was my heart that
                  felt the kindness. Indeed, it always jumps and jerks like a bobstay in a head sea,
                  when I meets her. And then, when I thinks how 'twas me done the good turn, and no
                  thanks to nobody! You hearn of me 'afore, eh" (he turns to his companion, who
                  measuredly answers in the affirmative). "Well, then, my name's Skipper Jack
                  Hardweather, known all along the coast; but, seeing how the world and navigation's
                  got shortened down, they call me old Jack Splitwater. I suppose it's by the way of
                  convenience, and so neither wife nor me have a bit of objection." Here the
                  conversation was interrupted by the good wife's round, cheery face shooting
                  suddenly from out the companion-way, and enjoining our friend Jack to come away
                  aboard, her high peaked cap shining like snow on a dark surface. The truth was,
                  that Splitwater, as he was styled, had become so much absorbed in excitement as to
                  forget the length of his yarn. "Come away, now!" says the good wife, "everybody's
                  left the Maggy to-night; and ther's na knowin' what 'd a' become 'un her if a'h
                  hadn't looked right sharp, for ther' wer' a muckle ship a'mast run her dune; an'
                  if she just had, the Maggy wad na mar bene seen!" The good wife shakes her head;
                  her rich Scotch tongue sounding on the still air, as with apprehension her chubby
                  face shines in the light of the candle she holds before it with her right hand.
                  Skipper Splitwater will see his friend on board, he says, as they follow her down
                  the companion-ladder. "Wife thinks as much of the Maggy—and would, I believe in my
                  soul, cry her life out if anything happened till her: wife's a good body aboard a
                  ship, and can take a trick at the wheel just as well as Harry Span the mate."
                  Skipper Splitwater leads the way into a little dingy cabin, a partition running
                  athwart ships dividing it into two apartments; the former being where Skipper
                  Hardweather "sleeps his crew" and cooks his mess, the sternmost where he receives
                  his friends. This latter place, into which he conducts the nervous man, is
                  lumbered with boxes, chests, charts, camp-seats, log lines, and rusty quadrants,
                  and sundry marine relics which only the inveterate coaster could conceive a use
                  for. But the good wife Molly, whose canny face bears the wrinkles of some forty
                  summers, and whose round, short figure is so simply set off with bright plaid
                  frock and apron of gingham check, in taste well adapted to her humble position, is
                  as clean and tidy as ever was picture of mine Vrow Vardenstein. Nevertheless,—we
                  know the reader will join us in the sentiment—that which gave the air of domestic
                  happiness a completeness hitherto unnoticed, was a wee responsibility, as seen
                  sprawling and kicking goodnaturedly on the white pillow of the starboard berth,
                  where its two peering eyes shone forth as bright as new-polished pearls. The
                  little darling is just a year old, Dame Hardweather tells us; it's a twin,—the
                  other died, and, she knows full well, has gone to heaven. Here she takes the
                  little cherub in her lap, and having made her best courtesy as Hardweather
                  introduces her to his nervous friend, seats herself on the locker, and commences
                  suckling it, while he points to the very place on the larboard side where
                  Clotilda—"Ah! I just caught the name," he says,—used to sit and sorrow for her
                  child. "And then," he continues, "on the quarter-deck she'd go and give such
                  longing looks back, like as if she wanted to see it; and when she couldn't, she'd
                  turn away and sigh so. And this, Molly," he continues, "is the self-same child my
                  friend here, who I am as happy to meet as a body can be, wants me to carry off
                  from these wolves of slavery; and if I don't, then my name's not Jack Splitwater!"
                  So saying, he bustles about, tells the nervous man he must excuse the want of
                  finery, that he has been a hard coaster for God knows how many years, and the
                  little place is all he can afford; for indeed he is poor, but expects a better
                  place one of these days. Then he draws forth from a little nook in the stern
                  locker a bottle, which he says contains pure stuff, and of which he invites his visitor to partake,
                  that he may keep up a good heart, still hoping for the best. The nervous man
                  declines his kind invitation,—he has too much at heart, and the sight of the child
                  so reminds him of his own now blighted in slavery. The good woman now becoming
                  deeply concerned, Hardweather must needs recount the story, and explain the
                  strange man's troubles, which he does in simple language; but, as the yarn is
                  somewhat long, the reader must excuse our not transcribing it here. With anxious
                  face and listening ears did the woman absorb every word; and when the earnest
                  skipper concluded with grasping firmly the man's hand, and saying—"Just you scheme
                  the strategy, and if I don't carry it out my name aint Jack Hardweather!" would
                  she fain have had him go on. "Lack a day, good man!" she rejoined, fondling closer
                  to her bosom the little suckling; "get ye the wee bairn and bring it hither, and
                  I'll mak it t'uther twin—na body'll kno't! and da ye ken hoo ye may mak the bonny
                  wife sik a body that nane but foxes wad ken her. Just mak her a brae young sailor,
                  and the Maggy Bell 'll do the rest on't." Hardweather here interrupted Molly's
                  suggestion which was, indeed, most fortunate, and albeit supplied the initiative
                  to the strategy afterwards adopted—for slavery opens wide the field of strategy—by
                  reminding the stranger that she had a long Scotch head. The night had now well
                  advanced; the stranger shook the woman's hand firmly, and bade her good night, as
                  a tear gushed into his eyes. The scene was indeed simple, but touching. The hard
                  mariner will accompany his friend to the wharf; and then as he again turns on the
                  capsill, he cannot bid him good night without adding a few words more in praise of
                  the little Maggy Bell, whose name is inscribed in gilt letters upon the
                  flash-board of her stern. Holding his hand, he says: "Now, keep the heart up
                  right! and in a day or two we'll have all aboard, and be in the stream waiting for
                  a fair breeze—then the Maggy 'll play her part. Bless yer soul! the little craft
                  and me's coasted down the coast nobody knows how many years; and she knows every
                  nook, creek, reef, and point, just as well as I does. Just give her a
                  double-reefed mainsail, and the lug of a standing jib, and in my soul I believe
                  she'd make the passage without compass, chart, or a hand aboard. By the word of an
                  old sailor, such a craft is the Maggy Bell. And when the Spanish and English and
                  French all got mixed up about who owned Florida, the Maggy and me's coasted along
                  them keys when, blowing a screecher, them Ingins' balls flew so, a body had to
                  hold the hair on his head; but never a bit did the Maggy mind it." The stranger's
                  heart was too full of cares to respond to the generous man's simplicity; shaking
                  his hand fervently, he bid him good night, and disappeared up the wharf.
               We apprehend little difficulty to the reader in discovering the person of Montague
                  in our nervous man, who, in the absence of intelligence from his wife, was led to
                  suspect some foul play. Nor were his suspicions unfounded; for, on returning to
                  Memphis, which he did in great haste, he found his home desolate, his wife and
                  child borne back into slavery, and himself threatened with Lynch law. The grief
                  which threatened to overwhelm him at finding those he so dearly loved hurled back
                  into bondage, was not enough to appease a community tenacious of its colour. No!
                  he must leave his business, until the arrival of some one from New York, to the
                  clerk who so perfidiously betrayed him. With sickened heart, then, does he—only
                  too glad to escape the fury of an unreasoning mob—seek that place of bondage into
                  which the captives have been carried; nay, more, he left the excited little world
                  (reporting his destination to be New York) fully resolved to rescue them at the
                  hazard of his life, and for ever leave the country. Scarcely necessary then, will
                  it be for us to inform the reader, that, having sought out the Rosebrooks, he has
                  counselled their advice, and joined them in devising means of relief. Blowers had
                  declared, on his sacred honour, he would not sell the captives for their weight in
                  gold.
               Rosebrook had no sooner received Annette's letter from the hand of Pompe than he
                  repaired to Blowers' plantation—as well to sound that gentleman's disposition to
                  sell his captives, as a necessary precaution against the dangers he had incurred
                  through his participation in the fair girl's escape; for albeit the disclosure
                  might be extorted from her by cruelty. But Blowers was too much of a gentleman to
                  condescend to sell his captive; nor would he listen to arguments in her behalf.
                  Nevertheless, we will not underrate Blowers' character, that the reader may
                  suppose him devoid of compassion;
                  for—be it recorded to his fame—he did, on the morning following that on which the
                  punishment we have described in the foregoing chapter took place, send the child,
                  whose long and piercing cries he could no longer endure, to the arms of its poor
                  disconsolate mother, whom he hoped would take good care of it.
               Now, let not the reader restrain his fancy, but imagine, if he can, Pringle
                  Blowers' disappointment and state of perturbation, when, three days after the
                  punishment, he presented himself at Broadman's establishment, and was informed by
                  that functionary that the fair mother was non
                     est. With honest face did Broadman assert his ignorance of wrong.
                  That he had not betrayed his duty he would satisfy the enraged man, by producing
                  the very order on which he delivered them to Joe! "Yes, Joe was his name!"
                  continues the honest man; "and he asserted his ownership, and told a
                  straightforward story, and didn't look roguish." He passes the order over to
                  Blowers, who, having examined it very cautiously, says: "Forgery, forgery!—'tis,
                  by the Eternal!" Turning his fat sides, he approaches the window, and by the light
                  reads each successive word. It is written in a scrawl precisely like his own; but,
                  forsooth, it cannot be his. However, deeming it little becoming a man of his
                  standing to parley with Broadman, he quickly makes his exit, and, like a
                  locomotive at half speed, exhausting his perturbation the while, does he seek his
                  way into the city, where he discovers his loss to the police. We have in another
                  part of our history described Blowers as something of a wag; indeed, waggery was
                  not the least trait in his curious character, nor was he at all cautious in the
                  exercise of it; and, upon the principle that those who give must take, did he
                  render himself a fit object for those who indulge in that sort of pastime to level
                  their wit upon. On this occasion, Blowers had not spent many hours in the city ere
                  he had all its convenient corners very fantastically decorated with large blue
                  placards, whereon was inscribed the loss of his valuable woman, and the offer of
                  the increased sum of four hundred dollars for her apprehension. The placards were
                  wonderful curiosities, and very characteristic of Blowers, who in this instance
                  excited no small amount of merriment among the city wags, each of whom cracked a
                  joke at his expense. Now it was not that those waggish spirits said of his placard
                  things exceedingly annoying to his sensitive feelings, but that every prig made
                  him the butt of his borrowed wit. One quizzed him with want of gallantry,—another
                  told him what the ladies said of his oss,—a third pitied him, but hoped he might
                  get back his property; and then, Tom Span, the dandy lawyer, laconically told him
                  that to love a fair slave was a business he must learn over again; and Sprout, the
                  cotton-broker, said there was a law against ornamenting the city with blue
                  placards and type of such uncommon size. In this interminable perplexity, and to
                  avoid the last-named difficulty, did he invoke the genius of the "bill-sticker,"
                  who obliterated the blue placards by covering them over with brown ones, the
                  performance of which, Blowers himself superintended. This made the matter still
                  worse, for with jocose smile did every wag say he had hung the city in mourning
                  for his loss; which singular proceeding the ladies had one and all solemnly
                  protested against. Now, Blowers regard for the ladies was proverbial; nor will it
                  disparage his character to say that no one was more sensitive of their opinions
                  concerning himself. In this unhappy position, then, which he might have avoided
                  had he exercised more calmly his philosophy, did his perturbation get the better
                  of him;—an object of ridicule for every wag, and in ill-favour with the very first
                  ladies, never was perplexed man's temper so near the exploding point of high
                  pressure. And here, forsooth, disgusted within the whole city, nor at all pleased
                  with the result of his inventive genius, he sought relief in strong drinks and a
                  week of dissipation; in which sad condition we must leave him to the reader's
                  sympathy.
               As some of our fair readers may be a little prudish, or exacting of character, and
                  as we are peculiarly sensitive of the reputation some of the characters embodied
                  in this history should bear to the very end, we deem it prudent here not to
                  disclose the nature of the little forgery which was perpetrated at Blowers'
                  expense, nor the means by which it was so cleverly carried out, to the release of
                  the fair captives, who must now be got out of the city. Should we, in the
                  performance of this very desirable duty, fail to please the reader's taste for
                  hair-breadth escapes, unnatural heroism, and sublime disinterestedness, an excuse
                  may be found in our lack of soul to appreciate those virtues of romance mance. We have no taste for breathless
                  suspenses, no love of terror: we deal not in tragedy, nor traffic in dramatic
                  effects. But as the simplest strategy is often the most successful of results, so
                  did it prove in this particular case; for, be it known, that on the morning of the
                  twenty-fourth of March, ——, was Molly Hardweather's suggestion adopted and
                  effectually carried out, to the gratification of sundry interested persons. Calm
                  and bright was that morning; Charleston harbour and its pretty banks seemed
                  radiant of loveliness: the phantom-like Maggy Bell, with mainsail and jib spread
                  motionless in the air, swung gently at anchor midway the stream; and Dame
                  Hardweather sat in the dingy cabin, her little chubby face beaming contentment as
                  she nursed the "t'other twin." The brusque figure of old Jack, immersed in
                  watchfulness, paced to and fro the Maggy's deck; and in the city as trim a young
                  sailor as ever served signal halliards on board man-o'-war, might be seen, his
                  canvas bag slung over his shoulder, carelessly plodding along through the busy
                  street, for the landing at the market slip. Soon the Maggy's flying jib was run
                  up, then the foresail followed and hung loose by the throat. Near the wheel, as if
                  in contemplation, sat Montague, while Hardweather continued his pacing, now
                  glancing aloft, then to seaward, as if invoking Boreas' all-welcome aid, and again
                  watching intently in the direction of the slip. A few minutes more and a boat
                  glided from the wharf, and rowed away for the little craft, which it soon reached,
                  and on board of which the young sailor flung his bag, clambered over the rail, and
                  seemed happy, as old Jack put out his brawny hand, saying: "Come youngster, bear a
                  hand now, and set about brightening up the coppers!" We need not here discover the
                  hearts that leaped with joy just then; we need not describe the anxiety that found
                  relief when the young sailor set foot on the Maggy's deck; nor need we describe
                  those eyes on shore that in tears watched the slender form as it disappeared from
                  sight. Just then a breeze wafted from the north, the anchor was hove up, the sails
                  trimmed home, and slowly seaward moved the little bark. As she drifted rather than
                  sailed past Fort Pinkney, two burly officials, as is the custom, boarded to search
                  for hapless fugitives; but, having great confidence in the honesty of Skipper
                  Splitwater, who never failed to give them of his best cheer, they drank a pleasant
                  passage to him, made a cursory search, a note of the names of all on board (Jack
                  saying Tom Bolt was the young sailor's), and left quite satisfied. Indeed, there
                  was nothing to excite their suspicions, for the good dame sat nursing the "twa
                  twins," nor left aught to discover the discrepancy between their ages, if we
                  except a pair of little red feet that dangled out from beneath the fringe of a
                  plaid shawl. And the young sailor, who it is hardly necessary to inform the reader
                  is Annette, was busy with his cooking. And now the little craft, free upon the
                  wave, increased her speed as her topsails spread out, and glided swiftly seaward,
                  heaven tempering the winds to her well-worn sails. God speed the Maggy Bell as she
                  vaults over the sea; and may she never want water under keel, slaves to carry into
                  freedom, or a good Dame Hardweather to make cheerful the little cabin! say we.
               And now, reader, join us in taking a fond farewell of the Rosebrooks, who have so
                  nobly played their part, to the shame of those who stubbornly refuse to profit by
                  their example. They played no inactive part in the final escape; but discretion
                  forbids our disclosing its minutiæ. They sought to give unto others that liquid of
                  life to which they owed their own prosperity and happiness; nor did selfish motive
                  incite them to action. No; they sought peace and prosperity for the state; they
                  would bind in lasting fellowship that union so mighty of states, which the world
                  with mingled admiration and distrust watches; which in kindred compact must be
                  mightier, which divided must fall! And while taking leave of them, hoping their
                  future may be brightened with joys—and, too, though it may not comport with the
                  interests of our southern friends, that their inventive genius may never want
                  objects upon which to illustrate itself so happily—let us not forget to shake old
                  Jack Hardweather warmly by the hand, invoking for him many fair winds and
                  profitable voyages. A big heart enamelled of "coarse flesh" is his; but with his
                  warm functions he has done much good; may he be rich in heaven's rewards, for he
                  is poor in earth's!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LV.
               IN WHICH IS A HAPPY MEETING, SOME CURIOUS FACTS DEVELOPED, AND
                  CLOTILDA'S HISTORY DISCLOSED.
               IT was seven days after the sailing of the Maggy Bell, as described in the
                  foregoing chapter, that Montague was seen sitting in the comfortably furnished
                  parlour of a neat cottage in the suburbs of Nassau. The coal fire burned brightly
                  in a polished grate; the carpets and rugs, and lolling mats, indicated of care and
                  comfort; the tabbied furniture and chastely worked ottomans, and sofas, and
                  chairs, and inlaid workstands, seem bright of regularity and taste; and the window
                  curtains of lace and damask, and the scroll cornices from which they flowingly
                  hung, and the little landscape paintings that hung upon the satin-papered walls,
                  and the soft light that issued from two girandoles on the mantel-piece of figured
                  marble, all lent their cheering aid to make complete the radiant picture of a
                  happy home. But Montague sat nervous with anxiety. "Mother won't be a minute!"
                  said a pert little fellow of some seven summers, who played with his hands as he
                  sat on the sofa, and asked questions his emotions forbid answering. On an ottoman
                  near the cheerful fire, sat, with happy faces, the prettily dressed figures of a
                  boy and girl, older in age than the first; while by the side of Montague sat
                  Maxwell, whose manly countenance we transcribed in the early part of our
                  narrative, and to whom Montague had in part related the sad events of the four
                  months past, as he heaved a sigh, saying, "How happy must he die who careth for
                  the slave!" Ere the words had escaped his lips, the door opened,and the graceful
                  form of a beautiful woman entered, her finely oval but pensive face made more
                  expressive by the olive that shaded it, and those deep soul-like eyes that now
                  sparkled in gentleness, and again flashed with apprehension. Nervously she paused
                  and set her eyes with intense stare on Montague; then vaulted into his arms and
                  embraced him, crying, "Is not my Annette here?" as a tear stole down her cheeks.
                  Her quick eye detected trouble in his deportment; she grasped his left hand firmly
                  in her right, and with quivering frame besought him to keep her no longer in the
                  agony of suspense. "Why thus suddenly have you come? ah!—you disclose a
                  deep-rooted trouble in not forewarning me! tell me all and relieve my feelings!"
                  she ejaculated, in broken accents. "I was driven from that country because I loved
                  nature and obeyed its laws. My very soul loved its greatness, and would have done
                  battle for its glories—yea, I loved it for the many blessings it hath for the
                  favoured; but one dark stain on its bright escutcheon so betrayed justice, that no
                  home was there for me—none for the wife I had married in lawful wedlock." Here the
                  woman, in agonising throbs, interrupted him by enquiring why he said there was no
                  home for the wife he had married in lawful wedlock—was not the land of the
                  puritans free? "Nay!" he answered, in a measured tone, shaking his head, "it is
                  bestained not with their crimes—for dearly do they love justice and regard the
                  rights of man—but with the dark deeds of the man-seller, who, heedless of their
                  feelings, and despising their moral rectitude, would make solitary those happy
                  homes that brighten in greatness over its soil." Again, frantic of anxiety, did
                  the woman interrupt him: "Heavens!—she is not dragged back into slavery?" she
                  enquired, her emotions rising beyond her power of restraint, as she drew bitter
                  pangs from painful truths. With countenance bathed in trouble did Montague return
                  her solicitous glance, and speak. "Into slavery" he muttered, in half choked
                  accents "was she hurled back." He had not finished the sentence ere anxiety burst
                  its bounds, and the anxious woman shrieked, and fell swooning in his arms. Even
                  yet her olive face was 
                     beautefully
                     beautifully
                   pale. The cheerful parlour now rung with confusion, servants bustled
                  about in fright, the youthful family shrieked in fear, the father sought to
                  restore the fond mother, as Montague chafed her right hand in his. Let us leave to
                  the reader's conjecture a scene his fancy may depict better than we can describe,
                  and pass to one more pleasant of results. Some half an hour had transpired, when,
                  as if in strange bewilderment, Clotilda opened her eyes and seemed conscious of
                  her position. A deep crimson shaded her olive cheeks, as in luxurious ease she lay
                  upon the couch, her flushed face and her thick wavy hair, so prettily parted over
                  her classic brow, curiously contrasting
                  with the snow-white pillow on which it rested. A pale and emaciated girl sat
                  beside her, smoothing her brow with her left hand, laying the right gently on the
                  almost motionless bosom, kissing the crimsoning cheek, and lisping rather than
                  speaking, "Mother, mother, oh mother!—it's only me." And then the wet courses on
                  her cheeks told how the fountain of her soul had overflown. Calmly and vacantly
                  the woman gazed on the fair girl, with whom she had been left alone. Then she
                  raised her left hand to her brow, sighed, and seemed sinking into a tranquil
                  sleep. "Mother! mother! I am once more with my mother!" again ejaculates the fair
                  girl, sobbing audibly; "do you not know me, mother?" Clotilda started as if
                  suddenly surprised. "Do I dream?" she muttered, raising herself on her elbow, as
                  her great soft eyes wandered about the room. She would know who called her mother.
                  "'Tis me," said the fair girl, returning her glances, "do you not know your
                  Annette—your slave child?" Indeed the fair girl was not of that bright countenance
                  she had anticipated meeting, for though the punishment had little soiled her flesh
                  the dagger of disgrace had cut deep into her heart, and spread its poison over her
                  soul. "This my Annette!" exclaimed Clotilda, throwing her arms about the fair
                  girl's neck, drawing her frantically to her bosom, and bathing her cheeks with her
                  tears of joy. "Yes, yes, 'tis my long-lost child; 'tis she for whom my soul has
                  longed—God has been merciful, rescued her from the yawning death of slavery, and
                  given her back to her mother! Oh, no, I do not dream—it is my child,—my Annette!"
                  she continued. Long and affectionately did they mingle their tears and kisses. And
                  now a fond mother's joy seemed complete, a child's sorrow ended, and a happy
                  family were made happier. Again the family gathered into the room, where, as of
                  one accord, they poured out their affectionate congratulations. One after another
                  were the children enjoined to greet Annette, kiss her, and call her sister. To
                  them the meeting was as strange as to the parents it was radiant of joy. "Mother!"
                  said the little boy, as he took Annette by the hand and called her sister, and
                  kissed her as she kissed him, "was you married before you was married to father?"
                  The affectionate mother had no answer to make; she might have found one in the
                  ignominy of the slave world. And now, when the measure of joy seemed full—when the
                  bitterness of the past dwindled away like a dream, and when the future like a
                  beacon hung out its light of promise,—Clotilda drew from a small workstand a
                  discoloured paper written over in Greek characters, scarce intelligible.
                  "Annette!" said she, "my mother gave me this when last I saw her. The chains were
                  then about her hands, and she was about to be led away to the far south slave
                  market: by it did I discover my history." Here she unfolded its defaced pages,
                  lifted her eyes upwards invokingly, and continued—"To speak the crimes of great
                  men is to hazard an oblivion for yourself, to bring upon you the indifference of
                  the multitude; but great men are often greatest in crime—for so it proved with
                  those who completed my mother's destruction. Give ear, then, ye grave senators,
                  and if ye have hearts of fathers, lend them! listen, ye queen mothers of my
                  country, whose sons and daughters are yet travelling the world's uncertainties!
                  listen, ye fathers, who have souls above Mammon's golden grasp, and sons in whom
                  ye put your trust! listen, ye brothers, whose pride brightens in a sister's
                  virtue! listen, ye sisters, who enjoy paternal affections, and feel that one day
                  you may grace a country's social life! listen, ye philanthropists, ye men of the
                  world, who love your country, and whose hearts yearn for its liberties—ye men
                  sensitive of our great Republic's honour, nor seek to traffic in the small gains
                  of power when larger ones await you; and, above all, lend your hearts, ye brothers
                  of the clergy in the slave church, and give ear while I tell who I am, and pray
                  ye, as ye love the soul of woman, to seek out those who, like unto what I was, now
                  wither in slavery. My grandfather's name was Iznard Maldonard, a Minorcan, who in
                  the year 1767 (some four years after Florida was by the king of Spain ceded to
                  Great Britain) emigrated with one Dr. Turnbull—whose name has since shone on the
                  pages of history—to that land of sunshine and promise; for, indeed, Florida is the
                  Italy of America. In that year did numerous of the English aristocracy conceive
                  plans as various as inconsistent for the population and improvement of the colony.
                  With a worthy motive did Lord Rolle draw from the purlieus of London*
                  
                     
                     *See Williams' History of Florida, page 188. State Papers.
                  
                   three hundred wretched females, whose
                  condition he would better by reforming and making aid in founding settlements.
                  This his lordship found no easy task; but the climate relieved him of the
                  perplexity he had brought upon himself, for to it did they all fall victims in a
                  very short time. But Turnbull, with motive less commendable, obtained a grant of
                  his government, and, for the sum of four hundred pounds, (being then in the
                  Peleponnesus) was the governor of Modon bribed into a permission to convey sundry
                  Greek families to Florida, for colonization. Returning from Modon with a number of
                  families, he touched at the islands of Corsica and Minorca, added another vessel
                  to his fleet, and increased the number of his settlers to fifteen hundred. With
                  exciting promises did he decoy them to his land of Egypt, which proved a bondage
                  to his shame. He would give them lands, free passages, good provisions and
                  clothing; but none of these promises did he keep. A long passage of four months
                  found many victims to its hardships, and those who arrived safe were emaciated by
                  sickness. Into the interior were these taken; and there they founded a settlement
                  called New Smyrna, the land for which—some sixty thousand acres—was granted by the
                  governor of Florida. Faithfully and earnestly did they labour for the promised
                  reward, and in less than five years had more than three thousand acres of land in
                  the highest state of cultivation; but, as Turnbull's prosperity increased, so did
                  the demon avarice; and men, women, and children, were reduced to the most abject
                  slavery. Tasks greater than they could perform were assigned them, and a few
                  Italians and negroes made overseers and drivers. For food the labourers were
                  allotted seven quarts of corn per week. Many who had lived in affluence in their
                  own country were compelled to wear osnaburgs, and go bare-foot through the year.
                  More than nine years were those valuable settlers kept in this state of slavery,
                  the cruelties inflicted upon them surpassing in enormity those which so
                  stigmatised the savage Spaniards of St. Domingo. Drivers were compelled to beat
                  and lacerate those who had not performed their tasks; many were left naked, tied
                  all night to trees, that mosquitoes might suck their blood, and the suffering
                  wretches become swollen from torture. Some, to end their troubles, wandered off,
                  and died of starvation in the forest, and, including the natural increase, less
                  than six hundred souls were left at the end of nine years. But, be it known to
                  those whose hearts and ears I have before invoked, that many children of these
                  unfortunate parents were fair and beautiful, which valuable charms singularly
                  excited the cupidity of the tyrant, who betook himself to selling them for
                  purposes most infamous. A child overhearing the conversation of three English
                  gentlemen who made an excursion to the settlement, and being quick of ear,
                  conveyed the purport of it to his mother, who, in the night, summoned a council of
                  her confidants to concoct the means of gaining more intelligence. The boy heard
                  the visitors, who stood in the great mansion, which was of stone, say, "Did the
                  wretches know their rights they had not suffered such enormities of slavery." It
                  was resolved that three ask for long tasks, under the pretext of gaining time to
                  catch turtle on the coast; but having gained the desired time, they set off for
                  St. Augustine, which they reached, after swimming rivers and delving almost
                  impenetrable morasses. They sought the attorney-general of the province, Mr.
                  Younge,—I speak his name with reverence—and with an earnest zeal did he espouse
                  the cause of this betrayed people. At that time, Governor Grant—since strongly
                  suspected of being concerned with Turnbull in the slavery of the Greeks and
                  Minorcans—had just been superseded by Tonyn, who now had it in his power to rebuke
                  a tyrant, and render justice to a long-injured people. Again, on the return of the
                  envoys, who bore good tidings, did they meet in secret, and choose one Pallicier,
                  a Greek, their leader. This man had been master mechanic of the mansion. With
                  wooden spears were the men armed and formed into two lines, the women, children,
                  and old men in the centre; and thus did they set off from the place of bondage to
                  seek freedom. In vain did the tyrant—whose name democracy has enshrined with its
                  glories—pursue them, and exhaust persuasion to procure their return. For three
                  days did they wander the woods, delve morasses, and swim rivers, ere they reached
                  the haven of St. Augustine, where, being provided with provisions, their case was
                  tried, and, albeit, though Turnbull interposed all the perfidy wealth could
                  purchase, their 
                     fredeom
                     freedom
                   established. But alas! not so well was it with those fair daughters whom
                  the tyrant sold slaves to a life of infamy, and for whose offspring, now in the bitterness of
                  bondage, do we plead. Scores of these female children were sold by the tyrant; but
                  either the people were drunk of joy over their own liberty, and forgot to demand
                  the return of their children, or the good Younge felt forcibly his weakness to
                  bring to justice the rich and great—for the law is weak where slavery makes men
                  great—so as to make him disgorge the ill-gotten treasure he might have concealed,
                  but the proof of which nothing was easier than to obliterate.
               "Maldonard, then, was my grandfather; and, with my grandmother and three children,
                  was of those who suffered the cruelties I have detailed. Two of his children were
                  girls, fair and beautiful, whom the tyrant, under the pretext of bettering their
                  condition in another colony, sold away into slavery. One was my dear mother." Here
                  tears coursed down the woman's cheeks. "And she, though I blush to tell it, was
                  sold to Rovero, who was indeed my father as well as Franconia's. But
                  I was years older than Franconia—I visit her grave by day, and dream of her by
                  night;—nor was it strange that she should trace the cause of similarity in our
                  features. Forsooth, it was that singular discovery—of which I was long
                  ignorant—coupled with the virtues of a great soul, that incited her to effect my
                  escape. Rovero, ere he married Franconia's mother, sold Sylvia Maldonard, who was
                  my mother; and may angels bring glad tidings of her spirit! Yes, true is it that
                  my poor mother was sold to one Silenus, of whom Marston bought my body while
                  heaven guarded the soul: but here would I drop the curtain over the scene, for
                  Maldonard is dead; and in the grave of his Italian wife, ere he gained his
                  freedom, was he buried." Here again the fond mother, as she concluded, lifted her
                  eyes invokingly, fondled her long-lost child to her bosom,—smiled upon her, kissed
                  her, and was happy.
            
            
               CHAPTER LVI.
               IN WHICH A PLOT IS DISCLOSED, AND THE MAN-SELLER MADE TO PAY THE
                  PENALTY OF HIS CRIMES.
               WHILE the scenes which we have detailed in the foregoing chapter were being
                  enacted at Nassau, there stood in the portico of a massive dwelling, fronting what
                  in Charleston is called the "Battery Promenade," the tall and stately figure of a
                  man, wrapped in a costly black cloak, the folds of which lay carelessly about his
                  neck and shoulders. For some minutes did he stand, hesitating, and watching up and
                  down the broad walk in front. The gas-light overhead shed its glare upon the
                  freestone walls—for the night was dark—and, as he turned, discovered the fine
                  features of a frank and open countenance, to which the flashing of two great
                  intelligent eyes, a long silvery beard, and a flowing moustache, all shaded by the
                  broad brim of a black felt hat, lent their aid to make impressive. Closer he
                  muffled his face in the folds of his cloak, and spoke. "Time!" said he, in a voice
                  musical and clear, "hath worn little on his great mansion; like his heart, it is
                  of good stone." The mansion, indeed, was of princely front, with chiselled façade
                  and great doric windows of deep fluted mouldings, grand in outline. Now a small
                  hand stole from beneath his cloak, rapped gently upon the carved door of black
                  walnut, and rang the bell. Soon the door swung open, and a negro in a black coat,
                  white vest, and handkerchief of great stiffness, and nether garments of flashy
                  stripes, politely bowed him into a hall of great splendour. Rows of statuary stood
                  in alcoves along its sides; the walls dazzled with bright coloured paintings in
                  massive gilt frames; highly coloured and badly blended mythological designs spread
                  along the ceiling: the figure of a female, with pearly tears gushing from her
                  eyes, as on bended knee she besought mercy of the winged angel perched above her,
                  stood beside the broad stairway at the further end of the hall—strangely
                  emblematical of the many thousand souls the man-seller had made weep in the bitterness of slavery; the softest
                  rugs and costly Turkey carpets, with which its floor was spread, yielded lightly
                  to the footfall, as the jetting lights of a great chandelier shed refulgence over
                  the whole: indeed, what there lacked of taste was made up with air of opulence.
                  The negro exhibited some surprise at the stranger's dress and manner, for he
                  affected ease and indifference. "Is your master at leisure?" said he. "Business,
                  or a friend?" inquired the negro, making one of his best bows, and drawing back
                  his left foot. "Both," was the quick reply. "I, boy, am a gentleman!" "I sees dat,
                  mas'r," rejoined the boy, accompanying his answer with another bow, and requesting
                  the stranger's name, as he motioned him into a spacious drawing-room on the right,
                  still more gorgeously furnished.
               "My name is Major Blank: your master knows my name: I would see him quickly!"
                  again spoke the stranger, as the boy promptly disappeared to make the
                  announcement. The heavy satin-damask curtains, of finest texture, that adorned the
                  windows; the fresco-paintings of the walls; the elaborate gilding that here and
                  there in bad taste relieved the cornices; the massive pictures that hung in
                  gauze-covered frames upon the walls; the chastely designed carpets, and lolls, and
                  rugs, with which the floor gave out its brilliancy; the costly tapestry of the
                  curiously carved furniture that stood here and there about the room; and the soft
                  light of a curiously constructed chandelier, suspended from the left hand of an
                  angel in bronze, the said angel having its wings pinioned to the ceiling, its body
                  in the attitude of descending, and its right hand gracefully raised above the
                  globe, spreading its prismatic glows over the whole, did indeed make the scene
                  resplendent of luxury. The man carelessly seated himself at a table that stood in
                  the centre of the room, threw the hat he had declined yielding to the negro on the
                  floor beside him, rested the elbow of his left arm on the table, and his head in
                  his hand, as with the fingers of his right hand did he fret the long silvery beard
                  that bedecked his chin, and contemplate with eager gaze the scene around him.
                  "Yea, the man-seller hath, with his spoils of greed, gotten him a gorgeous
                  mansion; even he liveth like a prince, his head resteth more in peace, and because
                  he hath great wealth of crime men seek to honour him. The rich criminal hath few
                  to fear; but hard is the fate of him who hath not the wherewith to be aught but a
                  poor one!" he muttered to himself, as the door opened, and the well-rounded figure
                  of Graspum whisked into the room. The negro bowed politely, and closed the door
                  after him, as the stranger's eye flashed upon his old acquaintance, who, bedecked
                  somewhat extravagantly, and with a forced smile on his subtle countenance,
                  advanced rubbing his hands one over the other, making several methodical bows, to
                  which the stranger rose, as he said, "Most happy am I to see you, Major! Major
                  Blake, I believe, I have the pleasure of receiving?" Here the stranger
                  interpolated by saying his name was not Blake, but Blank: the other apologised,
                  said he was just entertaining a small but very select circle of friends;
                  nevertheless, always chose to follow the maxim of "business before pleasure."
                  Again he bustled about, worked his fingers with a mechanical air, frisked them
                  through his hair, with which he covered the bald surface of his head, kept his
                  little keen eyes leering apprehensively on what he deemed a ripe customer, whom he
                  bid keep his seat. To an invitation to lay off his cloak the stranger replied that
                  it was of no consequence. "A planter just locating, if I may be permitted to
                  suggest?" enquired Graspum, taking his seat on the opposite side of the table.
                  "No!" returned the other, emphatically; "but I have some special business in your
                  line." The man of business, his face reddening of anxiety, rose quickly from his
                  seat, advanced to what seemed a rosewood cabinet elaborately carved, but which was
                  in reality an iron safe encased with ornamental wood, and from it drew forth a tin
                  case, saying, as he returned and set it upon the table, "Lots from one to five
                  were sold yesterday at almost fabulous prices—never was the demand for prime
                  people better; but we have Lots (here he began to disgorge invoices) six, seven,
                  eight, and nine left; all containing the primest of people! Yes, sir, let me
                  assure you, the very choicest of the market." He would have the customer examine
                  the invoices himself, and in the morning the live stock may be seen at his yard.
                  "You cherish no evil in your breast, in opposition to the command of Him who
                  reproved the wrong of malice; but you still cling to the sale of men, which you
                  conceive no harm, eh, Graspum?" returned the stranger, knitting his brows, as a
                  curl of fierce hatred set upon his lip.
                  With an air of surprise did Graspum hesitate for a moment, and then, with a
                  measured smile, said, "Why, Lord bless you! it would be a dishonour for a man of
                  my celebrity in business to let a day escape without a sale; within the last ten
                  days I have sold a thousand people, or more,—provided you throw in the old ones!"
                  Here he again frisked his fingers, and leaned back in his chair, as his face
                  resumed an air of satisfaction. The stranger interrupted as the man-seller was
                  about to enquire the number and texture of the people he desired. "Graspum," said
                  he, with significant firmness, setting his eyes upon him with intense stare,—"I
                  want neither your men, nor your women, nor your little children; but, have you a
                  record of souls you have sunk in the bitterness of slavery in that box"—here the
                  stranger paused, and pointed at the box on the table—"keep it until you knock for
                  admittance at the gates of eternity." It was not until this moment that he could
                  bring his mind, which had been absorbed in the mysteries of man-selling, to regard
                  the stranger in any other light than that of a customer. "Pardon me, sir!" said
                  he, somewhat nervously, "but you speak with great familiarity." The stranger would
                  not be considered intrusive. "Then you have forgotten me, Graspum?" exclaimed the
                  man, with an ominous laugh. As if deeply offended at such familiarity, the
                  man-seller shook his head rebukingly, and replied by saying he had an advantage of
                  him not comprehensible. "Then have you sent my dearest relatives to an untimely
                  grave, driven me from the home of my childhood, and made a hundred wretches swim a
                  sea of sorrow; and yet you do not know me?" Indeed, the charges here recounted
                  would have least served to aid the recognition, for they belonged only to one case
                  among many scores that might have been enumerated. He shook his head in reply. For
                  a minute did they,—the stranger scowling sarcastically upon his adversary (for
                  such he now was),—gaze upon each other, until Graspum's eyes drooped and his face
                  turned pale. "I have seen you; but at this moment cannot place you," he replied,
                  drawing back his chair a pace. "It were well had you never known me!" was the
                  stranger's rejoinder, spoken in significant accents, as he deliberately drew from
                  beneath his cloak a revolver, which he laid on the table, warning his adversary
                  that it were well he move cautiously. Graspum affects not to comprehend such
                  importune demeanor, or conjecture what has brought him hither. Trembling in
                  fright, and immersed in the sweat of his cowardice, he would proclaim aloud his
                  apprehension; to which medium of salvation he makes an attempt to reach the door.
                  But the stranger is too quick for him: "Calm your fears, Graspum," he says; "act
                  not the child, but meet the consequences like a hero: strange is it, that you, who
                  have sold twenty thousand souls, should shrink at the yielding up of one life!"
                  concludes he, placing his back firmly against the door, and commanding Graspum to
                  resume his seat. Having locked the door and placed the key in his pocket, he paced
                  twice or thrice up and down the floor, seemingly in deep contemplation, and heaved
                  a sigh. "Graspum!" he ejaculated, suddenly turning towards that terrified
                  gentleman; "in that same iron chest have you another box, the same containing
                  papers which are to me of more value than all your invoices of souls. Go! bring it
                  hither!" Tremblingly did the man-seller obey the command, drew from the chest an
                  antiquated box, and placed it hesitatingly upon the table. "I will get the key, if
                  you will kindly permit me," he said, bowing, as the sweat fell from his chin upon
                  the carpet. The stranger says it wants no key; he breaks it open with his hands.
                  "You have long stored it with goodly papers; let us see of what they are made,"
                  said he. Here Graspum commenced drawing forth package after package of papers, the
                  inscriptions on which were eagerly observed by the stranger's keen eye. At length
                  there came out a package of letters, superscribed in the stranger's own hand, and
                  directed to Hugh Marston. "How came you by these?" enquired the stranger, grasping
                  them quickly: "Ah, Graspum, I have heard all! Never mind,—continue!" he resumed.
                  Presently there came forth a package addressed to "Franconia M'Carstrow," some of
                  which the stranger recognised as superscribed by his mother, others by Clotilda,
                  for she could write when a slave. Graspum would put this last aside; but in an
                  angry tone did the stranger demand it, as his passion had well nigh got the better
                  of his resolution. "How the deep and damning infamy discovers itself! Ah, Graspum,
                  for the dross of this world hast thou betrayed the innocent. Through thine emissaries has thus intercepted these
                  letters, and felt safe in thy guilt. And still you know not who I am?" Indeed, the
                  man-seller was too much beside himself with terror to have recognised even a near
                  friend. "My name is Lorenzo,—he who more than twenty years ago you beguiled into
                  crime. There is concealed beneath those papers a bond that bears on its face the
                  secret of the many sorrows brought upon my family." "Lorenzo!" interrupted
                  Graspum, as he let fall a package of papers, and sat aghast and trembling. "Yes,"
                  replied the other, "you cannot mistake me, though time hath laid a heavy hand upon
                  my brow. Now is your infamy complete!" Here the stranger drew forth the identical
                  bond we have described in the early part of our history, as being signed by
                  Marston, at his mansion, on the night previous to Lorenzo's departure. Bidding the
                  man-seller move not an inch, he spread the document before him, and commanded him
                  to read the contents. This he had not resolution to do. "Graspum!" spoke Lorenzo,
                  his countenance flushed in passion; "you can see, if you cannot read; look ye upon
                  the words of that paper (here he traced the lines with the forefinger of his right
                  hand as he stood over the wretched miscreant) and tell me if it be honourable to
                  spare the life of one who would commit so foul a deed. On the night you
                  consummated my shame, forced me to relieve you by procuring my uncle's signature
                  to a document not then filled up, or made complete, how little did I conjecture
                  the germs of villainy so deep in your heart as to betray the confidence I reposed
                  in you. You, in your avarice, changed the tenor of that instrument, made the
                  amount more than double that which I had injudiciously become indebted to you, and
                  transcribed it in the instrument, in legal phraseology, which you made a
                  death-warrant to my nearest and dearest relatives. Read it, miscreant! read it!
                  Read on it sixty-two thousand dollars, the cause of your anxiety to hurry me out
                  of the city into a foreign land. I returned to seek a sister, to relieve my uncle,
                  to live an honourable man on that home so dear in my boyhood, so bright of that
                  which was pleasant in the past, to make glad the hearts of my aged parents, and to
                  receive the sweet forgiveness of those who honoured me when fortune smiled; but
                  you have left me none of these boons—nay, you would have me again wander an
                  outcast upon the world!" And now, as the miscreant fell tremblingly on his knees,
                  and beseeching that mercy which he had denied so many, Lorenzo's frenzy surmounted
                  all his resolution. With agitated hand he seized his revolver, saying, "I will go
                  hence stained with a miscreant's blood." Another moment, and the loud shriek of
                  the man-seller echoed forth, the sharp report of a pistol rung ominously through
                  the mansion; and quivering to the ground fell dead a wretch who had tortured ten
                  thousand souls, as Lorenzo disappeared and was seen no more.

            * * *It is believed that the above work, by Mr. Goodrich, will be very acceptable to
               the American public. It is the result of years of toil and labor, assisted in his
               researches by several scholars of known ability, and has been gotten up at a great
               expense by the proprietors. No pains have been spared in the execution of the
               Illustrations and Maps, which are entirely new, and prepared by the distinguished
               author expressly for the work. Indeed, all the other historical writings
               of Mr. Goodrich sink into insignificance, when compared with this, the result of his
               riper and maturer years. It is admitted that One Hundred Dollars could
               not purchase the same matter in any other shape: and the publishers confidently
               expect that in consideration of the great literary value of the work, the large sum
               expended in preparing it for the press, and the exceedingly moderate price at which
               it is offered, that it will be favorably received by every lover of good books.

            We commend this work to our readers who are inclined to the study of history in

               adapted to the popular mind of the American public.—Detroit Advertiser.
            This is a fine library volume, and the universal interest felt in the fate of the

            Mr. Headley has performed his task faithfully and well.—Ravenna Star.
            We think the author has done full justice to his heroine, and has taken a more

            TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE The Narrative of SOLOMON NORTHUP, a citizen of New York,
               Kidnapped in Washington City, in 1841, and Rescued in 1853, from a Cotton Plantation
               near Red River, Louisiana. 7 Illustrations, 336 pp. 12mo. Price $1,00
            VOICE OF THE PRESS.
            The narrative will be read with interest by every one who can sympathize with a human
               being struggling for freedom.—Buff. Cour.
            The volume cannot fail to gain a wide circulation. No one can contemplate the scenes
               which are here so naturally set forth, without a new conviction of the hideousness of
               the institution from which the subject of the narrative has happily escaped.—N. Y.
               Tribune.
            We think the story as affecting as any tale of sorrow could be.—N. Y. Evangelist.
            It proves conclusively that Uncle Tom's Cabin is a truthful history of American
               Slavery, though drawn under the veil of fiction.—Otsego Rep.
            Next to Uncle Tom's Cabin, the extraordinary narrative of Solomon Northup, is the
               most remarkable book that was ever issued from the American press.—Detroit Trib.
            This is a simple, earnest, moving narrative of the events, vicissitudes, cruelties
               and kindnesses of a bondage of 12 years. If there are those who can peruse it
               unmoved, we pity them. That it will create as great a sensation, and be regarded
               equally as interesting as "Uncle Tom's Cabin," is not a question for
               argument.—Buffalo Express.
            This is one of the most exciting narratives, full of thrilling incidents artlessly
               told, with all the marks of truth. There are no depicted scenes in "Uncle Tom" more
               tragic, horrible, and pathetic, than the incidents compassed in the twelve years of
               this man's life in slavery.—Cincinnati Jour.
            He who with an unbiassed mind sits down to the perusal of this book, will arise
               perfectly satisfied that American slavery is a hell of torments yet untold, and feel
               like devoting the energies of his life to its extirpation from the face of God's
               beautiful earth.—Evening Chron.
            The story is one of thrilling interest as a mere personal history. He is but a little
               darker than many who pass for white, and quite as intelligent as most white men.—N.
               C. Adv.
            The book is one of most absorbing interest.—Pittsburgh Dispatch.
            It is written in a racy, agreeable style, and narrates with admirable conciseness,
               yet animation the story of the sufferings, woes and persecutions of the hero. It is
               no less remarkable for candor and unity of purpose than for literary ability.—Oneida
               Her.
            It is one of the most effective books against slavery that was ever written. "Archy
               Moore" and "Uncle Tom" are discredited by many as "romances;" but how the apologists
               for the institution can dispose of Northup we are curious to see.—Syracuse Jour.
            It is well told and bears internal evidence of being a clear statement of facts.
               There is no attempt at display, but the events are so graphically portrayed, that the
               interest in the perusal is deep and unabated to the last. Some of the scenes have a
               fearful and exciting power in their delineation.—Cayuga Chief.
            It is a strange history, its truth is far stranger than fiction. Think of it! For
               thirty years A MAN, with all a man's hopes, fears and aspirations—with a wife and
               children to call him by the endearing names of husband and father—with a home, humble
               it may be, but still a HOME, beneath the shelter of whose roof none had a right to
               molest or make him afraid—then for twelve years A THING, a chattel personal, classed
               with mules and horses and treated with less consideration than they; torn from his
               home and family, and the free labor by which he earned their bread, and driven to
               unremitting, unrequited toil in a cotton field, under a burning southern sun, by the
               lash of an inhuman master. Oh! it is horrible. It chills the blood to think that such
               things are.—Fred. Douglass' Paper.
            It comes before us with highly respectable vouchers, and is a plain and simple
               statement of what happened to the author while in bondage to southern masters. It is
               a well told story, full of interest, and may be said to be the reality of "life among
               the lowly."—Buff. Com. Adv.
            Let it be read by all those good easy souls, who think slavery is, on the whole a
               good thing. Let it be read by all who think that although slavery is politically and
               economically a bad thing, it is not very bad for the slaves. Let it be read by all
               those M. C.'s and supporters who are always ready to give their votes, in aid of
               slavery and the slave trade with all the kidnapping inseparable from it. Let it be
               read, too, by our southern friends, who pity with so much christian sensibility, the
               wretched condition of the free negroes at the north, and rejoice at the enviable
               condition of their own slaves.—N. Y. Ind.
