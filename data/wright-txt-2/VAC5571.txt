                     "At the close of the day, when the hamlet still,
                     And mortals the sweets of forgetfulness prove;
                     When naught but the torrent is heard from the hill,
                     And naught but the nightingale's song in the grove:
                     'Twas then, by the cave of the mountain afar,
                     While his harp rang symphonious, a hermit began;
                     No more with himself or with nature at war,
                     He thought as a sage, while he felt as a man."

            PREFACE.
            The style of this little work, my readers may justly denominate
               allegorical—presenting facts and discrepancy as they are exhibited in the everyday
               play of life's great drama, in rather a mystified aspect; which may be readily
               observed by the careful peruser; but on the other hand, those who glance over these
               pages in a cursory manner, may not be able to discover any prominent features. If the
               "homely hints" alluded to, are but noticed by the reader, the writer will feel
               himself flattered with the idea that he has accomplished something; but that anything
               satisfactory should accrue as the result of that observation, is not anticipated at
               this age of the world's history.
            The author respectfully solicits all who may chance to peruse this volume, that they will not do so
               with the intention of criticising its contents, because no literary display was
               designed. That fact is obvious, by taking into consideration the modest feature of
               the title page.

            The hermit of Aleova, or, The shepherd girl's triumph
            THE HERMIT OF ALEOVA.
            
               I suppose all my readers are acquainted with the meaning of the word tradition; if
                  not, it will not be amiss for me to give my ideas on the subject, and submit it to
                  your criticism. Tradition means the handing down from one generation to another,
                  rites and ceremonies of a nation, such as a father communicating to a son, or
                  ancestors to posterity, their early history, with all their customs, rites and
                  ceremonies.
               The above explanation will suffice, I presume, for this occasion; but if you wish
                  to get a more thorough explanation, I must direct you to some learned
                  etymologist.
               It appears, as you will observe, that it was my happy lot to get hold of some
                  valuable papers, containing the early history, rise and progress of an interesting
                  clan, who left the homes of their
                  childhood, to seek their fortunes in an unknown and unexplored country.
               The motives which actuated them to take 
                     this
                     these
                   bold and daring steps, was none other than filthy lucre. The country
                  from which they fled, was small and thickly settled, making it almost an
                  impossibility to gain a livelihood, much less to amass wealth. But the desire to
                  become wealthy is a great stimulus, urging its votaries on with untiring energy,
                  holding out success as the great allurement or secondary impetus to its
                  attainment. When they attempted to raise a colony to emigrate to the country they
                  had in anticipation, it was not without great difficulty—each one objecting to his
                  or her relatives leaving them, to perish for aught they knew. They endeavored to
                  discourage the colony from their fearful undertaking, telling them all the
                  frightful tales—the woful mishaps that had ever happened or was recorded in the
                  annals of history of pioneers or adventurous persons; but all endeavors to
                  dishearten them only seemed to make them more determined and resolute. Seeing that
                  their threats and entreaties proved unavailable, they then changed the programme
                  by tendering them their assistance. How often you see the above picture
                  exemplified in every day life. You see the youth who is about to leave the
                  paternal roof to seek his fortune, to use the expression, "on his own hook." But
                  his parents object to the course he is about to pursue: they resort to threats to
                  try what virtue there might be in it to dissuade him from his foolish undertaking,
                  as long as there was enough and to spare in his father's house; but that proved
                  insufficient, so they resorted to entreaty; but finding no better success they do
                  not abandon him to his own selfish propensities, but endeavor to assist him in
                  getting rigged for whatever might be his undertaking.
               After the colony had themselves fully equipped, they embarked and set sail,
                  bidding adieu to their fatherland, the home of their childhood, the land of their
                  birth. With all their eagerness and anxiety to leave their native land, it was
                  impossible for them to suppress the emotions of their hearts, when they hoisted
                  their sails to the breeze: many unbidden tears found their way down their brave
                  cheeks. We must not suppose that because those daring adventurers wish to leave
                  their "good old homes" that they were destitute of the natural emotions of the heart, destitute of a feeling of
                  sympathy for those dear relatives they were about to bid an eternal farewell,
                  never again expecting to behold the bright sunshine of happiness beam upon their
                  familiar countenances.
               After the vessel had left its mooring to float upon the wide sea, the word Adieu!
                  Adieu! &c., might be heard until it was hushed by the foaming billows that
                  rolled between, and there we leave them to the mercy of Him who rules the mighty
                  deep.
               After sailing many days upon the vast ocean they came to land. And turning their
                  vessel into a bay they attempted to land. The country was nothing but one vast
                  wilderness of wood-land, extending for leagues in either direction. They sailed up
                  the bay as far as it would go, where they anchored and got into small boats, and
                  paddled ashore.
               You may imagine what were their feelings when they felt their feet again on
                     terra firma. They felt like kneeling down and
                  kissing the earth upon which they stood, such was the intensity of their
                  emotions.
               After they had landed, which was about midday day, they began to erect tents to
                  shelter them from the night air, as they did not know how long they might remain
                  in that situation. When they had dined, some of the colony followed the stream
                  that emptied into the bay in search of a location, for they intended to commence a
                  settlement as soon as fortune would favor them with a location. After they had
                  followed the stream for some two or three miles they came to a beautiful lake,
                  navigable for pretty large vessels, but thinking that not a suitable place to
                  commence a settlement, they resumed their search. They followed the stream a mile
                  or two further, where they came to a beautiful site to commence a settlement. They
                  went on further, but they soon returned to the selected spot, for it seemed that
                  was the site destined to contain the beautiful town Oleva, under
                  consideration.
               I shall now give a concise description of the commencement of the settlement. The
                  next day, after they had selected a situation, they moved all their implements to
                  the ground, and commenced to erect houses for the accommodation of the different
                  families. The members of these did not exceed a score, and the most of them were young married couples, having no
                  families; consequently the band was few and no necessity of erecting many houses.
                  After each family was snugly deposited in their several respective houses, the
                  next thing was to furnish a name for their cozy little village; at last they
                  thought of the name Oleva, and by that name it is known until this day.
               I shall now leave Oleva as it is and give a description of it in a future page. It
                  now being in its infancy, therefore it will be advisable for me to defer a
                  description of it until a few years have elapsed, when I will be able to go on
                  with the history of the hero of my story.
               I must not forget to mention a very particular circumstance which I came to learn
                  whilst reviewing some of my old "tradition papers." It appears that a colony left
                  the same country before the one above mentioned. They were shepherds, and when
                  they left they took many sheep and cattle with them intending to pursue their
                  present occupation in whatever country they might happen to land. Their colony was
                  pretty extensive, numbering perhaps two or three hundred; but where they landed,
                  and in what country, tradition does not seem to tell; but perhaps we will hear of
                  them by and by.
               My reader must remember that the first mentioned colony were merchants, and they
                  left their native country with the intention to continue the same occupation. They
                  intended to deal in furs, barks, roots, herbs, and many other such articles of
                  commerce; and as it seems that kind fortune smiled on their undertaking, for it
                  was their hap to settle in a country abundant in all the above mentioned articles.
                  The forest also abounded in many valuable trees such as mahogany, logwood, lignum
                  vitæ and cinchona, with many other valuable trees useless to mention. But I 
                     persume
                     presume
                   my reader is growing impatient for the description of the little town
                  Oleva.
               After the lapse of a few years over the town of Oleva it began to bear rather a
                  cheerful aspect, but for a description of the town at that time I must consult my
                  papers, which read as follows: The little town Oleva was situated in a dark and
                  shady wood, near the gigantic mountains of Aleova. This little village was hemmed
                  in by the wild-wood, like to an island of the sea that is hemmed in by the
                  majestic waters. This little town was
                  sheltered from the howling storms and tempestuous winds that swept overhead; but I
                  am sorry to say the balmy breeze, the listless zephyrs, were also strangers to
                  this little place: they were warded off by the tall majestic forest trees. The
                  howling winds and pelting storms yielded their fury to the surrounding forest,
                  passing by quiet Oleva, as the hungry wolf passes by the fold wherein lieth the
                  innocent lambs, portraying a spirit of innocence, whilst in reality it would but
                  could not, "a pretty good reason" the little boy would say. But in reality the
                  fierceness of the angry tempest is no more dreaded by the quiet villagers, than
                  the soul refreshing breeze that rushes from the sea. When the cold and blustering
                  wind of autumn or winter comes, it is greeted with a peculiar satisfaction known
                  only to the inhabitants of the little town Oleva. Stern winter was not dreaded by
                  them like those living in uplands, and in the highly cultivated regions, where the
                  freezing winds have full sway, sweeping with terror over the entire vegetable
                  kingdom. The sable garb of autumn, or the white mantle of Winter was looked upon
                  by the Olevans as a God-send, for it was in that season of the year they most
                  successfully amassed furs, and other articles of trade.
               Whilst strolling through the dark and sombre wood surrounding the village, you
                  might ever and anon, hear the loud report of the sporting piece, awakening the
                  many silent echoes of the mountains and woodland, when perhaps a denizen of the
                  forest, has received the keen piercing bullet in his vitals, causing him to
                  relinquish his hold upon life, as near and dear as it seems to be to him, and
                  after that must give up his rich mantle of fur to be worn by some prince or
                  peasant, or whoever may chance become its occupant. Or again you might hear the
                  shrill thwack of the busy wood-chopper's axe, who is felling the stately cinchona,
                  whose bark is known over the wide world for its valuable medical properties—so
                  valuable that at one time, it sold for its weight in silver. The trees known by
                  the name of mahogany, lignum vitæ, and many other valuable trees, also fell a
                  victim to the keen edge of the wary wood-chopper's axe. The employment of these
                  industrious Olevans was healthy and lucrative. In a few consecutive years, they
                  succeeded in accumulating considerable wealth. A physician cian accompanied this colony to the wild-wood of
                  Aleova, but he was compelled to abandon his glorious profession by 
                     neccessity
                     necessity
                  , for he soon ascertained that his otherwhere much needed profession was
                  entirely uncalled for in this healthy region of country; he soon found that his
                  profession was 
                     inadaquate
                     inadequate
                   to procure him a livelihood; therefore he was compelled to turn his
                  attention to something more lucrative: such was the hale condition of the settlers
                  at that early period, free from disease, and all maladies calculated to render
                  mankind miserable and wretched whilst here on this polluted earth.
               From a beautiful glen in the side of the mountain, issued forth a merry brook,
                  which came laughing and dancing over rocks and pebbles that lay in the
                  channel—anon whirling over the trunk of a fallen hemlock, then frisking through
                  branches and roots of trees and again sinking away beneath the arched banks, when
                  it is hidden from view, but again it emerges far below, resuming its heretofore
                  wanton song with cheerfulness seemingly unusual—again plunging headlong over
                  massive boulders, forming a small cascade or waterfall. Here the spray of the
                  dashing brook shed a faint rainbow in the sunbeams, similar to the one seen in the
                  heavens after a gentle April shower. Here the roaring of the diminutive cascade
                  broke the silence of the surrounding forest with its dashing footsteps.
               After the limpid stream had madly rushed down those rugged cliffs, it resumed its
                  usual murmuring song, until its merry babblings were hushed up in the outspread
                  arms of the quiet lake below, there perhaps to reflect on its past madness, its
                  musical mirthfulness, etc., since its outset from the quiet mountain glen.
               This lake was a beautiful sheet of water, spreading out to the distance of
                  three-quarters of a mile. Its waters were dark and deep moving with a slow and
                  majestic silence, as not even to awaken a murmur or startle a ripple. But anon its
                  quiet surface was disturbed by the wake of an aquatic fowl or animal, that glided
                  over its glassy surface; but it would soon again resume its "midnight stillness"
                  as if the God of Nature had commanded perfect silence and repose. When we
                  contemplate the deathlike stillness of the lake when compared with the noisy
                  brook, we are struck with awe, we are ready to exclaim: "How wonderful are thy works O God." But to attempt to
                  explain the why and the wherefore of the works of nature, we soon would be
                  enveloped in an inextricable mist, involved in a task, that time itself can not
                  elucidate. On the banks of this beautiful lake the willow grew luxuriantly, whose
                  slender wands oscillated in the breeze with majestic calmness. Their slender
                  boughs shed but a faint shadow over the sheet below, scarcely excluding the
                  penetrating rays of the noonday sun. The slender wands of the willow formed
                  another article of commerce of the industrious, money making Olevans. They tied
                  them in fagots, and thus sent them abroad to the osier basket maker, etc. The
                  osier willow was the species that grew by the lake, being the most valuable for
                  wicker work.
               On the banks of the lake grew many showy plants, and some of them of a bolder
                  character, ventured to vegetate within its watery limits: of these were the
                  nymphia, and nuphor, both of which are called by the vernacular name of water
                  lily. But the species that grew on the muddy banks was called sagitaria, or
                  arrowhead, as the name indicates. Two of the above mentioned flowers are white and
                  the remaining one yellow, all of which are very beautiful and gaudy. The root of
                  one of these aquatic plants was at one time celebrated for its vulnerary
                  properties, it was much used to cure rheumatism, but it has finally fallen into
                  disuse, with many other plants of like fame. When we take an impartial view of
                  these wonderful aquatic plants, we see the hand of Omniscience beautifully
                  displayed. You see the exercise of instinct even in seemingly inanimated nature,
                  that teaches them to bloom in watery beds, and shun the dry land, as the
                  Israelites did the approaching famine, or dearth.
               You may ask yourself the question, Why does not the rose bud and blossom on the
                  watery banks of a lake? Why is the nymphia never found blooming in all its natural
                  splendor, on the alpine heights, or on the rugged cliffs of a precipice? Or,
                  again, why is not the cunning fox, the denizen of the forests and hills, found
                  burrowing in holes on the banks of streams and lakes, with the musquash and
                  beaver? Or, why the beaver and muskrat do not quit their aquatic abodes, and
                  become denizens of the wild-wood, to shelter in the hollow trunks of trees with
                  the 
                     racoon
                     raccoon
                   and the squirrel, or seek their
                  den among the rocks with the bear and the wolf? In answer to these interrogations,
                  we may rightly say, it is because that God their Creator has given them an
                  instinct, that silently teaches them to do otherwise: he ordered the rose to bloom
                  in the valleys, and the water-lily in ponds and lakes: whilst on the other hand He
                  commanded the musquash and beaver to burrow in the banks of rivers and lakes, and
                  the fox and the coon in the wild-wood, each according to his instinct.
               This beautiful lake spread out its watery sheet, a mile or two from the village of
                  Oleva. The inhabitants displayed a considerable amount of good sense when they
                  located their village so far above the lake: it was more likely to be exempt from
                  the infectious miasmata that usually arise from stagnant waters, during the
                  oppressive heat of summer; this malaria is said to be generated by the
                  decomposition of vegetable matter, during the hot seasons.
               The village of Oleva was a small one, as I said before; the number of families did
                  not exceed a score. They lived together like a holy band of brothers. Never was
                  their social firesides bedewed with strife and discontentment; all was peaceful
                  and harmonious. It is one remarkable fact, that the inhabitants of a newly settled
                  country, possess more friendship and sociability than all the older settled
                  countries on the globe. Every man strives to become a true and genuine friend of
                  his neighbor, ever ready to help in time of need.
               It was in this village (Oleva) that the parents of the subject of this narrative
                  resided. It will be entirely unnecessary for me to give the names of those
                  venerable parents—enough to speak of them, in their task of rearing our young
                  adventurer. They were kind and indulgent, striving every way possible, and
                  equitable, to make their only son happy and contented. They spared no exertions to
                  procure for him a liberal education, which you will perceive in the sequel, to be
                  paramount to his fellows: but in this lonely settlement education could not be
                  easily procured, to the extent wished for, by the young hermit, but the difficulty
                  was considerably obviated by his parents, who had obtained a superior education,
                  before they left the land of their nativity; but with such means as were afforded
                  to him, he made ample progress to outride superstition and error, to a great
                  extent.
               
               The cognomen of this young philosopher could never be ascertained; no relic or
                  autograph was even to be had by tradition, for that being so imperfect, that, no
                  doubt, some valuable accounts or histories have been lost, at least to the present
                  day. But for convenience we will call him Solum, a name I presume every Latin
                  scholar is familiar with. The literal meaning of the word is, alone, solitary,
                  &c., which my reader well knows is appropriate to the traits and character of
                  a hermit, who is alone and solitary as his heart could wish and perhaps a little
                  inclination to redundance.
               This young lad grew up with the favor and good-will of all around him, so amiable
                  was his disposition; so sweet was his expression that he was almost idolized by
                  his comrades; his decorum was well worthy of imitation, but I am sorry to say that
                  some of his younger companions were much opposed to him, not from any pure motive,
                  that could not be, but it was from a mere selfish envy or a jealous feeling, a
                  feeling not cherished in the bosom of an honest individual; but he spurned it as
                  he would the death fangs of the virulent adder.
               Young Solum was very fond of fishing; he used to supply his father's table both
                  with the brook and lake trout. The trout is a fish much sought after by anglers,
                  its flesh being much superior to any of the fresh water fish, especially what is
                  denominated the speckled trout.
               The lake spoken of in a former page was a favorite resort for our young angler. He
                  did not angle merely for amusement, for his education taught him better, but it
                  was to supply the table with that exquisite delicacy.
               Solum seldom went to the forest with his neighbors to hunt the roving wild beast,
                  that part of his father's profession or rather occupation was not amicably
                  relished. The loud and sharp report of the rifle was not a favorite music of his;
                  he could listen to the ten thousand echoes awakened by the many hunters,
                  reverberating from mountain to mountain with pleasure, but he would not be a
                  participant in that seemingly awful amusement. His father procured a rifle for him
                  (Solum), to assist in collecting furs, &c., for the spring trade, for that was
                  the proper time to collect them, in the cold, frosty days of winter; but that
                  injunction of his father's was obeyed,
                  though rather reluctantly. He did not wish to be stubborn and disobedient like
                  some children, but the hunting of the wild beasts, merely for their furs, was
                  repugnant to his finer feelings, but he was willing to labor to disadvantage and
                  dissatisfaction rather than to disregard his father's mandates.
               If Solum's father had presented him a new set of fishing tackle, instead of a
                  rifle, he would have been much more satisfied, for fishing was his favorite
                  employment. Often would he steal away at an early hour, before the sun had emerged
                  from beneath the horizon, before the merry warblers had quit their roosts or
                  resumed their morning carols, yes, ere the noble nightingale had ceased his
                  nightly reverie. He would steal from his dormitory hours before his parents awoke
                  from their slumber, and go to the lake for a two-fold purpose. The first was to
                  witness the rising sun, depicted on the quiet surface of the lake. The tableau was
                  beautiful beyond description, it was perfectly sublime, it seemed to him that the
                  beautiful lake was pregnant with glittering gold, or that the vivid glare produced
                  by the reflection of the rays of the sun proceeded from a grate of burning embers
                  in the watery deep, enkindled by the vassals of Neptune, the fabulous monarch of
                  the watery elements.
               Solum's second purpose was to commence decoying the hungry trout with his barbed
                  hook and line, upon which was fixed the "dainty allurement."
               By the time he had succeeded in catching enough for breakfast, the sun had risen
                  to such a height as to dictate for Solum to cease his morning exercises and return
                  home to learn the order of the day.
               The innate propensities or disposition of Solum was similar to those of a
                  naturalist. From a mere youth he used to manifest a disposition to pry into the
                  hidden mysteries of nature. He wanted to know the why and the wherefore of the
                  causes and effects of all the works of nature, which lay spread out in open
                  volumes in his youthful pathway. He would frequently ask his parents, why the
                  majestic sun rose in the east and sat in the far west, or why the listless zephyr
                  treads so lightly over the sombre wild-wood, whilst the tornadoes or hurricanes
                  came blowing and howling through the boughs of the stately trees, lashing ing them to and fro, and anon prostrating
                  many of those proud monarchs of the forest to the ground, a victim of their
                  unrelenting power.
               Again, he would direct his attention to the tiny insects beneath his tread, and
                  ask, why the little ant busied himself all day long endeavoring to store away
                  provision, as if for an approaching famine, whilst the lazy beetle or the skipping
                  grasshopper seemed to be careless and unconcerned about their future welfare, or
                  else they were too proud and arrogant to submit to paltry labor.
               These, with many other interrogations, were put to his parents, when he was but a
                  mere stripling. They often acknowledged that many of the young philosopher's
                  interrogations were profound and unanswerable. But such was his ardent desire to
                  become acquainted with the laws of nature, both in the animated and in the
                  inanimated, the organized and in the inorganized portions of the works of
                  nature.
               Another trait in the character of Solum was his excessive love for solitude. He
                  did not love solitude with a mere selfish object, to absent himself from the
                  society of his fellow men, but it was that he might pursue the study of nature
                  more successfully and unmolested.
               It is the character of naturalists almost universally, to wander alone through
                  valleys and glens, over mountains and hills, in search of the hidden beauties of
                  nature. When they see a subject of contemplation, whether it be the beauties of a
                  mountain scenery, or of a lowly woodland, the grassy leas, the murmuring
                  streamlets, or the blooming flowers, they wish to sit down quietly upon a
                  moss-clad rock, or perhaps upon the trunk of a prostrated forest tree, there to
                  give full scope to their vivid imaginations. Perhaps they wish to become
                  acquainted with the notes of some unknown feathered songster, that is more shy of
                  his notes than the selfish halcyon is of his prey. If that is their object, they
                  wish particularly to be alone, that the whispering conversation of company might
                  not hush the wary songster ere he had completed his morning carol.
               Again, naturalists wish to be alone, when they wish to repair to the secret abode
                  of some denizen of the wild-wood or of the waters. Perhaps the history of the wary
                  animal in contemplation lies enshrouded in mystery, and they wish to get a clue to that obscure part of zoology,
                  for the benefit of their science. Many of our wild animals are nocturnal in their
                  habits, and but seldom leave their lair during the daytime, therefore it would be
                  quite a task for naturalists to ascertain their secret habits, resorting to all
                  the secresy imaginable.
               These above mentioned traits of naturalists were perfectly coincident with those
                  of Solum's, as far as his youthful mind had developed.
               It was such a pity that such a bright genius as Solum was allowed to lavish his
                  extraordinary talents to the four winds as it were. He had no one to teach, nor
                  was there any to teach him; no one fancied his, what they called "wild
                  inclinations," nor was there any of them endowed with such an unusual amount of
                  natural abilities. His companions looked upon his love of nature with
                  indifference; they considered it one of his effeminate weaknesses. But, oh! how
                  far was their imperfect criticism from the genuine, infallible truth; they
                  attempted to betray his true noble character, but in doing so they only portrayed
                  their own selfish and ignorant propensities.
               Solum's parents were very indulgent, and allowed lowed him many privileges which
                  other parents denied their children, he being their only son; and as a natural
                  consequence an only child is oftener indulged than otherwise. He was allowed to
                  resort to the lake, with his fishing tackle, to sport awhile with the finny
                  tribes, or to roam at large in the wild forest, studying the occult sciences or
                  mysteries of dame Nature. It was not the object of Solum's parents to accumulate
                  wealth for their only son, consequently they could spare him oftener, that he
                  might pursue his studies, for they plainly saw that it was not to idle away time,
                  that he desired to be alone so much; this fact they ascertained by his numerous
                  interrogations, when partaking of their evening repast; they knew that an inactive
                  mind could not frame such profound interrogations.
               No, paltry riches was but the smallest duty incumbent upon them, according to
                  their judgment.
               At the age of fourteen, he became so much attached to his inclinations, that he
                  was obliged to keep out of the way of many of his associates, to avoid their
                  sneering provocations. Their envious or rather malicious propensities run to such
                     a pitch, that it was almost considered
                  unsafe for him to remain in the town of Oleva, any longer. Solum wished to be
                  emancipated from the thraldom of their intense hatred. He longed for a quiet and
                  lonely hovel, in some shady forest retreat, where he could feel the realities of
                  true liberty, both of body and of speech—where he could feel that he was free from
                  their scoffs and jeers. He did not wish to leave his dear indulgent parents, but
                  wished to have them accompany him.
               Little did Solum imagine, that the day of his emancipation had drawn so near; he
                  did not think, that in less than a year the inhabitants of Oleva would be visited
                  by a fearful pestilence, that would prostrate their noble band, and lay them in
                  the cold and inanimate embrace of death. Solum's parents were both living when the
                  pestilence commenced its fearful ravages in the town of Oleva. They were but in
                  the prime and vigor of life, and full of all its pleasures and anticipations. They
                  looked upon their only child as the only source of secular comfort in their
                  declining years. They expected to have their rugged pathway through old age and
                  its anxieties, made smooth by the presence of Solum; but my reader will find
                  detailed in a future chapter, that Solum was released from that duty incumbent
                  upon him. The words "duty incumbent" may be a non-appropriate term, instead of
                  that, a "duty of pleasure," for it certainly is or ought to be, a duty of pleasure
                  to each and every child, to soothe his or her parents, who meet with so many ills
                  and aches in their downward course of life.
               Solum had asked permission of his parents in the evening, to go to the lake early
                  in the morning on purpose to fish or otherwise enjoy himself. Whilst he was busy
                  arranging, or rather repairing his tackle, one of his young lady associates
                  knocked at the door. She came to make a call upon Solum's mother, for she was very
                  fond of the old lady's company. The name of this young miss, was Lelia; she was a
                  beautiful girl of fourteen, but a few months younger than Solum.
               It will not be amiss for me to say a few words about Lelia, in relation to Solum.
                  She was a beautiful girl, with dark auburn hair, with a little 
                     tendancy
                     tendency
                   to wave; her eyes were of a dark hazel color, and her complexion was
                  clear and lily like; so Solum did not find it a very hard task to love one so near
                  his beau ideal. She was the only young
                  lady in town that Solum could fancy; all the rest seemed to have imbibed the idea
                  that Solum was too weak minded for their company. This idea, of course, they
                  received from their parents and neighbors, for Solum's pursuits seemed to have
                  been the common parlance of the day.
               It happened, (as good luck would have it,) that Solum's mother was out among the
                  neighbors, so Solum had to entertain Lelia himself, which was no disagreeable
                  task. Whilst they were alone, the following conversation ensued:
               "Lelia, I am very sorry that mother is not in, for I am sure that you feel
                  somewhat disappointed."
               "O no Solum, I do not feel much disappointed, because I live so near, that I can
                  run in at any time. What is this you are working at, if I may be so
                  inquisitive?"
               "Please don't talk about being inquisitive, that is what I love to see in a young
                  lady, but I have learned to distinguish between being inquisitive and impudent;
                  the latter, I am sorry to say, many persons, yes too many persons possess; but I
                  pray Lelia do not infer that I mean you, for I know, without flattering you in the
                  least, that you possess too much common sense, to be guilty of that. But pardon
                  me, I have not answered your question. I am mending my tackling, with the
                  intention of going a fishing in the morning, down to the lake."
               "O, how I wish I could accompany you on one of your rambles of pleasure,
                  especially when you go a fishing to the lake. O dear! I wish my parents would let
                  me go along once, anyhow, but I presume they would rather have me beheaded."
               "Lelia, how I wish you could accompany me, at least for one time; I am sure that
                  you would be so delighted with your jaunt that you would never afterwards feel
                  satisfied to spend so much of your time in doors."
               "I presume so Solum, but you seem to be talking about pleasures unattainable, at
                  least it appears so to me, however I shall live in hopes."
               "There is mother coming, Lelia, I hope that we shall be able to carry our
                  conversation into practice at a future time."
               "I thank you Solum; I sincerely hope we shall." With that Solum's mother entered
                  the house.
               "O how do you aunt," said Lelia, (as she was in the habit of calling Solum's
                  mother so, as a mark of respect for old age.)
               
               "I am pretty well, I have just been out among some of the neighbors, a calling, I
                  was at your house."
               "You were," said Lelia; "I am sorry that I was not at home, I am always absent
                  when you call at our house, I believe; Solum has been entertaining me ever since I
                  came; he has got me quite in the notion of going a fishing to the lake."
               "Yes I presume he would be trying to persuade you to go, for that lake seems to be
                  a part of his very existence."
               "What, mother? you don't mean what you say; do you infer that I go to the lake
                  oftener than necessity requires?"
               "I don't know but you do go there oftener than necessity requires, but I don't
                  mean to say that you go oftener than we permit."
               "O well, that alters the case vastly; I am sure I would not have Lelia think that
                  I stole away unawares, especially under existing circumstances."
               "O no," said Lelia, "I am too well acquainted with your mother, and her
                  discipline, than to harbor the idea that you pursued such a truant course."
               "Well, I am glad you do," said Solum, as if his mind felt somewhat relieved.
               "Lelia, I guess you had better accompany Solum to-morrow, to the lake; don't you
                  think that you would enjoy the trip?" said Solum's mother.
               "O, yes ma'am, I am pretty sure that I should, but O dear, my parents won't let me
                  go, I know they won't."
               "Well, there is only one way to find out," said Solum's mother, rather
                  emphatically.
               "Well," said Lelia, "I shall endeavor to go the time he goes, if I possibly can
                  get permission. I declare if it is not almost eight o'clock, and I am here yet; I
                  must really run home, for mother will be wondering what keeps me out so late, so
                  good night aunt, good night Solum, come and see us." So she ran home as nimble as
                  a fairy, much pleased with her visit, but more pleased with the young philosopher.
                  It was easy to be perceived that there was something mutual in their affections;
                  but it looks as if each one feared to make known their desire to reciprocate; but
                  I presume that is to be accounted for, by taking into consideration their tender
                  age, and the extreme delicacy of the subject.
               "What do you think of Lelia, mother?"
               "What do I think of her? that is not hard to tell, I always did love that girl; I think she is
                  the most intelligent young lady in town, and the most amiable."
               "Mother, you must not talk so, I am afraid you will get me quite in the notion of
                  her."
               "No danger of that at all, my son, I should judge by circumstances that that part
                  of the drama has been played already."
               "What do you mean, mother," asked Solum, rather sportively. "I should judge from
                  your inference, that you considered me pretty deeply in the mire already."
               Whilst they were thus conversing, a knock was heard at the door; the door was
                  opened, and there stood one of Solum's associates. He said he came to see how
                  Solum was getting on, or whether he had given up what many of the villagers
                  called, his "foolish ideas."
               Solum gave him to understand, that his ideas were not foolish; nor did they
                  approach near to it; but even if they were, he wanted a critic more thorough than
                  he was, to tell him so; he also told him, that it was a want of knowledge on those
                  profound subjects, that made him talk so ignorantly.
               When he found that he could not be reclaimed (to use his expression, that he was
                  irrecoverably lost), Solum thought (after the boy had left), that if he was
                  irrecoverably lost, it was his ardent desire that mankind in general were in the
                  same predicament.
               He was satisfied that if his innate principles led him so far in the pathway of
                  destruction and misery, as long as he had no calamitous premonitions; as long as
                  it afforded him such unrivaled pleasure, he would follow on in the same footsteps,
                  that he had from the beginning.
               Solum had an indomitable spirit, that was likely to put into execution his every
                  intentions; but to this part of my story, I must beg leave to lay aside for a
                  short time, whilst I will endeavor (in the mean while,) to withdraw the veil, that
                  has kept obscure, a sad picture; a picture that will cause many sympathetic hearts
                  to ache, when they hear the horrible detail in store for their entertainment. It
                  will be a complete history of the rise, progress, and results of the pestilence,
                  in the town of Oleva, with a concise sketch how it reached that place.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               THE PLAGUE.—SOLUM'S FLIGHT FROM OLEVA.
               What a fearful and appalling enemy, the mighty pestilence is. It is dreaded by
                  mankind almost universally; it comes like a dark and gloomy cloud, lowering in
                  woful columns, over the happiness and prosperity of the citizens of towns and
                  villages. It is alike detrimental to the progress of science and literature, as it
                  is to the longevity of human life. It seems to be its delight to torture—to
                  prostrate, poor helpless humanity; regarding not their circumstances, nor their
                  aversion to become his victim. It seems to glory in its regal power, swaying the
                  scepter of despotism and dismay; and wielding the sword of desolation, sometimes
                  to the entire extinction of living humanity in towns and cities. It has no ear to
                  the plaintive sobs of a bereaved husband, or the heart rending shrieks of a
                  sympathetic mother, at the loss of her only darling child. It soothes the cry of
                  the afflicted and bereaved infant, by a stroke from his fatal dart.
               Oh! cruel monarch of desolation and destruction, relent—cease thy fury, and let
                  feeble mortality glide upon the sea of time yet a little longer—let this
                  flickering lamp of life burn but the three score years and ten allotted to him—why
                  is it that thou art sworn to be his enemy? sworn to reduce his feeble clan to a
                  mere representative of his former greatness and prosperity; sworn to plunge thy
                  deadly shaft into the vitals of the innocent, and to withdraw it therefrom, and
                  wield it in the air with a smile of exaltation and triumph, while it is yet
                  reeking in the warm heart's blood.
               The pestilence! the pestilence! Who that has a knowledge of it, can speak of it
                  without a chill of horror creeping over his feeble tenement? If there are any such
                  persons in the world, their hearts must be like the adamant, which can not soften;
                  they must have the courage of a martyr, and the strength of a Hercules; but with
                  all these unnatural accomplishments, they are unable to combat the fearful
                  monster, when he pleases.
               
               Solum did not get started on his expedition to the lake quite as early as he
                  anticipated, in consequence of having overslept himself. When he rose the sun was
                  above the horizon higher than Solum was desirous of having it when he started on
                  his fishing expedition; but finally he came to the conclusion to postpone the
                  expedition until the ensuing morning.
               Solum was very sorry that he had overslept himself, and thus deprived himself of
                  his anticipated pleasure, for the day at least; but he resolved to make up, or,
                  rather, redeem a portion of enjoyment, by visiting his lady love Lelia.
               Solum stored away his tackles for the day, and went to pay a visit to Lelia. He
                  found her alone, enjoying herself at plain sewing—a favorite employment of
                  hers.
               "O, how do you do, Solum? I thought you intended to visit the lake to-day," said
                  Lelia, looking rather surprised.
               "I am very well, I thank you. I am almost ashamed to tell you the reason why I did
                  not go to the lake to-day."
               "No, you must not be afraid; I shall not divulge the secret to any person."
               "I thank you, Miss Lelia. I am well aware that you would not; but it is not a
                  secret. To tell the plain truth, I only overslept myself a little."
               "Why, Solum, I always thought that you was a model for early rising; but I guess I
                  shall be rather more careful to what conclusions I come in the future," said
                  Lelia, rather mischievously.
               "Now, Lelia, ain't you a little too severe this morning? I am sorry I told you my
                  misfortune." This Solum said with the intention that he might ascertain what was
                  her real meaning; for it is plainly to be seen, by the character of his answer,
                  that he did not know whether to take her assertion in earnest, or merely as a
                  jest.
               "Solum, what is the matter with you this morning? Why, you can not take a joke at
                  all."
               "Pardon me, Lelia. I am sorry that I gave you to understand so. I must confess I
                  feel rather irritable to-day; but I hope sincerely that you will not take
                  offence."
               "O, no, no danger whatever. I am sure, if I had been disappointed as you have been
                  to-day, I would have been much more irritable."
               "Lelia, I admire your candor. You are frank to acknowledge your shortcoming. That has long been my failing, and, by that, I
                  have often submitted myself to ridicule."
               "How can that be, Solum?"
               "Ain't you, aware, Lelia, that the mass of the people in town are opposed to my
                  course of life?"
               "Certainly I am; but I did not think that you had reference to that," said Lelia
                  thoughtfully.
               "Lelia, I presume it would be an improvement to our entertainment if we should
                  waive the subject, provided we take up a better one."
               "O, yes," said Lelia, "I had almost forgotten to tell you my dream which I dreamed
                  last night, I was determined to tell you all about it, the next time I had an
                  opportunity. I presume no better one could be than the present."
               "O, no! tell me all about it, at this most favorable of all opportunities. I hope
                  that it will be something good—something whose associations are connected with my
                  trip to the lake to-morrow.
               "Why, Solum, you almost guessed my dream. I shall begin to think that you are
                  something of an astrologist."
               "O, no, Lelia, I do not profess to be an astrologist gist, or anything allied to
                  that science, but I thought it was something, concerning that 'expedition,' merely
                  from our previous conversation. A person is liable to dream of what lies upon the
                  mind—any subject that has been recently agitated. But, please tell me your dream,
                  Lelia, won't you."
               "Certainly, my— O, Solum! how near I came to make an irreparable blunder," said
                  Lelia, about half frightened.
               "How, Lelia? I did not take notice."
               "You didn't; but I hope that you will pardon me, for I wasn't thinking who I was
                  conversing with."
               "Never mind, Lelia; banish some of your extreme delicacy, I shall excuse you with
                  pleasure; you need not fear that I shall communicate it to any one else."
               "Well trusting to your honor, I will tell you. When you asked me to tell my dream,
                  I came near answering you by saying, 'certainly, my dear.' I don't know what
                  possessed me to think of saying so, but I hope that you will pardon my
                  mistake."
               "Yes ma'am, ten thousand pardons! but I do not think that it would have been out of place, for I am certain that it would
                  have been reciprocated; but as it is, I am afraid that reciprocation would meet
                  the cold shoulder of disappointment. Don't you think so, Lelia?"
               "'Tis a delicate subject for conversation, I think. It is well that we are alone;
                  but, however, I must answer your interrogation."
               "O, no, Lelia, not without you choose. I think the question was rather too
                  pointed," said Solum, with a look of embarrassment.
               "Solum, in answering your interrogation, I would take the liberty to confess that
                  I would reciprocate your feeling under circumstances whose characters are similar
                  to the one now existing." This Lelia said with much embarrassment; for her tender
                  heart seemed to palpitate almost in her throat.
               "O, Lelia! Lelia! do I truly understand the import of your last remark, or am I
                  flattering myself with the vague idea of your love to me? O, that I
                  could know! I fear to ask for a repetition, for fear that a 'cruel denial' will be
                  meted out for me, as a merited reward for my rashness—my insolence."
               "O, no, Solum; with full assurance of your good faith, I repeat, in other words,
                  that your affections are fully reciprocated."
               "Then may I appropriately call you dearest Lelia. Now do I feel happy. Although in
                  our tender years this avowal is made, yet may it prove no less permanent. Let us
                  seal our affection by truly the "first kiss." May our love and affection prove as
                  true and permanent as time itself. But, dear Lelia, now about that dream."
               "Oh! I almost forgot. Well, I dreamed that, according to your solicitations, I
                  obtained permission of my parents to go to the lake, and in the morning we started
                  together, happy in the anticipations of the pleasure of the day's expedition. I
                  thought that the lake was one of the most beautiful sheets of water that I had
                  ever witnessed. Again, I thought that we got into a small boat together. The boat
                  resembled the nautilus, (of the genus Cephalopodous Mollusca) and it moved off
                  immediately, shifting its tiny sails with the dexterity of a sailor; but no hand
                  seemed to control the boat; it seemed to follow our inclinations as accurately as
                  if controlled by natural dictations. The scenery surrounding the lake seemed more
                     celestial than terrestrial; but such
                  is often the character of a dream—every thing looking more vague and unnatural
                  than otherwise—and that is one of my most prominent reasons for not revealing many
                  of my nocturnal visions."
               "Lelia, your dream was quite beautiful; but I am sorry that you are prohibited
                  from realizing it: but I don't know; a dream so unnatural as a moiety of yours
                  was, would not be too well calculated to benefit us much in the end."
               "Dear Solum, those are precisely my ideas on the subject; I never had any
                  inclination to witness anything metaphysical or supernatural, for I think in the
                  aggregate, they are vastly more injurious than otherwise."
               "Lelia, I must break off rather abruptly from our interesting conversation; just
                  look what time of day it is already; I must confess that I never knew time to pass
                  away so rapidly."
               "Well Solum, if you must go, I hope that you will not neglect to continue your
                  visits, for as far as I can learn, there is no obstacle in the way without it
                  exists in your own mind."
               "I thank you very much Lelia, for your kindness, and you may rest assured that no
                  obstacle is harbored bored in my bosom; so good bye, I hope to see you soon;" with
                  that they parted. But I am sorry to narrate, that that interesting conversation
                  was never renewed on earth, as you will perceive in the progress of this
                  chapter.
               When evening came, Solum retired early, thinking by that means he might be enabled
                  to rise earlier than he did on the previous morning.
               Solum had accomplished his desires, by rising in good season, and when he had
                  collected his tackles together, laid in his store of provisions for the day, he
                  told his parents not to be alarmed about him, if he should not return in good
                  season, for he determined to devote as much of the day to pleasure and enjoyment,
                  as possible.
               When he had reached the lake, the sun was beginning to peep over the gigantic
                  mountains, and looking down upon the beautiful lake with a smiling aspect, making
                  nature and all its associations, appear unusually animated and interesting; the
                  trout seemed as if they had been fasting ever since Solum's last visit to the
                  lake; such was their eagerness to seize the tempting "grub." Solum fished all day
                  long, and had collected a great many fish with his unerring hook; he had a large
                     vessel with him, into which he had
                  collected his luxury but when evening was come, he put up his tackles, and took a
                  stroll into the forest, to visit his long accustomed seat; it was a fallen
                  hemlock, which lay but a short distance from the lake it was clad in a garb of
                  moss, which had been accumulating for a series of years, making it look verdant
                  and animated, like the surrounding forest trees, although it lay a prostrated
                  specimen.
               It was a favorite resort of Solum, when desirous of meditation. It was a calm and
                  beautiful evening that he sat upon his accustomed seat, I may say, for the last
                  time. The glorious sun was sinking fast beneath the western horizon. Solum watched
                  his last glimmering rays of light, as they sank into the glaring twilight. There
                  he sat, still, watching the fading twilight, as it seemed to disappear by being
                  absorbed by the approaching darkness. While thus contemplating the play of one of
                  nature's dramas, an object attracted his attention in the rear. It was the pale
                  face of the mistress of the night, just emerging from her obscure retreat, to
                  illumine the, scene of darkness that was then overspreading that portion of the
                  terraqueous globe. She began to shed her silvery rays in such rich profusion, as
                  to attempt to rival the luminary just sunk beneath the horizon. The winds began to
                  raise their melancholy cadences, as if to welcome he moon to her nocturnal duties.
                  The listless zephyr seemed to lose her wanted silence, and strike up a dirge too
                  mournful to hear, as if to tell a tale of sorrow and, desolation.
               Solum listened to these feeble voices of the breeze, endeavoring to interpret
                  their mysterious teachings—their silent admonitions to learn. Solum loved to
                  listen to the sweet whispering voices of the breeze from hour to hour. He loved to
                  watch the aspen leaves quake, and the towering fir-trees lash to and fro in the
                  angry tempest; but there seemed to be something unusually doleful in the voice of
                  the sighing winds on this occasion. He mistrusted their song. A song—ah!—it was
                  not a cheerful song, but 'twas a dirge—a 
                     melancholly
                     melancholy
                   song—a precursor of a woful sequel.
               Solum thought not of the deadly messenger from—the Satanic empire (as it were)
                  that was wafted on the breeze; he did not think that He who wafted such sweet,
                  refreshing breezes would alike waft a
                  messenger of death to his native village.
               Ah! too true. The pestilence may glide upon every breeze; his footsteps may be in
                  the dark and gloomy hours of midnight, as well as in the brilliant glare of the
                  noon-day sun. He waiteth not for a calling, but cometh out from obscurity, as a
                  hungry lion, whose keen appetite loudly calleth for the blood of the innocent and
                  unwary.
               It began to grow late, and Solum thought that it was time to relinquish his
                  meditations for the present, and repair to his father's cottage, for fear their
                  anxiety for his return might be alarming. Ah! truly, they were alarmed; but not
                  merely for the return of their only son, but at the report that was adrift through
                  town. Some two or three days ago, a few settlers had landed in the town, Oleva,
                  from the "old country." They said that their country was visited by a fearful
                  pestilence that laid all lifeless who became a victim of its poisonous breath.
                  This announcement greatly frightened the Olevans; and, certainly, not without a
                  cause. They became so exasperated that they threatened to destroy the lives of all
                  those who had but recently landed amongst them. But a little reflection taught
                  them otherwise. They came to the righteous conclusion that, if they should commit
                  such a base act, they might not totally exterminate or root out the germ of the
                  appalling disease that was about to develop in their midst; and if they failed in
                  that, their exertions were worse than in vain; for it would heap ignominy upon
                  their irreproachable name—a thing not at all desirable by ambitious humanity.
               Solum, with his parents, retired to their dormitory for the night, with an
                  unusually sorrowful heart.
               Solum's sorrow was not on account of himself; but he feared that the
                  much-talked-of pestilence would break out amongst them, and make his parents its
                  first victims. The longer he thought on the woful subject, the worse it seemed to
                  grow, until, finally, he became so weary that he fell into an apparently
                  undisturbed slumber; but oh! that was not the case; he was shortly awakened,
                  looking somewhat affrighted, as if he had had a visit from a specter or
                  apparition. He had been dreaming—dreaming that his dearly beloved mother lay a
                  lifeless corpse on her couch. He sat up in his bed, wondering whether it was an
                     idle dream or a true revelation. He
                  feared to speak, for he dreaded to hear the echo of his own voice, after having
                  been terrified by such a hideous dream; but he at last summoned up courage enough
                  to call his mother; but oh! how glad he was when he received the sweet response,
                  "What, my son?" Solum did not tell her why he called her, but merely intimated
                  that he was lonesome; but he laid him down again, and they all slept soundly until
                  morning.
               Solum got up in the morning as usual, and dressed himself, for his accustomed
                  morning walk. He thought of the dream he had during the night; it troubled him
                  much indeed. He wished to reveal his vision to his parents, for he was not
                  accustomed to keep anything a secret from them, and deemed it indiscreet, and
                  disrespectful to their better judgment, but he feared that if he should reveal his
                  dream, it would be accompanied with dissatisfactory consequences, so finally he
                  concluded to keep it a secret within his own bosom, and wait the consequences that
                  might ensue.
               After he had returned from his morning walk, his mother told him that one of the
                  neighbors had been in the house since he left, and said that several of the down
                  town folks, were taken severely ill and died, and that many more of them were not
                  expected to survive from one moment to another.
               This awful (I would not say unexpected) news, was to Solum, a severe shock; he
                  thought of that melancholy dream, and how soon it might be realized; he thought of
                  his poor and tender hearted mother, lying a cold and lifeless body at his feet! It
                  almost overwhelmed him, but he strove to bear up, on his mother's account.
               When breakfast was ready, they all sat down together, to eat the last breakfast
                  together on earth; I do not mean to say the last meal; no, I mean the last
                  breakfast.
               Neither of their appetites were as keen as usual, on account of the much dreaded
                  pestilence in town. But ah! if the veil of obscurity could have been withdrawn at
                  this present moment, whilst they sat together, at the breakfast table, how
                  entirely different would have been their feelings; their feeble appetites would
                  have been exchanged for an entire loathe of food; but in this circumstance, as
                  well as all others of a similar
                  character, it was well that the future remained a dark and gloomy mystery.
               Another neighbor came along, after they had finished breakfast, and said that
                  nearly, or more than one-half of the folks in town, were taken sick, that they
                  lived but a short time after an attack; he also said, that he did not believe that
                  there would be one living person in town, in less than a week; he said that he
                  believed that the rest of the folks in town, ought to flee for their lives, and
                  not remain there to become a victim of the dire pestilence.
               This last news from their neighbor, made them all feel worse than ever. That
                  heart-rending news began to bear upon the mind of Solum's mother; she began to
                  look unusually pale and languid; she looked as if the dreaded monster had begun to
                  prey upon her vitals. She did not feel entirely well, nor did she feel unwell; but
                  it was evident, from her personal appearance, that fear was the sole cause of her
                  distress. She was not to be wondered at. Who would not do likewise, especially
                  when he or she, hears of the sword of desolation, that is wielded over head—when
                  they hear of one by one, of their number, dropping into the silent grave. They
                  know not how soon the messenger of death may send them a summons to appear before
                  his bar of terror and dismay.
               The day hung very heavily on Solum; it seemed to pass away with slow and faltering
                  steps. He longed for the approaching night, that he might sleep away his many
                  anxieties and troubles; night came at last, but not to his relief; it came but to
                  enhance his sorrow. He retired early, thinking to drop into a sweet repose,
                  forgetting his troubles and anxieties.
               Poor Solum, he was much mistaken!—he had fallen asleep, but to be disturbed by
                  startling dreams. What seems to be rather an extraordinary circumstance, was the
                  repetition of the same dream or vision, he had on the previous night. He was
                  dreaming as before, of seeing his dear mother lie upon her bed, a cold and
                  lifeless corpse. He called to his mother, as he did on the previous night, but his
                  ears were not greeted with that happy response, "What my son," but all was sad and
                  silent, excepting the faint snoring of his father. He did not like to lie down
                  again to slumber, without knowing to a certainty, whether his dear mother was dead
                  or alive, He sat up in bed trembling with
                  fear—he had no courage to speak again, for he feared to hear the sound of his own
                  voice, in the gloomy darkness of the occasion; he was almost confident, that the
                  vision of death revealed to him, had come to pass. He got up out of bed, but he
                  found that his trembling limbs were scarcely adequate to support his "fear
                  debilitated" body. He attempted to approach the bedside of his dear parents, with
                  his heart palpitating in his throat, apparently. Again he came to a dead stand,
                  shrinking back from the ice-cold "touch," that was to reveal to him the reality of
                  his dream. He seemed to have a desire to linger in suspense, that he might not
                  know the dire reality—the sad and mournful spectacle which lay before him,
                  enshrouded in the gloomy darkness of midnight.
               Solum at last put forth his hand to feel, what! why the death-cold touch of his
                  ever affectionate mother's face. She had ceased to live—the fatal plague had
                  stolen into her chamber of repose, and had plunged his fatal shaft into her
                  vitals, and chased away that lovely spirit (that used to dwell there) to the land
                  of its kindred spirits. When Solum had felt her death cold face, he was shocked
                  more than ever; but still his mind was partially prepared to ward off the severity
                  of the sorrowful stroke, by his previous visions, which seemed to him, too real to
                  be rejected and disbelieved.
               Solum wished to awaken his father, but he feared the clouds of sorrow that lowered
                  in stupendous columns over them. He turned his eyes toward the windows, when he
                  saw that day-light was beginning to dawn—that the glaring twilight began to shed
                  its faint light in the room.
               He called to his father two or three times ere he responded; when he answered,
                  "What is it, my son?" Solum answered his father by words of untold sorrow-sobbing
                  so loud that his father was unable to understand him. "Will you please to tell me
                  again, Solum?" said his father. "What makes you sob and cry?" Solum answered this
                  interrogation of his father in a low and heartfelt tone indicating the mighty
                  warfare in his heart, which strove to keep unrevealed the awful reality of his
                  mother's death; but at last he gave utterance to the word "mother," when his
                  father learned by experience the remnant of the untold tale.
               
               "Good heavens!" he exclaimed, "what shall I do. The partner of my happiness and
                  sorrow has fled; her noble spirit is gone! My dear Solum—my only child—what is
                  left for us to do? Your dear mother is no more, and how soon we may be in a
                  similar predicament God only knows."
               "Dear father, since the nearest and dearest relative on earth has left us, why
                  need we tarry here any longer, and expose ourselves to the mighty pestilence? Let
                  us flee from the impending danger, while there is strength remaining."
               "But, my son, what will we do with the remains of your dear mother?"
               "Let us bury it in the garden, for that is all that is incumbent upon us, to have
                  the remains of our departed relative decently interred."
               After the morning had fully dawned, Solum's father went out to get some one of the
                  neighbors to act in the capacity of an undertaker; but he was greatly astonished
                  to find no one in the streets. All was silent, as if hushed in the still repose of
                  midnight slumber. No one responded to his calls, which frightened him more and
                  more. He at last gave up the idea of finding living humanity in town—thinking that
                  he and his son might be the only specimens remaining.
               He returned to communicate his sad experience to his son. Solum was greatly
                  astonished to hear that no one had survived the pestilence but he and his father.
                  He thought of his dear Lelia, and wondered if she had become a victim to the
                  pestilence along with her neighbors. He resolved to ascertain. As he was about to
                  go to search for his lady love Lelia, his father said to him, "Solum, will you
                  leave me alone?" "No, dear father," said Solum affectionately, "I wish you to
                  accompany me to one of the neighbors, if you please, for I am very anxious to
                  know."
               "Know what, my son?"
               The emotions of Solum's heart can be easily imagined, but not experienced ad libitum. He was afraid to say that he wished to
                  know whether Lelia was alive or not, because his father was not aware of their
                  attachment, for the affair was but too recently transacted for his father to have
                  a knowledge or detail of the proceedings.
               Solum's father did not repeat the interrogation, but accompanied his son,
                  expecting to ascertain, by experience, the place he (Solum) intended to visit. Solum entered the house, and the
                  first thing that met his gaze was the lifeless remains of his dear Lelia. O, that
                  moment! that mournful moment! that moment in which Solum's sorrowing eyes just met
                  the lifeless, marble-like body of his much beloved Lelia! Who would wish to
                  remember it? Who would wish to retain it, as something sacred, on the tablet of
                  his memory? No one, I trust. Let it sink into the dark and obscure retreats of
                  oblivion; let eternal forgetfulness lay hold on that awful moment, and discard it
                  from existence! for its associations are sorrow and despair, neither of which are
                  desirable companions.
               Solum's father witnessed the emotions or feeling that he (Solum) portrayed when he
                  saw the dead body of Lelia. He asked him why he felt more sorrowful for her than
                  for any of her neighbors, Solum was frank, and told his father all about his late
                  engagement, together with all the circumstances connected therewith. His father
                  made no reply; but you may imagine that his thoughts were not those of a
                  pleasurable character.
               Solum, lingered no longer by the corpse of his departed Lelia, knowing that the
                  work of death was completed, and that there was no remedy for the existing
                  circumstances, this side of the endless ocean of eternity. Nothing was now left
                  for him to do, but to flee with his father from the deadly pestilence that had so
                  recently desolated their quiet village.
               Solum and his father set about making preparations to inter their last relative on
                  earth, at least that they knew of. They buried her in the garden, and planted some
                  of the flowers that grew therein over her grave, as a token of regard to her
                  lifeless remains.
               After they had paid the last debt of nature to her whom they held sacred above all
                  living humanity, they next began to make a more thorough search, to ascertain
                  whether the lamp of life had become extinct in each and every dwelling. It was so!
                  every single inhabitant had fallen a victim to the fatal monster—the fell
                  destroyer—death.
               Solum said to his sorrow-stricken father, "Come, let us flee, whilst we have the
                  ability from this pestilential air, ere it overtakes us!"
               They both went back to the cottage, for the last time, to collect such articles as
                  would be likely to be of service to them
                  on their journey. Each one filled his knapsack with provisions and other useful
                  articles. After they had finished laying in their store of provisions, &c.,
                  they came to a stand, considering which way to flee. Solum's father suggested by
                  way of the lake, but Solum's good sense taught him to refute his father's
                  suggestion, on account of the unhealthy effluvia which naturally arise from low
                  ground, and said, the only sure way to escape the infected air, was to flee the
                  upland route, by way of Mount Aleova. Finally they both concluded to ascend the
                  mountain.
               The mountain of Aleova lay towards the northwest. It was a beautiful mountain
                  indeed, but a more precise description of it will be detailed hereafter. Solum and
                  his father still continued to clamber up the rugged side of Aleova, with untiring
                  vigilance; anon they struggle through thickets and underbush; then over craggy
                  rocks; until their intense thirst compelled them to relinquish their ardor to
                  ascend, and go in search for a brook where they might slake their intense thirst.
                  They halted for the first time, to listen if, possibly, they might hear the
                  distant murmurings of a merry brook. Whilst they stood listening, no one seemed to
                  dare break the wonted silence. They thought they could hear the distant music of
                  water playing over beds of rocks and stones; but it was only imagination. No water
                  was near to quench their craving thirst. The father could stand it no longer; he
                  said that he must die ere that wanted liquid could be obtained. His lips began to
                  turn pale and death-like. Solum thought of the plague, and knew it was that that
                  was the cause of such intense thirst.
               The father laid himself down, as he said, upon the leaves to die. "Dear Solum,"
                  said he, "I must leave you all alone to tread your weary journey. The plague—that
                  dire plague—is fast taking hold of my vitals. I feel that the struggle will soon
                  be over. When I am dead, leave me, and pursue your journey with unabated energy.
                  Look not back upon your once-trodden pathway, lest the unwelcome messenger of
                  death overtake you."
               "Father," said Solum, "If you die here, might I not as well remain with you, yes,
                  and die by your side; for what is my life to me, after you are taken from me? If I
                  continue on in my journey, I am liable
                  every moment to become a victim to the dreadful plague; for we all inhaled its
                  poisonous air into our systems, ere we abandoned Oleva."
               "No, no," said his father, "you must not do so. You must obey my dying injunction.
                  You are not at all likely to become a subject of the pestilence; for your habit of
                  life has been so entirely different from the mass of your fellow-men, as to render
                  you almost, I would say, exempt from its sad influences. You have cherished the
                  pure, unsophisticated air of morning, whilst we and our neighbors were slumbering
                  in our dormitories You appear to be in the midst of health, beauty and vigor of
                  life. You must not think that because I fall a victim to the destructive
                  pestilence on this lonely mount, that you will; because I felt the hand of death
                  preying upon me ere we left our native town; but I did not wish to communicate the
                  sorrowful fact to you, for fear that you would become so disheartened as to cause
                  you to linger in the pestilentious atmosphere that surrounded Oleva, and thus fall
                  a victim to its deleterious influence. Pursue your journey, my son, and may kind
                  Providence befriend you, smile upon your lonely pathway, and bring you in safety
                  to whatever portion of this earth it should be your lot to be cast upon. There is
                  a blessing in store for you, although it lies enshrouded in a dark and gloomy
                  mystery, only to be revealed by the lapse of time." As he said these last words,
                  he felt his strength give way. He sank upon the lap of his son Solum, gasping for
                  that sweet breath that had so long supported his earthly tenement. Solum saw that
                  the work of death was almost accomplished. He bowed his head to listen whether the
                  fainting heart of his father had ceased to palpitate. Ah! it had—ceased forever! A
                  chill of horror passed over Solum's body, when he heard the last life-stroke of
                  his father's heart. Poor Solum! son of affliction! thou art bereaved of thy last
                  relative on earth, at least to thy knowledge. What a gloomy future lies hidden
                  from thy observation!
               There sat Solum, beside the lifeless remains of his dear father. Reader, what a
                  picture of sorrow and depression must Solum have been at that critical moment. Was
                  it not enough to call forth your tears of sympathy for that poor bereaved orphan,
                  who was left alone in the world, without
                  a home, a friend, or without the knowledge of the whereabouts of living humanity.
                  Solum came to the just conclusion that it was useless for him to remain any longer
                  with the corpse of his father, as he could do him no further good; but he did not
                  wish to abandon it to the mercy of the roving wild beasts that inhabited proud
                  Aleova's towering heights.
               He came to the conclusion that it was best for him to build massive boulders
                  around the corpse and thus leave it. After he had paid the last debt of duty to
                  his departed parent, he resumed his journey, but very reluctantly. He thought of
                  his father's dying blessing, which he had so freely bestowed upon him in his dying
                  hour. It acted as an impetus to his onward flight; he thought of the future and
                  how his father's blessing might be realized; ten thousand different phantoms
                  arrayed themselves before his imagination, each exhibiting a different aspect; but
                  again, he thought that if his pathway continued to be one vast field of woodland,
                  how could he expect to see a manifestation or realization of his father's
                  blessing; however, he endeavored to banish such idle imaginations from his mind,
                  at leapt for the present, for it was not at all likely that he should realize
                  anything short of the elapse of time, and that measured by the rolling by of many
                  years.
               Solum shouldered his knapsack, together with his father's, and commenced his
                  journey with vigor, for fear the day might pass away without procuring him a
                  shelter for the night. He traveled onward pretty steadily till towards the
                  meridian of the day, when he became hungry. No sound of the merry babbling of a
                  rill or brook saluted his anxious ears. He did not wish to dine without having
                  some of nature's cool, refreshing liquid to slake his craving thirst, for he knew
                  that eating only aggravated the difficulty instead of remedying it. He listens.
                  What does he hear? Ah! joy is depicted upon his careworn countenance. He hears the
                  sweet music of a merry rill as it meanders down Aleova's steep declivities, into
                  the valley below. He hesitates no longer, but onward rushes, as if with phrenzy,
                  to reach the long looked for stream. He could scarcely wait until he had reached
                  its mossy banks ere he bowed to quaff its limpid waters. The thought occurred to
                  me while Solum was slaking his thirst, that he was not like the fabled youth, Narkissos, who when he saw the
                  image of his beauty reflected from the mirror of water beneath, as he drank
                  therefrom, he became so enamored with it as to cause immediate death, and it was
                  said that his body was transformed into a plant which bears the same name, the
                  language of which is "selfishness," a very appropriate interpretation. The history
                  of Solum, or rather his exemplifications, were better calculated to teach morality
                  in history, than those of the selfish youth Narkissos related in mythology; but I
                  am afraid that this subject may be an intrusion upon the narrative.
               Solum was glad to sit down upon the bank of the brook, to rest his weary limbs
                  after the struggles and turmoils of the way, for, as I intimated in a previous
                  chapter, that his burden became two-fold after the death of his father, having an
                  extra knapsack, &c., to carry.
               When he commenced to open his knapsack to get out some provision, his sorrow
                  returned with renewed energy. He thought of his dear affectionate mother, whose
                  gentle hands had made and fashioned the biscuits that were before him; he thought
                  of the many sweet hours he used to spend with her in the garden. But alas! those
                  happy days were over, they had fled to give place to others of a different
                  character—days of melancholy and solitude in a lonely hermitage.
               After Solum had partaken of his hasty meal, he addressed himself for the pursuance
                  of his journey. He determined to banish from his mind all sorrow and sadness, and
                  think of the future, for he began to find that sorrow was preying too largely upon
                  his thought to fit him for future usefulness and prosperity. Sorrow when long
                  cherished, will cause the blooming cheeks of youth to fade, the once ruddy
                  countenance to vanish into the pallor of disease, yes, and even death. It causes
                  the bright and sparkling eye that bespeaks joy and mirthfulness, to lose its lucid
                  glare, and assume the dull and inanimate look of misfortune; it causes the once
                  vigorous and healthy system of man to dwindle down to nothing short of a querulous
                  invalid. Then cease O mortality to weep! drive away thy sorrow and live, do not
                  curtail the many happy days of pleasure allotted to you. Why will you go down to
                  the chambers of the tomb by such a depression? Shake off the dire aggrievances and
                  be free, sing the sweet carols of
                  pleasure whilst the bright sunshine of prosperity illumines your pathway. Why will
                  you suffer the dark clouds of sorrow and depression to lower around your head
                  whilst nature and nature's God bids you look up and be cheerful.
               Solum, as he journeyed onwards, saw vestiges, of the wild beast that roamed at
                  pleasure through the dark forest of Aleova. He began to have fears (although he
                  had escaped the dire plague) that he would become a prey to their ravenous
                  appetites, but still he was pretty well buoyed up by Hope, that sweet companion of
                  solitude and misfortune.
               Solum had now gained the summit of Mount Aleova, his toilings and scramblings were
                  over at last. The top of the mountain was level for more than half a mile, which
                  made the prospect rather obscure, consequently he was unable to see into the
                  valley below, on account of the dense and sombre forest that surrounded him.
               When he came to a place where he could look down into the deep valley beneath, he
                  was greatly disappointed. He expected to see the habitations of living humanity,
                  but instead of that nothing met his anxious gaze but one vast ocean of woodland,
                  (if I may use the expression,) spreading out for miles in the distance, a scenery
                  which he thought his eyes had feasted on long enough. He looked this way and then
                  that way, if perchance he might get a glimpse of the blue curling smoke that
                  bespeaks a lonely cottage, but 'twas all in vain. Again he listened, perhaps he
                  might hear the loud thwack of the busy wood-chopper's axe, but alas! all was
                  hushed in repose, no sound was heard but the merry chirping of the little
                  chick-a-dee-dee upon the boughs of the shaggy pines. He traveled onwards near a
                  quarter of a mile, and again resumed his listening attitude, when he thought that
                  he heard the tinkling of a bell, that bespeaks the grazing herd, but it proved to
                  be the ringing of his imagination.
               Solum at last saw a valley or opening in the forest that seemed to allure his eye.
                  He made up his mind to reach that beautiful spot ere the sun had sank beneath the
                  horizon.
               Aleova was more easily descended than ascended; consequently Solum was enabled to
                  reach the desired spot before the sun had concealed his glaring countenance for
                  the day. When he had reached that little forest-girt valley, he commenced to devise a plan by which he might
                  ward off the ravenous wild beasts. He knew that he had no time to erect a shanty
                  or cabin ere he would be enveloped in the darkness of night; but he at last
                  thought of a plan that proved 
                     sucessful
                     successful
                  , and that was to collect together some rich pine knots, and kindle a
                  fire, for he had learned from his father that wild animals would not approach
                  fire. After he had kindled a brisk fire, he went to work to arrange a hammock or
                  couch whereon he might rest after the turmoils of the day. It was constructed of
                  layers of branches of the hemlock or spruce, which he had cut down from the
                  numerous trees that grew near by. When finished, it looked rather tempting;
                  especially to Solum, after having passed. through so many scenes of sorrow and
                  difficulty.
               After he had partaken of his evening repast, he laid down upon his novel hammock,
                  and soon fell into a gentle slumber, no less refreshing than if he had lain on the
                  downy bed of more civilized life. Solum slept soundly until the rising sun awoke
                  him from his transient lethargy.
               When breakfast was over, and other arrangements ments consummated, Solum set about
                  erecting a hermitage; as he had concluded to remain in that beautiful spot, at
                  least for the time being; but the progress of the erection of that grotesque
                  building, will be accurately detailed in the ensuing chapter, to which I would beg
                  to turn your attention.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               A DESCRIPTION OF THE VALLEY.—THE HERMITAGE.
               The little valley to which Solum directed his attention, or, rather, steps, was
                  beautiful beyond description. When it was yet in the distance, it allured his
                  anxious eye, like the flickering Will o' the Wisp (Ignis Fatuus) does the weary
                  traveler who has lost his way through deserts and swamps.
               Literally, the spot which Solum had chosen for the site of the hermitage, could
                  not be called a valley, for it was merely an opening in the forest, where the
                  trees and underbush grew more thinly. The whole amount of shrubbery, &c., that
                  grew in this tiny valley, might be removed with but little difficulty, when it
                  would be free from any obstacles, excepting the massive boulders which but thinly
                  covered the selected spot.
               It was something singular and unaccountable why the gigantic forest trees did not
                  venture to grow themselves upon that lonely spot, whilst they grew to an enormous
                  height in either direction. It might have been the abode of some wanderer at an
                  early day, who had cleared away the timber, and that the lapse of time had not
                  been sufficient to allow the shrubbery to assume the gigantic attitude of the
                  "old, majestic oak"—the lord of the forest-trees.
               In the midst of this valley lay a stupendous boulder, elevated some eight or ten
                  feet from the ground, and it would naturally be hard to obtain its summit; but one
                  side of it was slanting and irregular, forming almost natural steps. Upon this
                  natural platform sat Solum for a while, viewing the surrounding prospect. It was a
                  beautiful prospect, too; not to be excelled anywhere. From that eminence, you
                  might direct your eyes towards the south and west, and there behold the towering
                  heights of proud Aleova, reaching to such a lofty pitch as seemingly to kiss the
                  silvery clouds that lowered in gorgeous columns over it. These Alpine heights were
                  eternally clad in verdure of the deepest dye. It was covered with the fir, pine,
                  hemlock, or spruce, and cedar, whose
                  foliage is, seemingly unchangeable as the deep blue canopy. The most stately of
                  these lordly eminences was the fir-tree; its lofty heights were far above the
                  surrounding forest-trees, lashing to and fro in the breeze, as if swaying the
                  sceptre like a despotic potentate, over all beneath. But canon the raging storm
                  comes with unimpeded fury, and dashes headlong many of these proud potentates of
                  the forest, to the ground, there to lie, as silent relics of their former
                  greatness; there to shed their princely verdure to the proud monarch of decay, for
                  the humble garb or habiliment of verdant moss.
               I sincerity hope, that my reader will pardon me for directing his or her attention
                  to the striking allegory which appears in my translation of this traditionary
                  narrative. I have just been treating of the lordly fir tree and its
                  characteristics, but I now turn your attention, to a similar picture, in every day
                  life. You see the proud and arrogant man, like the "lordly fir," swaying the
                  sceptre of depression, and slavery, over all who are beneath his dignity, by
                  poverty and indigence; till by and by, the furious storms of adversity, sweep:
                  like a mighty besom over him, when he is prostrated trated, like the stately fir
                  tree, there to welter in poverty of the most degrading character.
               When the fir tree falls, it is soon divested of its verdant robes; so is it with
                  the ostentatious rich man—after lie loses his wealth, he loses his gorgeous robes,
                  which he used to wear in prosperity. But there is another striking feature in the
                  allegory, to which, I have not alluded to yet, and that is, when a stately fir
                  tree is prostrated by a howling tempest, it soon loses its verdant foliage; but by
                  and by, it seems to rebel against the decrees of decomposition, by assuming a new
                  garb, whose verdure is but little inferior to the one previously worn; this
                  verdant garb is known by the "vernacular" name of moss or lichen. This is so with
                  the arrogant wealthy man; after he is prostrated from his dignified position, by
                  adversity, he is not able to retain his gorgeous apparel, but like the prostrated
                  tree, if unable by the thraldom of poverty, to wear the genuine habiliment, he
                  will take measures to procure an imitation, always striving to keep up
                  appearance.
               After Solum had viewed these lofty heights to his satisfaction, he then reversed
                  his position, turning his face towards the north and east. In this direction the country was level, as far as the
                  eye could reach, but covered over thickly with timber. It was evident, merely from
                  observation, that the country in this direction might be inhabited by mankind, but
                  it was without the range of human perspective; therefore, Solum made up his mind
                  to rear a hermitage, without any further search for the whereabouts of his fellow
                  being.
               Solum now sat about selecting a site where he might erect the hermitage. There
                  were several locations that seemed to offer themselves to Solum for his
                  consideration, but he concluded upon the one nearest the brookside.
               There must have been some natural inducements, held forth to Solum, or else he
                  would not have concluded to remain, in that quiet and lonely valley. Yes, the
                  generous hand of dame nature, held forth many inducements—wild fruit of the most
                  delicious kinds, grew spontaneously, and promising to be in such profusion, as to
                  render animal life supportable, by little exertion on the part of Solum. The most
                  abundant fruits were the wild apple, plums, persimmons, grapes and tomatoes, these
                  with other different kinds, as the melon and potato. The potato is a very valuable
                  root, wherever cultivated for culinary purposes. It is capable of supporting
                  animal life, without any other aliment, for a great length of time. The amount of
                  starch, albumen, and Saccharine principle, is greater than in any other known
                  vegetable tuber. Another inducement not yet spoken of, and that was the "delicious
                  trout," that abounded in the stream that murmured by the hermitage, and the
                  catching of them promised Solum, any amount of solitary amusement, for that was
                  one of his favorite employments from a mere child; these with many other
                  inducements, useless to mention, were held forth to Solum, as an incitement or
                  incentive to his present proceedings.
               When the sun had approached near the meridian, Solum began to think that it was
                  high time for him to commence the construction of the hermitage, or else be
                  exposed to the inclemency of the weather, and the mercy of the wild beasts another
                  night, which he did not fancy, if his exertions could prevent.
               Solum had firmly come to the conclusion, that he would spend the remainder of his
                  life, in a hermit's hovel, at least that was the dictation of his mind at this important crisis, but what would
                  be his determination in after life, I mean after he had experienced years at the
                  hermitage, he was unable to suggest, but that part of life's drama, did not give
                  his naturally quiet mind much uneasiness.
               The loud thwack of Solum's busy axe might now be heard, reverberating through the
                  wild forest, awakening the long silent echoes of these lonely regions, as he
                  felled the wanted timber.
               Solum had now to exercise his ingenuity, in the capacity of an architect; he had
                  but little knowledge of the use of edged tools, for he had spent a great part of
                  minor period, in rambling through the forest studying the recondite lesson of
                  nature, and in fishing in the brook and lake; but however, he had a mind that was
                  well calculated to bear him through difficulties, seemingly almost
                  insurmountable.
               After he had felled a sufficient number of trees to erect a cottage, he commenced
                  its construction. The timber was dragged to the place, and cut into sticks of such
                  length as Solum desired, and built them one above another, in the "old cabin
                  style" known to all early settlers and wood-choppers. The roof was made, by laying
                  small poles parallel to each other so that they partly excluded the rays of light;
                  and on these poles were thrown dead leaves, which lay profusely all around, until
                  the light was entirely excluded, when a layer of earth "capped the climax"; which
                  in time, had grown over with grass and other herbage.
               After the hermitage was completed, it looked rather cozy, well adapted to meet
                  Solum's wishes on the present occasion.
               Solum intended to spare no pains in the future to make his lonely cottage a second
                  rate paradise. He intended to fence in a large portion of ground and devote it to
                  the cultivation of culinary vegetables and flowers. This tract of ground lay in
                  front of the hermitage, where it was best calculated to add beauty to the
                  scenery.
               Solum was ever fond of horticulture and used to assist his mother in that pleasing
                  duty, especially that department devoted to the rearing of flowers. When Solum had
                  finished the building of the hermitage and completed the plan of his garden, he
                  set about collecting wild flowers for his garden, as my reader is well aware that
                  Solum could not procure domestic ones. The surrounding ing forest abounded plentifully in wild flowers, of
                  the most beautiful and gaudy appearance. Many of the flowers in his mother's
                  garden were originally wild, and collected in his rambles through the forest.
               Solum was what you might term a natural florist. He had no means whereby he could
                  study the science successfully, but he managed to make himself pretty generally
                  acquainted with the traits and instincts of the vegetable kingdom.
               As I intimated before the site of the hermitage was where the wood grew more
                  thinly, where the Alpine ranges could be seen extending their lofty summits,
                  running parallel to the tiny valley containing the lonely hermitage, south and
                  west. These gigantic mountains, which stood as colossal monuments against the
                  corroding hand of time, presented a verdant scenery of the most picturesque
                  character a tableau of which, as the novelist would say, "could be more easily
                  imagined than delineated." Among their shaggy cliffs abounded many wild and
                  ferocious animals, such as the bear, panther, wolf and catamount, which might be
                  seen prowling about, almost any hour of the day. If Solum had been naturally of a
                  timid disposition position, he would have had abundant opportunities to exercise
                  that passion; but, as kind fortune would have it, he had courage enough, with his
                  unerring rifle to meet the savage denizens of the forest on any occasion; be
                  seldom failed to prostrate one of their number at each and every report of his
                  trusty weapon. Yes, Solum and his deadly weapon became a terror to the whole
                  undomesticated clan of wild beasts the fled from the sharp crack of his rifle,
                  like the jackals, that are said to flee from the ominous prognostications of a
                  volcano.
               Solum, used to spend a great portion of his time among the shady declivities of
                  Mount Aleova. He saw many things there to protract his stay, objects ever pleasing
                  to his philosophical eye. Many wild flowers grew there, and amongst the most
                  beautiful were the azalia, lupinus, pisum and trillium these with many others
                  useless to mention. Some of the cryptogamic class of plants grew near the foot of
                  Aleova, especially near the umbrage of the spruces and along the banks of the
                  brook. The names of some of them were the polypody, brake, maiden hair, and the
                  numerous mosses. All these, together with the minor works of nature, contributed to interest
                  Solum in his rambles along the mountains and through the sombre forest.
               As I said before that towards the north and east, the dense forest seemed to
                  extend as far as the eye could reach, sinking gradually into an unknown obscurity
                  of the prospective. In that direction, humanity might be reveling in all the
                  pleasures of life, but of that fact Solum. was entirely ignorant, nor did that
                  subject often trouble his mind, for it was fully made up to test the solitary
                  enjoyment of a hermitage, of which he had read so often in his younger days.
               'Tis strange how humanity could consent to shut himself, as it were, from the eyes
                  of the world and live in a lonely hermitage, as contented as if dwelling in
                  magnificent mansion in a populous town or city, but as the post says: 
                     
                        "How use doth breed a habit in a man.
                        This shadowy desert, unfrequented wood,
                        I better brook than flourishing, peopled towns;
                        Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
                        And to the nightingale's complaining notes
                        Tune my distresses and record my woes."
                     
                  
               
               Solum had been so busily engaged for the last week, that he had not taken a
                  moment's reflection either on the past or future; but he had now got pretty near
                  through, or, had nearly accomplished the hardest of his labor; therefore, he
                  thought that he could take, a seat by the brook, and reflect somewhat on the drama
                  of life that had just been played, or that which was about to offer itself for the
                  stage, of action. His thoughts were first directed to the memory of his dear
                  departed Lelia, his now angel intended. He thought of the many hours of pleasure
                  he had consumed in her interesting company; he thought of the "first kiss" that
                  was the seal uniting their youthful affections; he thought how happy he would now
                  be, if the destructive pestilence had but spared the object of his affection, in
                  fulfilling his deadly errand; but of that melancholy subject his heart had learned
                  to repulse, knowing that its existence only consisted in what it might have
                  been—not in the possibility of its consummation. In this meditative attitude,
                  Solum whiled away many lonely hours. He often felt happy, even, in those lonely
                  confines that the God of nature had so bountifully provided for his daily wants,
                  giving him a contented mind, proverbial of being "a continual feast"—a thing ever desirable, more especially to a
                  solitary hermit.
               The first year of Solum's stay at the Aleovan Hermitage, was principally devoted
                  to the decoration of the foreground, including the garden. When he had cut away
                  all the dense shrubbery and underbrush, the few massive boulders lay exposed
                  unsatisfactorily; but he managed to remove them, by piece-meal, to a place more
                  appropriate for such inexorable personages, at least according to the judgment of
                  Solum.
               Solum had to resort to the forest surrounding for ornamental shade-trees, (of
                  which it possessed a redundant supply) to plant about his hermitage. But I must
                  not forget to mention that the first duty he performed was to plant his bed of
                  potatoes—for they were the main staff of life. He planted them early, that they
                  might soon be ready to supply his then scanty table. Many wild, climbing plants
                  grew near the hermitage, of which a pretty fair representation might be seen
                  growing up the walls of Solum's cottage, making it look rather interesting and
                  cheerful. Among these were the flowers belonging to the genera Convolvulus
                  volvulus Ipomea, both of which are noted for their beautiful and showy
                  flowers.
               At the termination of Solum's first year at the hermitage, it presented a
                  beautiful and picturesque appearance; vastly paramount to what could have been
                  expected during the lapse of so short a period—evidently portraying the hand of
                  taste and industry in vivid colors. As a reward for his commendable industry, he
                  had the pleasure to witness a happy result in all his undertakings. His bed of
                  potatoes yielded a redundant supply, and the remaining vegetables fell but little
                  short of his fullest calculations.
               As I previously intimated, a beautiful brook murmured closely by the hermitage,
                  whose limpid waters uttered a melancholy dirge as they gurgled by the many
                  moss-capped rocks that stood isolated in, the channel. The clearness of the stream
                  made it look rather interesting and beautiful. The pearl colored pebbles that lay
                  strewed over the bottom of the channel, could be seen distinctly, as well as fish
                  of numerous varieties, sporting about in the watery element with a satisfaction
                  only equaled by the tiny insect that
                  plays in the animating sunbeams of a clear May day.
               When Solum was fatigued after the labors of the day, he used to take a seat on his
                  rustic chair or bench, which stood hard by the brook-side, and listen to the merry
                  babbling of the brook as its crazy waters rushed madly onward to parts unknown.
                  Many were the times that Solum's thoughts were transported across Aleova's proud
                  heights, to that alike purling brook near the little town Oleva, where he often
                  sat with his dear parents and unforgotten Lelia. Many unbidden tears found their
                  way down his youthful cheeks, when he thought on those bygone remembrances or
                  recollections. Sometimes when he thought of those bygone days of pleasure, he
                  would look upon the noisy brook with a frown of contempt, as if to say, "cease thy
                  murmurings and be still, disturb not my fond reflections of the dark and gloomy
                  past—let me think on those sad hours with profound silence!" But ah! this last
                  representation betrays the true character of Solum, he frowned not at the loud
                  murmurings of the little brook; no, it was a frown that introduced itself to the
                  innocent countenance of Solum, when he thought of those unfortunate exiles that
                  brought the deadly pestilence to the home of his childhood; but soon that guilty
                  frown would vanish when he thought of that Almighty Ruler, "who doeth all things
                  well."
               The murmuring of a mountain brook or rill was ever music to Solum; never was there
                  a period in his sorrowful life that its melancholy cadences were too grave, too
                  solemn to court his noble favor; he would always hearken to it with an entire
                  satisfaction known only to the lovers of nature, the philosophical mind.
               As year after year rolled by, Solum still continued to decorate his lonely
                  cottage, and each consecutive year added its share of beauty to the scenery, as it
                  rolled slowly away to be replaced by its subsequent relative; it began to exhibit
                  an aspect known only to those sections of the earth, where the footsteps of
                  morality and civilization hath left a permanent impression. The climbing
                  convolvulus had found its way to the summit of the hovel, with ten thousand
                  different strands and supported by a duplicate of tendrils, holding to the rustic
                  cottage with the firmness of a preying
                  falcon. It was clad every morning with a florid, or rather a variegated garb of
                  pretty flowers, wafting to the listless breeze their sweet aroma in such rich
                  profusion as to impregnate the surrounding atmosphere.
               The tiny shade trees that were planted around the cottage, had grown to such a
                  height that their boughs began to overshadow the hermitage, in compliance
                  satisfactorily to the wishes of the Aleovan hermit. His productive garden yielded
                  a redundant supply of potatoes, beans and tomatoes, with many other culinary
                  vegetables. His garden never suffered for the want of rain or water, for Solum had
                  made a branch from the brook to pass through his garden, which banished the
                  possibility of a drouth.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               IMPROVEMENT OF THE HERMITAGE CONTINUED.—SOLUM BEGINS TO DESIRE
                  SOCIETY.
               It appears, as I continue to consult tradition, that there is a "hiatus" in the
                  history of Solum, while at the Aleovan hermitage; but I am happy to state to my
                  reader, that it will have no tendency to depreciate the character of the
                  narrative; for it must have included but a few years, whose history would have
                  been uninteresting and monotonous, of which we have had or may have a surplus.
               Solum had now been several years at the hermitage, still laboring to improve the
                  scenery all around. His garden was a model for horticulturists and florists; his
                  flower beds were very beautiful, paramount to many of those cultivated by eminent
                  florists. There was a novelty connected
                  nected with his flower garden, peculiarly striking, and that was the entire change
                  of programme, in regard to the names of his plants. He did not cultivate the
                  hydrangeas, snow-balls, roses, japonicas, flowery almond, tulips, white lilies,
                  hyacinths, daffodils, harebells, and many other plants known to civilized
                  countries; but he cultivated flowers of equal beauty and fragrance, among which
                  were the azalia, or wild bush honeysuckle, lupine, esclepius or butterfly weed,
                  the wild pea flower, the false wake robin, the pulmonaria, or lungwort, together
                  with many others, which were successfully cultivated.
               Solum had good and regular habits, although he was secluded as it were, from the
                  scrutinizing eye of humanity; he kept his cottage clean and neat, free from all
                  the rubbish and filth, usually found in cabins and old dilapidated houses; he
                  swept out his little hovel as cleanly as the careful domestic would.
               I presume my reader is ready to ask the question, where did Solum get his broom?
                  Well, he made it, simply by cutting the smaller boughs of the pine, and tied them
                  in small fagots, after which a handle was inserted into it, which makes a capital
                  besom, good enough for any old fastidious bachelor.
               The old adage, "As the twig is bent, the tree is inclined" shows its blessed
                  truths in the character of Solum. "Train up a child in the way it should go, and
                  when it becomes old, it will not depart from it." That is even so; Solum always
                  felt desirous of doing what was right and exemplary, although he was secluded from
                  the meddlesome busybody, as you may perceive, in the progress of the
                  narrative.
               Solum was in the habit of rising early, and taking a walk to enjoy the sweet
                  refreshing air. He used to go forth ere the radiant sun had presented his broad
                  disc above the blue capped horizon; when he could hear the first notes of the
                  warbling feathered tribes. It was pleasure to him, to listen to the loud and
                  musical strains of the chewink, or mountain robin, which first awoke the silent
                  echoes of the tranquil morning. He used to watch the glaring twilight, which
                  preceded the dawning of the day, brighten into the brilliant rays of the radiant
                  sun, when the herald of the morning would cease his enchanting carols, and resume his daily avocations, and Solum
                  imitating the worthy example returns to his cottage, to superintend the order of
                  the day.
               When Solum had returned from his accustomed morning walk, he sat about getting
                  breakfast, which consisted of meat and potatoes, a diet which he felt thankful
                  that he was able to procure; but I must confess that the monotony of the tasteless
                  viands began to excite a loathe or dislike, and not without sufficient reason, for
                  he had long partaken of his meals, without that essential saline ingredient, which
                  animal life ever craves, and the feeble amount that naturally existed in his
                  animal and vegetable aliment, was inadequate to make up the deficiency.
               Solum was fond of his lone and solitary life. He was fond of it, for the same
                  plausible reason, that a fastidious old bachelor loves his lonely room. He loved
                  it, because he had learned to be content with whatever condition or circumstance
                  in life he should be placed in, but not that he had any real liking for his
                  solitary life, but because he knew no way wherein he could remedy the existing
                  circumstance.
               It is plainly to be seen by the above intimation, that if Solum should make a
                  candid confession, acknowledging his true feeling, in regard to his lonely
                  circumstance, it would be to better his situation; but on that subject, he thought
                  that it was worse than useless to comment, for he saw no opening whereby he might
                  escape the dire solitude; there were no populous towns or cities, near the
                  hermitage, where he might hold sweet communion with a specimen of his own
                  existence, and thus shake off the dire aggrievance. He began by degrees to exhibit
                  a longing desire to have access to the innocent company of the fair sex, for the
                  feeling he had cultivated in the presence of his dear departed Lelia, still left a
                  few burning embers upon the altar of his heart, and those began to exhibit
                  symptoms of kindling to a greater degree of warmth, if not to a vivid flame, as
                  you may perceive in the sequel.
               Solum began to feel the want of a companion, in these lonely confines, to whom he
                  might reveal the many secrets that had accumulated in his heart; a companion to
                  advise him, in trouble, and to care for him, in illness; but such a companion he
                  despaired of getting. He thought of his native town Oleva, but ah! they had all
                     become the victims of the
                  destructive pestilence, consequently there was no hope of meeting the wanted
                  society, if he should conclude to retrace his steps. But where should he go, that
                  he might be successful in meeting that desired companion? Ah! that was an
                  interrogation, he would readily have solved, if in his power; he could not! no, he
                  could not! But one thing certain he determined to do, and that is, to go in search
                  of his fellow-beings, and to continue until successful, or die in the attempt. He
                  resolved to explore the country, in a few days, in every direction, until he found
                  the whereabouts of his species, or be more fully convinced that their company and
                  his should never mingle on earth.
               Solum at this time, was about twenty-one or two years of age; just emerging from
                  adolescence, into the more mature stage of human life, manhood, full of health and
                  vigor. He was (to use the expression of ladies) beautiful, handsome, good-looking,
                  &c.; of a medium size; fair complexion naturally; but I presume, the reader
                  might justly imagine, that the scorching sun had changed the natural hue of his
                  visage somewhat, but however a tanned complexion can not hide nor disfigure a
                  beautiful feature. His hair was of a dark auburn color, with a slight tendency to
                  wave; his eyes bright and of a dark hazel cast; but his greatest accomplishments
                  were his mind and character, which are more to be prized, or at least ought to be,
                  than mines of untold wealth.
               Solum had but little knowledge of the pleasures of female society previous to his
                  acquaintance with Lelia. There was a relative of his, some two years younger than
                  himself, that used to visit his father's family occasionally, but he made no
                  effort to cultivate her acquaintance, for reasons amply satisfactory. When he
                  would attempt, to hold a conversation with her, she would shortly commence her
                  slang, remonstrating him for living such an indifferent life, saying at the same
                  time, that his course would certainly lead him to depravity and degradation, that
                  he would be the common parlance as long as he lived. In that mood his cousin kept
                  up her conversation, and you may rest assured that it was not amicably relished by
                  Solum, and no wonder, who would under the existing circumstances? I fear the
                  response in her favor would be justly considered a merited paucity. The idea suggested by Solum's cousin, that
                  his way of life would lead to depravity and degradation, did not trouble him much,
                  nor did he feel inclined to credit the assertion that he would become a common
                  parlance, a by-word, an object of derision as long as he lived; He thought that
                  her expression might be improved by discarding the words "common parlance," and
                  insert common gossip of idle and ill-disposed men and women", which would approach
                  nearer infallibility.
               Solum began to feel the want of society more and more day by day. The poetical
                  name of solitude had begun to lose its wanted charms; he thought of the language
                  of the poet, which reads thus: 
                     "Oh Solitude I where are thy charms?"
                  
               
               Ah! the charms of solitude had quietly dissolved into discontentment. It was once
                  a favorite companion of his, but they had become dissatisfied and sworn to be each
                  other's enemy to the sequel of the drama of life. Solum was not entirely destitute
                  of pride, for you will perceive that it was no small obstacle setting itself in
                  array against the secret projects of his heart. He had no apparel to wear, that
                  was worthy to be worn in the society of females. He knew that his hairy garb,
                  which was made of the skins of wild beasts that roamed the forest, which he now
                  wore, were repugnant to their extreme delicacy. They would shrink from his
                  unwelcome society as they would from a demon—a being I must confess, to my ideas,
                  his apparel resembled. He also knew that there was a vast amount of false,
                  delicacy and undue respect, in the society of the fair sex, which was to be
                  combatted with energy ere he would be enabled to come off second best in the
                  conflict.
               Solum, had one suit of clothes remaining of those he had brought from Oleva, but
                  he had outgrown them to such an extent that he would cut a ridiculous figure if he
                  attempted to wear them in society. These reflections led him to think of something
                  important, and which in the end proved successful, and that was to look for his
                  father's knapsack, that had hung so long on the walls of his cottage. It had hung
                  there unmolested for a number of years; the spider had taken up his abode in it,
                  and had spun his tender web over it, to delude the unwary insect that chanced to wander that way; the dust of
                  many years had settled upon it, presenting an aspect that seemed to betray the
                  character of Solum as a neat housekeeper, but that was not the case; he kept his
                  cottage clean and neat, excepting that lonely "nook," where hung his father's
                  knapsack. For many years after he built the hermitage, he could not bear to look
                  in the direction in which it hung; it brought back recollections of past sorrow
                  which he was striving to forget, it brought back recollections of his sunny
                  childhood, but he would endeavor to banish them from his mind by quoting the
                  following beautiful poem: 
                     
                        "Fond memory,
                        O let me forget the sweet days of my childhood,
                        The pleasures and joys that I left with regret,
                        The flowers that I plucked in the spring from the wildwood,
                        The birds sweetly singing, O let me forget!
                        The bright cherry hopes that upon me were dawning,
                        So sweetly enchanting in life's early morning,
                        When nature appeared in her brightest adorning;
                        Those sweet merry hours, O let me forget."
                     
                  
               
               When Solum attempted to open the sack, a huge 
                     tarentula
                     tarantula
                  , or the venomous spider, exhibited a hostile spirit for his (Solum's)
                  intrusion upon his claimed territory. It made a bound at the back of his band,
                  plunging his tiny fangs therein, and leaving a sensation behind anything but
                  pleasant. Solum became somewhat indignant at the rash act of the 
                     tarentula
                     tarantula
                  , and attempted to despatch him for his unruly conduct; but he escaped
                  into a chink in the wall, and thus preserved his bacon. The bite pained Solum's
                  hand considerably, so that he was compelled to procure some medicament to ease his
                  sufferings. Solum was slightly acquainted with the vulnerary properties of wild
                  plants. He had heard that a plant of the genus plantago was considered an antidote
                  for the venom of poisonous reptiles and insects. He went into the garden, if,
                  perchance, he might find the desired vulnerary. When he had found it, he applied a
                  leaf to the wound; so, by and by, the pain began to subside gradually, till it had
                  entirely left his hand; whether from the soothing effect of the antidote, or from
                  the virus having consumed its energy, it is immaterial to know.
               Solum found that the suit remaining in the knapsack was in a perfect state of
                  preservation; free from the destructive inroads of the moth, which usually makes a
                  havoc of drapery. He took them out, and hung them on the shrubbery, to bask, as it were, in the sunshine a spell, to
                  taste of the pure atmosphere, of which they had so long been deprived.
               Solum now began to think that every obstacle had been surmounted, that arrayed
                  itself against the exploring expedition in anticipation, but one, and that he knew
                  not how to overcome. It was this: where was he to find that happy society in
                  contemplation? Where lay the secret pathway that would lead him to their concealed
                  where-abouts? Ah! to these interrogations he could not respond. If he could, how
                  readily would he have performed the task! But, however, he had made up his mind to
                  ascertain their respective places of abode, ere a fortnight had passed by.
               There was another obstacle in the way of Solum, which, I am sorry to say, he
                  dreamed not of; and that was: he was a poor boy, possessing no riches to recommend
                  him to any society. He did not think, for a moment, that riches constituted a part
                  of a man's now-a-days accomplishments, without which he was destined to
                  misfortune. Ah! that is a fact too true! There is more truth connected with it,
                  than virtue or common sense. A sad truth—a truth that tells many tales of sorrow
                  row and misery. How many golden opportunities have been slighted by the fairer
                  sex, of uniting themselves to promising manhood, by the holy bands of matrimony,
                  simply because they were not heirs to a competent fortune. They do not slight such
                  offers because the company of their suitors is repugnant; no, but because a mass
                  of them can not command at least a moderate sum, which is, I am sorry to say,
                  almost universally requisite to their wishes. But, alas! how many are mistaken,
                  and that sadly, too! How many have married worthless coxcombs, whose mere outward
                  appearance portrayed wealth, and by their treacherous arts succeed to betray some
                  of those who had avowed to marry a man of wealth or none, to become his wife,
                  whilst the extent of his riches was on his person. After they had been united in
                  matrimony she finds out her sad mistake—her irreparable misfortune. He comes (that
                  is, her husband) to her and utters a plaintive story, telling her that misfortune
                  had been his lot since he was married; that his wealth had taken wings and fled,
                  while at the same time it never was his fortune to possess it. But you that marry
                  for riches must abide by the consequences that may ensue; if you allow yourselves to become so
                  inconsiderate, you deserve but little sympathy. But in some instances the fair sex
                  are not to be held culpable for such demeanor, but their parents and guardians.
                  Their mandates are, not to marry any one who is not able to command such an amount
                  of wealth as ever to deliver them from the "vile drudgery" of labor, which has so
                  strong a tendency to deteriorate the lily-white hands of idleness.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               SOLUM'S EXPLORING JOURNEY.—HIS SUCCESS.
               Solum now began to put some of his calculations into execution. He had become
                  quite tired of mere speculations, in regard to future enjoyment. He found that
                  building castles in the air, promised nothing more substantial and satisfactory,
                  than the pleasure of their construction, a pleasure often our nocturnal companion,
                  but it usually vanishes, at the approach of morning; a pleasure that never emerges
                  from the dreamy world of imagination.
               He had long looked for a brighter epoch, to dawn upon his weary life, but it
                  seemed to him, that dire solitude was destined to become his constant companion.
                  It seemed to him, that anything more satisfactory or happy, could not be well
                  anticipated, as he was excluded from the gaze of the busy world. His situation was like a solitary
                  island of the sea, whose soil too sterile and unproductive, to support even the
                  few aquatic fowls, that resort to its barren strands; too poor to proffer any
                  comfort, save a resting place for their weary feet, during the gloomy shadows of
                  the night. Just so with Solum; he was cast upon that lonely valley, where The
                  brilliant sunshine of felicity and pleasure, could never shine in its purity; it
                  could only afford him but scantily, of the true happiness and enjoyment, known
                  only to the shady side of eternity. It only promised him a resting place; a place
                  secure from the unmerciful wild beasts, whose lairs were almost a constituent of
                  the hermitage, but their discordant howl had lost its terror, and become grateful
                  to his ears.
               Solum took his father's old garments, which he had laid upon the shrubbery to air,
                  and went to the brook, to exercise himself in the capacity of a washerwoman; after
                  washing them to suit his taste, he hung them out to dry. He next commenced to pack
                  his knapsack, for the ensuing day, he was to commence his exploring journey.
               Solum had traversed the wild forest around him in every direction, excepting
                  towards the north east, while in quest of game, or pleasure, consequently, he was
                  prepared to come to an adequate conclusion in regard to the direction he would
                  pursue on the coming day. As I before intimated, the land towards the north and
                  east, gradually sank away, beyond the gaze, so it was easily to suppose, that in
                  that direction (if in any) the land was cultivated, because towards the south and
                  west, nothing but the Aleovan ranges could be seen.
               The hermit intended to be absent from his cottage, some two or three days,
                  consequently he had been arranging matters to that effect, for the last fortnight;
                  arranging his garden; fitting up the hermitage, and arranging his fishing tackles,
                  with the storing of his knapsack.
               It was on a calm and beautiful morning in the month of June, that Solum set out on
                  his exploring journey. He had risen early, and addressed himself for the
                  forthcoming turmoils of the day. The birds were seemingly more lively than usual.
                  The loud and mellow notes of the mountain robin could be heard in the distance,
                  and nearer could be heard the faint
                  notes of the little chick-a-dee-dee. The sun was just commencing to emerge from
                  behind the gigantic forest, and smiling with seemingly, unusual splendor on all
                  around.
               The little brook that went purling by the hermitage day after day, seemed to be
                  singing its song of mirth, or playing its life-like drama, with an unnatural air.
                  That beautiful stream ran in the direction that Solum intended to travel,
                  consequently, he concluded to make it his guide, to that obscure region, he was
                  about to explore.
               Solum had now commenced his journey, and continued to follow the babbling brook as
                  his conductor, but he found as he followed its merry song, that the volume of its
                  waters began to swell beyond its primitive boundary; each mountain glen sent forth
                  a tributary, laughing and singing over pebbly beds, rushing down with
                  cheerfulness, to meet the murmuring brook below, to aid in swelling its limpid
                  tide. As the waters of the brook increased in bulk, it gradually hushed its loud
                  ripplings over the long worn rocks, for a silent and majestic ebb. It had lost, as
                  it were, its youthful murmurings, and taken up the sad and mournful dirges of a
                  deep flowing stream.
               When Solum had traveled some five or six miles he came to where the banks of the
                  stream swelled to an unnatural extent beyond its usual boundary; where its
                  flower-clad banks, which had been parallel, now swelled or expanded to form a
                  beautiful sheet of water which you might justly term a lake. It was a beautiful
                  lake indeed, spreading out its limpid sheet, like a mighty mirror, reflecting the
                  golden sunbeams to a degree of perfection but little inferior to their original
                  splendors. The tiny flowers reflected their vivid colors in its deep waters,
                  forming, as it were, a bower beneath its surface. As he trod along the flowery
                  strands of the lake, he met here and there a fresh trodden pathway, leading from
                  the shady mountains on the right to the quiet edge of the lake. It was made by the
                  footsteps of the wary chamois or wild goat, as they proceeded to the lake during
                  the shady hours of midnight to slake their craving thirst.
               Whilst Solum gazed upon that lonely expanse of water, its surface was calm and
                  still, not a breath of the stirring breeze blew over it to wake its slumbering
                  ripples; but anon, a series of waves would emanate from a spot on the quiet sheet, whose peripheries expanded as
                  they approached the shore; it was caused by a hungry trout, that had emerged from
                  the sable deep to captivate the unwary insect that danced over the surface in the
                  sunbeams. Solum felt very reluctant to leave that beautiful lake to pursue his
                  exploring journey, for it seemed to him more like a life-like tableau than a sheet
                  of water, whereon was depicted the verdant foliage, the spreading boughs and
                  massive trunks of the gigantic trees of the sombre wildwood that surrounded the
                  scene, in glowing and gaudy colors. Again, as he continued walking by the fertile
                  strands of the lake, his silent meditations would be frequently disturbed by the
                  loud croak of the timid bull-frog, as it plunged into the waters beneath,
                  exulting, as it were, in the security of its retreat.
               Solum began to think that he was squandering away much precious time, therefore he
                  resumed his journey with renewed vigor, his footsteps were hastened to redeem, if
                  possible, much of the time he spent loitering by the lake, till at last he became
                  fatigued and hungry, when he set about selecting a suitable spot where he might
                  make the requisite preparations for dinner; and when he had made a selection
                  suitable to his fancy, he stepped aside into the forest to get a fishing pole; he
                  came to a venerable old beech tree that supplied him with a long slender rod,
                  sufficiently long to reach half-way across the brook.
               Solum was fond of fishing, as was intimated in a former chapter, but he seldom
                  caught more of the finny denizens of the brook than was necessary to supply his
                  table, for he justly thought that he would be culpable for wasting intentionally a
                  rich portion of the bountiful provisions of Providence.
               Solum had now traveled some ten or twelve miles, but had not as yet discovered any
                  vestiges of living humanity. His hopes of success for the day were beginning to
                  falter; he did not wish to return again to his lonely hermitage without making
                  some discovery satisfactory to his ardent wishes, but as yet, the day was but half
                  spent, consequently there was still remaining hope of success in the moiety not
                  spent.
               Whilst Solum was endeavoring to decoy the finny tribes that sported in the waters
                  beneath with his trusty hook and bait, he was struck with the death like stillness
                  that pervaded the forest. The merry chirpings of the little warblers were hushed,
                     when the loud and doleful whistle of
                  the tree-frog broke the silence. A dark and gloomy cloud began to rise towards the
                  western horizon. It was a thunder storm approaching. It made Solum feel sad and
                  downcast, wishing at the same time that he was only back to his cottage, at least
                  till the storm had subsided. He had to quit his fishing in the brook, for the wary
                  trout had retreated to their hiding places in the banks of the stream, as if
                  dreading the approaching storm, but what was Solum to do? Where was he to flee,
                  that he might escape the violence of the thunder storm brewing? He fled to the
                  cliffs of the mountain, where he found a projecting rock which proffered its
                  imperfect shelter to his consideration, which he accepted.
               The tiny cloud that had risen in the far west, had now swelled into a massive
                  cloud of a dark and angry expression, overspreading the whole blue canopy with its
                  terror. The vivid lightnings began to play, and the low muttering thunder grumbled
                  in the distance. A low, mysterious sighing was heard in the forest, as if the
                  trees were whispering to each other of the fearful tempest approaching. Louder and
                  louder became the harsh voice of the thunder, as the brilliant glare from the
                  flashing lightning increased. Anon was heard the pattering sounds of the heavy
                  raindrops upon the leaves of the forest trees, and on the brook. In a few moments
                  the fury of the storm began to play all around. The rain fell in torrents, whilst
                  the lightning flashed alternate with the loud roar of the mighty thunder that
                  echoed among the mountains; but in a short time the mighty storm had spent its
                  fury upon the forest and had blown over towards the eastern horizon, when the sun
                  emerged from the scene of darkness which had just eclipsed its smiling face, and
                  shining forth with splendor, causing a beautiful rainbow to arch over the sombre
                  forest, whose brilliant hues portrayed a rich tableau in the heavens. Solum, with
                  the feathered tribe, emerged from the mountain retreat or grotto, to take a look
                  at the surrounding aspect. The huge, immortal trees of the forest looked
                  refreshed. Their leaves that did seem, to curl with the aridity, before the storm,
                  now expanded their broad surfaces to the breeze with an entire satisfaction. As he
                  still looked around him, he saw many of the lordly specimens of the forest furrowed by the fury of the vivid
                  lightning; from their tops to the roots you might see the track of the subtle
                  fluid, as it descended, and see where the gigantic boughs had been shattered from
                  their trunks, as it passed into the bowels of the dark earth.
               Those numerous strickened trees can no longer repel the many parasites that were
                  anxiously waiting to vegetate on their shaggy surfaces. The moss and the lichen
                  were ready to hang their verdant curtains in graceful festoons around them, and
                  thus be a substitute for the verdant habiliments just disrobed, only they would
                  present an aspect more grave—as if clad in the dark and gloomy robes of a funeral
                  drapery.
               Solum now resumed his onward march, cheered by the merry warblers that seemed to
                  be singing songs of gladness that the gloomy tempest had passed away once
                  more—that they were enabled to resume their accustomed sport among the forest
                  trees. Ever and anon would Solum clamber up some hillock, or up the mountain side
                  to view the landscape, if, perchance, he might see the blue smoke winding and
                  curling amongst the trees of the forest, on its upward flight; a sight that would
                  bring joy to his anxious heart, for it bespeaks the habitation of mankind; and
                  again be would listen to hear the sounds that might be echoing through the
                  wildwood—the barking of a cottage watch dog—the shrill voice of Chanticleer, or
                  the bleating or lowing of the grazing herds;—but none of these welcome sounds, as
                  yet, saluted his anxious ears.
               It is a remarkable fact, deducible from the every-day play of the drama of life,
                  that mankind can not always relish the same pleasures under every existing
                  circumstance, nor always consider discordant sounds repugnant. At one time the
                  sweet cadences of the harp are listened to with indescribable satisfaction, whilst
                  at another, its sweet chords act like the harsh and grating sounds of discord upon
                  his angry countenance. The barking of a dog is almost universally disliked by the
                  tender ear; but I would venture to say, as repugnant as it usually is, it would
                  have been grateful to the over-anxious ears of Solum—filling his inmost soul with
                  joy and delight—yes, relished with eagerness, notwithstanding its disagreeable
                  melody.
               The anxiety that had come across the mind of Solum, recently, was very great; caused by the
                  mighty storm which had just gone by—the fear that its tardiness (the storm) had
                  robbed him of much of his precious time—therefore, it caused him to pursue his
                  journey with vigor, forgetting his hunger; but it soon began to return as, is
                  agitation subsided. He again resolved to make preparations for dining, and see if
                  he could not be more successful. He came to an opening in the forest, where the
                  gigantic trees seemed to stand back from the brink, as if fearful of the obscure
                  depths of the brook. In this little opening there lay prostrated forest-tree,
                  which had been precipitated from its former dignified position by the howling
                  tempest, whilst it was proudly lashing to and fro above its surrounding fellows.
                  It lay there, clad in a verdant garb, of moss, tempting, as it were Solum, to
                  accept the well-cushioned seat it proffered. Solum, was very ready to accept the
                  kind invitation of nature, being a good deal fatigued. The moss-covered seat
                  whereon he sat, seemed to have a soothing effect to his aching limbs. But hark! he
                  hears some unknown melody. He thought it was the sweet, enchanting music of the
                  fairies. "Fairy music," thought he. "I have often heard of their sweet melodies,
                  in my youthful days, but was taught to believe that it was all imaginary. I have
                  heard that they swelled the loud cadences of their harps in the wildwood,
                  awakening the many slumbering echoes thereof with their melodious strains, and,
                  syren-like, charming all within the expanse of their vibrations." Those sweet,
                  melodious strains that were wafted across the murmuring brook, became louder and
                  louder. Solum was in a deep, pensive muse he did not know whether to consider
                  those mellow strains real or imaginative; but the thought occurred to him, that
                  each fervent strain, as it reached his attentive ear, was too forcible to proceed
                  from the tiny harps of fabled imaginaries, as fairies, sylphs, &c. He at last
                  came to the conclusion of quitting his mossy seat, and go in search for the origin
                  of such exquisite music. He followed the stream, until he came to where a hemlock
                  had fallen across the brook, enabling him to cross without much difficulty. When
                  he had reached the opposite shore, nearest to where the music proceeded, he
                  commenced to penetrate the sable forest, following the sweet strains of music as a
                  guide. After he had walked a short
                  distance, he halted to listen again, when he thought that he could distinguish a
                  voice—the voice of a female—a voice, he thought, that resembled that of his
                  immortal Lelia, the sound of whose sweet voice still lingered on the tablet of his
                  memory. He started onward again, crashing and tumbling through the thickets of
                  underbrush, until he was fatigued enough to give up the chase; but at last the
                  dense and shady forest gave way to a beautiful, undulating and well cultivated
                  land, whereon were many grazing herds. Fields of verdant grass extended far in the
                  distance, presenting a life-like appearance when the gentle breath of the breeze
                  blew but softly over it.
               Solum could now hear the music distinctly, but could not ascertain from whence it
                  proceeded; the one from which the exquisite music proceeded was hidden from view,
                  by a clump of hazel bushes, which she had resorted to, to shelter her tender
                  visage from the piercing rays of the sun. The sun had left his meridian, by many
                  degrees, consequently, it would be more likely to strike the face of any who had
                  the boldness to withstand his piercing rays.
               Solum proceeded into the open field towards the clump of bushes, but he had good
                  sense enough not to come upon her retreat, in a manner calculated to frighten her,
                  but took a circuitous route, that she might observe him ere he approached. When he
                  came to a spot where he could see, he found that the music proceeded from a
                  beautiful maiden, that was a shepherdess. The first glimpse he had of the
                  shepherdess, reminded him of Lelia, and if he had left Oleva without knowing to a
                  certainty, that she was dead, he would have been ready to pronounce her his dear
                  Lelia. Their complexions were somewhat different, but at the distance Solum stood
                  from her, he could not discern that fact; nothing but the expression was readable
                  at that distance, and that imperfectly.
               This beautiful maiden was keeping watch over the many herds that quietly grazed
                  around her; but in the progress of the narrative, you will ascertain, why she was
                  alone, in the performance of such a formidable task.
               Solum had now placed himself in a more conspicuous situation, when she at last
                  observed him; she ceased to sing and play, and exhibited symptoms of agitation and
                  fear, but not without some reason. What
                  female would not fear to meet an entire stranger in the field alone? Who would not
                  be ready to cry for help, even at the sight of such an intrusive visitor, even
                  before she knew there was any danger to dread? But often it is the case, I must
                  confess, that women allow themselves to become the subjects of fright, when little
                  or no danger is nigh, but such is the natural timidity of the fair sex.
               When Solum saw the timidity of the shepherd girl, he halted, for fear if he
                  approached any closer, she would be seized by some malady, as a consequent of
                  fright, that would be liable to prove serious; but when she saw that Solum had no
                  desire to invade her company without consent, she beckoned to him, saying, "If you
                  come peaceably, stranger, your company is acceptable?" O the sweet sound of that
                  voice, was what Solum was anxious to hear. He approached her with nimble steps and
                  a light heart—a heart palpitating with emotions of joy at his expected success. As
                  he came up to her, he made a low and gentle bow, when she in return, made a modest
                  courtesy. At that happy juncture, the fears that remained in the innocent heart of
                  the shepherdess, fled, like the dew of the morning, at the approach of the
                  congenial rays of the sun. She knew by the appearance of refinement he portrayed,
                  that he was not likely to be a rake—a dangerous person.
               Solum had fears, before he approached the sweet maiden, that his language would be
                  different from hers, consequently, their further acquaintance would be rather
                  difficult, but he had the extreme pleasure of seeing that obstacle remedied; he
                  found that her dialect was precisely the same as that of his, and apparently of
                  the same origin, a fact desirable to anxious Solum.
               After they had stared at each other to their satisfaction, the following
                  conversation broke the silence:
               "Where did you come from, my friend?" asked the shepherdess.
               "I came from my cottage, which is situated far into the shady forest of Aleova,
                  thank you."
               "The forest of Aleova, did I understand you to say?"
               "Yes ma'am, that was what I said."
               "Your cottage must be a great ways from here, or you have not been there very
                  long," said the shepherdess in a friendly manner.
               
               "Yes ma'am, the distance is considerable, I have been traveling ever since
                  daybreak, with the exception of the time that storm passed over."
               "If I may be so inquisitive, stranger, where was you during the storm, for I don't
                  perceive any vestige of it on your person."
               "Respected miss, do not fear being too inquisitive, you may consider it your
                  prerogative to ask such questions as your ladyship may think proper. But in answer
                  to your question, I fled to Mount Aleova near by, where I found a projecting ledge
                  of rocks, forming a small grotto, which afforded me the necessary shelter."
               "Well I am glad to learn that you obtained shelter, for it was truly a fearful
                  storm," said the shepherdess, in a spirit that indicated that a feeling of
                  affection was kindling up in her heart for the homeless wanderer, as their
                  interesting conversation continued.
               "I thank you very much, respected maiden, for the sympathy you seem to have on my
                  behalf, but I do not feel worthy of so much attention," said Solum with
                  emotion.
               "Not at all, stranger, it always has been my disposition to exercise a charitable
                  and hospitable spirit towards strangers." This the shepherdess said to cloak her
                  previous expressions, for she began to think that she had expressed herself rather
                  more freely than was her modest desire.
               "Friend," said the shepherdess, "as you were so kind as to give me the liberty of
                  interrogating you at pleasure, I sincerely hope that you will not consider me bold
                  in case I should, at least partially, accept your kind offer."
               "No ma'am, no danger, proceed with pleasure," said Solum.
               "I thank you, stranger. What is your occupation? what did you follow for a
                  livelihood?"
               "I am what you might justly term a hermit. I subsist on the fruits of my little
                  garden, together with the game I kill in the Aleovan forest and the fish I catch
                  in the brook that murmurs so sweetly by the hermitage."
               "So you always manage to procure enough of nature's bountiful supply to subsist
                  on?"
               "Yes ma'am, I do, and for which I am afraid I have not felt half thankful
                  enough."
               "You have no family, I believe," said the, shepherdess, seemingly more anxious
                  than ever to learn his history, but in her heart she dreaded his response, the reason my reader can easily
                  guess. But she saw a change in the countenance of the stranger after asking the
                  question, instead of that bright, cheerful brow, there was a sorrowful downcast
                  expression, as if it brought back to his recollection, scenes of bygone
                  days—scenes of sorrow and sadness. She began to think that she had been too
                  forward and wished to retract.
               "Will you pardon me for asking you such an impertinent question?"
               "O no ma'am, there is no necessity for any such ceremony; the question was a
                  plausible one, but the reason that I hesitated to answer it, was the emotions of
                  my inmost soul. I can say more than tell you that I have no family; I have not got
                  a single relative on earth to my knowledge."
               "What, no relatives at all?" asked the shepherdess in an anxious tone.
               "None at all. I saw my last relative on earth, that I know of, wrapped in the
                  cold, icy arms of death, and that was my dear father." When Solum had made that
                  last expression, the shepherdess saw him wipe some unbidden tears from his cheeks;
                  he did it in such a manner as if he wished to conceal his feelings. She began to
                  think that the hermit was a man of no ordinary accomplishment, possessing feelings
                  that were alive to the misfortunes of mankind, unlike the heartless rake, who
                  prowls about to victimize the unwary.
               "Pardon me, stranger, for neglecting to ask you whether you had anything to eat
                  since morning, the excitement of the occasion entirely banished the question from
                  my mind until now."
               "I thank you miss, for your kindness, I must confess, I have not eaten anything
                  since morning. I was quite hungry when I was sitting by the brookside, but I
                  declare I had forgotten all about it."
               "If you will accept the scanty meal I shall offer, I will keep you waiting no
                  longer, for you can not be otherwise than very hungry."
               "I thank you very much indeed, but I am pretty sure that what you denominate 'a
                  scanty meal' will be a luxury to me, for you must remember that a hermit can not
                  have all the dainties and luxuries which you, or others in a similar situation,
                  possess."
               Without further conversation the shepherdess went to her basket and brought the
                  remains of her dinner, which was
                  biscuit and cold meat, and sat them before the hermit. He thanked her very much
                  for her kindness, and commenced eating the proffered meal. It tasted better to
                  him, than any meal he had eaten since he had left Oleva. There was something in
                  the victuals, that made him relish it, more than usual. It was the saline
                  ingredient, a condiment he long had wished for, without which, food seems to lose
                  its wanted taste.
               "Respected miss, I presume you are ready to say, that I must have been hungry,
                  after having demolished the remnant of your victuals."
               "Yes sir, I am ready to confess that you must have been hungry, but not from the
                  fact of your having eaten the remaining biscuits, but I am sorry that there was
                  not more."
               "I thank you miss, I had quite a plenty; I could not have eaten any more."
               "I presume it did not taste natural to you, being used to meals of a different
                  character."
               "I must confess it did not taste like my accustomed meal, but vastly superior. It
                  was decidedly the best meal I have eaten since I was but a small youth," said
                  Solum.
               "Well I am glad that you appreciate it, for under the existing circumstance, I
                  could not have suited you better. Don't you feel very much fatigued after your
                  long journey," asked the shepherdess, wishing to change the conversation.
               "No ma'am, I feel very comfortable now, but when I met you first, I felt
                  exceedingly tired."
               "How far have you traveled to day, or rather how far is your cottage from here, my
                  friend."
               "Well, I presume the distance is about fifteen miles, as near as I can
                  calculate."
               "Well, no wonder you felt tired; I am sure I should, if I had but traveled one
                  quarter the distance."
               "Miss—excuse me for changing the subject—will I be transgressing by asking you to
                  play a few tunes, such as you played when I came out of the forest?"
               "O, no, sir; not at all! I shall be happy to comply with your wishes. What do you
                  wish me to play?"
               "Anything you please. I can not make a choice, for it has been so long since I
                  heard music, that I could not make a selection, to save my life."
               "Well, as you have allowed me to make a
                  choice, I will play the 'Lament of the Alpine Shepherd Boy,' a favorite
                  ballad."
               "The title pleases me very much, and I presume the performance will be
                  paramount."
               The shepherdess commenced the prelude on the lute, or guitar, a favorite musical
                  instrument of the Aleovans, especially of the shepherdesses. They can all play the
                  instrument that have a capacity for learning instrumental music. She commenced the
                  song which reads as follows: 
                     
                        "A shepherd boy pale, from afar o'er the main,
                        Sat piping; all lonely and sad was his strain:
                        'Oh! my own native land, my mountains so blue,
                        My Leila! I weep for my home and for you.
                        Hark! the echo! her spirit seems whispering low,
                        But, alas! she is dead, and my tears they must flow!
                        That voice! once again! now I know thou art nigh.
                        The echo—sweet echo! with thee let me die.
                     
                     
                        Oh! my home! native home, how dear are thy hills,
                        The music how sweet of thy murmuring rills,
                        How gentle and soft is the breath of thy gales,
                        As sweetly they blow in the vine-scented vales!
                        Farewell to ye all, valley, mountain and plain,
                        And the grave of my Leila, far, far o'er the main!
                        But hark!' and the mountains re-echoed his sigh,
                        'The echo—sweet echo! with thee let me die!'"
                     
                  
               
               While the shepherdess was singing and playing the song, Solum's heart began to
                  swell with emotions; but he managed to suppress their outbreak, but it was a
                  mighty warfare. The name Leila sounded so much like Lelia, his departed lady love,
                  that it was almost impossible to suppress his feelings; but there remained a
                  change of expression, which was impossible for Solum to obviate, especially while
                  the song was in progress.
               "I observe, my friend, a change in the aspect of your physiognomy. Your
                  countenance seemed to be weighed down, apparently, by a sad sequel. Am I not right
                  in my conjecture?"
               Solum hesitated to answer the interrogation of the shepherdess; not knowing what
                  to say. He did not wish to confess his alliance to Lelia, for fear it would have a
                  tendency to depreciate the respect she seemed to display on his behalf; but he at
                  last adverted to his adverse circumstances, in the following plaintive mood:
               "I am truly an outcast upon the earth—an exile—a lonely wanderer—a person destined
                  to grope in the dark and gloomy walks of misfortune and solitude. It seems to me
                  that the hand of justice has been unusually severe upon me. Many privations have I
                  undergone since my youthful days. Loss of friends, relatives and acquaintances has
                  been my greatest privation. I was not
                  aware that the happy abode of man was nearer to me than my old native land; but I
                  am happy, and rejoice, that I was enabled by kind fortune to meet you here. It
                  seems that that long anticipated epoch has commenced to dawn upon my weary
                  existence."
               "Your tale is certainly a pitiful one indeed, I should be gratified to hear a
                  minute detail of the whole circumstance, but however I shall not trouble you at
                  the present time, hoping that a more favorable opportunity will be afforded. Am I
                  too impertinent, in asking your name?"
               "No ma'am, you are not. My name is Solum, a name that implies lonely, solitary,
                  &c."
               "An appropriate name, I should judge, by your narrative. My name is Vestilia. Why
                  I was called so, I am unable to say."
               "No matter, respected miss, why you was called by that name, I think it a very
                  beautiful one indeed."
               Thus they conversed together, until the brilliant light of the radiant sun began
                  to wane, and to hide his effulgent disc behind the towering heights of Aleova;
                  when it was time to drive the herds from the field, to their respective folds.
                  Vestilia kindly invited Solum to become her guest for the night, which he
                  cordially accepted. Solum assisted Vestilia in driving home the flocks, which was
                  no small task, in consequence of their immense number. They had to be housed up in
                  folds to escape the ravages of the prowling wolves and other savage wild beasts,
                  that were denizens of the sable forest of Aleova.
               Solum has now gone to be a guest of an Aleovan shepherd. Those shepherds were a
                  kind and generous hearted race, of people, but somewhat penurious. They were
                  wealthy, and like the ancient patriarchs, their wealth consisted in immense herds
                  of sheep, cattle and other domestic animals.
               They were truly a wealthy clan, having no indigent specimens of humanity in their
                  ranks. The peculiar plan they had resorted to, to obviate poverty-stricken persons
                  from entering their society, was their forbidding any person to marry into their
                  horde, who had no wealth to recommend him to their approbation. Wealth was
                  considered an indispensable recommend, without which, the unhappy applicant was
                  doomed to be rejected, without respect
                  to his other though superior qualifications. Yes, beauty, refinement,
                  intelligence, and every other commendable accomplishment, shared but no better
                  fate, than the non-possession of filthy lucre. Those above mentioned
                  accomplishments were considered by them of minor importance; but as a substitute
                  for those noble accomplishments, they had freely embraced, what you might justly
                  term "The doctrine of old fogyism," a doctrine that has long impeded the progress
                  of science and literature. It hung as a clog to their nimble feet—protracting
                  their stay in the dark and gloomy grottoes of selfishness and ignorance.
                  Notwithstanding their peculiarities, they possessed many commendable traits, and
                  those were, their kindness, hospitality and charitable feelings towards strangers
                  and indigent persons. They never wronged a stranger, nor sent a beggar away empty.
                  They scorned to maltreat any, whom ill fortune did seem to claim as a vassal, but
                  endeavored to open their hearts, to the comfort of all those unfortunate victims
                  of poverty; but energetically resisted their ingress to their society, as they did
                  not claim to possess any such personages in their clan, consequently it was
                  natural to suppose that their society was repugnant.
               The country in which these wealthy shepherds resided, was very productive and
                  beautiful; pastures grew spontaneously, and every other natural inducements were
                  favorable to their innocuous employment.
               It appears that those rich pasture lands of the Aleovan shepherds were never
                  covered over with timber, like the adjacent lands towards the southwest; if they
                  were, it must have been at a very early period, for no, relics of the fact could
                  be found; all was smooth and free from any representative of the vegetable
                  kingdom, save the slender grass which formed a verdant carpet, covering those
                  beautiful undulating lands, and furnishing food for the many lowing herds of the
                  shepherds.
               My reader has not forgotten, I presume, what was stated in a former page, about a
                  colony of shepherds, who left the home of their childhood, with herds and flocks,
                  to pursue their occupation in a far unknown land. Tradition does not state
                  positively whether the clan in consideration was that colony or not, but we have many reasons to
                  assert, from the history given by tradition, that they were the identical
                  settlers. However, we can safely affirm that they must have settled much earlier
                  than those who settled on the southwest side of Mount Aleova. Their language was
                  identically the same, but their occupations were vastly different; the one pursued
                  a mercantile life whilst the other reared flocks and herds. The latter was the
                  richer, but the former clan bid fair to become the more successful and
                  independent.
               Solum had now accomplished what he had long in anticipation, and that was an
                  entrance into the society of the fair sex. He had long cherished the social
                  chit-chat which he had with his beloved Lelia; and ever had a hankering desire to
                  renew that innocent employment, not with Lelia, for he deemed that impossible, but
                  with one of equal accomplishments and intelligence. A true representative, or his
                  identical beau-ideal, he thought he had now met in person; he thought that he had
                  now a suitable foundation whereon to, base his future anticipations; but he knew
                  not of the mighty barrier that stood in the way; he thought not that in order to
                  meet the approbation of the old gentleman, the shepherd, he must boast of wealth,
                  nor was that always satisfactory, the credentials had to be presented indicating
                  the infallibility of the assertion. Why they were so rigid on that point I have
                  explained on a previous page, but I presume it will not be amiss for me to say
                  something more on the subject.
               The by-laws which they had enacted to prevent poverty and indigence from making
                  inroads into their noble clan did prove inadequate to the task. To expel poverty
                  and indigence from a horde may promise to be an easy undertaking while in its
                  infancy, but when their ranks increase to thousands, they would find the
                  impossibility of the success of their by-laws. When the old ancient patriarch
                  Jacob was fully established in the world, he had enough for himself and for many
                  succeeding generations, but notwithstanding that fact, it was not at all likely to
                  be supposed that each individual representative of his increasing progeny retained
                  a competency of that extensive fund, to supply his numerous predecessors for time
                  immemorial.
               As I intimated before, though imperfectly, that the country in which those Aleovan
                     shepherds had settled, was richly
                  adapted to the success of their occupation. Their lands were beautifully clad in
                  grass, and other herbage. The lovely brook that ran purling by the hermitage,
                  might be seen meandering through their productive valley, which offered its limpid
                  elements in profusion to the many thirsty herds that grazed on its flowery
                  banks.
               The herds raised principally by those Aleovan shepherds were cattle and sheep.
                  They did not rear them for a mere mercenary object, like at the present day, but
                  for their natural produce. The cattle were not slaughtered for their flesh tallow
                  and hides, excepting those whose services were not wanted in the dairy; neither
                  were the sheep slain for their flesh, &c., but merely prized for their
                  wool.
               Of this last mentioned trait of the Aleovan shepherds, I would deign to criticize.
                  It seems to exert a moral influence, when, in reality, no such benign results were
                  designed. The laws of morality would have been but a feeble obstacle in their way,
                  could they have procured purchasers for that kind of merchandise. The love of gain
                  had become, too extensively, their "ruling passion."
               The old shepherd (at whose house Solum had gone to be a guest) was exceedingly
                  wealthy. He had lands and herds, I would almost say, innumerable. He had no heir
                  to, all this immense wealth, excepting an only daughter. He had had other
                  children, but they died in infancy; none of them were permitted to weather the
                  storm of life so long, but Vestilia, the shepherdess. She was a stout, hearty,
                  robust, but not uncomely female, possessing all the accomplishments due to her
                  sphere in life.
               The name which we will give to that venerable old shepherd, is Pastores, which
                  means a shepherd or herdsman. Tuelia was his wife's name. She was an industrious,
                  frugal and intelligent woman; well adapted to fulfill the different offices of
                  wife, housekeeper and mother. As for Vestilia, the daughter, her merits will come
                  in as the narrative progresses. Enough to speak of her on this occasion, as being
                  the sole manager of the flocks; for her father had become so old and 
                     increpit
                     decrepit
                  , as to unable him to pursue his nomadic occupation pation. Since he had become so infirm with age, he
                  had been accustomed to hire help; but at this time, it appears that they were
                  destitute of help, from what cause I am unable to state; consequently the whole
                  duty devolved upon Vestilia.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               SOLUM AT THE HOUSE OF THE SHEPHERD.—HIS STAY, &C.
               Vestilia had taken Solum to the house of her parents, there to remain as a guest
                  for the night. They all seemed to welcome him in heart, as they did with the right
                  hand of fellowship; but poor Solum labored under many disadvantages. He was
                  extremely bashful, and so 
                     embarrased
                     embarrassed
                   when any one spoke to him, that it was with difficulty that he could
                  respond; and not much wonder, for he had not seen the face of one of his
                  fellow-beings since he left Oleva. At that time, he was young and untutored, I
                  mean in regard to etiquette; therefore, there was a plausible excuse for his
                  extreme diffidence, uncouth manners and rude expressions. He also found that his
                  language was so very imperfect, as to be almost inadequate to hold an ordinary
                  conversation; that being the result of the loss of practice—having no one to converse with, since the death of his
                  parents. The tender age of Solum, when his parents died, was sufficient of itself,
                  to account for the loss of so much of his native language.
               When Vestilia had brought the stranger into the castle of the old shepherd, she
                  introduced him to her mother, who was preparing the evening meal, and afterwards
                  took him into a large room, where sat her venerable father, with both hands on his
                  knees before a gentle fire, which was kindled to drive away the chilly air of
                  evening, for vitality or warmth is not very extensive in old age. He seemed to be
                  in a deep, pensive meditation, probably thinking what would become of his dear
                  Vestilia, if he should die ere she had formed a matrimonial union, with one of her
                  opposite sex; ere she had selected, or rather had been selected as a partner for
                  life, by one of the clan. In that meditative mood, Solum was ushered into his
                  presence, by his daughter, saying, "Father I have a guest to introduce to you,
                  please accept of his company;" with that Solum made a low and genteel bow.
               "How do you do, my friend," said the old shepherd, as he welcomed Solum to a
                  seat.
               "I am very well, I thank you."
               "You are quite a stranger to these parts, I presume," continued the old
                  shepherd.
               "Yes sir, I have never visited these parts before."
               "What part of the country are you from, if I may ask."
               "I came from the sombre forest of Aleova, in which I have resided many years.
                  Originally, I came from Oleva, a town situated on the southwest side of Mount
                  Aleova."
               "How far is that place from here," inquired the old man.
               "Well, I presume it's about fifteen miles, as near as I can calculate."
               "It is strange that you lived so long in that gloomy place, without finding us
                  before this time; what was your reasons for remaining there so long?"
               "Well, I can hardly tell; I presume it was in consequence of the many privations I
                  had under gone, &c."
               "What was your occupation, or how did you subsist so long, in the Aleovan
                  forest?"
               "I subsisted by hunting, fishing and in cultivating vating my little garden; I mean, I subsisted on the
                  success of my hunting and fishing expeditions, together with the bountiful
                  supplies of my garden."
               "Yes sir, I understand you. You live somewhat like a hermit, I should think," said
                  the old shepherd in a joking style.
               "Yes sir. I call my cottage a hermitage; the name I was very proud of at one time,
                  but I must confess that more than the name has become odious to me."
               "I presume so. It must be a very tiresome and lonely life, but perhaps the case is
                  different with you. Have you got a family?"
               "No sir. I have no family, no relatives, nobody but myself that I know of,"
                  replied Solum rather demurely.
               "What," said Pastores, looking rather surprised, "do you mean to say that you have
                  no relatives at all?"
               "Yes sir," replied Solum, "I have no relatives that I know of. My father and
                  mother, and all my relatives have long since died."
               "You certainly have been a very solitary genius," said the old shepherd, as if he
                  felt about half inclined to doubt the last assertion of Solum.
               At this moment Vestilia entered the room and said that supper was ready. Pastores
                  invited Solum to take supper with them, which he (Solum) was very glad to accept,
                  for he felt very hungry, together with the novelty of eating an "old fashioned
                  meal," was rather gratifying to him.
               After they had finished supper, the old shepherd and Solum returned to the
                  sitting-room again, to resume their interesting conversation, where I beg leave to
                  have them remain whilst I direct your attention. to what is transpiring in the
                  kitchen between Vestilia and her mother. They had commenced to do up their
                  housework preparatory to retiring to bed. Tuelia, Vestilia's mother, felt somewhat
                  anxious to know about the stranger and how Vestilia happened to meet with him,
                  &c. There was something prepossessing in the appearance of Solum, which was
                  ready to recommend him to the respect and goodwill of all who chanced to meet him.
                  Tuelia thought that the circumstance looked rather suspicious, but she kept her thoughts a secret until a more suitable
                  opportunity. They were working together busily without either speaking a word, as
                  if they alike dreaded to break the wonted silence, but at last the mother broke
                  forth in the following strain:
               "I think that stranger is rather an intelligent looking man; don't you think so
                  Vestilia?"
               "Yes ma'am, I think he looks rather intelligent. I should not be at all surprised
                  to hear of his being a man possessing a vast amount of information."
               "How did you happen to meet with him at first?" inquired Tuelia.
               "Well, towards evening I sat down in the shade of a clump of hazel bushes, for the
                  rays of the sun were very powerful at that time. I began to sing and play as I
                  usually do when alone; after I had sang but a few stanzas, I merely raised my eyes
                  a little, when I observed him standing directly opposite me; how long he was
                  standing in that position unnoticed I am unable to say. He was listening
                  apparently with great earnestness."
               "Was you not a little frightened, daughter, when you first saw him? 
               "Frightened! you may be sure I was. My heart seemed almost in my mouth when I
                  first saw him."
               "Did he look like a man that you might dread, when you first saw him?" This
                  question her mother put to her as a hint for timidity.
               "No, mother, I must confess he did not; but the idea of seeing a man, especially
                  under such circumstances, was enough to frighten me; but when I looked at him
                  awhile, I saw an innocent and unmeaning smile on his countenance, which drove away
                  my fear like the vapor before a gale; when I felt somewhat ashamed of myself."
               "I do wonder if he is a man of property," said Tuelia, as if that was the only
                  part of the conversation worth dwelling on.
               "Why do you ask that, mother?" inquired Vestilia, as if a little irritated.
               "O, because I would like to know, I feel somewhat curious about the matter."
               Tuelia had an object in view when she asked that question, but she did not wish to
                  communicate the secret to her daughter. She thought that Solum was beautiful
                  beyond a doubt, and apparently very intelligent, but there was one accomplishment she feared he did not possess, and
                  that was wealth. His appearance betrayed his true situation very much, if he had
                  at his command wealth and great possessions. Pastores and wife were getting very
                  old and decrepid, and they were fearful that they might drop into the grave ere
                  their only daughter, or rather only child, had secured a companion for to aid in
                  combatting the ills and turmoils of life; but I presume they would rather die, and
                  leave the whole incumbrance on their daughter's shoulders, than that she should
                  thus violate their by-laws by marrying a man below mediocrity. Her parents were
                  certainly culpable for that very act. Why should they care whether their
                  daughter's intended was wealthy or not, knowing they were not long for this world,
                  leaving an inexhaustible store of wealth behind them? But ah! the love of gain has
                  severed or rather separated many loving hearts. Many lovers, who have sworn to be
                  each other's companions through life, have been separated forever, for no better
                  reason than because their parents would not sanction the proceedings unless what
                  they always consider requisite could be boasted of, and that was wealth.
               "Mother, I should think from what he has told me, that he does not possess much
                  wealth," said Vestilia.
               "What did you hear him say, my daughter?" asked Tuelia, looking rather
                  earnestly.
               "Well, I heard him say that he lived in a hermitage which was far into the shady
                  forest of Aleova, and that his sustenance was what he procured by hunting,
                  fishing, and by cultivating his little garden."
               "Oh dear!" said Tuelia, looking rather disappointed, "if that is the case, he can
                  not be worth much anyhow."
               "Concerning his circumstances I must confess ignorance, but of his personal
                  appearance I think I can judge pretty accurately. He certainly has a very fine,
                  intelligent look, which few of our clan possess."
               "Well I don't know." That expression of her mother was uttered in a snappish tone.
                  She wished to make manifest her disapproval of a man whom she feared was in
                  indigent circumstances, apprehending at the same time the danger of her daughter's
                  forming an alliance with him, as he
                  possessed a very fine, prepossessing appearance, which would forever subjugate
                  them to the ill-friendship and dislike of the whole horde, because it would be
                  violating one of their most sacred injunctions.
               "Vestilia, have you finished up all your work for the night? If you have we will
                  go into the room and sit with father awhile before we retire."
               "Yes ma'am," replied Vestilia, rather cheerfully, "I believe I have, at least as
                  far as I know of."
               Tuelia and her daughter went into the sitting-room, where they found Pastores and
                  Solum in the midst of a lively conversation. When they were seated, the old
                  shepherd said to his wife—
               "Tuelia, this strange gentleman has been giving me a very interesting sketch of
                  his life, which contains many sad and trying circumstances."
               "I presume so," replied Tuelia, "I should like to have heard it, very much."
               At that moment Solum stepped out of the room, leaving the three together.
               "Tuelia," said Pastores, "I presume it is not late yet—I mean too late for Solum
                  to repeat his interesting narrative to you."
               "No, I guess not, it is only nine o'clock, but perhaps the gentleman is too much
                  fatigued for to repeat his narrative."
               "I should judge he was," remarked Vestilia thoughtfully, "from the distance he has
                  traveled to-day, especially through such a dense forest as that of Aleova."
               "Well, I did not think of that. It would seem too inconsiderate to ask him to
                  repeat the story to-night. He seems to be a very nice young man," continued
                  Pastores, "but it is a great pity he is in such destitute circumstances. If he was
                  in possession of wealth I should invite him to stay by all plans, on Vestilia's
                  account." This he said as he turned his eyes towards Vestilia, laughing at the
                  same time. Vestilia did not reply, but blushed a considerable. "But, under the
                  present circumstances, I must give him no encouragement whatever for fear I should
                  incur the displeasure of all our people."
               This last assertion of Pastores made his daughter feel rather badly, for, if the
                  truth was made manifest, it would show that she was deeply smitten with the
                  hermit; that there was love kindling up in her heart, that was not to be
                     extinguished guished by an ordinary
                  effort, but she knew that it was for her interest to keep her thoughts a secret
                  within her bosom.
               In the meanwhile, Solum entered the room, when the old shepherd asked him if he
                  was not too much fatigued to repeat his history to his wife and daughter. Solum
                  had not the heart to make known his true circumstances, for fear he might incur
                  their dislike, consequently he was willing to labor under disadvantage to gratify
                  their natural curiosity.
               "O, no sir," said Solum, "I shall comply with pleasure to the wishes of your
                  family. I am originally from the little town Oleva, a village situated southwest
                  of the gigantic mountains of Aleova. In that beautiful place I was reared, in that
                  place my parents lived for many years. My father (as well as the rest of the
                  settlers,) was a merchant. Our merchandise was collected from the wild forest,
                  such as furs, roots, spices, medicinal barks, and many other articles useless to
                  mention; these they shipped off to foreign countries. When I was about fourteen or
                  fifteen years old, there came a new colony from our fatherland and settled in
                  Oleva. They did not tell us their object immediately for leaving their native
                  country, but by and by, the women divulged the secret. It appears that they fled
                  from their homes on account of a deadly pestilence that was destroying all that
                  became its victims; but that dreadful messenger of death followed them, and
                  tradition tells us that several of their number were found dead in the vessel that
                  brought them over. The dreadful plague broke out in our town, and did not leave
                  until it victimized our entire clan, with the exceptions of father and myself. We
                  concluded to flee from its deadly ravages by ascending the rugged mountain of
                  Aleova, but we had not reached the summit of the mountain when my father began to
                  exhibit symptoms of the dire pestilence from which we were fleeing. He became the
                  victim of the plague, as did all the rest, and left me alone to pursue my journey.
                  When I had reached the summit of the mountain, I found it level for some distance,
                  but I could not see anything before me but a dense forest, until I came to the
                  brow of the mount, when I had a beautiful view of what I might term a mighty sea
                  of woodland, extending as far in either direction as the eye could reach; but
                  there was a little valley or opening in
                  the forest that seemed to allure my eye, to that beautiful spot I directed my
                  footsteps. I got there in time to kindle a fire and make a bed; where I spent the
                  night, exposed to the ravages of the merciless wild beasts. In the morning, I saw
                  so many inducements held forth to me by the generous hand of nature, that I was
                  tempted to remain, at least for a few years. I erected myself a hermitage, and
                  fitted it up in the best manner I could; attached a garden to the foreground,
                  where I spent a great deal of time cultivating culinary vegetables and flowers. I
                  have spared no pains in endeavoring to beautify the hermitage, by planting
                  ornamental shade trees around it, together with many wild climbing plants, which
                  you might see climbing up the ancient-looking walls of the hermitage; taking these
                  all into consideration it presented rather a romantic appearance. You would not
                  think, (if you could but see the hermitage,) that it was entirely destitute of
                  natural inducements."
               "O it must be perfectly beautiful," said Vestilia, "I would like to visit it very
                  much indeed."
               "Well, after living there a good many years," continued Solum, "I began to think
                  that I would like to know whether there were any specimens of humanity living
                  near; finally I came to the conclusion that I would go on an exploring journey in
                  a few days from the time I got the idea, which day is the present one.
               "When I was fully equipped for the journey I set out, following the little brook
                  that murmurs so sweetly by the hermitage as my guide, which proved to be an
                  infallible one too. I traveled on until the sun was on the evening side of the
                  meridian, when I became tired, and sat down upon a prostrated tree to rest my
                  weary limbs and to muse on the future prospects. While I sat there, I heard such
                  beautiful sounds, which made me think of the music of the fabled fairies or
                  sylphs, whose lyric cadences were wafted upon the listless zephyr that sweeps so
                  gently over the sombre forest; but again, the thought occurred to me that those
                  sounds were too forcible to be imagined. I crossed the brook, and commenced to
                  penetrate the thick forest with the music as my pilot, when at last I came to
                  where the dense forest gave way to a beautiful open country, whereon I saw many
                  grazing herds, (which I presume was your property) then I could hear the music
                  more distinctly, but I could not tell
                  from whence it proceeded, but I at last ascertained that the music came from
                  behind a clump of hazel bushes somewhat in the distance. I did not wish to go up
                  immediately behind the shrubbery for fear that I might frighten whoever might be
                  the origin of such exquisite music, but I took a circuitous route, that I might be
                  observed while in the distance, and thus avoid the many difficulties that might
                  ensue as a result of fear or sudden fright. When I came in view, I saw your
                  daughter Vestilia, singing and playing in that beautiful style, which you are
                  better acquainted with than I am. That is but a concise sketch of my history; if I
                  was to furnish you with a complete detail of my chequered life, it would take more
                  than one day to furnish it."
               "I should think so," said Tuelia, "but I must candidly confess, that I have
                  listened to your narrative, with deep interest; it contains a great many very
                  entertaining items. You have mingled with your sorrowful picture," continued
                  Tuelia, "beauty and romance, making on the whole, nothing less than a grand and
                  beautiful combination; a noble scheme for some writer of romance."
               "O dear," said Vestilia, "how I would love to behold the hermitage. It seems to
                  me, to appear like some antiquated novel scenery, like what I have read of, but
                  never witnessed. To see its ancient looking wall hung about with flowers, in
                  careless festoons; to see the noble shade trees, whose umbrage casts a gloom over
                  the solitary castle. Methinks that it would almost rival paradise itself. Is the
                  distance so great that no one can visit it; I mean of our sex?"
               "Yes ma'am," replied Solum, "I think it is. It is a great ways at present, owing
                  to the almost impenetrable woodland that intervenes; but on the other hand, if the
                  way was clear, without obstruction, it might be reached without much difficulty,
                  but still, even then you would not find enough to interest—to repay you for your
                  trouble."
               "That is even so," remarked Pastores, "you must be contented, my daughter, with
                  only its history or description. It is now getting late, Vestilia, will you get
                  your guitar and play a few tunes, after which we will retire, for I presume Solum
                  feels greatly fatigued from the turmoils of the day."
               Vestilia got her guitar, and played a few tunes and sang a few songs, after which,
                  they all retired to sleep or dream, as was their lot. Solum was shown a large ante-chamber, wherein were two beds.
                  He had not slept in the ordinary bed, which is used by the higher rank of
                  humanity, for many long and tedious years; but a bed similar to those in the room
                  where he was, he had never witnessed, much less, slept on one.
               Solum laid him down upon the downy couch, not to sleep, I am afraid, but to muse
                  on the novel transactions of the day; but he did not forget to turn his thoughts
                  for a moment to the future. His greatest anxiety was, to have a private interview
                  with Vestilia. His heart began to swell with true and ardent love for her; he knew
                  she was pure and unsophisticated—free from the blighting influences of evil
                  company, and glowing with true virtue, a gem not in the possession of every
                  representative of her noble sex.
               He began to build castles in the air; to lay plans for the future, how he might
                  win and woo the angel hearted Vestilia; the true living representative of his
                  lamented Lelia. But as yet, he knew no obstacle in the way, hindering the
                  execution of his plans, in accordance to his intentions; he knew not that there
                  was something of paramount importance which he had to possess, ere he could enter
                  the society of the Aleovan shepherds, and without which, he was destined to become
                  their enemy; he did not know that her parents, who had been so kind and hospitable
                  to him, would rise up against him, and finally expel him from their presence and
                  approbation, excepting he could manage to become in possession of the requisite
                  recommendation.
               While Solum lay thinking, he at last felt his eyes grow heavy, when he dropped
                  into a sweet slumber; and there we will leave him, and softly steal into the
                  sleeping chamber of the old shepherd and wife, and listen while they expatiate on
                  the merits of their now sleeping guest.
               Vestilia slept in a little room leading off from her parents, and the door betwixt
                  the rooms always stood ajar, for she did not feel exactly satisfied to sleep in a
                  room alone. When her parents conversed, it was easy for her to hear the whole, as
                  she desired. She had retired somewhat earlier than her parents, that she might
                  feign herself asleep when they came to bed, for she was anxious to hear their
                  conversation, which would be concerning the hermit.
               
               After they had got themselves snugly deposited in bed, the following conversation
                  issued:
               "Tuelia, what do you think of the hermit?" asked Pastores.
               "O, I like him very much, from what I have seen of him. He makes a very fine
                  appearance indeed."
               "He tells rather an instructing tale of himself; don't you think so, Tuelia?"
               "Very instructing indeed! I don't know when I was so well entertained as I was
                  this evening while listening to his narrative."
               "Don't you anticipate some trouble with our daughter and that stranger?" asked
                  Pastores, in a low whisper, fearing Vestilia might not be sleeping as soundly as
                  she appeared.
               "I shouldn't wonder at all if we would have considerable trouble. Oh! dear, I wish
                  that he had never been introduced to us; then we would have no anxiety about her
                  whatever. I think it our best plan to dismiss him early in the morning; because,
                  the sooner his presence is expelled from her company, the less will be the
                  impression upon the heart of our only child. Don't you think so, husband?"
               "Yes, my dear Tuelia, that is precisely my plan; but is it not a great pity that
                  he is in such indigent circumstances? If he could furnish the necessary
                  recommendations, which our by-laws so strictly require, there would not be a man
                  belonging to our whole tribe that I would fancy in preference to him; but who
                  would be so disgraced—so reduced in society—as to violate one of our most
                  prominent codes, by letting his daughter marry a man so indigent, when a little
                  exertion on his part might easily prevent all dissatisfactory proceedings."
               'My dear husband, do not be so confident about the execution of that last remark
                  you made. I beg leave to differ from you; because it can not be easily done, with
                  all our exertions, if Vestilia is determined to oppose us, which I am pretty sure
                  she will, and there are many facts or circumstances which go to prove the
                  infallibility of my assertion. The first I shall mention is, that she has never
                  had any one to pay her attention since she has come forward; secondly, there is
                  something very sweet and winning in the expression of Solum, which almost tempts
                  me to violate that by-law, and encourage his company; but what I mean to say is, that she will make but
                  feeble efforts to discountenance that winning, prepossessing look or expression.
                  Other probable reasons might be advanced, but those just stated will prove
                  sufficient. It is truly a hard task to check the progress of true love, even when
                  it is kindled but a little; it would be similar to the exertion of the boy who
                  undertook to extinguish the flame that had caught hold of his sister's clothes, by
                  blowing it with a fan—a means that only enhanced the difficulty instead of
                  ameliorating it."
               "That may be all true what you have been saying, Tuelia, but I shall use my utmost
                  endeavors to counteract it. The best way to commence will be to reason the matter
                  with her, tell her of the awful disgrace she would be the means of bringing upon
                  her people by marrying a stranger, especially one who is in such indigent
                  circumstances. If it was not for the fear that Solum and Vestilia would form an
                  inseparable attachment to each other, I would certainly hire him as a herdsman,
                  which we stand greatly in need of. You need Vestilia to assist you in the
                  household affairs, but under the existing circumstances you can not have her
                  assistance for a moment when the flocks are in the, field; but the way matters
                  look at this time, I think I shall defer making any bargain with him until some
                  future time." Thus they conversed till each grew weary and fell asleep, without
                  thinking for a moment that the sleep, the snoring of their daughter was only
                  feigned. She was wide awake during the whole conversation and heard everything
                  that passed between them; many things which made her tender heart ache, especially
                  those that were uttered derogatory to the character of her dearest Solum. She felt
                  a desire to be with him that she might communicate to him what he might expect in
                  the approaching future. She heard statements that would be hard for her to
                  approve; mandates constructed which would be doubtfully obeyed. Thus ran her
                  thoughts in such a self-determined train, until the subtle monster, sleep, had
                  closed his nocturnal gates upon her.
               In the morning, Solum rose up early to take his long accustomed walk. He was in
                  the habit of rising early for many years, that he might walk abroad to enjoy the
                  soul-refreshing breeze of the early morning, to listen to the merry songs of the
                  feathered warblers, as they re-echo from the wild-wood wood, to behold the majestic sun as he seems to
                  clamber over the orient heights to look down upon the smiling vales beneath. He
                  loved to breath the morning air, because it was impregnated with the aroma of ten
                  thousand beautiful sweet scented flowers that bloom over the fields, and through
                  the wild forests; he loved the morning zephyr because its, gentle breath caused
                  the delicate petals to expand their beauty and shake off their dewy encumbrances,
                  which weighed them down during the shades of the night, and display all the beauty
                  in common to the flowering world. These with many other enjoyments were the glory
                  of his life, the stroke that caused his heart-strings of pleasure to vibrate. He
                  loved those early rambles, as the merry school-boy does his gambols on the school
                  grounds.
               When Solum was returning from his morning stroll, he saw a young maiden tripping
                  along at a "hop, skip and a jump" rate, singing at the same time a merry song.
                  which seemed to be adapted to the gait. As she drew nearer to him, he began to
                  recognize the smiling countenance of Vestilia. She had been sent by her mother to
                  one of the neighbors on an errand. It was a lucky moment for them, for each had
                  been wishing for a desirable opportunity to afford them the sweet interview which
                  they had been looking so anxiously for. There was a weight upon each of their
                  hearts, which, they mutually desired to have removed, which could only be done on
                  an occasion similar to the one in contemplation. They met, as the poet says, "by
                  chance," and that chance was to transact business that would remain as permanent,
                  as lasting as life itself.
               When they had fully met, the following conversation issued:
               "O, good morning, Solum, how do you do this beautiful morning—have you recovered
                  from the effects of yesterday's hardship?"
               "Yes ma'am, I thank you. I feel entirely restored to my usual feelings. I rested
                  very well last night, slept very soundly."
               "I am very glad to hear it indeed, Solum. You must have risen very early this
                  morning, did you not?"
               "Yes, ma'am; but that is an old habit of mine, which I have lived up to since I
                  was a mere child but I very seldom had the extreme pleasure of meeting one of the
                  fairer members of society in my
                  rambles; but do not infer, from that, that I am not fully able to appreciate what
                  I now enjoy."
               "O, no, Solum, there is no danger of such heartless conclusions on my part. I feel
                  exceedingly glad that I am permitted to meet you here alone, for I have many
                  things of great interest to communicate to you; but I did not expect such a
                  blessed opportunity, until you had left for your respected destination."
               "Pray, what is the difficulty that you allude to now?" asked Solum, with a look of
                  anxiety.
               "Solum, I feel rather delicate to express what I mean," replied Vestilia, with a
                  pitiful expression on her face.
               "Oh! dear Vestilia, do tell me what that difficulty is, that seems to weigh down
                  your innocent heart. I vow, if you will but communicate the secret to me, I will
                  lend my endeavors to ameliorate the matter."
               "Solum, I thank you very much for your kind offer; but I shall be compelled to
                  decline it, on account of its inefficacy; for nothing short of the lapse of years
                  can wholly ameliorate the heartfelt difficulty."
               "Ah! fear not, sweet Vestilia; only tell me, and I shall endeavor to make you
                  happy—endeavor to emancipate you from the thraldom under which you seem to labor;
                  therefore, speak your whole heart, dearest Vestilia."
               "Kind Solum, since you have proffered your attachment to the interest of my
                  unworthy self, it would be worse than cruel to refuse you any longer your humble
                  request. It is simply this: my parents are opposed, and that bitterly, too, to my
                  associating with you, and have strictly forbidden me to converse with you."
               "Why? oh, why, Vestilia, are they so bitterly opposed to my company? What harm
                  have I done them—what injury have I been to their character? Can you explain why
                  my person has become so odious—especially in so short a time?" inquired Solum,
                  with a sorrowful change upon his countenance.
               "Yes, dear Solum, I can tell you; but would that I could not! would that the
                  slumbers of midnight had taken me away from the world of hearing, so that what I
                  now know might have been in the trusty hands of obscurity! but perhaps the
                  revelation will add alike to the promotion of our welfare. While I laid upon my couch feigning myself
                  asleep, I overheard their conversation, which was, as near as I can remember, as
                  follows: They said that they thought a great deal of your personal appearance,
                  thought your manners were superior, and your intellectual capacity almost
                  supernatural; but, notwithstanding all those accomplishments, you could not win
                  their approbation unless you possessed wealth. I know," continued Vestilia, "that
                  it is against the custom or by-law of the Aleovan shepherds, to marry with any who
                  are not in affluent circumstances; but still, under the existing circumstance—I
                  mean, the age of my parents-I had thought that they would surely employ you as a
                  herdsman; but they are too fearful that we might establish an intimacy betwixt us
                  that could never be eradicated, and thus be the means, as they would say, of
                  bringing their grey hairs with sorrow to the grave."
               "I am very sorry indeed," said Solum; "but I hope to hear better news ere long. My
                  father's dying blessing was that I should rise to eminence, yea, to pre-eminence.
                  I look as earnestly for the fulfillment of that prophesy, as you do for the
                  morning light, after the long, dreamy hours of a wearisome night. Vestilia, I must
                  not keep you here conversing any longer—they will be wondering why you tarry so
                  long—therefore, hasten to your dear mother, and be obedient to her injunctions,
                  and look for a brighter and better day to adorn your pathway." With that kind
                  admonition, Vestilia tripped along, singing as merrily as if nothing had
                  transpired, until she arrived at her father's castle, where she found her mother
                  busily engaged with the breakfast arrangements.
               "Why Vestilia," said her mother, "how smart and active you have been? You must
                  have run all the way there and back again, did you not?"
               "Yes ma'am, I ran some of the way, but do you really think that I returned very
                  soon, mother?" inquired Vestilia, feeling glad in the prospects of the secresy of
                  their morning chit-chat.
               "Yes my daughter, I do think that you have been very expeditious—if always so, I
                  shall never have an occasion to reprove you, no, never." As Tuelia was making that
                  remark, Solum stepped in from his morning walk.
               "Good morning madam," said Solum.
               "Good morning," responded Tuelia, rather coolly.
               
               "It is a very beautiful morning indeed; I have just been out trying to enjoy it. I
                  took a stroll over your pasture-lands, and found them very extensive and
                  beautiful," said Solum, endeavoring to draw the old lady out in a
                  conversation.
               "Yes sir, rather so," replied Tuelia, in a snappish tone, as if she did not wish
                  to cultivate his acquaintance any further, which was the case no doubt.
               Solum was very ready to discern the cool manner in which Tuelia treated him,
                  especially after having teen previously forewarned of the existing difficulty. He
                  saw that his presence was becoming more and more odious, therefore he came to the
                  conclusion, the sooner he got himself away from the pasture-land of old Pastores,
                  the sooner satisfactory quietness would be restored.
               After breakfast was over with, Pastores took Solum into the sitting room, as he
                  wished to hold a little conversation with him, previous to his departure for the
                  hermitage.
               "Solum," said Pastores, "I had a notion to hire you to act in the capacity of a
                  herdsman, but after further consideration of the subject, I concluded to wait
                  another year, and perhaps if you should be down this way near the expiration of
                  that time, you may stand a good chance of getting substantial employment, as long
                  as you choose to do honor to your station, but at present I shall not make any
                  engagements."
               "But before you return to your hermitage," continued the old shepherd, "leave your
                  knapsack in the kitchen with the women, and they will fill it with the necessaries
                  for the way." That was rather a plain hint for Solum to bestir himself and leave
                  the castle; therefore he arose to obey the dictates of the sly hint. He went into
                  the hall to look for his knapsack, but he found that it was gone. The generous
                  hearted Vestilia had taken it into the kitchen to store it well with rich
                  provisions, enough to last for a week. That task she performed, before she left
                  with the flocks. She had been forbidden by her mother to wait for the assistance
                  of Solum, for her father wished to speak with him awhile.
               Solum went into the kitchen in search of his knapsack, but there was no one there
                  save Tuelia, and she appeared to be unusually busy, so that she did not as much as
                  notice him, until he spoke, inquiring for his knapsack, when she pointed to a chair that stood over in the other
                  corner, Whereon was the article he was looking for.
               "Madam, I am under many obligations to you and your husband, for the kindness you
                  have so bountifully bestowed upon me, and am very sorry that I was the means of
                  giving you so much extra trouble, but I hope that I shall be able to repay you at
                  a future day."
               You are welcome to all that we have done for you," said Tuelia in a hurried manner
                  as if to curtail the conversation instantly—that Solum might take the hint and go
                  without any further preliminaries.
               "I wish you good morning," said Solum, as he stepped towards the door.
               Good morning," replied Tuelia, with an air of satisfaction at the strangers
                  exit.
               "O dear! how glad I am that that plague pest is gone at last" thought Tuelia, "but
                  I fear that will not be the last of him he will go to Vestilia in the field and
                  beguile her innocent heart and persuade her to form an alliance with him and thus
                  ruin her forever; but still I have great hopes that she will be better able to
                  take care of herself than to allow a person so poor, so indigent, to approach the
                  portals of her unsophisticated heart." While she was thus thinking, Pastores, her
                  husband came into the kitchen, and took a seat by the window, saying,
               "Is the stranger gone, Tuelia?"
               "Yes, and I am exceedingly glad of it. I thought that he was ever going to start,"
                  said Tuelia in an unfeeling manner.
               "Why are you so bitter against the stranger, wife; has he insulted you?" asked
                  Pastores, as if he felt somewhat ashamed of his wife's rashness.
               "No, he did not, but I have been fearing that we might lose our ancestral,
                  aristocratic seat in the Aleovan society, by his intimacy with our daughter,
                  Vestilia."
               "Well, but don't you know," said Pastores, attempting slyly to rebuke, "that it is
                  one of the rules of our society, to be kind and hospitable to strangers—to feed
                  the starving poor?"
               "Yes sir I know all that," replied Tuelia in a pettish manner, as if she did not
                  fancy the merited rebuke. "But I don't," she continued, "like to have a stranger
                  loitering about the house, especially when I know his intentions are not in
                  accordance with my approbation."
               
               "You do not mean to say, wife, that Vestilia has any friendship or regard for
                  Solum at this present time? I think she is a girl of more judgment than to form an
                  attachment for any one who may be in such indigent, such destitute circumstances
                  apparently, especially when she is well aware that it is a direct violation of the
                  rules of the society, which we have so long adhered to."
               "Well, I hope she is a girl of better judgment, but I have my reasons for keeping
                  on the alert. I am afraid it would not take much to lead her astray. What is your
                  opinion on the subject?"
               "Well, I do not know what to think about it. You ought to know more about her
                  inclinations than I do, she being much more in your company. However, I do not
                  think that there is much danger of her becoming engaged to him for fear of being
                  disinherited. She would dislike to be dispelled from her old homestead very much,
                  especially for a man who could offer so few inducements as Solum."
               "It is a pity," said Tuelia, "that he possesses so much personal beauty, such a
                  pleasant look, &c., because we might have employed him as a herdsman, without
                  fearing the results."
               "That is a fact," replied Pastores, "but I told him that I thought I would try and
                  get along without help another year, and if he came along about that time, I might
                  employ him."
               "Well husband, if you told him that, then that's enough; you will have him to
                  trouble you, no doubt, no danger that he will wait any longer than the year; but
                  it will be all right enough provided we succeed in getting Vestilia married."
               "O nonsense, Tuelia, you might be greatly mistaken."
               Thus they conversed together for hours without change of subject. But my reader
                  must leave the old folks to the enjoyment of their chit-chat, and turn your
                  attention to Solum and his whereabouts.
               After Solum had left the castle of the old shepherd, he directed his footsteps
                  towards the wilds of Aleova. He determined to have an interview with the object of
                  his heart, Vestilia, ere he had commenced to plant his footsteps in the wild
                  forest. As he was strolling across the fields, he observed Vestilia, sitting
                  beneath the umbrage of an ancient looking spruce tree, reading. While Solum was a
                  good ways off, he walked as though he
                  intended to pass her by unnoticed; but as he turned his head to see whether she
                  had really observed him or not, when be saw her gentle hand wave an invitation,
                  beckoning him to approach her, he was not long responding to her silent
                  invitation; but his hurried footsteps soon ushered him in the presence of his
                  hearts desire.
               "I thought you intended to pass me by unnoticed, I think that would have been very
                  cruel," said Vestilia.
               "Pardon me Vestilia, I must confess that actions often speak louder than words,
                  but in this case you were deceived. I resorted to that stratagem merely to know
                  its results; but if you had not beckoned to me, I certainly would have approached
                  you, especially on this most favorable occasion."
               "Well I am exceedingly glad to meet you here," said Vestilia, with her whole
                  countenance lit up with a soul-cheering smile. "But if my parents knew," continued
                  Vestilia "that you and I were together in the field, they would be exceedingly
                  angry at me. I know that it is wrong for me to disobey or violate any of their
                  mandates, especially those connected with reason and sound judgment. They did not
                  forbid me to entertain you in the field, nor would I think that I was doing wrong
                  even if the had forbidden me."
               "I am sorry that your people have imbibed such strange notions, especially in
                  regard to wealth. Oh! that I was wealthy, not that I love it, but only that I
                  might accomplish my determination. No more would I penetrate the dreary wilds of
                  Aleova; no more would solitude claim me as its victim."
               Vestilia had thought to ask Solum, what were those determinations he had spoken
                  of; but her heart failed her, but again she thought it would be inconsiderate to
                  ask such a question, especially at that critical moment, for the future would
                  frame a sufficient answer to her inquiring mind.
               "Solum," said Vestilia, after a moment of profound thought "I can not bear to have
                  you leave me, to penetrate the gloomy wilds of Aleova, all alone. If it was not
                  for that bright hope upon my heart, telling me that there is a better day to dawn
                  on our, existence; a day that you and I will be free from the thraldom of
                  superstition and error; I say, if it was not for that sweet hope, I Would forsake
                  all and follow you through the rugged
                  pathway of life. My heart desires you to stay, although I know I have no desirable
                  way to entertain you; my very heart rebels against the firm decrees of my parents;
                  not my parents alone but my people; can it be that you must go and leave me? Oh!
                  Solum, Solum."
               "My dear Vestilia, do not feel so badly, remember if I go, I am not gone forever;
                  I shall return again to your rural seat, where I know I shall meet a hearty
                  welcome, despite the imprecations of your venerable parents. All I want is one
                  thing, and that I fear to ask."
               "What is that dear Solum," asked Vestilia, with an earnest expression. "Do not be
                  afraid to ask me anything you desire, for you maybe sure that your feelings are
                  reciprocated."
               "Well, what I want is this," replied Solum, with a trembling voice, "will you
                  tender to me, your pure unsophisticated affections, and consent to become my sweet
                  companion for life, in case the mighty barrier in the way, can be removed, I mean
                  the reconciliation betwixt your parents and I."
               "Yes, dear Solum, I will consent to anything that you desire, provided it will be
                  right and judicious."
               "Dear Vestilia, I now feel happy; my soul is strong with gladness; I feel that I
                  have accomplished one of the great ends of my existence, and that there was but a
                  moiety for me to accomplish. I feel happy that you have thus condescended from
                  your elevated position in life, to notice a lonely wanderer. Yea, what is more,
                  you have offered your lovely self to soothe and cheer me, after so many
                  adversities have blown across my pathway. Oh! Vestilia, how can I ever repay for
                  even a half of the many kindnesses you have bestowed upon me."
               "Believe me, dear Solum," said Vestilia, "I have been amply paid already. I have
                  not loved you more than you have reciprocated. Pardon me, dear Solum, if there is
                  anything amiss in what I am going to say. I love you dearly, and have continued to
                  do so ever since I first became acquainted with you; that you was the very picture
                  of innocence and beauty—my very beau-ideal. I know that the time is short since we
                  first met, but it seems to me that I have known you for years; that your familiar
                  countenance had met my gaze often. But can it be the spiritless phantom of
                  imagination; can it be that I am betrayed; can it be that my most ardent love has not been
                  reciprocated; can it be that I have foolishly sold my hand to a vile wanderer, a
                  rake, hastily given up my person to a heartless betrayer? Oh! tell me—speak quick
                  or I die—relieve me from the impending ruin that is ready to crush my fainting
                  heart, till its gentle sobs shall heave no more." As she said that, she fell with
                  face towards the ground, Weeping as if her innocent heart would break with
                  swelling emotions.
               "Oh! do not do so, if you love me, dear Vestilia! do not think for a moment that I
                  am anything not desirable, for I vow that my heart is as free from deceit and
                  villainy, as the blushing rose is from venom. Vestilia sit up and let us seal our
                  affections with a kiss, and may it remain united until these feeble tenements that
                  instituted the vow, shall have crumbled to her mother dust."
               After they had sat there many hours, Solum arose to depart saying, "Vestilia, the
                  day is fast wearing away, and I must be going, or gloomy night will overtake me
                  ere I reach the lonely hermitage."
               "No, no, dear Solum!" replied Vestilia with a heart that seemed to feel each
                  expression as it was uttered. "You can not and must not leave me to-day. You must
                  be content to remain one more day with me, after that I shall be able to tell you
                  what course to pursue. I have surreptitiously made provisions or preparations to
                  that effect. I have filled your knapsack with biscuits and other eatables, so that
                  you could remain if you choose."
               "I am very thankful to you, dear Vestilia, for your kindness. I am willing to
                  weather any difficulty for your gratification, but I shall have to keep myself in
                  concealment lest your parents should happen to find me out, when you would have to
                  bear a severe reprimand."
               "O dear! have no fears about that," said Vestilia with a joyful expression,
                  perhaps from her success, "you shall fare well; you shall sleep in the same
                  chamber that you did last night, without being molested, without being discovered
                  at all; and I pledge, my love, that you shall be well taken care of. You can enter
                  your chamber late and leave it early, and thus avoid being detected. When you go
                  to the fields, on your way home, stop beneath the umbrage of this spreading tree
                  where I am accustomed to sit, and wait until I come, for I presume I shall have some important
                  news to communicate to you in regard to our more immediate future. I can not
                  promise you what will be the character of that news, whether cheerful or sad, but
                  one thing I can promise you, and that is, it shall be the best news that my feeble
                  efforts can produce under the existing circumstances."
               Thus Vestilia and Solum sat, and merrily chatted the day away. The flight of time
                  seemed to them to be so rapid, that hours were but mere momentary notations,
                  leaving but little impression as they swept onward over the sea of life. It seemed
                  too transient in its stay to enable them to transact the business of importance
                  yet unfinished—business for time, yea, for eternity! Evening came stealing upon
                  them, when it seemed to them that the morning dew had scarcely evaporated. The
                  morning, midday, noonday and evening, had each passed away respectively,
                  completing the cycles of another day; but it seemed that those happy hearts—those
                  happy lovers—knew not those changes, till, at last, the sinking sun reminded them
                  that he was about to close the labors of the day; and bidding nature prepare for
                  the gloomy shadow, he (the sun) was about to throw around them. Those busy lovers
                  aroused from their wonted slumber of love, but to see the last brilliant rays of
                  the sun melt into the feeble glare of twilight.
               "Vestilia, is it possible that the sun is setting in the western horizon already?
                  Have we not been dreaming all this time? It is not possible that the evening
                  shades are casting their sable garb around. O love! great must be thy charms, when
                  thou canst cause the wheels of time to move so listlessly along, and cause the
                  iron wheels of trouble to glide smoothly along the rugged pathway of life, as if
                  over the 'downy pillows of ease.'"
               "Yes, dear Solum, it has swiftly fled away, emblematic of the days when our
                  devoted hearts shall be united, and the twain shall be one. Then anticipate an
                  endless succession of such happy days, if it were possible. I declare! it is time
                  for me to drive my herds home."
               They kissed each other, and parted for the day, to meet once more in the morning,
                  ere they parted for a longer season.
               Vestilia drove home the herds, and put them in their respective folds, and then
                  went to her mother at the castle, to
                  assist her in the kitchen. She had not been there long, ere the following
                  conversation took place:
               "Vestilia, my daughter, did you see Solum after you took the flocks to the
                  fields?" asked Tuelia, rather pointedly.
               "Yes, mother, I did. He came by me, on his way home," replied Vestilia, with a
                  frank spirit, as if she was prepared to combat any interrogation readily.
               "Did he stay long with you?" inquired Tuelia, continuing to be, what most women
                  are—inquisitive.
               "Well, he staid a while with me; but why do you ask me that question? Do you not
                  think that I am capable of taking care of myself, out of your sight?" asked
                  Vestilia, in a dissatisfied tone.
               "O no, I don't mean that. I merely wanted to know something about it."
               "Well, mother, I believe you have never told me your candid opinion in relation to
                  Solum. Don't you think that he is a very fine, gentlemanly-behaved young man?"
               "Well, I think he is all that; but what recommendation would that be to him, when
                  he does not possess wealth? Poverty degrades all, wealth reclaims all."
               "Oh! mother, how foolish that seems to me! Is a man degraded because misfortune
                  and adversity have frowned on his future prospects?"
               "Well, you know, my daughter, that it is against the rules of our society, to
                  marry or associate with any who are not able to command an independent
                  income."
               "Yes, mother, I know all that; but do you consider it an honest by-law—a just and
                  holy code? Don't you think that it is fallacious throughout?"
               "No, my dear, I do not. I think it is a capital plan, to keep beggars and indigent
                  folks from our society."
               When Vestilia had heard that last expression of her mother's, she gave up the idea
                  of winning her over to her satisfaction. She fouled that it was useless to attempt
                  to change her mind, for it was immutable. She had too long lived under that
                  custom—that by-law, which had almost become a second nature to her. She still
                  remained intrepid, saying, that she would not barter away what she almost
                  considered her very existence, that is her pure aristocratical elevation in society. Pastores
                  and wife stood among the hightest of the clan, and they felt no little pride in
                  the knowledge of that fact. It would take a multiplicity of offers paramount to
                  that of Solum, to make them swerve from their antiquated customs; but the by-law
                  in itself, had few virtues to commend it to the approbation of mankind in general;
                  it being a mere whimsical attempt at a code, but having neither sound reason for
                  its origin nor common sense for its motive.
               As I was looking over a portion of my tradition papers, I found, that we may
                  expect trouble in the camp; a trouble that neither Solum nor Vestilia dreamed of.
                  I will pretty soon introduce a suspicious old genius to your consideration, and if
                  you can find any traits in his character, that are remarkably peculiar, I must
                  confess that you have discovered the true man. This old gentleman in contemplation
                  was one of Pastores' nearest neighbors, and in whom he strongly confided. He was
                  his only friend (I may say) in council. The name of that old shepherd was Cleardo,
                  a good, honest, upright and intelligent old man, with all his peculiarities. He
                  had his failings, like mankind in general, but his ruling difficulty was, his
                  interference with matters and circumstances which were under the special
                  supervision of the owners; he wished to dictate for others with the same authority
                  that he managed his own affairs, a fault well calculated to irritate
                  friendship.
               That old Cleardo had but two children, a son and a daughter. The daughter was
                  grown up to be a young maiden, while the son lacked two years of being as old as
                  his sister, or as they counted, he was two years a minor. Old Cleardo was in the
                  habit of visiting the house of Pastores very frequently, but they did not
                  attribute his numerous visits for any object short of sociability and friendship;
                  but Cleardo knew (if they did not) what his intentions were. He saw that he
                  (Pastores) had a beautiful young daughter growing up, which would make a suitable
                  companion for his minor son. He endeavored to keep her under his eye, that he
                  might know whether any one attempted to interfere with what he considered his
                  prerogative. He had never spoken of the subject to Pastores; but he thought that
                  there was no immediate hurry, as long as his son remained a minor, and no one
                  interfered. But he stood on the alert,
                  watching to see the least interference, when he would plead his suit,
                  energetically.
               I do not suppose that the subject of Vestilia's alliance with Cleardo's son, had
                  ever entered the minds of her parents. They knew of Cleardo's wealth, his family,
                  &c.; but 'tis strange they never thought on that subject, especially when the
                  two families have long been so intimate.
               As I intimated before, that Cleardo did not see any reason why he should expedite
                  his plea, but I would say, if he had known the secresy or intimacy of Vestilia and
                  Solum, he would be on his muscles, full of excitement, or in some uncontrolable
                  situation; but as Vestilia would say, "I thank fortune he knows nothing about it,
                  nor do I mean he shall."
               It was the custom of the Aleovans, to inter-marry among themselves, I don't allude
                  to relationship, but amongst their neighbors. They would not object to a stranger
                  marrying amongst them, provided he had the necessary recommendation, but they
                  preferred an Aleovan by birth, that they might be enabled (as they say) to keep
                  all their wealth together, I mean in the same horde. The strict observance of that
                  by-law, would undoubtedly lead to gross degeneracy or idiocy, but they did not
                  observe the letter of the code, they only observed it as far as the laws of nature
                  and man would agree.
               I shall speak of the old shepherd Cleardo, under another connection, as his
                  history or traits will prove somewhat entertaining.
               Solum was the common parlance at the house of the old shepherd, for many days
                  after he had left. He was a person of exquisite beauty, of vast intellectual
                  attainments, so that it was difficult for any one to form a derogatory opinion of
                  him, who was not in the least influenced by prejudice. If he had been a man of
                  wealth, he would have been the greatest personage that had ever visited their
                  horde. In fact they were almost persuaded to risk the consequences that would
                  ensue, from such an open violation of one of their strenuous injunctions. Perhaps
                  if the same opportunity is brought to bear, that it would be cordially accepted,
                  for it was evident that there was something preying upon their minds, not entirely
                  satisfactory; but there is no telling what would be the result when old Cleardo
                  gets wind of the proceedings, no doubt
                  but that he will strive to have matters and things work for his best interest.
               The next day, Solum and Vestilia had met under the spreading branches of the same
                  spruce tree that they had agreed to the day previous. It was a beautiful morning
                  indeed. The sun shone forth in all its wanted splendor, and the birds were piping
                  their sweet melody, in tones of musical shrillness as if they formed an orchestra
                  for the occasion. The soft and gentle flowing breeze seemed to utter but a faint
                  sigh, as it passed through the tiny boughs of the spruce overhead; but anon a
                  rigid gale from the over. land would kindle the sighing dirge into a profound
                  murmur, which would seem to add solemnity to the occasion. The noisy, babbling
                  brook that ran by the scene, greatly enhanced the beauty of the life-like tableau.
                  It came whirling and dancing over the many verdant turfs which stood in the
                  channel, and sometimes as if engaged in a merry laugh, as it ran away to parts
                  unknown. These, with the Aleovan forest in the background, constituted the
                  tableau, the morning after the secreted slumber.
               Before Vestilia had arrived, Solum had collected a beautiful bouquet of wild
                  flowers to bestow upon her when she had arrived. By and by, he saw her Grecian
                  figure emerge into view, followed by a long train of cattle and sheep. They seemed
                  to follow her, as if they know that she was better adapted to select the most
                  luxuriant pasture.
               When she had come to the spruce tree, they saluted each other with a kiss, and
                  after that sat down to the following conversation:
               "Vestilia, here is a bouquet of flowers I collected for you this morning. Ain't
                  they beautiful?"
               "Perfectly beautiful," replied Vestilia, in a delighted tone, "I am very much
                  obliged to you indeed."
               "O, not at all. They are not worthy of thanks, for they grow too
                  spontaneously."
               "Well, but that does not make any difference. I do not take into consideration the
                  value of the flowers; but the donor and the spirit in which they were
                  presented."
               "I am exceedingly obliged to you for the compliment," said Solum, as if be felt
                  somewhat flattered. "They might have been more acceptable if they were unfading," continued Solum, "but alas!
                  they soon wither away. They seem to shrink, from the lily-white hand that clasps
                  them, as if the fond grasp was too rude for their tender forms; but I sincerely
                  hope that your fate may not be like that wilted nosegay; for the poet says: 
                     
                        'Such is the fate of artless maid,
                        Sweet flow'ret of the rural shade!
                        By love's simplicity betrayed,
                        And guileless trust;
                        Till she, like thee, all soiled, is laid
                        Low in the dust.'"
                     
                  
               
               "O no, I hope not. I am pretty sure that that can not be my destiny, at least
                  under the present circumstances," replied Vestilia, with an air of exultation.
               "I am very glad," said Solum, "that you feel that kind of a spirit within you. It
                  will have a direct tendency to bring about the desired results, keeping you from
                  the many thousand snares and temptations rife. Are there any news this morning,
                  that seem favorable, Vestilia?" asked Solum, rather abruptly, as if he was aware
                  that they had begun to squander the present day away, like yesterday; but which he
                  endeavored to prevent vent, as time was too precious at that critical period.
               "I am sorry to say, I fear not. Fashion, or custom, has triumphantly predominated
                  over all; but, however, I shall remain one and the same—unchangeable throughout my
                  whole course of life."
               "Thank you, my dearest Vestilia, for your candor and determined perseverance,"
                  replied Solum, impressing her rosy lips with a true signification. "But, dear
                  Vestilia, I am sorry to say to you that I must depart. The hour of our separation
                  draws nigh. I must again tread the lonely pathway that leads through the dark and
                  shady forest of Aleova. I must again be exposed to the mercy, or, rather, the
                  ravages of the wild beast; again be a tenant to the gloomy wildwood; there to
                  await the tide of prosperity—there to await the gentle breeze that wafts news that
                  would redound to my earthly glory."
               "Dear Solum, how can I but rebel against the decree that bids you separate
                  yourself from my presence! How can I bear to have you leave me in this unfriendly
                  community! I am almost tempted to have you remain another night with me, that I might make the necessary
                  preparations to accompany you in the morning to your lonely hermitage."
               "O no, dear Vestilia, as you value me and my happiness, do not so rash an act.
                  Desire not to leave your aged parents, but be their present help in every time of
                  need. Wait patiently a little longer, and you may see the tide of adversity roll
                  away—retrograde—and the lapse of time may tell you a sweeter tale than that you
                  attempted to relate. By that time, the old gentleman, your father, may have become
                  reconciled, if not to my wishes, perhaps to the ice-cold hands of death, and thus
                  change the scale; but, however, let us cheerfully wait; perhaps kind fortune may
                  condescend to smile on me. But, dear Vestilia, I must no longer delay. I must
                  start soon, or expect to be left in the open air, with no covering save the blue
                  canopy, for to-night. I will have to hazard my life to the prowling wild animals,
                  if I am unable to reach my lonely hermitage ere the evening shades begin to
                  fall."
               "Since you are determined to go, dear Solum, I bid you God speed. I wish you all
                  the pleasure and success imaginable, and that to attend you through your journey,
                  and safely land you at your cottage, where you may find everything in the
                  predicament you desire."
               Solum thanked Vestilia for her generous wishes, and then took his parting kisses,
                  when they separated, for how long a time I am not prepared to say; but Solum
                  promised to meet her again as soon as he could conveniently, under the shade of
                  the same spruce tree, that had previously afforded them so much comfort by
                  obstructing the scorching rays of the noonday sun.
               Solum and Vestilia are separated at last. Two congenial spirits have ceased to
                  hold their sweet familiar intercourses as they were wont to do, but they did not
                  separate without an avowal, pledging to promote each other's happiness and
                  prosperity when a favorable opportunity could be afforded.
               It is a curious circumstance to learn that Vestilia should engage herself to a
                  stranger, contrary to the wishes and by-laws of the Aleovan shepherds, and thus
                  expose herself to their derision. But when we take an impartial view of the
                  subject, we find that it is an arbitrary one; we feel inclined to doubt the
                  fallacy or substantiality of their
                  by-laws, which they had so long gloried in. Vestilia had many inducements to lead
                  her in the pathway she had chosen, but to speak of them would be but a criminal
                  waste of time, since you all are or may be acquainted with them from the history
                  yon have had already.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               MORE ABOUT CLEARDO.—HIS ATTEMPT AT RIVALRY.
               Vestilia, the shepherdess, is now about to undergo a greater difficulty than any
                  that had previously beset her youthful pathway, since the siege of love had
                  commenced. She imagined that the secret communion which she had with her absent
                  Solum would be a profound secret within her bosom; but oh! in that she labors
                  under a deluded imagination, whose blind dictations will soon expose her error.
                  Cleardo (at the sound of whose name Vestilia frowns) is about to come forth to
                  assist in the drama about to be played. The character which he intends to play, is
                  one of little interest; but how perfectly or how successfully he will play the
                  game of love for the welfare of his noble son, I will leave the narrative to
                  detail.
               As I intimated before, that old neighbor Cleardo do was a meddlesome old genius, but after all that
                  has been said derogatory to his peculiar disposition he was very seldom guilty of
                  that aforesaid crime, without there was some prospect of something favorable to
                  accrue to his own personal interest.
               It happened on the same beautiful morning that Solum had intended to start for his
                  hermitage that old neighbor Cleardo was out strolling over the fields, looking at
                  his herds and flocks, as they grazed quietly on the wide-spread savannas, under
                  the auspices of his two children. When he had gratified his curiosity in a
                  measure, he took a notion to transgress on the grounds of his neighbor Pastores
                  for awhile. After he had crossed the line of demarcation betwixt their farms, he
                  espied some person in company with the old shepherd's daughter. He thought that
                  his old neighbor had hired a herdsmen at last; but again, he thought it was very
                  strange that Pastores should do such a thing without first consulting his lordship
                  as he used to; however, there was something in the proceeding which he could not
                  explain, and what was more, nor did he relish. It began to excite or provoke a
                  jealous feeling which actuated him to seek further information on the subject.
                  With his heart teeming with dissatisfaction, he directs his footsteps towards
                  Pastores' castle, where he calculated to gain the necessary information. When he
                  had arrived, at the kitchen door he knocked with his long staff, when he was glad
                  to hear two voices, Pastores and wife, for those were the identical persons he
                  wished to see.
               "Walk in neighbor Cleardo, and rest yourself awhile," said Pastores.
               "How have you all been since I saw you last?" inquired Cleardo.
               "O very well indeed, excepting Tuelia, she is still troubled with her old
                  complaint."
               "What is that" inquired Cleardo, "the headache?"
               "Yes sir, she has it very often indeed, and sometimes very severely."
               "It is a very troublesome difficulty, I assure you. I know something about it; I
                  have it every two or three days."
               "How is your family all at home, I almost forgot to ask," inquired Tuelia.
               "O they are as well as usual—able to attend to their daily responsibilities. Neighbor
                  Pastores," continued Cleardo, "how do your flocks flourish this season, as well as
                  usual?"
               "They seem to be doing remarkably well, much better than I expected."
               "O by the by," said Cleardo, as if some new idea of importance had come across his
                  mind, "you have employed a new herdsman at last, havn't you?"
               "Why what do you mean, neighbor Cleardo?" inquired Pastores, as if he doubted his
                  own ears. "Hired a new herdsman? none that I know of."
               "Now Pastores, don't prevaricate any longer, if you have employed a man to assist
                  in taking care of the flocks, why don't you say so," said Cleardo, in a manner
                  that would lead you to think that he imagined there was some secret
                  connivance.
               "Neighbor Cleardo, do you intend to insult us to our faces, this morning?" asked
                  Pastores, feeling somewhat nettled.
               "O no, no, Pastores, nor nothing of the kind; I beg your pardon, I did'nt mean to
                  convey any such foolish ideas at all," replied Cleardo, looking rather
                  frightened.
               "Well what have you seen or heard, that leads you to ask such a question?"
                  inquired Tuelia.
               "Well I'll tell you. As I was out strolling over my farm this morning, looking at
                  my herds as they quietly grazed by me; I took a notion into my head that I would
                  trespass on your ground for a few moments. As I walked a short distance over your
                  field, I stopped and cast my eyes towards Aleova, when I observed the young man in
                  question, sitting with Vestilia under a large tree. I took it for granted that you
                  had employed him, therefore I thought I would pay you a short visit, and inquire
                  who he was and how you got him, not thinking for a moment but that you knew all
                  about him."
               "Is that possible, neighbor Cleardo? How can that be? Why, we are entirely
                  ignorant of what you speak. You are sure that you saw some one in the field along
                  with Vestilia?"
               "Yes sir, I am quite sure; I thought nothing else but you had employed him."
               "I do wonder if it could be that stranger that lodged with us a few nights ago!"
                  whispered Tuelia.
               "O, I don't think it could have been he, because he was not encouraged in the least to stay," said
                  Pastores, that Cleardo could hear him.
               Old Cleardo began to exhibit signs of uneasiness; he began to think that his plans
                  might be frustrated after all his trouble and pains; that there might be an
                  intervening lover, although he had kept a sharp lookout, for the last year more
                  particularly.
               "Who was that stranger whom you have reference to, that lodged in your house a few
                  nights ago, and where was he from?" inquired Cleardo anxiously.
               "Well, he said he was a stranger from the wilds of Aleova, and dwelt in a
                  hermitage."
               "Well, how did he come to stray away here?" asked Cleardo, still anxious to know
                  about the stranger.
               "The stranger said that he become lonesome, as he had not seen the face of any
                  person but his own, and that he saw reflected from the brook every time be stooped
                  to drink therefrom. This stranger that I am speaking about was very handsome, and
                  intelligent, and I shouldn't wonder a mite if Vestilia was badly smitten with
                  him," said Pastores.
               "But where could he have stayed all this time?" inquired Tuelia.
               "Bless your heart Tuelia," said Cleardo, "he might lie in the open fields, under
                  some shed or in some secreted place, no fears about that if he loved Vestilia. I
                  tell you," continued he, "that you had better keep watch of your daughter, for he
                  might infatuated her, that she might run away with him."
               "O, I don't think that Vestilia would be guilty of such a misdemeanor," said her
                  parent.
               "Well it is always the most advisable plan to keep danger in the prospective, and
                  not suffer it to approach any nearer. And there is another suggestion I would
                  make, and that is, that those migratory rakes never possess any wealth, therefore
                  on that account you had better be careful, for fear you might incur the
                  displeasure of the society."
               "When Vestilia comes home in the evening, neighbor Cleardo, we will ascertain to a
                  certainty who that young gentleman could have been, that you observed in the field
                  this morning."
               "I should like to know who he was, very much indeed," said Cleardo, "because I
                  have had a plan in my own mind for a
                  year or two back, which that stranger might frustrate entirely."
               "O, no danger, neighbor Cleardo; the stranger can not interfere with our
                  injunctions whatever; if we say to Vestilia, no, it shall be so; but I do not
                  apprehend any trouble with her at all, for she always was and is an obedient
                  child."
               "Well, perhaps there is no danger," replied Cleardo, "but I should be rather
                  inclined to be fearful."
               "I presume there would be no harm done if I should state to you my plans at this
                  present time, and if you would but sanction them, you would have an object in view
                  whilst you are fulfilling your promise."
               "O no harm at all," cried Pastores and wife, as if they were elated with the
                  imposing prospects of old neighbor Cleardo's plans, "but on the contrary, we will
                  be much pleased to hear it."
               "Well, it is simply this: you know that you are a very rich man, having only one
                  child and that one a daughter unmarried, and probably without any prospects of
                  that fact being established ere you both drop from the stage of life, for you are
                  both well up in years—both stricken with infirmity, and not able to attend to any
                  amount of duty. Again, you know that my circumstances are near the same as those
                  of your own, only I have been blessed with one more child than you have. You know
                  it is the rules of our society to marry our sons and daughters to persons of like
                  circumstances; therefore, let us put our heads together against all foreign
                  invasion. Supposing that you propose my son to Vestilia, and I will propose your
                  daughter to my son; and if we can effect a unity of hearts, why we have succeeded
                  in keeping a great mass of our wealth together, and thus by that simple means,
                  ward off indigence and beggary, which we so much dread, in a great measure."
               "O won't that be an excellent plan! I sincerely hope that we shall succeed," said
                  Tuelia, as if in ecstacy.
               "There is not the least danger but what we shall succeed if we undertake," said
                  Pastores, with a confidential air.
               Thus the old shepherd and his wife conversed with their old neighbor Cleardo,
                  until near mid-day, when the old gentleman returned home; after which Pastores and Tuelia continued the
                  conversation.
               "Wife, I do wonder if Vestilia would be guilty of such base misdemeanor,
                  especially when there are such glowing prospects to illumine her future?"
               "Indeed, Pastores, I am inclined to credit every word that Cleardo said about
                  Vestilia. O it makes me angry when I think of it! I feel like giving her a
                  complete tongue-lashing—so I do."
               "Pray, whatever you do, wife, don't do that. If you do, you will certainly have
                  occasion to regret your proceedings. You will create in her a resenting spirit
                  that will conquer all your attempts, and frustrate all your plans. The way you
                  will be the most likely to succeed, is by teaching her the evils of such a course,
                  and entreat her to flee from it; for harsh language, and similar treatment, will
                  never subdue the indomitable spirit she possesses."
               "Well, I don't know but you are right, Pastores. Two can very often succeed when
                  one would eventually fail."
               "Wife, it is my candid opinion that we will have considerable trouble, ere we will
                  accomplish anything suitable to our desires, in relation to our daughter; because,
                  if she loved him enough to cause him to secrete himself, as we understand, why,
                  she loved him enough to fight for him through difficulties great and numerous.
                  Remember 'true love is unconquerable.' Vera aimcitia est
                     sempeterna."
               "Pastores, you don't want to discourage me from making an effort? No one can tell
                  what he can accomplish until he makes consecutive attempts," said Tuelia, as if
                  she felt a little agitated at what her husband had said.
               "O no, dear wife, I do not wish to discourage you in the least; but I only was
                  desirous of telling you what you might expect as the result of your attempt. I
                  sincerely hope that you will be successful; for to have one of old Cleardo's
                  children for a son-in-law, is quite an item."
               "I think so, too," said Tuelia. "The name will resound throughout our clan, like a
                  mighty echo, whose reverberations will not cease short of time itself."
               "O don't get too eloquent," said Pastores, with a smile, "for fear your sanguine anticipations may
                  be blasted in the bud—for fear the dazzling sunshine of matrimonial prospects be
                  eclipsed by unexpected frustrations—and then what would become of the name you
                  speak of?"
               "Pastores, I declare you are a little too hard on me, this afternoon. I can
                  scarcely suggest anything without your turning it into ridicule—without your
                  saying, 'Don't be building castles in the air, for you can not live in them,
                  &c.' Men are always a good deal inclined to prevaricate, when they see that
                  the women look anxious or determined."
               "Come, now, Tuelia, don't throw any blame on your neighbors; but let us try and
                  see what we can accomplish," said Pastores, in a cheerful spirit.
               "I declare, it is past mid-day! I came near forgetting to get dinner. Why didn't
                  you tell me you were hungry, Pastores, and you would not have had to wait so
                  long."
               "Well, I suppose the reason why I did not tell you, was, because I did not feel
                  hungry. A very good reason—don't you think so, wife?"
               In like manner those venerable shepherds whiled away the remainder of the day—not
                  suffering fering, for a moment, their conversation to wander from that seemingly
                  all-important subject, Vestilia, and who would be her suitor, in time to come.
               It is an old adage, but no less true on account of its seniority, that "the course
                  of true love never runs smooth." At least it appeared so whilst Solum and Vestilia
                  traveled it. They had scarcely commenced to tread its fabled bowery walks, when
                  the angry thorns of difficulty and trouble began to prick their tender feet, so
                  unaccustomed to such subtle foes. They had but commenced to love each other, with
                  pure, undefiled affection, when obstacles of enormous magnitude obstructed their 
                     amitorial
                     amatorial
                   pathway. The quiet surface that usually pervades the sea of love, was
                  misplaced for the overwhelming billows of difficulty, whilst its dashing spray
                  served as a centre of attraction, to allure the gaze of the silly, the imprudent,
                  the frivolous and indolent. They ever stand ready to embrace the first prominent
                  opportunity afforded to them, of ridiculing love's unfortunate victims. They glory
                  in the downfall of its votaries; but oh! what could you better expect from such a
                  cold, unfriendly world—from vain and selfish humanity! You might as well expect fervor in the
                  cold heart of death, as to expect sympathy from the gazing world—especially when a
                  difficulty of an amatorial character is up for their diversion—all is scorn and
                  ridicule. Vestilia found the infallibility of those foregoing sentiments, to her
                  heart's content. She found that she had a world of gain-sayers to compete, aside
                  from the burden of her own ill feelings, which bore heavily upon her
                  sorrow-stricken soul. But what she least expected was a severe reprimand from her
                  parents, for her late conduct. She expected to complete her surreptitious
                  courtship undiscovered; but in that she was sadly mistaken, as the sequel will
                  detail. She was not aware that meddlesome Cleardo (a man whom she disliked enough
                  already) was strolling about in quest of fruit for gossip, while he ought to have
                  been engaged in his own affairs.
               When evening came, Vestilia drove home her flocks and stored them in their folds;
                  after that she went as usual, to her mother to assist in the kitchen; but, instead
                  of meeting the sweet smiling countenance of her mother, she observed a frown
                  thereon; yes, a frown so perceptible, so extensive, enough to ferment the most
                  congenial look into a sorrowful and downcast expression. Vestilia observed all
                  those unnatural proceedings, but she could no longer refrain from giving vent to
                  her feelings, and broke forth in the following strain:
               "Dear mother, are you unwell, or what makes you look so unnatural? Do tell
                  me."
               "No, daughter, I am not unwell, but our old neighbor Cleardo was here to-day, and
                  he told us rather unpleasant news, and it has made me feel rather badly ever
                  since."
               "Oh mother! do tell me what that unwelcome news was, and not keep me in suspense
                  any longer. What can it be?" asked Vestilia in a very excited tone.
               "Well, perhaps you would not like to hear it after all your anxiety. It was
                  something that he had seen to-day."
               Vestilia began to get somewhat nervous and irritable, while her countenance
                  assumed a frightened aspect. She began to think her secret courtship was found
                  out; that old meddlesome Cleardo had been loitering about over the fields in his
                  leisure moments, watching her proceedings, that he might communicate the same to
                     her parents. These contemplations
                  began to kindle a feeling of resentment; her anger began to burn within her
                  against that "meddlesome old busy-body Cleardo," to use her expressions. Her
                  hatred against him (Cleardo) was so acute, that it would ever prove unavailable
                  for him to attempt to effect a union betwixt his son and the offended maiden; he
                  might almost as easily accomplish the mighty task of eclipsing the brilliant rays
                  of the noon-day sun, for "offended virtue harbors long its wanted resentment."
               "Well, mother, can't you tell me what that ill news was?" asked Vestilia, rather
                  angrily.
               "O dear! don't get angry at me, it is not my fault; Cleardo told us that he saw
                  you and a strange man together under the spreading branches of a tree. Is that
                  so?"
               "Yes mother, that is so. But what about it?"
               "Nothing but the impropriety of your doing so," replied her mother.
               "Show me the impropriety of such conduct?" asked Vestilia in a hasty manner.
               "Well, before I answer your interrogation, will you allow me to put one to
                  you?"
               "Yes ma'am, certainly," replied Vestilia.
               "What was that stranger's name to whom Cleardo had reference?"
               "Mother, I shall not keep anything hid from you, that would have a tendency to
                  gratify your curiosity. His name was Solum, a gentleman with whom you are
                  acquainted."
               "Now I am ready to answer your interrogation. You asked me to show you the
                  impropriety of your conduct. It can be done in but a few words. You know that it
                  is expressly a violation of our code of regulations to condescend to associate
                  with those who are poor and indigent, much less to marry them, therefore you are
                  incurring a very great displeasure—a disgrace upon our ancestral dignity."
               "Ancestral dignity," repeated Vestilia with a sneer, "I would like to know what
                  that big word means?"
               "Why daughter," replied Tuelia, looking surprised, "do you mean to tell me that
                  you do not know the meaning of the word 'ancestral dignity?' It can not be
                  possible that you study our statutes very much."
               "Yes ma'am. I know what the word means, but I asked to know what it is to be so
                  dignified?"
               
               "O! that is what you mean," answered Tuelia. (But my reader will soon discover
                  that she did not understand Vestilia after all.) "You say you wish to know what
                  ancestral dignity is? It is that high and aristocratic feeling which pervades our
                  whole clan of shepherds. We would not condescend to look upon poverty and
                  indigence, or even mediocrity, as we claim to have no hand in the cause of those
                  dire misfortunes; we strive to keep them from our ranks."
               "Well, if that is what it means, I ask, deliver me from the thraldom of such a
                  spirit; I covet not to be one of your clan. You say that by strictly obeying the
                  rules of the society, you would forever expel poverty, &c., from your
                  community. I believe it, but it would drive it somewhere else. Your laws would not
                  destroy the possibility of poverty, but drive its unhappy victims to a more
                  charitable people a people possessing more generosity and true friendship, than
                  millions of Aleovan shepherds."
               "Why Vestilia, how you talk! you are certainly taking up a controversy against
                  your own people," replied Tuelia, somewhat chagrined at Vestilia.
               "Yes mother, I acknowledge that what I have been saying is rather derogatory to
                  the Aleovans; but I do not intend to reprove them more than any other horde, who
                  live under such imperfect codes—establish such silly by-laws."
               "Vestilia, your conversation seems to convey the idea to me, that with all our
                  efforts to prevent, you have united yourself to that poor Solum, which if that be
                  the truth, you shall have ample reason to regret the wretched course you have
                  pursued, ere you die. But I hope better things of you."
               "Mother, is there any harm in my forming an attachment for Solum, when I do not
                  intend to marry him as long as you and father live to dissent?"
               "Dear daughter, I thought that it could not be, that you had lost all respect for
                  your aged parents and their rigid injunctions. I am glad to know that you do not
                  intend to bring such a disgrace upon our head, while we are amongst the
                  living."
               "Well mother, you are opposed to my friendship with Solum, now what must I do? You
                  know that you and father are getting old and infirm, and it can not be that you
                  are long for this world. If either or both of you should be taken from me at this time, what would become of
                  me, the herds, &c.?"
               "My daughter, you must not fear that. There are a great many Aleovans, and among
                  the number there are enough that would be exceedingly glad of the chance."
               "Glad of what chance, mother?"
               "Glad of the chance to accept your hand in marriage."
               "The case might be, that there were quite a number waiting my decision, and I did
                  not love either; what would you say in those circumstances? You would not advise
                  me to take either, as I loved neither, would you?"
               "Nonsense about love; you know that one can not live by love now-a-days; it goes
                  but a little ways in the formation of the happiness of mankind. What need you care
                  for love, if wealth is plenty? You can live by the one, while you would starve by
                  the other; aye wealth is the great desideratum."
               "That can never be the case with me, mother. Love is what I consider the most
                  essential element or ingredient in that desirable compound termed 'human
                  felicity.' Wealth is desirable and good, in its place, but without love, it would
                  increase our misery instead of enhancing our enjoyment. A fire-side without love,
                  would be like the lute without a string, playing upon it produces more discords
                  than music."
               "How strangely you talk Vestilia. That Solum has been teaching you all that
                  nonsense."
               "No, mother, he hasn't been teaching me all that nonsense, nor do I call that
                  nonsense; it is a kind of nonsense I feel very proud of. Mother would any one
                  attach themselves to bores or tyrants for the sake of paltry wealth? If so, I am
                  not one of the number, you may be sure."
               "Daughter, I'll tell you the plan we have arranged matters. I mean concerning your
                  personal interest, if you wish to hear it."
               "I should like to know very much indeed. Don't you think I take any interest in
                  myself whatever?"
               "Well, I suppose you do, or at least ought to. Neighbor Cleardo was at our house
                  the other day, and made a proposal that pleased us very much, and I sincerely hope
                  that you will be delighted when you come to learn the project."
               
               "I hope so too, mother; but I would not promise until I have ascertained the
                  whole."
               "Well, you know, old Cleardo has got a very fine son, whom he calls Jathello. He
                  will be of age in two years."
               "Jathello," replied Vestilia with a turn tip of her lips, rather indicating
                  contempt. "Why he is but a youth; a silly boy. You don't suppose I have any desire
                  to form a matrimonial attachment with such a weed? Wait two years on one who has
                  not said ten words to me in his life, that I can recollect. Why mother, I would
                  almost pronounce you a little light-headed to day."
               "Be a little composed, daughter, none of your rash expressions about Jathello,
                  there is time enough yet. The old man has spoken of that project if his son
                  hasn't."
               "You must understand, mother, that old Cleardo can not make a bargain for me."
               "Why not, Vestilia?"
               "Wouldn't that be great doings, give up the selecting of my own enjoyment to a
                  stranger? Mother, I think that I am endowed with an intellect, with a capacity,
                  enabling me to select what is best adapted to my taste, to my circumstance, better
                  than Cleardo or any other stranger."
               "Daughter, won't you acknowledge that age has its superiorities—its
                  experience?"
               "Certainly I will, but let me tell you mother, that that experience does not avail
                  much, aside from the person who possesses it. You can point out the course of
                  life, but you can not experience it, for any one else than yourself. Here is a
                  doctrine no doubt some may teach as valid and commendable, although I feel
                  inclined to pick flaws out of it, before it will perfectly coincide with my views.
                  An aged man may say to adolescence, "come here young life's traveler, I have a few
                  words of advice for you, which experience has kindly taught me." And he goes on
                  with his harangue, telling the youth that experience has taught me that;
                  experience has taught me this; experience has taught me to shun that vice;
                  experience has taught me to do so and so. Well, suppose experience has done all
                  that and even more, what benefit is that going to be to me? Not much, if any. It
                  is often the case that we are as liable to run into danger by endeavoring to
                  escape, as otherwise. Look at the pilot who is sailing among unknown seas, does he know where the breakers
                  lie? Is he not as liable to run into danger under those circumstances as he is to
                  flee from it? Just so with humanity, what he learns, he learns for himself, and
                  for no one else. The voyage of life is but a chequered scene at best. In it, man
                  is always sailing in unknown seas, and ever liable to come in contact with the
                  numerous breakers ahead, it matters not how skillful the pilot may be. I do not
                  wish to inculcate the doctrine that the teachings of experience are totally
                  useless, no such thing; I simply mean, that owing to the chequered scene that life
                  presents, it is impossible for one man's experience to correspond with those of
                  another; therefore I claim, that experience was created more for our own welfare
                  than for others."
               "Well, Vestilia, you have delivered quite a lecture on the subject—your argument
                  all seems to be plausible enough, but we must live by our laws; they would be of
                  no use if we did not obey them."
               "That is so mother, but that does not argue that all laws are just laws, does
                  it?"
               "No, my daughter, but we should think that there is ability in the sage members of
                  our society to enact just and appropriate laws. But what was you going to say a
                  few moments ago?"
               "I was going to ask the question, suppose you and father should die previous to
                  Jathello's becoming of age, what would become of me and the estate?"
               "Why, the management of the whole estate could be delivered into the hands of
                  neighbor Cleardo, who would see that all things were taken care of, in a proper
                  and advisable manner."
               "Yes ma'am, no doubt he would take a great deal of pains to have things properly
                  managed, I mean to suit himself—to promote his own welfare at stake."
               "Well Vestilia, that is what your father intends to do if he should die before the
                  consummation of your marriage."
               "What does father intend to do?"
               "Why deliver the pasture-lands into the care of friend Cleardo, at our death,
                  provided you are not married."
               Vestilia was not at all pleased with the arrangements made by her parents, but she
                  had the good sense to keep her thoughts to herself; to control her anger, which might have led her into no
                  desirable position. She thought within herself, that they might dictate and
                  control while they were alive, but after that it would be just as she thought
                  proper to demise the estate. If the parents of Vestilia had died previous to her
                  marriage, there was one consolation for her, and that was, she then became sole
                  proprietor of the whole extensive pasture-land, with all the herds and flocks that
                  pastured thereon. She became sole heir according to the Aleovan codes, and that
                  she could do with the said property whatever she had a mind to. She would not be
                  compelled to marry any one but the person she had a mind to, but if she married
                  any one who was not wealthy, she was immediately expelled from their society.
               The parents of Vestilia did use their utmost endeavors to induce her to favor
                  their project, in regard to a matrimonial connection with Cleardo's son. They
                  resorted to various stratagems, but success did not seem to accompany any of them;
                  last of all, they threatened to disinherit her of the vast wealth that she was
                  heir to by the law of hereditary descent, if she would not adhere to their desires
                  immediately, but that only seemed to make her the more resolute in her
                  determinations. She would say, "Do as you please in regard to disinheriting me; if
                  the accomplishing of that ungenerous act would enhance your earthly happiness, I
                  would advise you by all means to hasten its termination, consider not my welfare,
                  for that part of life's anticipations are under the supervision of an ever
                  indulgent friend." She did not absolutely refuse to obey their mandates, nor would
                  she consent, considering that her prerogative, at least her convictions, were so
                  strenuous on that topic, that she considered it her duty to give it her earnest
                  attention.
               If old Cleardo had known the unpopularity of his noble son, or even of himself, in
                  the eyes of Vestilia, he would have felt his dignity droop a considerable; but
                  when ignorance is our guide, the ill results of the future are as satisfactory as
                  otherwise, provided they remain unaccomplished.
               Cleardo's son, whom I am about to introduce to you, was called Jathello. He was a
                  youth of no extraordinary capacities, and possessing but little if any animation.
                  He was of a light complexion, with flaxen hair and sky blue eyes, with features not uncomely. His general
                  expression presented something very peculiar and not easily explained. It was not
                  what you might justly denominate a silly look, but a vague and unmeaning stare,
                  more easily noticed than exemplified. His general appearance was not at all
                  attractive nor prepossessing, excepting in the estimation of his father, who
                  thought him a model of perfection; he thought that he would be one that would
                  acorn his "day and generation"—be a bright and shining light to glow up the
                  benighted pathway of his fellow-comrades around him—a brilliant star to guide the
                  life-anxious traveler to the famous castle of knowledge and eminence; but how
                  often parents are liable to attribute more natural abilities or other desirable
                  qualities to their offspring than is really the case; other children may possess
                  treble the natural recommendations, but somehow or other, they are never able to
                  discover the fact, except it exists in their own family—by their fireside.
               When Cleardo had returned from the aforementioned visit to Pastores, he told his
                  wife of all the news he had become acquainted with during the morning. He told her
                  of a rival to his son Jathello, who had been on a visit to the castle of Pastores;
                  "but by the by," said Cleardo, "Pastores showed a considerable good sense by
                  discountenancing the beggar (if I may call him so, for he was nothing else); but
                  it seems that she encouraged him; so that he did not feel inclined to leave, but
                  skulked about the pasture-land, sleeping, no one knows where. But never mind, the
                  villain has been found out; I caught him in the very act, while I was out on my
                  morning stroll."
               "How came you to do that?" inquired his wife.
               "Well, when I was going to Pastores', I stopped for a moment to see if I might
                  discover the whereabouts of Vestilia; and behold! I saw her sitting in the shade
                  of a tree in company with a strange gentleman. Well,I did not think very much
                  about it at the time, because Pastores had been talking about employing a herdsman
                  for a good length of time, but when I came to the castle, I pretty soon
                  ascertained that they were entirely ignorant of the fact, and they seemed inclined
                  to doubt my veracity when I acquainted them of what I had seen."
               
               "It is often the case," said Cleardo's wife, "that our intimate friends become our
                  enemies, when we attempt to do them a favor, especially when it seems to interfere
                  with their own little affairs; but really I should feel very sorry if our plan is
                  positively frustrated; however, I am determined to ascertain shortly. The best
                  plan to ascertain what will be the success of Jathello, will be to have him repair
                  to Vestilia in person, and then he will be able to ascertain his success."
               "Well, I guess that is about the surest method for him to pursue with the hope of
                  success," replied Cleardo. "I think Jathello is entirely too youthful to commence
                  business belonging to more mature years; but the existing circumstance actuates us
                  to have him begin the struggle earlier, or expect to be disgraced with dire
                  disappointment. Let him secure Vestilia, that his inexperienced mind may be
                  relieved from no little depression, or learn his destiny in whatever manner or in
                  what aspect it may present itself."
               "He had better go to-night," continued the old lady; "for the sooner he ascertains
                  the result, the sooner our minds may be at ease. What do you think, Cleardo? "
               "Those are my sentiments precisely, wife; but there is no use for us to build much
                  on future prospects, for they are only calculated to deceive us—lead us into
                  irremediable difficulties. Hope in the future is a good deal like the blazing
                  meteor, which makes a luminous path in the aerial world, but quickly dies away,
                  leaving its followers to grope in sad disappointments."
               "Hark! husband, there is some one knocking at the door. Open it, and see." Cleardo
                  opens the door, and in steps one of Cleardo's wife's most intimate friends. She
                  was the tale-bearer of the clan, and faithfully performed the duties of that
                  calling. Tradition justly named her Mendacea—a name more appropriate than the mass
                  of cognomens of the present day. I would here take the liberty to acquaint my
                  readers with the fact, that tradition has placed a very imperfect narrative into
                  my hands, to translate. Many of the names have been omitted, and a blank left,
                  which makes the whole appear more ridiculous than it would otherwise have been.
                  Some of the names on record are very appropriate, at least in regard to the
                  narrative, and the character they portray, whilst others have merely the
                     character of a name, without any
                  interpretation; but, however, I hope to collect the debris together, and form
                  rather an interesting tale, on the whole.
               "Mendacea, how do you do? I havn't seen you for a great length of time. What have
                  you been doing?" inquired Cleardo's wife.
               "Bless your soul! I am always well-running about as usual; but, I confess, I
                  havn't been to see you for quite a spell. I began to feel a little ashamed of
                  myself, so I thought I would come over and see you a moment."
               "How are the folks at your house, Mendacea," asked Cleardo.
               "All quite well, I thank you, excepting my husband; he has been complaining a
                  little, as usual."
               "Cleardo and I have just been talking about Pastores' daughter, before you came
                  in. She has been cutting a ridiculous figure with that stranger, hasn't she?"
               "What do you allude to?" inquired Mendacea.
               "To her keeping company with that rake from Aleova."
               "Is that all? Why, my gracious! you havn't heard one half the news," replied
                  Mendacea, with her eyes stretched to the size of a catamount's.
               "You don't say that you have heard anything worse than that, Mendacea!" asked
                  Cleardo's wife, somewhat excited.
               "Nothing else about Vestilia, I hope. Bad enough already," remarked Cleardo.
               "Yes, sir, there is the worst story out now of all. You wouldn't believe it."
               "Do tell us, and not keep us in suspense any longer," said Cleardo's wife, as if
                  very impatient.
               "Well, it is this:—but, before I tell you anything about it, I don't want you to
                  say anything about who told you, until you hear the story from some other source
                  than from me."
               "Don't be afraid, we won't say anything about it," answered Cleardo and wife.
               "Well, I was down to the other part of the settlement, and, what do you think, but
                  the folks were all in uproar about a hermit—I don't remember what they called him.
                  Do you know, Cleardo?"
               "I heard Pastores speak of a young man whom he called Solum, who was a
                  hermit."
               "That's the name, exactly," continued Mendacea. "Well, what I was going to say,
                  was, that this Solum came there to stay over night. In the mean while, Vestilia became so smitten with his
                  appearance and general deportment, that she could not resist the temptation of
                  loving him. Well, the parents, Pastores and wife, came to understand that the
                  stranger was nothing but a poor, indigent hermit, not worth his room. They saw
                  that he was in destitute circumstances, therefore they resolved to employ him as a
                  herdsman; but previous to the consummation of the bargain, they saw that there
                  existed too much intimacy betwixt him and their daughter, consequently, that
                  curtailed the whole proceedings, in regard to their employing him as a herdsman.
                  Well, as the story goes, he lingered about for several days, when he was detected,
                  and, consequently, Vestilia was taken to task about the stranger, and acknowledged
                  her intrigues with him, saying that she was determined to marry no one else but
                  Solum; if she could not get him, she would remain single as long as her parents
                  survived, when she would marry whom she thought proper, and not consult any
                  person's good will. They tell me that, when her parents came to understand her
                  determinations fully, they said that they would expel her instanter, saying that
                  they would not submit themselves to ignominy on her account—that they wouldn't
                  sanction anything that was in enmity to their noble by-laws. Well, as a natural
                  consequence for independent folks, Vestilia took offence, and the way she lectured
                  her parents it was a shame to mention, I declare. After she had finished her
                  lecture, she packed up her clothes, and started for the Aleovan hermitage."
               "Is that possible?" asked Cleardo and wife.
               "I don't know," says Mendacea, "only what I heard."
               "Well, it seems like a credible story from what I have heard," remarked Cleardo.
                  "Oh! dear," continued he, "isn't that too bad; our plans are totally frustrated,
                  wife."
               "Aye, that is so," replied Mendacea, as if she understood what they alluded
                  to.
               "Never mind," said Cleardo, "I won't put full confidence in the story until
                  Jathello returns."
               "Why, where is Jathello going, pray tell me," asked Mendacea, when she found
                  herself somewhat in the dark, after all her pretended knowledge.
               "O, he's only going on an errand for his mother to-night," replied Cleardo, with a view to cloak
                  the subject.
               "That is it," replied Mendacea, "I thought you meant that Jathello was going in
                  search of the run-away shepherdess."
               "If she has gone away, I am sure I shouldn't let Jathello make a fool of himself
                  by running after her," replied Cleardo.
               "Well, you might as well all take it easy—not trouble yourselves about Pastores'
                  daughter, for she has been seen for the last time in our horde," remarked
                  Mendacea, with an important air.
               "I beg leave to differ from you, Mendacea, I think that I shall see her quite
                  often yet," replied Cleardo.
               "Well, every one has a right to his or her opinion, so in this case we differ. I
                  declare, look what o'clock it is; why, I would not have thought that it was so
                  late; I must really go—come over and see us—do come." When she had thus spoken she
                  started off rather more abruptly than usual, but not more than desirable, on that
                  occasion.
               "I declare I like that Mendacea, she is a good soul, but sometimes I think that
                  she is a little singular in her actions," said Cleardo's wife.
               "Well, I feel inclined to doubt the veracity of her story to-night; mark my words
                  if she didn't make up the whole of that stuff," replied Cleardo.
               "I believe the whole story; Vestilia is just such a girl to do such things, do you
                  doubt that?"
               "I have no reason to doubt your words, nor have I any reason to suppose that
                  Vestilia would do such a degraded act."
               "Well, you'll see if there ain't some truth in Mendacea's story by to-morrow
                  morning, for I am determined that Jathello shall go and see."
               "That is my plan wife, wait until Jathello returns before we come to any
                  decision."
               "What would become of those dear old people, if Vestilia has really gone away and
                  left them alone," said the old lady, as if she felt the expression just
                  uttered.
               "Well, we would have to call a meeting of the society and ascertain what he would
                  have done. Some one would have to be appointed to oversee the management of the
                  flocks, for he is too feeble entirely to take charge of them."
               "Dear husband, how sincerity I hope that what Mendacea has been telling us, will prove false; why
                  I wouldn't know how to contain myself."
               Thus they conversed, until the day began to draw towards a close—discussing one
                  subject a while, and then turning their attention to another—until the two
                  children came home from the field with the flock.
               On a previous page, I penned something rather derogatory to old Cleardo—I mean,
                  Vestilia's views on the subject. Really, what would that old gentleman of honor
                  think, if he heard our comments on his character—if he knew that we were getting
                  eloquent in speaking of his misfortunes! I would adventure to answer the
                  interrogation, by saying that lie would grumble out some low imprecations at our
                  impertinence and infatuations. But it was well for old Cleardo as well as for
                  mankind in general, that the future remained veiled. If that veil which intervenes
                  betwixt us and obscurity was to be laid aside—withdrawn for one moment—what a
                  spectacle would present itself to our observation! A chaotic mass of happiness and
                  misery, prosperity and adversity, sunshine and darkness; each blended together,
                  forming hideous mountains, whose very aspect would cause the beholder to shrink
                  back with horror from the scene. If each part of the mighty tableau should come to
                  pass as they were severally depicted, we should certainly be overwhelmed with joy,
                  or overcome with grief. But oh! how good it is that there is a Providence who has
                  the supervision of those matters of obscurity; who tells them when to progress, or
                  when to forbear, to the comfort or distress of humanity in general!
               After the work of the day had been accomplished, Jathello and his mother had
                  chosen a separate room from the family, that they might conveniently talk of the
                  subject in consideration. The mother did not wish to communicate the news which
                  Mendacea had spoken of, for fear it might have a tendency to frustrate her
                  intentions. The following is a sketch of their conversation:
               "Jathello, my son, don't you wish to go on an errand, to-night?"
               "Yes, mother, I am always ready to go; but I would like to know what was the
                  object of the errand."
               "Well, I'll tell you: Father and I have been talking recently about your trying
                  for the hand of Vestilia. You are almost too young to commence mence that part of life's drama, but now seems to
                  be the most favorable opportunity for success. If we should procrastinate until
                  you become of age, then the golden opportunity might be eternally gone by."
               "Mother, how can I broach such an extremely delicate subject before Vestilia? I
                  know I shall fail in the attempt—diffidence is my prevailing propensity, and I
                  tell you it will be hard to subdue."
               "Don't talk so childish Jathello; you can never calculate to meet with success,
                  whilst you suffer such effeminacy to predominate. Shake off such nonsense and be a
                  man."
               "Mother, I shall make a vigorous effort to accomplish all that your heart desires,
                  for I am well aware that if I don't succeed, I have committed the unpardonable
                  sin, I mean in your eyes."
               "Well, it is enough to irritate one's feelings, to know that his or her child is
                  such a non-entity as to fail in the simple task of courtship."
               "Mother, you seem to think that the play of love is easily learned, and more
                  easily accomplished."
               "So it is, more especially in this case, because more than one-half of the task is
                  accomplished already."
               "What do you mean, mother?"
               "Don't you know that father has been speaking to Vestilia's parents about the
                  subject?"
               "No ma'am, how do you suppose I would ascertain that?"
               "Well, I supposed that your father might have said something about it."
               "He has had no opportunity to speak on the subject to me very recently."
               "Well, I'll tell you. The other day he was over to Pastores' and they commenced
                  talking about their ages, and one thing led to another till they commenced talking
                  about Vestilia's getting married. So the idea came across your father's mind that
                  she would make an excellent companion for Jathello; and the moment he made the
                  suggestion to her parents, they seemed so elated that they could but imperfectly
                  control their feelings. They said that they favored the project throughout, and
                  that they would use their utmost endeavors to accomplish the important
                  object."
               "I am exceedingly glad to hear that the most difficult portion of the task is accomplished,"
                  said Jathello with a smile, as if he thought the whole difficulty had come to a
                  finale.
               "Jathello, it is now almost eight o'clock, and you had better make some little
                  preparation for your errand."
               How silly and out of place it seems, when you hear a parent officiating for her
                  child in the affair of a love drama. It is anything but music to our ears—music
                  like that from the long tense lute-string that has deviated from its proper tone,
                  which sends forth strains that grate upon the fastidious ear of a pretender, much
                  more a skilled amateur. Parents too often usurp authority, by interfering with
                  their children's prerogative. They say you must address such a lady—marry such a
                  gentleman, while at the same time they have such an unconquerable abhorrence of
                  the person in question, and could not but live a life, but little superior to his
                  satanic majesty, in their immediate company; but notwithstanding the intense
                  character of their hatred, the imperative injunction of parents and guardians is,
                  "You must do so and so, or meet with a disinheritance and even banishment." But
                  let us look a moment upon the dire result of such a proceeding. Oftentime in
                  progress of life's weary play, you may have witnessed two willing hearts, united
                  by the silken ties of unsophisticated love. You watch the child-like innocency of
                  their hearts, as they intermingle each other's voices in the sweet intercourse of
                  love. You observe each maneuver they make as they convene in the rustic arbor day
                  after day, but you do not see anything that has a tendency to violate the
                  guileless character of modesty and virtue. They converse with untiring constancy
                  on the glowing prospects of the untold future; thus they mingle each other's
                  hearts in sweet converse; but when they attempt to bend their united knees at the
                  shrines of the hymeneal altar, then objections rise like stupendous mountains, to
                  quench the holy flame enkindled in their youthful hearts. The parents object to
                  the project, simply because he or she of the party is poor, or perhaps one of
                  their connections have ill-behaved, or descended from some low origin; these with
                  many like objections may arise to counteract their irreproachable intentions. But
                  oh! how foolish—how inconsiderate is such a course—virtuous humanity having to
                  bear the ignominy of his profligate
                  relative, and thus be deprived of his devoted lady-love—of his very soul's
                  existence. Nature seems to form attachments true and exemplary, but meddlesome art
                  often effects a separation, and that to the sacrifice of one or more of the lives
                  of Love's votaries. Parents, beware of the tragical effect of Love's interference,
                  for 
                     
                        "If the love of the heart is blighted, it buddeth not again;
                        If that pleasant song is forgotten, it is to be learnt no more:
                        Yet often will thought look back, and weep over early affections;
                        And the dim notes of that pleasant song, will be heard as a reproachful
                           spirit,
                        Mourning in æolian strains over the desert of the heart,
                        When the hot siroccos of the world have withered it one oasis."
                     
                  
               
               It was a beautiful summer evening, that Jathello made his first visit to the
                  castle of Pastores, on an errand of love. The moon shed forth her silvery rays on
                  the sleeping earth, with a brilliancy but little inferior to the dazzling light of
                  the radiant sun. All was calm and serene, as if hushed in the repose of midnight
                  slumber, as Jathello traveled the moonlit fields; but anon the loud yelp of the
                  roving catamount, or the sharp howl of the ravenous wolves of proud Aleova, as
                  they crashed through the wildwood in search of booty, and the more feeble voice of
                  the philomela, or nightingale, might be heard from the hazel clump. But of the
                  surrounding beauties of verdant nature, Jathello cherished not a thought, for they
                  were all absorbed with the mission of love he was undertaking.
               When Jathello had arrived at the castle door, his heart began to palpitate with
                  unusual rapidity, for fear and trembling filled it to its utmost capacity. There
                  he stood, dreading to hear the sound of the knock that was to demand his
                  admission, much more the voice that was to welcome his affrighted lordship in; but
                  he thought of his mother's admonition, and at last summoned up courage enough to
                  knock. When he heard the welcome response to his knock, he entered and found
                  Vestilia alone, finishing up her house work; the parents were in the sitting room,
                  consequently everything and circumstances were just in accordance with the wishes
                  of Jathello. He had been laboring under a good deal of anxiety ever since he had
                  left home, for fear he would have to encounter the presence of the old folks; but
                  that was only exhibiting a spirit that young suitors usually do on such
                  occasions.
               
               He is now in the presence of his lady-love Vestilia, where he was so much overcome
                  with diffidence or bashfulness, as to disable him to proceed with an ordinary
                  conversation. Whether he was too much frightened to commence conversation, or that
                  he was too ignorant, it was too difficult to decide, but however, the latter
                  suggestion seemed to have the ascendancy. But I am glad to know that a sufficient
                  amount of courage came to his rescue, and enabled him to break forth in the
                  following strain:
               "It is exceedingly pleasant out doors to-night, the moon shines brightly on all
                  around, making everything look rather cheerful for evening; but the howling of the
                  wolves, seems to shed a gloom on the whole scene. Each yelp seemed to send a fresh
                  chill over my body, making me feel—I can't express my feelings."
               "You mean, it makes you feel rather cowardly!" said Vestilia, with an air that
                  indicated little regard for her visitor on that occasion.
               "O no ma'am, I don't mean that; but there seems to be an inexpressible timid
                  sensation creeping over my whole system."
               "Jathello, the loud and repeated howlings of the wolves or the hideous shrieks of
                  the catamount, do not effect me in the least; I love to hear them equally as well
                  as the warbling notes of the nightingale," replied Vestilia, more to be contrary
                  than otherwise.
               "Oh! Vestilia, is it possible that you possess such a heroic spirit?"
               "I would like to know where there is a display of heroism in that? There is no
                  earthly use in being afraid of anything that is not real, and but little more than
                  imaginary."
               "Vestilia, there is no use to talk to you, for you certainly possess more bravery
                  than a host of your sex."
               "'Tis true, I talk as if I possessed a great deal of prowess, but there are others
                  who possess as much, and perhaps a great deal more, yet to hear them talk, you
                  would think that they were perfectly pusillanimous," answered Vestilia, in a
                  trifling manner.
               "Will you tell me, Vestilia, what you think of those who are naturally timid?"
                  asked Jathello, as a clew to change the subject.
               "What do I think of them? Why I despise the very name of coward, much more the
                  person who is so silly as to become its victim."
               
               "Don't be so personal, Vestilia. You don't know but what I am one of nature's
                  perfect cowards."
               "I can't help it if you are," said Vestilia, in a crusty manner, "you ought to
                  know enough about etiquette, to know that present company is invariably
                  excepted."
               "Certainly I do," replied Jathello, "I only made that remark for diversion,
                  therefore I hope that you will pardon me for the wrong impression I have created.
                  I presume you are aware of the object of my visit here to-night?" said Jathello,
                  changing the subject rather abruptly.
               "No sir, I do not, without it was to learn how we all were, as a sociable neighbor
                  ought to," replied Vestilia, pretending ignorance.
               "Yes ma'am, that is true, but with that, I have two-fold object," said Jathello
                  with a blush.
               "Pray what can be the one thing untold? I would like to know very much."
               "Vestilia don't you know; can't you really guess; I wish you could."
               "No doubt you do, but the task is entirely too difficult for me, therefore I shall
                  leave the matter with you, as I am no adept at guessing."
               "Well, my object is this—Vestilia I beg your pardon, will you condescend to get me
                  a drink, if you please?" [My reader must not censure the young rival, for calling
                  for a drink of water, ere he had finished his statement, because if any of you
                  should happen to get into a similar predicament, you will then be able to judge in
                  regards to its inconvenience—to ask a lady for her hand as a helpmeet for life, is
                  no trifling interrogation, especially when he is not fully convinced that his love
                  has been reciprocated; but if that should really be the case, his actions have
                  been highly culpable; for no one should leap, ere he looked to ascertain his
                  footing.]
               "Well, what I wish to say is rather embarrassing, perhaps you can relieve me of
                  the difficult task by guessing."
               "No, I don't think that I can; as I told you before I am not an adept at guessing.
                  I might make an irreparable mistake, if I was to undertake it, therefore I beg to
                  be excused."
               "Well, this is my object: father and mother told me the other day, that I should
                  endeavor to secure your hand as a partner for life, because if I didn't do it
                  soon, why I would be liable to be unsuccessful, as there are always those who
                     are read to secure the first
                  desirable opportunity that presents itself."
               "O that's it," replied Vestilia with an air of pretended surprise. "You must think
                  that I am a good, desirable chance for somebody?"
               "Yes ma'am, I do most assuredly, but I sincerely hope that I can claim the
                  preference," said Jathello.
               "The preference did you say? I am sorry to say that I am unable to satisfy your
                  interrogation, having never thought on the subject, therefore I am unwilling to
                  decide. But don't you think that you are too youthful as yet?"
               "I presume that is so, Vestilia, but I am willing to wait any length of time that
                  you would think proper," said Jathello, as if not willing to give up his suit for
                  trifles.
               "Very well Jathello, I'll concede to that proposal; but remember that I am to
                  consult my pleasure in regard to the stipulation—I choose the time when to have
                  the nuptials consummated."
               "O certainly, Vestilia. Your will shall be my pleasure."
               "Well, that point of business is settled," said Vestilia, with an air of
                  exultation over her duped suitor.
               It was evident that Jathello did not discover wherein he was duped by Vestilia,
                  while in her presence; nor was it likely that be would previous to his next visit.
                  He gave Vestilia, the privilege of waiting in her pristine virginity as long as
                  her heart desired. He gave her the prerogative of choosing or selecting the day
                  whereon the chain of matrimony was to unite their willing hearts; but, truly, she
                  intended to exercise that prerogative to such a degree, as to cause
                  dissatisfaction to spring up in the heart of Jathello. She was desirous of keeping
                  his anxious heart in suspense, until her true lover had rolled away the massive
                  difficulties which existed betwixt her parents and the consummation of her
                  nuptials, when Jathello would ascertain, to his entire dissatisfaction, from the
                  flying reports that it would be useless and unnecessary for him to tarry in
                  solitary celibacy any longer, with the hope that facetious Vestilia would come to
                  his relief, for it was evident, from the existing circumstances that she intended
                  to sacrifice his first love.
               When Jathello arose to depart, he reminded Vestilia of her contract, and urged her
                  to remain constant to its stipulations, to which she indifferently ently assented. As he left the room he bade her
                  "good night," and the same she returned in reply, but did not utter a word of
                  encouragement, in regard to tho repetition of his visit. But such is the effect of
                  love, that many of its devotees are so blinded or smitten, that they are unable to
                  see when they are misused or discountenanced. They can not see when they are
                  imposed upon, thinking that open insults and wilful neglect are but a display of
                  witticism or mirth, and continue to think so, until, perhaps, they have been
                  convinced of their error by sad experience, as a merited reward for their gross
                  stupidness. Oh! vain capricious love! how many are made the victims of thy potent
                  influence, and prostrated by thy misgivings! Thou art like the ignis fatuus that
                  flickers over the marshy swamp, to delude the anxious traveler that has become
                  bewildered in the shades of darkness. The traveler is deluded when he attempts to
                  find that blazing light, for it always remains in the perspective—the longer you
                  pursue it, the farther into the abyss of delusion you penetrate. Just so with our
                  young suitor Jathello. He endeavored to approach the innocent heart of Vestilia,
                  through the uncertain medium of love; but he did hot know that the longer he
                  pursued that object, with the anticipation of overtaxing it, the farther off it
                  would appear in the perspective, her heart being the flickering Will-with-a-wisp
                  that was to delude or lead astray that of Jathello.
               After Jathello had gone, Vestilia, went into the sitting room, to join the company
                  of her father and mother, which she had been anxious to do for several long hours.
                  When she entered the room, her parents had been busily talking and laughing, as if
                  something was being transacted of a pleasing character. They had been conversing
                  on the prospect of Jathello's alliance with Vestilia. But, ah! when she tells her
                  tale there will be a marked change on their venerable countenances. The sweet and
                  cheering smiles that had lit their aged cheeks would be driven away by the
                  interposition of a dissatisfied frown.
               When Vestilia had seated herself, then commenced a series of interrogations from
                  her parents, as follows:
               "Well, my daughter, how did you and neighbor Cleardo's son get along to-night?"
                  asked Pastores.
               "Quite as well as I had anticipated."
               
               "He is a dear young man, I think," said Tuelia, thinking that all was right.
               "Yes Tuelia, I think so too. He'll make an affectionate husband and an excellent
                  provider no doubt."
               "He is a nice young man for aught I know, but for a husband, I should prefer some
                  one a little more intelligent," replied Vestilia.
               "Why Vestilia, how you talk," said her mother, with a look of surprise on her
                  countenance.
               "Tuelia, she don't mean what she says, she is only jesting."
               "No father, I am not jesting, I positively mean what I have just said."
               "You do," said Pastores, with a dissatisfied air. "Why what can be the
                  matter?"
               "O nothing is the matter, only I do not fancy the company of Jathello. I have no
                  friendship for him, more than I have for his father, which you know is precious
                  little."
               "Why Vestilia, you certainly talk like a very silly girl," said Tuelia, getting
                  somewhat out of humor. "I think you ought to be talked to, a little."
               "Yes worse than talked to," said Pastores, as if he felt the disappointment worse
                  than his wife.
               "What ought to be done to me, that is worse than a scolding?" asked Vestilia, with
                  an air that indicated no dread of consequence.
               "By your misdemeanor, you certainly have blasted our brightest hopes, and for
                  that, you ought to be severely punished."
               "Do as you please father, but one thing certain you will not have an opportunity
                  to punish me more than once."
               "Why, what will you do, Vestilia? If you don't cease your impudent conversation,
                  you will be disinherited before to-morrow night."
               "You may consult your pleasure, father, about disinheriting me. You need not wait
                  any longer than the present moment. I have one consolation remaining, in case you
                  should do so."
               "What is that consolation, I would like to know?" inquired her mother.
               "Mother, that consolation is, a friend to flee to, in case of trouble."
               "Come now daughter, there is no use in talking that way, tell us plainly; will you
                  be friendly to Jathello or not?" asked Pastores.
               "Yes father, I will be friendly to him as far as it is my duty; but to marry him, that I never will
                  do, while I have sense enough remaining to dictate for me otherwise."
               "I expect it is that poor Aleovan hermit that has infatuated her. It is a great
                  pity that she ever saw him, then there would have been no trouble; she would have
                  taken Jathello without any hesitation on her part," said her father.
               "Father, I do not like to contradict your assertion, but to be candid, I never
                  did, nor never could love Jathello. I mean to be obedient to you and your
                  injunctions, as long as I live with you, excepting in regard to selecting a
                  partner for life. Don't you think it cruel and unjust, to make me marry one whom I
                  can never love? I appeal to your superior judgment on the subject; I appeal to you
                  as a father, who has a sympathy or interest in the welfare of his offspring."
               "Well, I don't know but there is some truth in your assertion—your plea; but still
                  I would not have you marry that poor hermit, for all the world," said the father,
                  looking more composed, evidently indicating that he thought his daughter's logic
                  had some force—some foundation.
               "Very well, father, I solemnly pledge myself to obey you in that, so long as I
                  live, except I am expelled from the parental roof; after that, I shall be free to
                  choose, free to act; and if I shall then think proper to encourage the Aleovan
                  hermit, well and good, if not, no harm is still committed."
               "Well, that amends the matter somewhat; but still, I can not help but feel sorry,
                  when I think that you have disappointed our fondest hopes and expectations," said
                  her mother; "but, however, no one shall reap the reward of the transaction but
                  yourself: If you make your bed upon difficulties, you will have to lie on it. No
                  one else would be willing to share it with you—no one else accountable for your
                  misdemeanor."
               "Well, I shall endeavor to be satisfied; especially when I can do no better," said
                  Pastores.
               "Dear parents, you shall not long have occasion to regret the course I am
                  pursuing. The balance—the scale—will turn the other way. Instead of discontentment
                  being your portion, you will lie down in your graves in peace, having nothing to
                  reflect upon, in regard to the course I pursued in life."
               "Dear daughter, I hope to realize every word that you have just expressed; and if
                     you pursue that course with a
                  genuine motive, no doubt but that we will enjoy your fullest anticipations," said
                  Pastores.
               "But if she marries Solum, how can we ever expect to realize much?" said
                  Tuelia.
               "Mother, 'be not faithless, but believing,' I have not said that I intended to
                  marry Solum. Time will dictate."
               "Well, we have talked enough at this time. Come, Vestilia, get your guitar, and
                  sing and play a few ditties before we retire," said Pastores.
               "It is too late," said Tuelia. "The clock has struck ten."
               "Oh, well, we can have one tune, anyhow. Come, Vestilia, let us have it."
               "What shall I play, father?"
               "Anything that you choose. I am not particular," replied Pastores.
               "Well, father, since you have given me the privilege to select what piece of music
                  I shall sing and play, I take it for granted that you will be satisfied with my
                  taste. The piece I have selected is called "Hope, when once blighted"—a very
                  sentimental piece. Shall I play that, father?"
               "Yes, daughter, let us have it," replied Pastores, getting rather impatient.
               When Vestilia had tuned her lute, she commenced as follows: 
                     
                        "Hope, when once blighted,
                        May sometimes renew,
                        But love, when once slighted,
                        May bid us adieu!
                        Blessings unfolded
                        When will we enjoy?
                        Know when they will come
                        Sweet memory employ.
                     
                     
                        I look not for pleasure,
                        Since sadness is mine;
                        Love does betray me,
                        Although I am thine!
                        Friends they desert me,
                        And leave me to mourn;
                        Would that my ashes
                        Were stay'd in the urn!"
                     
                  
               
               "Vestilia, that piece is certainly beautiful. It contains a great deal of
                  sentiment. I presume you selected that piece because it was rather adapted to your
                  circumstance, did you not?"
               "Why do you think so father?"
               "Because the thought came to my mind when you sang those two lines, which read as
                  follows: 
                     
                        "Blessings unfolded
                        When will we enjoy."
                     
                  
               
               It made me think of what you asserted just previous to your commencing to
                  play."
               
               "I do say, you and Vestilia might as well talk all night, and not go to bed at
                  all," said Tuelia, growing a good deal impatient.
               "O, no Tuelia, we have finished our conversation now." As Pastores said that, he
                  moved off slowly to his dormitory, and the remainder of the family soon followed;
                  but when the parents were in bed they resumed the same subject.
               "I presume we might as well relinquish the idea of Vestilia marrying Jathello,"
                  said Tuelia "don't you think so husband?"
               "I fear that your suggestion will be too true; but perhaps it will be all for the
                  best."
               "It is my opinion, husband, that she intends to marry Solum, but if we will not
                  consent to that at present, she intends to wait until we are in our graves, when
                  all obstacles will be removed, and she will then act according to the dictates of
                  her conscience."
               "No doubt, but that is all true; but if that should happen to come to pass, why,
                  she'll have a pretty hard time of it, for all the Aleovans will discountenance her
                  from their society."
               "Well, I don't think that will make much difference with Vestilia, for she does
                  not seem to covet their society on any occasion," replied Tuelia.
               "That is true, but the idea of being excluded or banished forever, would appear
                  more odious to her, than you have had reason to suppose."
               "Well its getting late," said Tuelia, (yawning) "so I think we had better leave
                  all further discussion until some more appropriate time, and go to sleep, for we
                  can not remedy the difficulty a whit, if we should talk of it a life-time."
                  Consequently Pastores and wife, fell quietly into the soothing embrace of
                  slumber.
               About ten o'clock on the next day, they had a visit from their old friend Cleardo.
                  When they (Pastores and wife) saw him coming over the fields, they began to
                  tremble for the result of his visit. They expected to receive a severe reprimand
                  for their daughter's conduct towards Jathello; but the true statement of his
                  errand would produce a characteristic change upon their countenances. Instead of
                  resentment swelling his heart-bearing down his spirit; it was buoyed up with the
                  most brilliant hopes. 
                     
                        "Sad indeed were man's lot, if through storms as they lower
                        He could see no reflection of Hope's bright hued
                           flower."
                     
                  
                   Jathello had been telling his father
                  that Vestilia had offered her hand at his pleasure; which news made him feel
                  somewhat elated. He was in ecstacy, he could wait no longer than the time he
                  thought that it would take for Tuelia to finish up her morning house work, which
                  was about ten o'clock. As he (Cleardo) enters the house, he finds the aged couple
                  taking their ease, as they should do especially in the decline of life.
               "O, how do you do neighbor Cleardo?" said Tuelia.
               "Pretty well, I thank you—no reason to complain. How do you feel this morning,
                  Pastores."
               "Well I don't exactly feel as usual. I have a dull sensation about my eyes, with a
                  little tendency to headache."
               "I am sorry for that Pastores, perhaps you haven't taken any exercise this
                  morning."
               "I confess that, Cleardo."
               "Yes indeed, Cleardo," said Tuelia. "He has got into the habit of taking things so
                  easily now-a-days, that I sometimes wonder that he can live."
               "Pastores, hadn't you better take a walk over our way every morning, and see if
                  you would not receive benefit from the plan?"
               "Bless your heart, Cleardo, I couldn't walk as far as your castle, if you was to
                  make it a present to me for my trouble. I mean to say, every morning."
               "Well, perhaps so. You must be quite an old man by this time."
               "Yes, sir, I finished my four scores the other day."
               "So old as that?" inquired Cleardo. "Why, I did not think that you were so much
                  older than I."
               "How old are you, Cleardo?"
               "I am three score and eight years old, lacking about twenty days."
               "Why, you ain't as old as Tuelia, my wife, She was three score and twelve years
                  old, two months ago."
               "Is that possible! Why, I ought to feel young, especially in the company of you
                  and Tuelia. I almost forgot to ask how your daughter was."
               "She is well as usual," replied Tuelia.
               "I always forget your daughter's name—what is it, if you please?"
               "Her name is Vestilia," answered Pastores.
               "Oh, yes; I'll try and remember it; for, according to what my son has been telling me, she'll be my daughter-in-law,
                  some day."
               "Is that so, Cleardo?" inquired Tuelia.
               "Yes, ma'am, that is so. He told me candidly, and I never knew him to tell me what
                  was false, intentionally, in my life."
               "Well, I do declare!" said Pastores, "that is entirely contrary to the story
                  Vestilia told us last evening, after your son had left."
               "O, well, that all might be true. She might not wish to communicate the whole
                  circumstance to you immediately; but by and by she will muster up enough moral
                  courage to divulge the whole secret."
               "I should feel exceedingly glad, if your statement should be verified; but I am
                  afraid, from what she told us, that you are totally mistaken," said Tuelia, with
                  an earnest expression.
               "Why, Tuelia, what did she say?"
               "I don't like to repeat all that she said to us, for fear that you would think
                  that it was a design of our own devising, for the purpose of frustrating your
                  intentions or desires."
               "Oh, no danger of that, for I know that you are willing that your daughter should
                  have Jathello."
               "Well, Cleardo, I'll tell you this much: if she really means what she says, you
                  and I might as well give up the idea of seeing them united in the holy bands of
                  matrimony," said Pastores.
               "If that is the case, Pastores, I feel somewhat inclined to doubt your daughter's
                  veracity," replied Cleardo, in an excited tone.
               "Can you tell me," inquired Tuelia, "what our daughter said to Jathello—I mean,
                  what proposals did he make?"
               "Well, Jathello said that your daughter promised to give him (Jathello) her hand,
                  on condition that he would wait her pleasure."
               "Very good," said Pastores, defending his daughter, "does that indicate that she
                  promised to marry him? Didn't your son see that she was trifling with him?
                  According to her promise, she might keep him waiting a whole life-time."
               "That is true, I never thought of that; but what else did she say?"
               "Since I have told you a part of her story, I might as well tell you more. She
                  said that she would never marry Jathello, as long as she lived, and that no one
                  could compel her. When my wife and I heard her use that expression, we got very indignant, and threatened to
                  disinherit her, if she did not comply with our wishes; but that did not seem to
                  frighten her a particle; she said in reply, that I might disinherit her as soon as
                  I thought proper, she had one consolation left, and that was, a friend to flee to,
                  in time of difficulty; so I thought that I would not expel her on that account,
                  for she promised not to marry any body against our wishes, as long as we survived,
                  but after that, she would be at liberty to act according to her dictates; and
                  another thing, I didn't want to be deprived of her company while I lived. She is a
                  dutiful child to me, and affords me a great deal of comfort in my old days; but on
                  the subject of choosing a partner for life, she thinks that parents ought not to
                  interfere, and I am a little inclined to think that she is pretty near right, at
                  least in some instances."
               "Well, it is strange that your daughter should act so, especially when she has the
                  offer of becoming so immensely rich," replied Cleardo, looking considerably
                  downcast and disappointed.
               "'Tis strange indeed, but she has often told us confidentially, that she would
                  never marry any one contrary to her wishes, for paltry wealth."
               "Well, but is she not afraid of incurring the displeasure of the society, by that
                  course of conduct?"
               "No sir, she said she did not respect the dignity of the society, because their
                  motives were at enmity to the welfare of the poor and indigent portions of
                  humanity," replied Tuelia.
               "Well, I believe that stranger was the origin of the whole mischief. Who taught
                  her to criticise our society rules, if it was not him—I am sure that you never
                  instilled such doctrine into her mind, nor was it likely that it came by chance,"
                  remarked Cleardo.
               "Yes sir, no doubt but what he was the sole cause of her dissatisfaction—her
                  criticism; and not much wonder indeed, for he was the finest looking man I ever
                  saw—his looks were perfectly beautiful and fascinating; but he possessed a still
                  greater accomplishment, and that was intelligence."
               "O well, that accounts for the whole proceedings," replied Cleardo, rather
                  pettishly. "I hope sincerely, that she will get her fill of that stranger. I would
                  venture to say, that she will never see him again as long as she lives. Such
                     wandering rakes turn up every once
                  in a while; but it is very seldom you hear of them afterwards."
               "Well I can't say in regard to that, but I believe that she remains pretty
                  sanguine in relation to her future prospects; however she has promised to remain
                  single as long as we lived, meaning that she would not marry against our consent,"
                  answered Pastores.
               Thus they conversed, until the sun had gained his meridian—until it was time to
                  take preliminary steps towards dinner. Pastores and wife urged Cleardo to remain
                  for dinner; but he wished to be excused, saying that his wife would have his
                  dinner ready waiting his return; therefore she would think that something had
                  happened to him, if he should be absent from a single meal, which he seldom was. I
                  presume my readers will coincide with me, in doubting the validity of Cleardo's
                  excuse for not remaining to dine at the castle of Pastores. As we feel inclined to
                  doubt the excuse given by Cleardo, it may be incumbent upon us to state what we
                  might consider the valid reason. The true reason, according to our views, was,
                  that he had heard news that was not altogether acceptable, according to his
                  fancy—news having no tendency to increase his appetite or invigorate his system.
                  He had too much to communicate to his beloved wife, that burdened his dissatisfied
                  mind. His hopes for the present and future were all blasted—nipped, as it were, in
                  the bud of anticipation. He received no more pleasure from his "bright cherry
                  hopes" than he would realize from the mere thought of a "might-be-so."
               There is nothing new exhibited in the said disappointment before us. We see
                  similar circumstances transpiring around us day by day. Many rest assured that
                  their brightest hopes and fondest anticipations will be fully realized; but, ah!
                  how often they are sadly and wofully disappointed. Wisdom and knowledge are both
                  taught in the sad school of disappointment, as well as in the more pleasing one of
                  success. If we would set bounds to expectation, we would be better prepared to
                  cope with whatever may be the result, as the poet very justly says: 
                     
                        "For experience hath another lesson, which a man will do well if he
                           learn,
                        By checking the flight of expectation, to cheat disappointment of its
                           pain."
                     
                  
               
               
               One thing I would here suggest, for the benefit of mankind in general, and that
                  is: if everybody would but pay due attention to their own affairs, to the entire
                  negligence of others', they certainly would meet with fewer rebuffs, and have to
                  encounter less formidable disappointments. But, oh! selfish humanity! if thou wilt
                  not be taught wisdom by the pleasant lessons of admonition, experience must be thy
                  tutor.
               If Cleardo had not interfered with what might be justly termed the civil rights of
                  his son Jathello, but left the whole amatorial proceedings to his own discretion,
                  there would not have been occasion for the sad rebut under consideration; but, if
                  so, there would only have been one of two its sad recipient.
               There had long been a commendable intimacy existing betwixt the families of
                  Pastores and Cleardo. They had cherished each other's friendship through many
                  checkered scenes, and, until the day when that difficulty arose between Vestilia
                  and Jathello, it had remained pure and unspotted in the eyes of the world; but,
                  whether the unwelcome news, communicated to Cleardo, would change the scale of
                  proceeding, remains to be seen.
               When Cleardo had returned home, he did not wait long to communicate the sad
                  tidings to his wife. He had called her into the sitting room, when the following
                  conversation took place:
               "Wife, I am sorry to say that we have been sadly mistaken in our calculations, but
                  the fault does not lie at our door."
               "Why, what next have you learned? No more bad news, I hope."
               "Yes, dear wife, more bad news, I fear; but I can not be certain of it until I see
                  Jathello again. Perhaps he and I have misunderstood each other."
               "Please tell me what you have heard, that I may be able to give my opinion on the
                  subject," asked Cleardo's wife.
               "Well, you know that we understood Jathello to say that Vestilia had positively
                  given him her hand. In view of that fact, I broached the subject in the presence
                  of Pastores and his wife, saying that I was happy in the prospects of the intimate
                  relation that time would soon make us. As I said that, they both looked very much
                  surprised, and said "I must certainly be laboring under a mistake." "If what you
                  say is the exact statement, why, we are the mistaken ones, not you, which we sincerely hope." I asked them what
                  Vestilia had said. They told me that she had positively declared that she would
                  never marry Jathello as long as she had common sense to dictate for her
                  otherwise."
               "Now husband, is that not too bad! Is it possible that there is so much deception
                  in Vestilia?"
               "It is not deception, wife, according to their story. They say that she never gave
                  her hand to Jathello at all; and if he had not been so grossly stupid, he might
                  have observed the sell."
               "Don't you think that they have been converted over, by the influence of their
                  daughter?"
               "What do you allude to, wife?"
               "Well, I allude to the fact, that Vestilia might have (through persuasion), got
                  consent from her parents to marry that hermit: and that they are now endeavoring
                  to defeat our calculations, which stand as an obstacle in the way."
               "No, wife, I do not think so, for obvious reasons. They have always been strict
                  observers of our by-laws, and would never deign to speak derogatory of any one of
                  them. When I spoke of forming a matrimonial alliance between Vestilia and
                  Jathello, they seemed to be elated—promising mising at the same time, that they
                  would use their utmost endeavors to execute the proposed plan."
               "Well, there is certainly something very mysterious in the whole proceeding."
               "Pastores said that there was no engagement existing between the parties; that
                  Vestilia, mischievously said that she would give Jathello her hand, provided he
                  would agree to wait as long as it was her pleasure, before they would celebrate
                  their nuptial ceremonies."
               "Ah! that was the deception—poor fellow, no wonder he was so sadly deceived;
                  being, I presume greatly excited, when he could hardly escape being duped. I am
                  exceedingly sorry that we proceeded in the manner we did. I believe, that if we
                  had transacted the whole affair ourselves we would have met with better success,
                  if not, we certainly would not have been so much mortified."
               "Don't speculate too freely on that point, wife; perhaps we have had no occasion
                  to be mortified as yet—wait until we have had an interview with Jathello, before
                  you commence to jump at conclusions," replied Cleardo, in an earnest tone.
               
               Thus the talked over matters until evening, when the children returned from the
                  field with the herds. Jathello, after having finished up all his evening chores,
                  started to visit one of his intimate acquaintances before tea; but his father
                  observed him, and called him back, saying that he had something to say to him,
                  that was very important. Jathello began to wonder what was to pay now. He hastened
                  into the sitting room, that be might have his curiosity satiated. When he entered
                  the room be found both of his parents sitting there, with an anxious expression on
                  each of their venerable faces.
               "What is it that you want me for? I was going over to see one of my acquaintances
                  before supper," asked Jathello.
               "We'll we have somewhat to say to you. You can easily postpone your visit till
                  another evening, can't you?" inquired his mothers.
               "Yes ma'am, I suppose I can; but do tell me what you want to ask me."
               "Well, I believe you told us that Vestilia had given you encouragement the night
                  you had paid her that last visit, did you not?" asked Cleardo.
               "Yes sir, I did; but what about it?"
               "Your father has been over at Pastores since, and they told him, that no such an
                  agreement had been made betwixt Vestilia and you."
               "That is positively a falsehood. She made an agreement with me, and that she can
                  not deny, without being guilty of a gross slander," answered Jathello, in a
                  greatly excited tone.
               "Keep down your anger my son—don't let foolish passion overrule you," said
                  Cleardo.
               "I am not angry, father, but it is provoking for one to hear of facts
                  contradicted."
               "Well so it is sometimes, but how will you mend the matter?"
               "I'll tell you how I'll mend the matter; I am going over there to-night, when I
                  can ascertain the veracity of the statement you have heard. I can not think for a
                  moment that Vestilia has so deceived me—certainly there must be a misunderstanding
                  existing somewhere and I am bound to ferret it out."
               "Well, if you are going over to see Vestilia to-night, I don't think that there is
                  any use discussing the matter any more. We had better await the result of your
                  visit," said Cleardo.
               Just at that moment Mendacea knocked at the door. She had come over on an errand, and seemed
                  somewhat in a hurry, but it was only feigned. Under such circumstances she was
                  sure to ask for an article that she was pretty confident they had not got, and
                  perhaps never had seen, much less possessed. Her main object was to gossip, an
                  employment that seemed compatible with her very existence—an employment, without
                  which, her soul would lose the energy that bespoke its existence. She had not been
                  in the castle of Cleardo long, when the same subject was taken up for further
                  discussion, that occupied their attention, at her previous visit.
               "Mendacea, have you heard anything more concerning what we were talking about when
                  you were here last?" inquired Cleardo's wife.
               "What was that?" answered Mendacea, pretending ignorance.
               "About the elopement of Vestilia with the hermit of Aleova."
               "O, yes, I remember. I haven't heard anything about it since, have you?"
               "Yes, I heard something about it the next day or so after that."
               "Well, what did you hear? That I had been telling a parcel of falsehoods, or
                  what?"
               "No, I have heard nothing about your telling falsehoods, but I heard that they had
                  not eloped; that Vestilia was still at home, but the hermit of Aleova had
                  gone."
               "Who was telling you that Vestilia was still at home. I would like to know?"
               "My son Jathello. Isn't that authority good enough?" inquired Cleardo's wife.
               "I should think it was good enough authority; but how did he come to hear what we
                  were talking about? Has he been to see her?" inquired Mendacea, as if she wanted
                  to find out all the particulars concerning Jathello, whether he had any liking for
                  Vestilia or not.
               "He has been to Pastores', and he saw Vestilia there, attending to the household
                  affairs as usual."
               "Is that possible. Are you sure that he was, there since that story could have
                  been raised?" inquired Mendacea very particularly.
               "Well, it was since you was over here the other day, so you may judge for
                  yourself," answered Cleardo's wife, as if she thought that Mendacea doubted what
                  she had just stated.
               
               "I do wonder who could have been so malicious as to start a story so false, on an
                  innocent girl? I do think it was too bad," said Mendacea, notwithstanding she knew
                  all about it and its origin.
               "Well, whoever it was had better be minding his or her own affairs. They'll have a
                  guilty conscience to trouble them, or else I am much mistaken," said Cleardo's
                  wife, as if she rather suspected Mendacea.
               "Well, I don't know about that. A person that would circulate such lies, can not
                  have much conscience," said Cleardo.
               "Well, indeed, I must really go home, for fear my husband will begin to think that
                  I am lost. To be sure, I don't live very far from here, but it is getting quite
                  dark," said Mendacea, as she left for home. Mendacea began to think that Cleardo's
                  folks began to have rather suspicious insinuations connected with their
                  conversation; therefore, she concluded that it was best for her to make up some
                  kind of an excuse, and leave the contest. Mendacea had always been a very great
                  friend of Cleardo's wife; but that late report rather had a tendency to throw a
                  damper on their intimacy. The family of Cleardo would not have had any reason to
                  doubt the veracity of Mendacea, if she had but given the origin of her report;
                  but, as she failed to do that, it was reasonable to suppose that she was somewhat
                  connected with the affair.
               "Husband, what do you think of that Mendacea? I have been quite an intimate
                  associate of hers, for several years, and, during that time, I have not heard you
                  speak your opinion about her single time. Now, please tell me, what do you think
                  of her?"
               "Well, I don't know that I ever had anything against the woman, until recently. I
                  always knew that she was an inveterate talker, but I ever thought anything about
                  her, until she began talk about Vestilia and that hermit; but to give you my
                  candid opinion now, I feel more fully persuaded. It is my honest belief, wife,
                  that Mendacea is the sole originator of that fallacious report. The whole
                  circumstance connected with the report, and her actions throughout, all indicate
                  the fact—all go to substantiate my suggestion."
               "I never had any reason to suspect her before; but I shall be careful how I believe what she says
                  hereafter."
               "But wife, you must treat her well. Use her as you always have been accustomed to,
                  and you will fare better in the sequel."
               "Oh, I shall—no doubt about that. If we are not good friends after this, why, it
                  won't be my fault."
               The daughter had just been in the room and notified them that supper was ready,
                  when they all went out into the dining hall. While partaking of the evening
                  repast, the following conversation commenced:
               "Jathello, I do say, you don't intend to go to see your neighbors, in such a
                  looking rig?"
               "No, mother, I am not. I have not begun to make any preparation whatever. There is
                  time enough for an hour yet."
               "Why, where is he going, to-night?" inquired the daughter, very particularly.
               "He is going over to Pastores', on an errand," replied her mother.
               "Oh dear! Can't I go along?"
               "No, daughter, you can not go tonight; but any other time you choose."
               Thus they conversed, until they had finished supper, when Jathello went to make
                  ready for his anticipated visit. He spared no pains to make himself look as tasty
                  as possible.
               In the evening when Vestilia had returned from the field, and done up her evening
                  chores, she hastened as usual to assist her mother with the supper.
               "You have got home already, my daughter; did you feel very lonesome to-day?" asked
                  Tuelia.
               "No, mother, not more than usual."
               "Vestilia, what do you think old neighbor Cleardo was here to-day".
               "You don't say so, mother. What did he want, I would like to know?"
               "Well, he said he was out strolling around for his health, so he thought he would
                  drop in and see how we were getting along."
               "Yes, he is always strolling around, according to his story," said Vestilia, with
                  a sarcastic toss of her head.
               "I presume, you would scarcely believe what I am going to tell you," said
                  Tuelia.
               "What is it mother—do tell me?"
               
               "You had the idea, that Cleardo would never forgive you, for your recent treatment
                  of his son, hadn't you?"
               "Yes mother, that was what I dreaded most."
               "Well, when your father and I saw him coming we came to the conclusion, that he
                  was coming for no desirable purpose; but oh! how astounded we were, when we heard
                  his jolly salutation. He seemed to be in ecstacy about something; but what that
                  was, we could not imagine. He talked about one thing and another at last be began
                  to inquire about you. He said that he could not remember your name, and wished us
                  to tell him saying, that he would try and remember it in future, for according to
                  what Jathello had been telling him, the day was not far distant when you would be
                  his daughter-in-law."
               "Why the old fool, if I may call him so. What did he mean?"
               "Well, he meant that you had given your hand to Jathello, unreservedly."
               "That Jathello must be one of the greatest young boobies in existence. I always
                  thought that he was an ignoramus, but now I am thoroughly convinced of the
                  fact."
               "Vestilia, my daughter, be sparing in the use of technicalities—the least said
                  will be the easiest mended."
               "Why mother? am I not speaking the truths?"
               "I presume you are, but the truth is not always to be spoken—there are a great
                  many truths which would not be advisable to be spoken."
               "Mother, when Cleardo told you that, didn't it excite your risible propensities?
                  Could you keep from laughing in his face?"
               "No daughter, I did not feel like laughing at all, I was too much surprised. His
                  story was so directly contradictory to yours, that I was afraid that you had
                  resorted to deception, to keep us from knowing the true statement."
               "Mother, did you ever know of my being guilty of such a misdemeanor in all my
                  life?"
               "No, I have not, but young folks often deviate from the truth, in love
                  affairs."
               "In love affairs! Mother do you suppose that there can be much love existing
                  between Jathello and me?"
               "I should not think there was, daughter."
               "Mother, what I told you the evening that Jathello was here, is the candid truth as far as I am acquainted with the
                  matter."
               "Don't you expect him to call again soon, or didn't he say anything about it?"
               "He, did not say that he would come again, and I am sure I did not ask him to; but
                  I should judge from Cleardo's story, that he would, and that soon."
               "Well, when he comes again, you had better give him to understand the true
                  statement—give him to know your positive determination."
               "Yes, ma'am, I shall; no doubt about that. He won't have to 'labor under
                  deception,' as he may term it any longer."
               "But, daughter, you must do all that in a friendly and courteous manner. Beware of
                  giving offence."
               "I will not offend him intentionally; but however, I will not condescend very much
                  to prevent, if he is so inconsiderate as to become so."
               While they were yet conversing, Pastores came into the dining room; but they
                  ceased immediately, for supper was then ready on the table. After they had taken
                  supper, Pastores and wife went into the sitting room, where they always remained
                  until bed time. Vestilia's mother usually assisted in doing up the kitchen work;
                  but that evening she felt unusually fatigued, and she told Vestilia that she would
                  be obliged to her, if she would excuse her from the kitchen, as she did not feel
                  as well as usual. Vestilia went to work alone, and soon accomplished all that
                  remained for her to do. She worked steadily, wishing to finish soon, for fear that
                  Jathello might be silly enough to drop in to-night. She did not know when he would
                  come, whether to-night or any other night; but had the idea that he would not wait
                  very long, from the circumstance she had lately been made acquainted with.
               When the dining equipage had all been stored away, Vestilia took a seat by the
                  table, with her guitar in hand. The evening was somewhat sultry, so, that the
                  kitchen door was left open. The moon was shining brightly through the castle
                  windows, that, with the burning embers on the grate, served her with all necessary
                  light on the occasion. When she had tuned her guitar, or lute, she commenced to
                  sing and play the following favorite piece of music: "I forget the gay world."— 
                     
                        "I forget the gay world at the lone hours of night,
                        
                        And the many dear friends that are sleeping;
                        I forget all the splendors that dazzle my sight,
                        And the many sad heart that are weeping;
                        But the musical tones of thine angel voice,
                        And the love in thy youthful eye,
                        With the gentle touch on the string of the lute,
                        Can alone with memory vie.
                        Tra, la la la, &c.
                     
                  
               
               While Vestilia, was singing the song, Jathello had come, but stood outside the
                  door. He did not wish to interrupt her until she had concluded. He paid strict
                  attention to the lines of the poetry, and thought that they were very appropriate
                  his circumstances. He admired each line as she sang them; but when she came to the
                  following, 
                     
                        "But the musical tones of thine angel voice,
                        And the love in thy youthful eye,"
                     
                   he thought that Vestilia's thoughts were upon him, and sang the song to that
                  intent. Jathello had few accomplishments, as I previously stated; but it could not
                  be denied but that he had a musical voice—was a sweet singer. The whole clan
                  admired the melody of his voice. I presume, from that fact, together with his
                  minor age, made him think that they were sung in memory of him, which we would
                  suppose to be natural for a person not too extensively gifted with
                  intelligence.
               When Vestilia had finished the song, she commenced to select another when Jathello
                  entered but when she saw him, she put up her lute or guitar and acted as though
                  she did not intend to sing any more at that time.
               "Vestilia, I was listening to your beautiful song, a good while. My very soul
                  seemed to join with you, as I listened to each sweet line."
               "It is a very beautiful piece indeed, I like it about as well as any I ever
                  heard," replied Vestilia.
               "Yes ma'am. that is so. Will you be so kind as to repeat it again?"
               "Jathello, I beg to be excused. I very seldom sing before strangers."
               "You would not call we a stranger, Vestilia."
               "Why not call you a stranger?"
               Why, from recent circumstances, you know," replied Jathello, getting a little
                  excited.
               "I know of no recent circumstance, that convinces me of that assertion."
               "Vestilia, I don't wish to contradict you, but I think that you know what I am
                  alluding to, very well, and if, you would only confess, it would save me from a
                  useless repetition."
               
               "That is as much as to say, that I am addicted telling fallacious stories,"
                  replied Vestilia, with the intention of having a little sport with Jathello.
               "Pardon me Vestilia, I did not mean to insinuate anything of the kind. I only
                  intended that you should guess," replied he, looking considerably frightened.
               "I prefer that you would tell me frankly, as I am not in the habit of
                  guessing."
               "Vestilia, I only alluded to the circumstance of our engagement."
               "O, that is it," replied Vestilia, laughing at the silliness of Jathello. "When
                  did our engagement take place?" she continued.
               "Didn't you consider that an engagement, which transpired between us the last time
                  I visited you?" inquired Jathello, earnestly.
               "No sir, I did not," replied Vestilia, with considerable emphasis.
               "Well, I certainly did," said Jathello.
               "I can't help it if you did. I don't think that I had a shadow of a reason to
                  think so; if you had, I wish you would explain the matter to me, perhaps I am
                  laboring under mental delusion."
               "Yes ma'am; I shall explain the whole proceedings ceedings, or rather, repeat it.
                  You remember that you promised me your hand if I would agree to wait as long as
                  you desired, before we should consummate the marriage ceremonies. Now I would like
                  to know if that isn't an honest engagement?"
               "Yes sir, I remember the promise very well; but you foolish fellow, didn't you
                  think that I was making sport all the time? Why I might keep you in suspense a
                  life-time, and not violate my promise; in fact that was my intention."
               "Vestilia, I did not think for a moment that you intended to deceive me so; I had
                  a better estimation of your character than that," said Jathello, as if he felt the
                  pangs of disappointment—as if he had begun to realize the story at his parents had
                  communicated to him previous to his present visit.
               "Jathello, I can not see wherein I have been the aggressor; I think the fault lies
                  at your own door, if you examine the matter more closely."
               "Well, I am exceedingly sorry that I have been put to such inconvenience. Why
                  didn't you give me your final decision, when I was here previous, can you tell me
                  that?"
               
               "I think, Jathello, that I did, and that sufficiently. If you had not been so
                  deficient in your sentient faculties, you would have discovered the deception. In
                  fact, I would say, that there was no deception used, intentionally; but because
                  you was deceived thereby, I used the term deception to convey my ideas."
               "O, Vestilia, don't be harsh with me! I do not intend that we shall be enemies. I
                  wish to be good friends, if nothing more intimate."
               "It is not my desire to offend you; but I simply wish you to understand me more
                  thoroughly in future."
               "O, Vestilia! Vestilia! Can you not love me? Will you not love me?" said Jathello,
                  hanging his head, as if to weep.
               "Jathello, I can love you, but as a friend. The closest tie that can ever connect
                  us on earth, is friendship."
               "You want me to understand, positively, that I can never aspire to your hand on
                  earth?" inquired Jathello, as if he was very reluctant to believe what he had
                  heard.
               "Yes, sir, that I do. My refusing your liberal offer, can never put you to any
                  great inconvenience venience—can never rob you of one solitary blessing in store
                  for you."
               "Vestilia, I beg leave to differ from what you have just asserted. I consider that
                  your refusal will not only rob me of myriads of blessings, but haunt me with
                  misery the rest of my life."
               "Jathello, I would almost say that you were laboring under mental hallucination.
                  How can it be possible that I will rob you of so much felicity, when you do not
                  really love me? You are not actuated by love; far from it! You have seen me year
                  after year, and it seemed that you would never deign to speak to me until of late.
                  Your parents are at the head of all your transactions, not love. They are urging
                  you on to secure my hand, thinking that you would secure wealth by the operation.
                  Instead of you being actuated by pure, unselfish motives, you have been a mere
                  tool—an instrument—for your parents to execute their selfish designs."
               "Vestilia, I see, by your conversation, that you intend to curtail our
                  acquaintance, rather abruptly."
               "You are at liberty to think as you choose; but I pledge my honor that no such an
                  object is intended. Jathello, just
                  think how foolishly you have acted towards me, and you can not help but acquit me
                  of all censure. You have only been to see me but twice, counting to-night, and the
                  very first night you proposed—aspired to my hand—not knowing whether I could
                  reciprocate your love or not. Thus portraying the hand, or, rather, the dictation
                  of some person, or persons, aside from yourself."
               "I confess that is all true; but that isn't sufficient reason why you shouldn't
                  love me," replied Jathello, not willing to give up his plea.
               "To be candid, Jathello, my love runs in a different channel. I don't wish to be
                  guilty of coquetry."
               "Ah! that is the reason why you would not accept my offer. I thought you would not
                  be so cruel as to absolutely refuse me, without a good and sufficient reason. I
                  feel much better on the subject than I did."
               "I am glad to hear it, Jathello. I sincerely hope that you understand me perfectly
                  this time."
               Vestilia did not contradict Jathello's ideas why she refused him, but was glad to
                  have him escape from the contest in such a reconciled spirit.
               "You are not afraid or unwilling to let me know who your suitor is, and what is
                  his name?"
               "Yes, sir, I am unwilling to let you or anybody else know anything about the
                  matter. I prefer that the knowledge of that should remain a secret in my bosom;
                  but every one is at liberty to conjecture who that person may be. Be patient,
                  Jathello, the lapse of time itself can alone divulge the untold mystery."
               "Is that person whom you have been alluding to, not the stranger that father was
                  speaking to me about, a few days ago? Was he from the wild woods of Aleova?"
                  inquired Jathello.
               "Well, suppose it was the man your father had reference to; what of that?" replied
                  Vestilia, with a toss of her head, as much as to say, "You're a little too
                  inquisitive, young man."
               "O, nothing Vestilia, but I shouldn't think that you would marry him."
               "Why, Jathello?"
               "Well, because he is poor and indigent, not possessing a place to put his foot
                  upon."
               "Now, Jathello, you are deviating from the truth. If you can not say what is true
                  about the stranger, you had better be silent," replied Vestilia lia, interrupting Jathello in the midst of what he
                  had intended to say.
               "I beg your pardon. What did I say that was fallacious, please tell me?"
               "You said that the stranger had no place to put his foot on; 'tis, false; he has a
                  home, although it is a hermitage—he has a plantation, although it is hemmed in, by
                  the wild forest of Aleova," replied Vestilia, in an excited tone.
               "I must have been wrongly informed," said Jathello, as if he was anxious to creep
                  out of the difficulty.
               "I am sorry Jathello, that I had to correct you in the midst of your conversation,
                  but I thought that you were far enough off the track already, without suffering
                  you to proceed any further; but proceed with the rest of your story, if you
                  please; I will not interrupt you again, without you get into a similar error,"
                  replied Vestilia.
               "Well, what I was going to say, was, that you would be a disgrace to the whole
                  Aleovan horde of shepherds, if you married him."
               "I am sorry that you, and all the rest of the Aleovans are so infatuated, that the
                  dictates of reason and common sense are consulted no longer to guide them through
                  the intricate pathway of Justice," replied Vestilia, with a curl of her lips
                  indicative of contempt.
               "Vestilia, I do think that you are getting very complimentary. You don't think
                  that you are one of the number that you are complimenting so highly."
               "I am well aware of what I am saying, and I also know that I am one of the
                  Aleovans; but I am happy to say that I am not a follower of their dogma. Many of
                  their codes are very defective," responded Vestilia.
               "Vestilia, suppose you should marry that hermit, how would you get along? No one
                  would visit you—no one would lend to or borrow of you, finally, no one would do
                  anything for you—you would be forever expelled from their company, and the
                  pleasure of their society," said Jathello, with a hope that be might discourage
                  her, to his own advantage—to his own aggrandizement.
               "Oh dear! what a frightful harangue," said Vestilia, with a feigned sign. "Is my
                  future welfare so much enshrouded in yours (the Aleovans), that there is no real
                  enjoyment to be found elsewhere?"
               
               "Pretty much so: at any rate, you'll find, that to get along through the world
                  without us, will cause you much difficulty and little pleasure; like the little
                  school boy, who toils and clambers up the hill with his miniature sled, that he
                  may have the momentary pleasure of riding down again. Much difficulty but little
                  pleasure is your only consolation," said Jathello, getting rather eloquent.
               "Well, Jathello, I don't know whether I can respond to your witty remark or not;
                  but I'll try."
               Jathello flattered himself that he had really said something worthy of note. He
                  made Vestilia think, for the first time, that he possessed any witticism or
                  intellectual comparison; but she determined to outwit his witty response, if in
                  her power.
               "If I should obey the mandates or injunctions of the clan," continued Vestilia, "I
                  would be like the incarcerated culprit, who sees oceans of pleasure a nd
                  enjoyment, but, all! he sees it only through the rusty bars that chequer the
                  windows of his gloomy cell—pleasure seen, but not realized—enjoyment in
                  redundance, but without the range of our possession."
               "Well, I shall give it up now," said Jathello, feeling that his idea, or
                  similitude, had been successfully surpassed, in witticism; but he would not
                  guaranty that it was in veracity.
               "Jathello, you seemed to doubt my veracity. Is there anything that I have said,
                  that is not perfectly consistent with reason and common sense? Why are the poor of
                  this part of the country driven to other parts of the world for alms?" inquired
                  Vestilia.
               "Simply because their humble plea is not granted—because they do not find a
                  reception in our clan," responded Jathello, as if he felt the weight of shame
                  somewhat, by his candor.
               "Yes, sir, Jathello, you have spoken the whole truth. If they are so fortunate—so
                  successful—as to receive anything while under your auspices, it is cold
                  charity—charity that would congeal the glowing heart of any philanthropist,"
                  observed Vestilia.
               "Vestilia, I see that you are determined to expatiate upon our misgivings. If I
                  don't benefit by your elaborate lectures, it will not be a fault of yours. You
                  have energetically fulfilled all duties incumbent on you," remarked Jathello.
               
               "Yes, sir, I think it greatly necessary that I should. If we wish to effect
                  anything, especially in the way of revolutionizing the world, we must commence
                  with the rising generation, as the poet says: 
                     
                        'We must train the youthful mind,
                        As we would the tender vine.'
                     
                  
               
               A plant, like the mind, is hard to cultivate, when its stem has become old and
                  firm; its tendrils having clasped firmly to its support. 
                     
                        'Listen to advice from the hoary-haired sage;
                        To culture the mind begin not with age.'"
                     
                  
               
               "Vestilia, you are getting quite poetical; but, with all your poesy, you will find
                  me a stubborn, obstinate pupil. One who would be likely to remain as skeptical as
                  ever, even after tempests of sarcasm and reproof have swept over me," ejaculated
                  Jathello.
               "O, well, if you are desirous of remaining in ignorance and superstition all your
                  life, why, that is no consideration to any one else, save yourself. It does not
                  indicate that all others will consider your actions exemplary. Not at all! I hope
                  the mass of them will come to a wiser and more justifiable conclusion."
               "Vestilia, I do positively declare, that if you was not a lady of repute, I would
                  have become angry at your gibes long ere this. Many of your remarks are sharp and
                  reprehensible," retorted Jathello, in rather a dissatisfied tone.
               "Get angry," replied Vestilia, with a sarcastic turn-up of her lips. "Why, you
                  silly fellow! I should think that that must be your predominating propensity. I
                  don't think it very commendable for a young man, to be speaking of his coarser
                  feelings, in female society," observed Vestilia.
               "The idea that you advanced is perfectly true; but, notwithstanding all that,
                  there is some reprehension, on the part of the female, connected with that
                  subject," replied Jathello, with a spirit that indicated a disposition to defend
                  his sex. "The fairer sex are often more to blame than their coarser relations;
                  because they usurp too much authority. They have naturally more liberty of
                  speech—more fluent with the tongue—therefore they are liable to impose upon the
                  more limited address—the finer feelings—of man; knowing that his indomitable
                  disposition engenders not resentment, especially towards your sex."
               "I can not say whether your disposition engenders genders resentment or not, but it seems to me at
                  times that it came near it. What I have told you to-night, is nothing but the
                  plain unerring truth. If I have, please inform me, wherein," replied Vestilia,
                  rather sharply.
               "Well, I don't know that you have intentionally told a positive falsehood; but you
                  know that the truth is not always to be spoken," replied Jathello.
               "Yes sir, truth is always to be spoken, more especially when it has a specific
                  tendency to counteract or lessen vice," responded Vestilia, rather tartly.
               "What are you alluding to now?" inquired Jathello.
               "Nothing but what you have heard already. I try to avoid all useless repetitions,
                  as much as possible," replied Vestilia, in an independent tone.
               "Yes ma'am, but I was thinking that you had reference to some other imperfect
                  trait in my character, not as yet alluded to. You seem to have an inexhaustible
                  source of argument," remarked Jathello.
               "Jathello, do you suppose that I am arguing with you, with the intention of
                  whiling away, what would otherwise be, a few solitary moments? No sir, if you can
                  not fully appreciate the force of my discussion at present, you will after the
                  elapse of a few years—you will, when the stale opinions of the present generation,
                  have passed into the obscure morass of oblivion."
               "I hope so, Vestilia, I am always anxiously looking for a brighter epoch to dawn
                  upon our deluded age."
               "That does well enough for you to talk about, but if you wish that epoch to dawn
                  upon your segment of this deluded age, you must assist its advent. Commence at
                  home, and let home-influences sweep, like a mighty besom, over the world; and, as
                  a necessary result, you will see that blessed era commencing to dawn upon this
                  deluded generation, and its consecutive ones, like the effulgent rays of the
                  morning. You may first notice its appearance, like the faint glare of the
                  twilight; but soon it brightens from its crepuscular glow, until it assumes the
                  brilliancy of the noon-day sun. Instead of 'hope on, hope ever,' I say
                     'work on, work ever.'"
               "Vestilia, I am very much obliged to you for your series of instructions, to-night, which you
                  have gratuitously bestowed upon me. I am beginning to know that I have a very
                  extensive lesson to learn, ere I will reach that desired eminence which you have
                  so glowingly depicted; but it is getting quite late now; therefore, we shall be
                  obliged to curtail our interesting conversation, or else trespass upon
                  discretion."
               "Jathello, may I ask you a question, before you leave for home?" inquired
                  Vestilia.
               "Yes, ma'am, with perfect freedom."
               "Well, it is this: Don't you suppose that you are a great deal wiser in things
                  relating to an amatorial nature, than when you came here to-night? Don't you
                  suppose that you could discharge the duties of courtship more desirably—more
                  successfully—than previous to to-night's visit?"
               "I sincerely think that I could; but, Vestilia, I will detain you no longer.
                  Pardon me for all I have done amiss. I hope that we shall always remain good
                  friends."
               "I hope so, too, Jathello," replied Vestilia, with a satisfied tone.
               "Good night, Vestilia," said Jathello, as he hastened home, not even waiting for
                  Vestilia's parting salutation; but his ear faintly caught her response, "good
                  night," as it began to die away.
               Here, reader, ends the interesting though concise courtship of Jathello and
                  Vestilia. The former introduced the subject of love, with intention of making it
                  the theme of the evening; but the latter's heart would not respond to anything of
                  an amatorial character. Jathello would talk of the bliss of holy matrimony, with a
                  make-believe feeling or emotion, but her unsophisticated heart was too innocuous
                  to reciprocate what was entirely repugnant. He still persisted in his plea,
                  notwithstanding the opposite stand Vestilia took, as if these lines of the poet
                  were indelibly stamped upon the tablet of his heart: 
                     
                        "Never give up, brother, never give up!
                        Though your burden be heavy, and dark be your way;
                        The bow in the clouds only comes with the rain,
                        And when night is deepest, then bursts forth the day."
                     
                  
               
               Jathello had to be dismissed as a non suitor. He was incompetent to
                  complete the task he had undertaken; but it was his last though ineffectual
                  attempt to woo the bright-eyed Vestilia. He found her true and unflinching in the
                  avowal she had made to some unknown
                  lover; therefore, he was-compelled to relinquish his plea, and return home, a
                  wiser suitor, and be content with his present circumstances, or direct his
                  seemingly redundant supply of affections in another, perhaps more beneficial,
                  channel.
               After the exit of Jathello, Vestilia lingered in the kitchen, to muse on the
                  singular occurrences of the day. Her thoughts wandered over the many flowering
                  hillocks that arose from the bosom of her father's pasture-lands, to that lonely
                  spruce tree, under whose welcome umbrage she had spent so many happy hours, and
                  from thence, her imagination roved to the wild forest of Aleova, where wandered
                  her weary lover. She seemed to be watching his lonely footsteps, as they were
                  implanted on the mossy strands of the babbling brook, on his way to the solitary
                  hermitage. She longed to be with him, to cheer him in his lonely pilgrimage—to
                  enliven his sorrowful moments. As she sat in the kitchen all alone, her thoughts
                  would break forth, as it were, with emphasis nearly audible, saying, "O, dearest
                  Solum! would that I was with thee, enjoying thy soul-cheering company. When shall
                  that happy day dawn upon my existence, that opposition shall subside, and I be
                  permitted to call thee mine? O, I sincerely hope it is almost now! O,
                  charming Solum, I will call thee mine!
               
                  
                     Yes, ever such I'll call thee, will ever call thee mine,
                     And, with the love I bear thee, a wreath of poesy twine;
                     And when the stars are shining in their bright home of blue,
                     Gazing on them, thou mayest know that I like them are true.
                  
                  
                     Forget thee? No, O never I thy heart and mine are one;
                     How can the man who sees the light forget the noon-day sun,
                     Or, he who feels its genial warmth forget the orb above,
                     Or, feeling sweet affection's power, its source—another's love?
                  
                  
                     But ask not if I love thee when I would call thee mine,
                     For words are weak to tell thee all, and I the task resign;
                     But send thy spirit out for love, and when it finds its goal,
                     'Twill be encircled and embraced within thy deepest soul."
                  
               
               When Vestilia was in the midst of her musing train, the old mantel clock told the
                  hour eleven. She was astonished that she had been thinking so long—just one hour
                  from the time that Jathello departed. But so sweet were her meditations, or
                  reflections, that time itself passed so lightly and swiftly away, that she could
                  not discern its nimble footsteps, as it fled away to endless eternity. Heretofore,
                  time had borne heavily upon her lonely mind; but, oh! that happy hour of
                  reflection—that happy hour of sweet communion with an absent though honest heart—a heart that she
                  cherished amid the storms of opposition and threatened adversity—a heart that she
                  hoped would one day be entwined with hers, like the ivy that clings to the shaggy
                  coat of the "old oak;" but that can not happen, until the gigantic billows that
                  are rolling on the sea of difficulties are lulled—until its heaving tide has
                  calmed to a quiet surface, and every eddy hushed in the arms of stillness.
               Vestilia had now gone into the sitting room to her parents, but they had become
                  weary of, waiting so long, and subtil slumber had overcome them; but the noise of
                  entrance awoke them.
               "Vestilia, I really thought that you intended to sit up all night with Jathello.
                  Why did you talk so long, didn't you think that our patience could be worn out?"
                  inquired her mother rather sharply.
               "Pardon me, mother, it was not Jathello's fault, he left in good season; but I
                  foolishly got into a train of thinking, and did not quit until the clock struck
                  eleven, when I was frightened, and came into the room immediately," replied
                  Vestilia.
               "Well, how did you make out to-night, daughter?" inquired Tuelia.
               "I got along admirably, I tell you. I expected two or three times that we would
                  get into a fracas, but we didn't. He behaved himself rather gentlemanly during the
                  whole evening, and went away with an excellent frame of mind."
               "How did he take your refusal, or how did he feel when he discovered his mistake?"
                  inquired Tuelia.
               "Well, he tried to make a considerable fuss about it at first, but when frankly I
                  told him that he did not love me—that, his whole proceedings were only a series of
                  make-believe, he became more calm; until by-and-by, he became quite natural in his
                  deportment, and gave up his idle whims," remarked Vestilia, with a lively
                  expression.
               "I presume he would not be willing at first to acknowledge that what you said was
                  true," observed her mother.
               "No mother, he was not; but I tell you, he went home to-night a changed boy, if I
                  may call him so; he seemed to have been brought to a new life. He acted like a
                  person that lived, yet didn't live. I
                  mean he was endowed with animal life, but he had no intellectual animation. It
                  seems as if his mind had always been good enough, but had never been aroused from
                  its lethargical condition—it had no impetus to awake it from its dormant repose to
                  actual usefulness," replied Vestilia.
               "Why, what made you think so, my daughter?"
               "Well, from his conversation. I asked him previous to his departure, if he didn't
                  think that the course he pursued, was entirely wrong. I also asked him if he was
                  not fully convinced, that wooing the youthful heart, by the dictation of parents
                  was an imposition; which interrogations he answered in the affirmative," remarked
                  Vestilia, as a sly hint to her mother.
               "I expect neighbor Cleardo will be over to-morrow, to lecture us about your
                  proceedings. I don't think that he will visit us very often; but he will want to
                  have the gratification of some little revenge ere he quits our company entirely,"
                  observed Tuelia.
               "Don't fear him, mother, I don't think he'll trouble you much. Jathello's
                  narrative will produce quite a different effect upon him, for I feel pretty
                  confident, that he will give his father some wholesome advice on the subject,"
                  responded Vestilia.
               "Vestilia, did he inquire anything about the hermit of Aleova, for no doubt his
                  father has given him a history as far as he knew of," inquired her mother.
               "History, what of?" inquired Vestilia.
               "The history of the Aleovan hermit," responded her mother.
               "O yes ma'am, he said something about him, what did he say, let me see?" replied
                  Vestilia, trying to think. "O, I remember now, what he said. I intimated to him
                  that I had a suitor, when he replied saying that he knew who I had reference to. I
                  asked him who? He said his father had been telling him about the person in
                  question. Then he asked me if he wasn't from the wildwood of Aleova. I answered
                  him, saying, "What if that was precisely the gentleman?" "O nothing," he replied,
                  "only he thought that I wouldn't marry that poor beggar boy," and thus went on
                  with a harangue, until I was persuaded to rebut his eloquence."
               Just at that moment Pastores awoke from his nap, and inquired what time of night it was.
                  Vestilia answered him saying that it was half an hour past eleven o'clock. He was
                  much surprised to find it so late. They all immediately retired to their
                  dormitories, where they soon fell into the soothing embrace of Morpheus; and under
                  whose auspices we will leave them, and turn our attention to the whereabouts of
                  the Aleovan hermit.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               SOLUM'S RETURN TO THE HERMITAGE, &C.
               Reader, let us turn our imagination to the Aleovan hermit, to ascertain what
                  head-way he is making through the sombre forest, on his return to the lonely
                  hermitage. But to do justice to the narrative, we must commence with the noble
                  spruce tree—the arbor of resort. We first witness him (Solum) as he is about to
                  quit the umbrage of that wide-spreading spruce, where sat the weeping figure of
                  his lady-love Vestilia. When he observed the tears of love trickle down her rosy
                  cheeks, like dew-drops of the early morning, what were the emotions that filled
                  his heart? There was a warfare within—a combat to quell the out gush of passion,
                  that threatened within; he did not wish at that critical moment, to portray an
                  effeminate disposition, to discourage
                  his now weeping Vestilia. He has bidden her adieu—we see tear after tear steal
                  unbidden down his weather-beaten cheeks as he recedes from the gaze of his idol,
                  as he approaches the border of the gloomy forest. Again, he halts, to take as it
                  were, a final glance at the sylph-like figure that sat weeping all lonely in the
                  back ground. He thinks it almost impossible to tear himself away from that one,
                  with whom his whole soul seemed to be united; but at last he summons courage
                  enough to dismiss those effeminate emotions or feelings, saying, to cherish such,
                  can not enhance my welfare or hers whom I so highly esteem. He again faces the
                  weary pathway, that lay spread out before him, over rocks, boulders, logs and
                  dense underbrush; these with a thousand other obstacles bestrewed his lonely path.
                  He renews his gait by lengthening his steps and accelerating his motion, until he
                  finds himself in the narrow confines of the gloomy forest, where lay his once
                  trodden path; but not a vestige of the fact was manifest, on the mossy strands of
                  the murmuring brook-all had been erased by the frequent showers that fell in that
                  section of country. But if the foot-prints of his former journey had been erased;
                  there remained a surer guide, which could never be erased, until the terraqueous
                  globe would shrink from its primitive beauty, to assume a higher acme of
                  perfection, which epoch can not adorn the existence of mortality, but will emerge
                  to the gaze of immortality, when time shall be declared no longer; and that was
                  the babbling brook, whose tortuous channel lay by the side of the solitary
                  hermitage.
               Solum continued to travel onward, following his rugged path, as it ran in the
                  advance, winding through dells, over glens, beneath impending precipices, and by
                  dense thickets. Anon, you might see him clambering over the rugged surfaces of
                  everlasting rock, and then, again, he would sink away from our vision. At the same
                  time, he was groping his way through gloomy caverns or grottoes, whilst ledges of
                  mighty rocks overhung the scene; but soon he would emerge from those sable
                  grottoes, rejoicing, as it were, that he had escaped what appeared to him to be
                  the outskirts of the kingdom of his Satanic majesty—still hurrying on, fearing
                  that the evening shades might begin to fall, ere he had reached his intended
                  destiny. Solum was too excessively fond of viewing the works of nature to make a speedy traveler—too
                  fond of prying into the arcana of unrevealed
                  knowledge.
               Solum is now at the beautiful lake mentioned in a previous chapter, where he
                  resolves to remain for dinner. He intends to catch some of the myriads of fishes
                  that were sporting in the lake, to dine upon; and in order to execute that
                  intention, he took his knapsack, which was stored bountifully with biscuits and
                  other eatables, from the generous hand of Vestilia, into the forest, some ways,
                  and placed it upon a large rock, upon which he intended to dine, when all
                  preliminaries were executed. He left the rock, and went a small distance into the
                  thick forest, to select a fishing pole, when he came to a venerable old beech
                  tree, which furnished him with the requisite material. While he was cutting the
                  fishing rod, he turned round to observe whether his provision was all right or
                  not, when he was frightened to see a guest at his dinner table, of no ordinary
                  appearance. The huge monster in question took hold of the knapsack, and dragged it
                  off the rock, for his own amusement. It was a large black bear, a frequent denizen
                  of the dark and shady wood, adjacent to lofty mountains. The animal was hungry,
                  and seemed anxious to know if there was anything in the knapsack that would suit
                  his anything but fastidious taste. But whilst Bruin was going through those series
                  of manipulations, Solum was not looking on with the eye of complacency. He did not
                  intend to let the shaggy-hide rob him of his dinner, without letting him (Bruin)
                  know that he was desirous of a divide. But what was Solum to do. His unerring
                  rifle lay beside the knapsack, and the whole under the auspices of Bruin. In such
                  an awful dilemma he had never been before; but he at last resolved to wait until
                  the bear had commenced that process of dining called prehension, when he would
                  probably be enabled to steal unawares and snatch his deadly weapon, when he would
                  be more than a match for monster Bruin. The snatching of the rifle from the
                  protection of the bear, was a daring adventure, whereby he might have easily lost
                  his life; and the sequel to such a sad fate my reader can easily imagine for
                  himself, without leaving the task for me to accomplish for him.
               The noise that Solum made in procuring his gun, made Bruin utter a dissatisfied
                     whew! but when his
                  fright had somewhat subsided, he looked around to observe who had treated him in
                  such an unfriendly manner, when he observed Solum; at that moment he set up a
                  savage growl, as mulch as to say, "intruder if you wish to preserve a piece of
                  your personage for your specimen case, as a relic of your former greatness, you
                  had better leave the contested ground while you are able;" but at that favorable
                  look, Solum discharged his piece, when it sent a ball whizzing into his (Bruin's)
                  brazen countenance, which gave him a kind of headache, not often long supportable,
                  and as a necessary consequence, Bruin keeled over, thus yielding the field to his
                  victor, Solum, much to the dissatisfaction of his usual indomitable disposition.
                  Solum rejoiced that he was permitted to spoil Bruin's fun, as well as suddenly rob
                  him of his appetite, for he considered, that all that was in his knapsack, might
                  be of service to him hereafter, if not at present.
               After Solum's successful combat with Bruin, he commenced to wage 'war against his
                  inferior enemies, the mosquitoes. While he was fishing, they attacked him in such
                  swarms as to make him think that they intended to convey him away by piece-meals,
                  but he succeeded in keeping them off until he had caught enough fish for one meal.
                  The fish he dressed and broiled on the coals, making in all rather a dainty
                  meal.
               When he had completed his meal, he laid down upon the mossy bed of nature, to
                  enjoy a siesta, but could not successfully, on account of the busy hum of
                  mosquitoes, that seemed to be keeping watch over his sleeping pillow. While he was
                  there lying on his mossy bed, he heard a tremendous splash on the lake; he jumped
                  to his feet, to see if he could ascertain its origin; but nothing could be seen
                  but the widening ripples; but whilst he gazed thereon, he witnessed a repetition
                  of the same splash, which unfolded the mystery. It was a large lake trout jumping
                  up to catch at the swarms of insects that sported over the surface of the sheet of
                  water.
               Those trout-playing scenes, reminded Solum of what his father used to tell him;
                  and that was, when he witnessed the fishes play upon the surface of the water,
                  after insects, he must look out for a storm to follow subsequently. But there were
                  no meteorological phenomena that indicated the fact, without it was the death-like
                  stillness of the atmosphere. Not a leaf
                  could be seen to move, excepting those of the aspen, which seldom ceases to quake
                  in the stillest breath of the breeze; but anon, he hears the low muttering voice
                  of thunder, as each consecutive peal rolled over Aleova's gloomy forest; which
                  removed the approach of a storm beyond a doubt—directly he sees dark and gloomy
                  clouds arise, and they, hastening madly on, until they had overspread the whole
                  blue canopy, impeding every effulgent ray of light, that proceeded from the sun.
                  Ever and anon, a vivid glare would flash across the dismal canopy, when the loud
                  and heavy booming of thunder responded in the distance.
               Those fearful rumblings of nature, were not music to Solum's ear. It yielded no
                  soothing strains, like the cadence of the lute-string, but it made him quake with
                  terror, and well it might, for it was not a very pleasing predicament to be in,
                  when a threatening storm was hovering around; without a shelter to resort to. But
                  to his joy, he witnessed an effulgent ray from the sun, through the lowering
                  clouds, which indicated that the storm was passing over, leaving the terrified
                  hermit unmolested. The angry storm had taken a north-easterly direction. When the
                  sun began to shine forth unbeclouded, what a dismal cast it give to the retreating
                  storm. It looked like the dark and gloomy shades of midnight, laid bare to the
                  brilliant light of the noonday sun, and from that gloomy spectacle, arose gigantic
                  columns of gold capped clouds; and the resplendent reflections that shone from
                  their summits, seemed to cap the climax; but soon all this resplendent and dismal
                  scenery, with the distant peals of thunder, faded from the perspective-all was
                  swallowed up in a profound quietus, excepting the feeble chirping of the tiny
                  feathered songster.
               Solum, now thinking it hightime, resumes his journey, and keeps on steadily
                  without losing sight of the lucid sparkle of the babbling brook. He seemed to be
                  enamored with its merry song, as it rushed madly over the many pebbles that lay
                  strewed over the channel. When he gazed upon its sparkling waters and listened to
                  its sweet cadence, he thought of the beautiful and appropriate language of the
                  poet, as follows: 
                     
                        "Nature's fair daughter,
                        Beautiful,—water!
                        
                        O, hail it with joy, with echoes of mirth,
                        Wherever it sparkles or ripples on earth.
                     
                     
                        Down from the mountain
                        Up from the fountain,
                        Ever it cometh, bright, sparkling and clear
                        From our Creator, our pathway to cheer."
                     
                  
               
               Solum had now reached an eminence where he could see his destined home, but it
                  was, just as the sun was taking his farewell look upon the mighty landscape
                  beneath, for the day; but it was necessary that he should shorten his gaze, and
                  hasten his footsteps or be compelled to travel a part of the way in darkness,
                  which he knew would not be very pleasant, especially, when his ears would be
                  saluted by the hideous yelps or shrieks of the roving wild beasts.
               When Solum had safely arrived at his hermitage, it was too dark for him to look
                  around his lot to see whether every everything remained as he had left them; all,
                  that he could do, was to collect fuel for the night, and shut the door of the
                  hermitage, for fear of the intruding wild-beasts; he then kindled a fire, (which
                  was done by igniting rich pitch-pine knots) and then searched his cottage to know
                  if all things were right or not; but he could not discover anything wrong,
                  excepting some little depredations committed by the tiny wood-mice, which he
                  considered of no consequence whatever.
               Solum had been previously reluctant to return to his old hermitage; but still he
                  was ready to acknowledge his satisfaction at having been permitted to reach it
                  again in safety. He felt somewhat at home again, when he witnessed the burning
                  embers, that played upon the hearthstone; but as he gazed upon the flickering
                  blaze, that sported beautifully on the antique looking fire-place, his thoughts
                  began to wander with the mighty zephyr, far over the sombre forest, to the rustic
                  castle of old Pastores, where his lady-love Vestilia, might be reciprocating his
                  meditations, by the feeble blaze of the lamp in the kitchen. He thought what a sad
                  reflection it was, to think of being separated from all that the heart held near
                  and dear on earth—from its only kindred in affection. But why this separation?
                  thought he. Is our love not mutual? Is there a want of congeniality in our hearts?
                  No! there lacketh nothing of that character; but there lacketh one thing, and I
                  almost blush to think of it—to think what an inferior—what a trifling obstacle
                     may sometimes separate two loving
                  hearts. it is wealth—paltry wealth, that separates us, but I feel thankful there
                  exists no crime, that would have a tendency to expel me from the company of my
                  intended Vestilia. "Oh! that I was wealthy," thought he, "not that glittering gold
                  allured my wishful eyes, or that I loved to bear the music of its clinking; far
                  from it; but that I might be, enabled to have access to the innocent company of
                  Vestilia; but as it is, I am destined to wait until the generous hand of death
                  would open the way, by kindly taking away those formidable obstructions, or that
                  kind fortune would otherwise administer to my desires." In such a meditative mood
                  did Solum remain for many consecutive moments. His anxious heart was ciphering out
                  a scheme or project, whereby he might aspire to the band of Vestilia, without
                  incurring the disapprobation or displeasure of her venerable parents; but with all
                  his effort of mind, nothing could be devised more real or efficient than imaginary
                  castles, often constructed in the atmosphere, which are of no account, beyond the
                  pleasure of erecting them.
               After Solum had eaten his evening meal, (which was a hearty one), he retired to
                  his bed of spruce boughs, to slumber away the many anxieties of his mind with the
                  fatigues of the past day's journey.
               I presume that many of my readers, have heard of the fact, that 
                     
                        Eating a full fuel on going to bed,
                        Would cause many dreams to trouble your head.
                     
                  
               
               Many of you have been taught it, ere yon left the nursery, I presume, for many
                  useful apothegms or axioms have been taught there, as well as the many silly
                  nursery rhymes. There is, no doubt, more truth than poetry, connected with the
                  simple rhyme above penned, at least you will be convinced that it proved so in the
                  case of Solum.
               When all was still around the Aleovan hermitage—even the many echoes that were
                  awakened by the hideous caterwaul of the catamount, were hushed in the repose of
                  the pitchy-darkness, and not a sigh or dirge of the breeze broke the profound
                  silence of the hour that Solum entered the pleasant land of dreams. Yes, he
                  dreams! He is visited by a thousand phantoms, each alluring him with a cheering
                  hope, that help would shortly come to
                  his relief. He dreamed that he had left his lonely hermitage, to visit the home of
                  his childhood, which was the little town Oleva, spoken of in a previous chapter.
                  Yes, he dreamed that he had crossed Aleova's towering heights, with the nimbleness
                  of a bounding roe, and stood upon the ground where he had whiled away so many
                  happy hours, in his youthful days. It was there he used to scamper through the
                  gloomy forest, and gambol with pleasure on the flower-clad strands of the lake
                  below, and from whose quiet waters, he had stolen many a wary trout. But Oleva
                  itself bore the aspect of dilapidation and decay; a dreary waste of brick and
                  mortar, or of whatever materials the houses were constructed. Dilapidated
                  cottages, and weedy gardens was the characteristic aspect of the village. Solum
                  was horror stricken with the dismal tableau, tempting him to flee, ere he had
                  entered a single cottage; but idle curiosity led him to banish all squeemish
                  thoughts, and boldly enter each and every house, until he had gone the general
                  round; and if tradition has informed me right, he found immense sums of gold and
                  silver, which he had collected together into a bag or knapsack. The bag containing
                  the wealth was quite heavy, so that it could not be lugged about without
                  considerable effort. Solum in his dream, was making considerable effort to carry
                  his bag of wealth; so great was the exertion he was making, that it awoke him from
                  his dream. When he awoke he found himself pulling on a limb, that was attached to
                  one of the timbers of the cottage. That limb had been left on account of the novel
                  shape into which it had grown. It first had grown out of the parent tree, in the
                  usual manner, but by some extraordinary freak of nature, it had re-entered the
                  trunk, forming a complete handle; and to that natural handle, Solum was pulling
                  on, instead of the handle of the money bag in question. It was a sad
                  disappointment to him indeed; but still, that was nothing unusual to happen to
                  those who visit the beautiful land of dream—they meet with more disappointment
                  than otherwise; but once in a great while, there happens to be a fortunate one
                  visit that imaginary elysium—success being the exception, not the rule.
               Whilst he lay upon his boughy bed, thinking of his late dream, his ears were
                  saluted with the first notes of the mountain robin—the herald of the morning, as its sweet cadence aroused
                  the sleeping echoes.
               He arose and dressed himself, to take his accustomed morning ramble. He took his
                  fishing tackles with him that he might catch a few trout, to breakfast upon, for
                  it would be out of the question, entirely, (to use the homely phrase) for him to
                  eat a single meal without that luxury. When he came to the brink of the stream, he
                  observed the hungry trout play up and down, after the unwary insects that danced
                  carelessly over the rippled surface of the water. When he had arranged his
                  tackles—fixed the "dainty allurement" upon the barbed hook, he cast it into the
                  brook, as a choice dainty for the finny tribes; but the bait had no sooner touched
                  the surface of the water, when a hungry trout bore away the booty, and in the act
                  of "playing off," Mr. Trout discovered his mistake; but I would suggest, that Mr.
                  Trout was not more mistaken or disappointed, than Solum was, with his bag of gold
                  and silver, he had dreamed of; but laying all conviviality aside, that dream of
                  Solum's might be of service to him at last. The idea came into his mind as he
                  continued to fish, of taking a trip to his native town, Oleva, to see if he could
                  not bring about a realization of his last night's dream. After he had caught
                  enough trout to breakfast upon, he returned to the hermitage, full of enthusiasm.
                  He could think of little else than his visit to Oleva—its successful results. That
                  he might become the possessor of unnumbered wealth, in the desirable shape of gold
                  and silver.
               Reader, you are aware, that I detailed an account of the plague that visited that
                  town, in a former chapter. The said pestilence destroyed all its inhabitants,
                  excepting Solum the hermit, consequently there would be no one to lay claims to
                  the wealth remaining—he being the sole heir; he could help himself with impunity,
                  having no one to dispute the claim—no one to accuse him of theft or robbery.
               That dream still ran in Solum's mind, to the entire exclusion of every other
                  object—not even a thought of his absent Vestilia; but of course it was on her
                  account that the dream was of such importance. He would commence to fix up his
                  garden, and all other matters that required his attention, but still he was
                  haunted by that spectral money bag, insomuch that he came to the conclusion that
                  he would go and ascertain the reality
                  of his vision; but at the time, he had not entirely recovered from the fatigue of
                  the last journey, consequently, he did not feel like commencing another so soon,
                  therefore he deferred it until a convenient day, when he would be enabled to
                  commence the tedious journey with the break of day; but circumstances dictated for
                  him, that he dare not postpone his journey too long, for fear his supply of
                  biscuits would not hold good, for it was quite certain that a substitute could not
                  be procured especially in that desolate region.
               Solum's mind, at last, became so restless, and dissatisfied that he could not wait
                  any longer, therefore he commenced to arrange his traveling baggage, and have all
                  in readiness for the early morning—to commence the journey with the first notes of
                  the chewink. When all preliminaries were completed, night came on, and Solum
                  determined to retire early, that he might be enabled to commence the day's journey
                  at an early hour; but when he had retired a few moments, tradition tells us that
                  he had a repetition of the same vision; but they made the remark that the bag of
                  money did not seem so heavy, but that deviation is easily accounted for, by taking
                  into consideration, the cause of his previous struggle, I mean the novel limb on
                  the wall of the hermitage, which article he failed to get hold of, in the
                  repetition of the vision, therefore there was nothing to indicate lugging an
                  immense bag of gold and silver.
               Solum was awakened early in the morning, by the loud and frequent pattering of the
                  heavy rain drops, as they passed through the leaky roof of the hermitage on to the
                  floor, but some of the heavy drops, less careful where they fell, dropped on his
                  sleeping personage, which had a tendency to curtail his sweet repose.
               When he saw that it was raining so hard, he felt somewhat disappointed, thinking
                  that his journey was all over with for the day, but by and by the rain ceased,
                  when the sun shone forth in its usual splendor. It was only what you might justly
                  denominate a morning shower. The recent shower rendered a journey through the
                  forest very unpleasant, but the anxiety of Solum's mind would not suffer him to
                  postpone it any longer; consequently he starts full of enthusiasm, and earnest
                  anticipations, and to the pursuance of that lonely journey, we will leave him, and
                  advert to him in a subsequent chapter; but at present, let us turn to the family
                  of Pastores, to learn how they prosper under the vicissitudes of time.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE ILLNESS OF PASTORES—HIS RECOVERY.
               Pastores now began to think that his lamp of life was near being extinguished for
                  time—that his stay upon earth would be but a transient one. The consideration of
                  that all-important subject, gave him unbounded sorrow and dissatisfaction; not
                  that he naturally dreaded the cold and unwelcome embrace of the monster death. No!
                  he feared not his tyrannic majesty, nor trembled at his unlimited sway; but his
                  sole anxiety was on account of his only child, Vestilia, whom he knew was
                  unprepared to commence this sad world alone. He knew that if death should suddenly
                  take him away, that all the responsibilities of the herds would fall upon her
                  shoulders, which was entirely too much for her youthful, inexperienced age.
               Pastores was taken with an unnatural sensation or feeling about his head, which
                  continued for several days, until it unfortunately terminated in an attack of
                  apoplexy; a disease which very commonly affects aged persons, producing death in a
                  great many instances; but the most unpleasant sequelea accompanying those who
                  partially recover, is paralysis; which seems to be a cessation of the function of
                  the motor nerves. As I intimated before, the disease very often proves fatal; but
                  happily, it did not in the case of Pastores. There was no doctor of medicine
                  belonging to the Aleovan horde, but most of the elderly women turned their
                  attention to that science, and some of them were considered quite skillful, and
                  Tuelia, the wife of Pastores, was among that number. Nature, with her noble
                  assistant, Tuelia, succeeded in arousing Pastores from the doltish malady that
                  held him bound with its lethargic chains.
               Vestilia dearly loved her father, and was a faithful companion during his disabled
                  hours. She loved him, notwithstanding he had frustrated her fondest anticipations,
                  at least for a time. She feared the dire malady under which her dear father labored, would prove fatal, ere the
                  exigencies could be justly and desirably disposed of.
               It happened one afternoon, after Pastores was restored to sensibility, that
                  Vestilia was alone with her father, Tuelia, her mother, being in the kitchen, that
                  the following pathetical conversation ensued:
               "How can I get along without you, dearest father?" said Vestilia.
               "Oh! my dear daughter, that is the only cause of my sorrow. If you was only well
                  provided for (I don't refer to wealth, but with a help-mate for life), I would
                  feel exceedingly happy, and would be satisfied to lie down and die," answered
                  Pastores, with pathos.
               "Dear father!" said Vestilia, when a sob checked the remainder of what she wished
                  to express.
               "What troubles you, my daughter? Do not fear to speak your whole heart to me, for
                  I can not nor will not, censure any of your desires or intentions."
               "Dear father," repeated Vestilia, feeling much encouraged by her father's last
                  remark, "can you not be reconciled to my friendship with Solum? Are you not
                  willing that I should marry him?"
               These interrogations of Vestilia, seemed more effectually to touch the sympathetic
                  passion of her father—so much so that he was compelled to pause for a reply, but
                  at last he said:
               "If I die, you can do as your conscience dictates for you. I will then be free
                  from all dire responsibilities."
               "O, father! if that is all that you fear, responsibilities, your mind need not be
                  troubled any further, for most assuredly, I am responsible for all misdemeanor,
                  not you," responded Vestilia, with a tone that indicated that she felt certain of
                  her plea.
               "That is true, my daughter," said Pastores thoughtfully, "but still, the mass of
                  the censure would fall upon my shoulders."
               "That may be the case, father. It is hard indeed, for a person to be deprived of
                  the liberty or privilege of doing what he considers proper, but so it is. Oh,
                  dear!" uttered Vestilia, with a deep sigh.
               "Vestilia, do you mean to insinuate that I am depriving you of your liberty to
                  think and act?" inquired Pastores, as if he felt a rebuke.
               "No, dear father, I did not mean that you had deprived me of a single privilege, but that the
                  clan to which you belong, had denied you the liberty of acting according to the
                  dictates of your good sense," observed Vestilia.
               "That is even so, my daughter, but do not give yourself any extra trouble on that
                  account, remember that all things will work for your best interest in the
                  sequel—be cheerful, as the poet says: 
                     
                        "When hope, the sweet flow'rs of heaven unfold,
                        You may quaff many pleasures from their cups of gold,"
                     
                   replied Pastores, intending to cheer his daughter's depressed spirits.
               "I thank you, father, for your consoling admonition; but what is pleasure and
                  enjoyment, when it can not be procured when desired?" murmured Vestilia.
               "Ah! my daughter, that is poor logic of 
                     your's
                     yours
                  . You must consider, that very often what we earnestly desire, would
                  prove our greatest injury, both for time and eternity, if they were granted us;
                  therefore be encouraged and contented with your present prospects: 
                     
                        '"Take courage, prisoner of time, for there be many comforts;
                        Cease thy labor in the pit, and bask awhile with truants in the
                           sun.'"
                     
                  
               
               "I shall try to, father, but it seems to be a hard task, and if it were not for
                  your poetical encouragements, I know I should despair," said Vestilia, with a
                  down-cast look.
               "I know it seems hard to be denied pleasures when we desire their enjoyment, but
                  often-times they prove a richer blessing, by being long withheld from us,
                  therefore do not murmur, my dearest daughter," replied Pastores pathetically, for
                  his heart swelled with sympathy for his only child. His expression indicated that
                  there was a warfare within his heart, a struggle for the ascendency. He did not
                  feel that he could openly transgress the by-laws of the horde, which he had so
                  long held sacred, by granting Vestilia her earnest request. The Aleovan code,
                  requiring the expulsion of indigent persons from their clan, had long been held in
                  estimation by each member of that noble band; but of a more recent period, there
                  were many dissenters, who positively denied the validity of such a code; whether
                  that was the result of Solum's teaching by the medium, Vestilia, tradition does
                  not inform us; however, it tells us, that in process of time, they arose en masse
                  to review their statutes, for the purpose of revising all that appeared peared defective, and among the number
                  was the code in question. They had an arbitration or discussion, on the subject.
                  Some of the members of the society, strenuously advocated the validity of the law,
                  while others firmly repudiated it, until finally the party in opposition gained
                  the ascendency, and had it revised, so that the law rendered the subject optional
                  with each member, and the former reading of the code was stricken from their
                  calendar.
               As I intimated before, Pastores lay helpless as an infant for many days. He was
                  unable to exert himself in the least (I would say), therefore, he greatly needed
                  the fostering care of Tuelia and daughter. He began to loose all the feelings of
                  dissatisfaction, he had formerly exercised towards Vestilia, and became more and
                  more attached to her day by day. He never felt easy when she was absent from his
                  presence; but exercised a nervous or restless disposition, until she would return
                  to his bedside, when he became quiet, as though from the effects of an anodyne.
                  When he had fully recovered his mind, he began to have serious reflections on his
                  previous treatment towards Vestilia. He felt that lie must crave her forgiveness
                  ness, or be doomed to a series of reflections, that would ever accuse him of his
                  misdemeanor, and thus render his life more miserable than the most ignominious
                  death. But there was one thing that had a tendency to mitigate his remorse, and
                  that was, he was not actuated by his own dictates; but he did so that he might not
                  infringe a code of the Aleovan statute book; however, he reflected a good deal on
                  his rashness, for not first considering his daughter's welfare, in preference to
                  the obedience of an indifferent by-law, especially when he had all that the world
                  need tender him (in regard to wealth), for her future support and happiness. But
                  again, he would comfort himself, saying, "I know my daughter's noble propensities,
                  and that she is ever willing to pardon everything that I have done amiss, and I in
                  return, will give all the liberty she desires, to emancipate her from the
                  thralldom that had previously weighed down her youthful spirit, and it (her
                  spirit), may speed its airy flight to whatever world of pleasure and enjoyment it
                  may choose; for I am determined not to be held responsible again on earth."
               In a process of time, the old shepherd began to recover from his helpless
                  condition, so that he was able to get
                  about by the aid of crutches, from one room to another. His feeble limbs began to
                  gather strength day by day, by exercising them, until he was able to dispense with
                  the crutches and use a staff alone. He felt very thankful that his time on earth
                  had been extended, apparently, and that he might yet be enabled to witness the
                  consummation of the marriage ceremonies of his beloved daughter; for that alone
                  was what gave him so much anxiety of mind. The reflection was a happy one to him.
                  To see his daughter established in the world, fully relieved from the many
                  responsibilities that stood ready to crush her innocent spirit. While he remained
                  in that; pensive mood, Vestilia entered the room. He did not see her but twice
                  each day—night and morning, and the time intervening seemed to him to be unusually
                  long, but as long as the cares of the herds rested upon her shoulders, it could
                  not be otherwise.
               "O, father," said Vestilia, "I think you look a great deal better than you did a
                  day or two ago. I think that you will soon be as well as ever, if you continue to
                  improve."
               "Yes daughter, I think I do feel better every day, and hope to continue to do so.
                  Come daughter ter, bring your chair and sit by my side, and let us talk awhile. I
                  have just been thinking about you; wondering what you were doing that detained you
                  from coming into the room," responded her father affectionately.
               "O, I have been busy in the kitchen, helping mother. I have been hurrying to get
                  my work accomplished, so that I am afraid that she will say that I slighted a
                  portion of it; but I felt so anxious to know how you were getting along, that I
                  couldn't well help it," answered Vestilia. "Does it seem long since I left this
                  morning?" she inquired.
               "Yes, dear daughter, it does; a very short period seems long to me now-a-days,
                  especially when you are absent. But daughter," continued Pastores, "I have
                  something to communicate to you which hangs very heavily upon my mind, and that
                  is, how badly I have treated you, by putting you to many sad inconveniences, which
                  might have been avoided; but I sincerely hope that you will pardon all my
                  short-comings," said Pastores with a sorrowful look.
               "O yes, father," said Vestilia (putting her arms around his aged neck and kissing
                  him), "but I have nothing to forgive,
                  because I certainly am the aggressor."
               "No, daughter, you can not be the aggressor in what I am alluding to. I have
                  hindered you from marrying one whom you greatly loved, and also hindered you from
                  living in all the enjoyment and pleasure that the matrimonial connexion could
                  afford. But dear Vestilia, will it atone for past offences, if I give you perfect
                  liberty to marry Solum?" inquired Pastores, anxiously.
               "O yes father, and more too," responded Vestilia, with an expression of delight.
                  "Are you really in earnest?" continued she, as if half inclined to doubt her
                  father's word.
               "Yes, daughter, I am in earnest. You have the privilege of marrying him (Solum),
                  as soon as you desire—the sooner, perhaps, the better, for then you will be
                  delivered from so many responsibilities and labor that would finally bring you to
                  a premature grave. But Vestilia, how are you going to let him know our
                  conclusions? We can not spare you long enough to visit him, nor would it be
                  advisable for you to undertake such a dangerous trip, if we could spare you.
                  Jathello would not go, I presume, for he can not feel any too friendly towards you
                  or any of the family," remarked Pastores.
               "O yes, father, Jathello would go if I was to ask him, but I don't think that
                  there will be any necessity for sending him word, for he told me that he would
                  visit me again in a month or so, which will be time enough, won't it?" inquired
                  Vestilia.
               "Yes daughter, but I feel rather doubtful about his returning so soon as
                  that."
               "Why do you doubt, father?" inquired Vestilia.
               "Because he was so inhumanly treated the time he was here. He has sufficient
                  reasons if he never returns, unless he values your company better than I am aware
                  of," replied Pastores.
               "Well, that might be father. He told me positively, that he would return in the
                  time I told you of, to know whether you and mother opposed him as bitterly as
                  ever."
               "But how did you know that we objected to him at that time," inquired
                  Pastores.
               "Why, I heard you and mother say that you would not employ him as a herdsman, for
                  fear of his intimacy with me, for he was too poor, &c.," replied Vestilia,
                  rather tartly.
               
               "I would like to know when and where you got all that news. I am sure that Tuelia,
                  nor I, did not tell you. There is a mystery about it somewhere," said Pastores,
                  looking rather ashamed that he had been so found out.
               "I will tell you father, where I got all my information. It was in my bed-room,
                  the night that Solum remained with us. I presume that you thought that I was fast
                  asleep, but it was only pretention; but I feel rather sorry that I thus deceived
                  you," said Vestilia.
               "Well, I wasn't aware that you was so well informed; however, let that subject
                  pass. But what I wish to know is this, How did it happen that Solum promised to
                  come back and visit you? You certainly must have reciprocated his love," inquired
                  Pastores.
               "Yes father, I confess I did; but the reason why I did not communicate the fact to
                  you and mother, was, I knew that you were not friendly to the association—that you
                  were opposed to my intimacy with the stranger, therefore I resolved to keep the
                  whole a secret until a more favorable opportunity," answered Vestilia.
               "I rejoice, dear daughter, in your candid disposition sition, and I am very sorry
                  that you have been put to so much inconvenience. Will you pardon me this time, if
                  the question which I am about to ask, is an improper one. Are you and Solum
                  engaged—have you promised to cherish each other's friendships and love, through
                  life—promised to remain true to each other, until the storm of opposition shall
                  have lulled? But I am happy to announce that the aforesaid storm has already
                  subsided. If you have pledged to do so and so, I pray you, let me know the fact,
                  that is all I ask?"
               "Dear, indulgent father, your interrogations are answered in the affirmative. We
                  leave not only promised to cherish each other's love and affection, through the
                  storm of opposition, but through the tempestuous storm that rises on the surface
                  of the mighty sea of life. I made the rash avowal to him, for I felt confident,
                  that I could never meet with another, in whom I could place my whole dependence. I
                  thought I might as well pledge myself to be his as not, for it would make no
                  difference to me in regard to my promise, whether I married him or not, because
                     I was fully determined to love no
                  one else, as long as I lived," responded Vestilia.
               "Vestilia, I am perfectly satisfied with your contract—I now sanction your whole
                  proceedings from beginning to end. You was perfectly right in so doing while I was
                  in error, but I sincerely hope that, that error is atoned for. I also hope that
                  you may succeed in getting him, on whom you have set your love and affection,
                  succeed not only in getting him, but all the felicity and pleasure that is due
                  humanity on earth," responded Pastores, in an affectionate strain.
               "I thank you father, for your kind wishes, and hope when Solum returns, that he
                  will have the requisite means to deliver our matrimonial connection beyond
                  disapprobation, so that when you come to die, you will have no ill
                  reflections—feeling that you can leave the world without a regret, that you had
                  ever been one of its inhabitants, simply because your offspring did not remain
                  pure and unsophisticated, but became tainted or vitiated by acts of immorality,"
                  replied Vestilia. While Vestilia was speaking Tuelia, her mother, entered the
                  room.
               "Tuelia," said Pastores, "I am glad that you have finished your work, so that you
                  can sit down by me and converse awhile, for I have something of importance to say
                  to you."
               While Pastores was thus speaking, Vestilia, the daughter, took the hint and left
                  the room, knowing that her presence would be more acceptable at another time.
               "Well, what is that, husband, which you wish to tell me?" asked Tuelia.
               "It is this; Vestilia and I have been talking about matters, when she plainly
                  asked me why I was so rigidly opposed to Solum? The question made me feel somewhat
                  ashamed; I told her that I would not oppose her designs or intentions again; when
                  she heard me say that, she felt somewhat encouraged, and consequently, she frankly
                  told me her whole secret. She said that she was positively engaged to him, and
                  would leave told us long ere this, but she knew that we were not friendly to the
                  relationship," replied Pastores.
               "Is that possible? Vestilia engaged to Solum? Who would have thought of that being
                  the case," responded Tuelia, with surprise.
               "That is even so, Tuelia; but there is another thing I wish to tell you, perhaps you never thought
                  of, and that is this, You was not aware that Vestilia told Solum how we were
                  opposed to him, and what our reasons were for so doing," remarked Pastores.
               "How could she tell Solum what she did not know herself? I am positively sure that
                  I never mentioned the subject to her."
               "That don't make any difference whatever, whether you told her or not, she knew
                  all about the whole proceeding," replied Pastores confidently.
               "Tell me how she came to hear the news, if you please, for I feel anxious to
                  know," asked Tuelia in an excited tone.
               "Well! she said that she overheard us talk the night that Solum lodged with us;
                  you remember the door stood ajar."
               "There now, Pastores," replied Tuelia, with a tone that indicated that she thought
                  that no blame was on her, "I said to you that night, that Vestilia might be
                  listening, but you said "O no, there was no danger," but now you see the
                  result."
               "Well, I acknowledge, her feigned snoring deceived me very much; but still I don't
                  realize any harm whatever," replied Pastores, endeavoring to excuse himself.
               "Why don't you expect that harm will accrue from it? He never will come back
                  again, after being so mal-treated; if he does, I am very much mistaken," replied
                  Tuelia, with a peculiar turn of her head, as much as to say, "you'll find your
                  mistake by and by—never mind."
               "Because Vestilia told me that he positively declared that he would return again
                  in a month or so, if health permitted," answered Pastores earnestly.
               "Well, I am glad that he does not intend to pay attention to what we said, for I
                  should feel very badly if I thought he did."
               "Wife, are you agreed to give Vestilia liberty to marry the Aleovan hermit, or
                  what?"
               "To be candid, Pastores, I always felt partial towards Solum since I first saw
                  him, and would have been willing for him to pay his addresses to Vestilia, but
                  knowing that he was poor, and how you felt towards infringing one of the codes, I
                  thought it best to coincide with you, knowing that it would not be right for me to
                  oppose your desires. I felt no conscienciousness in regard to violating the by-law, but I thought that I would
                  deliver myself from responsibilities, by leaving the matter to you entirely,"
                  responded Tuelia.
               "Well, now wife, you need not have been so mighty particular. If you had but
                  advised me a little on the subject, it might have obviated a good deal of sad
                  inconvenience, both on my part and Vestilia's," replied Pastores, with a feeling
                  of regret.
               "Well, I know that to be a fact, but as I told you before, I was fearful of
                  responsibilities. I have chosen you to be my adviser, considering your judgment
                  paramount to mine, especially in such matters. But you are not entirely culpable
                  under the existing circumstances, because you were actuated by a motive, and that
                  motive was, that you did not wish to be guilty of violating a by-law that you
                  always held sacred, from your youth up; but I should have reasoned in this wise,
                  you and I are getting old and decrepit, and Vestilia is not yet married, and even
                  without any prospects of being so—Solum is poor and indigent yet he is handsome,
                  and what is better, intelligent, amiable and industrious—you are rich beyond all
                  calculation, therefore if the horde would not recognize you on account of your
                  daughter marrying Solum, why, you need not care; you are not dependent on them for
                  a single article, and I am inclined to think, that in a few consecutive years,
                  their hatred or dissatisfaction would be all worn away. I would feel perfectly
                  willing to have Vestilia marry Solum to-morrow, regardless of the consequences;
                  but oh dear! what if he does not return."
               "Well, if he does not return, we can not help the matter; but I feel quite
                  sanguine that he will return, from Vestilia's story. She expects him shortly,"
                  Pastores replied.
               "Pastores, there is one thing certain, that we can not have if Solum marries
                  Vestilia, and that is a festival or nuptial banquet, because the whole clan would
                  be so enraged at our proceedings that they would consider it beneath their dignity
                  to notice our invitations," said Tuelia thoughtfully.
               It was customary among the Aleovan shepherds to hold a two or three days'
                  festival, when one of their number became married. Previous to the consummation of
                  the marriage ceremonies, a post was summoned to carry invitations to each member
                  of the society. The post was authorized to read a paper to each invited guest, naming the
                  persons to be united in matrimony—describing their character—giving a history of
                  their lineage—stating the amount of wealth each possessed or was heir to, so that
                  the invited guest could form an idea of the gentleman about to be initiated into
                  their society, previous to their attendance upon the nuptial banquet, and not be
                  subjected to a disgrace, by learning that one of the hymenial devotees was in
                  indigent circumstances, after having arrived at the castle where the ceremonies
                  were to be performed.
               Vestilia did not expect that her parents would discommode themselves for her
                  special benefit. Little did she think that their invective language would be
                  converted into the most cordial approbation. O, how happy she did feel when she
                  came to learn the fact. She could scarcely contain her emotions, being so elated.
                  She began to get very impatient for the return of her beloved Solum. She longed to
                  communicate to him the gladsome news of her triumph, or her parents'
                  reconciliation to their (Solum and Vestilia), matrimonial union. Days seemed like
                  months to her, so slowly did time appear to roll away. She felt like penetrating
                  ting the dark and dismal forest of Aleova, that she might find him; but she well
                  knew that she could not leave her aged parents, and the flocks that were under her
                  special care.
               When evening came, Vestilia took her accustomed seat by the fire. She did not sit
                  there to enjoy the congenial effects of the heat, for the weather was too mild at
                  that season of the year, but because she loved to watch the burning embers on the
                  grate, as they glowed, faded, and dropped below. She often imagined that she could
                  see fairy-like phantoms, that resembled her absent lover, dancing amongst the
                  glowing embers so vividly, as to almost tempt her to clasp the life-like figures
                  for the reality. She thought as she continued to feast upon those imaginary—those
                  spectral representations, that some thing more real would shortly be enjoyed. She
                  thought of the advent of "Hope," that beautiful and soul-enlivening poem, which
                  reads as follows: 
                     
                        "Once on a time, from scenes of light,
                        An angel winged his airy flight;
                        Down to this earth, in haste he came,
                        And wrote, in lines of living flame,
                        These words on every thing he met,—
                        Cheer up, be not discouraged yet!
                     
                     
                     
                        Then back to heaven, with speed he flew,
                        Attuned his golden harp anew;
                        Whilst the angelic throng came round
                        To catch the soul-inspiring sound:
                        And heaven was filled with new delight,
                        For HOPE had been to earth that night."
                     
                  
               
               How appropriate Vestilia thought those stanzas were to her situation. She felt
                  that she realized each and every line; more particularly the last one of each
                  stanza. She felt that the fairy-like messenger of Hope had visited her with his
                  soul-inspiring news, and had driven away all the discouraged feelings that
                  formerly dwelt in her bosom. O hope! sweet hope! what would poor dejected
                  mortality do without thy soul-enlivening influence—thy cheerful company? Ah! the
                  feeble spark of human life would soon be extinguished, in the midst of its
                  anticipations of much pleasure and worldly enjoyment.
               By-and-by Vestilia became weary of her meditations. Sullen sleep began to creep
                  over her weary system, and would soon have made her its victim, had riot her
                  mother come into the kitchen at that moment and awoke her, telling her that it was
                  late, and time to retire for the night, which she did, immediately.
               We have just now passed that portion of the narrative describing what tradition
                  terms "the shepherd girl's triumph." But Solum had not returned according to
                  promise, to lay claims to his precious jewel; and consequently, Pastores and wife
                  began to apprehend danger in regard to his return; but Vestilia remained sanguine
                  that she would not be disappointed.
               Whether Solum returned to the bosom of Pastores' family, I am unable to tell—no
                  knowledge of the fact has been communicated or conveyed to me as yet; but reader,
                  imagine Vestilia's predicament in case the hermit failed to make his appearance at
                  the expiration of the time specified. Take your pallet and brush and portray her
                  living expression. Would it exhibit that cheerful and soul-lit countenance,
                  whereon sat hope, enthroned in all its regal attire? No! an expression of sorrow
                  and disappointment would display itself, forming such a distressed outline, as to
                  make the beholder think that the original stood trembling on the brink of despair
                  when the sad portrait was delineated.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               SOLUM'S 
                     SUCCESSFULL
                     SUCCESSFUL
                   VISIT TO OLEVA.—HIS RETURN TO THE HERMITAGE.
               After the before mentioned shower had passed over, Solum set out on his journey to
                  Oleva. The day was unusually fine, the sun shining forth with unbeclouded
                  brilliancy, which is usually the case subsequent to a shower; the smoky
                  atmosphere, being washed or relieved of its murky intrude, and trodden to the
                  earth, by the heavy footsteps of the falling rain, leaving a pure, unsophisticated
                  medium, through which the effulgent rays of the sun might display their beauty to
                  perfection. The trees were clad in the richest verdure—their foliage appeared so
                  dark and dense, that they made the surrounding forest exhibit rather a gloomy
                  aspect—the spreading of the densely matted boughs, seemed to exclude the
                  permeating rays of the sun, rendering Solum's pathway somewhat dismal, but what
                  added most to the dismal scene in question, the wild-beasts, which ever and anon,
                  could be seen skulking in the prospective—a wolf, panther, or some other no milder
                  looking animal; or perhaps the wild shriek of the roving catamount, might greet
                  his cars, as it gazed upon him, from the topmost branch of a gigantic oak. These
                  with a thousand other imaginary objects, beset Solum's gloomy pathway over the
                  lofty mountains of Aleova. Perhaps some of my readers can not realize the sense of
                  the expression relating to imaginary objects, and are ready to ask "what terror is
                  there connected with imaginary objects in the day-time?" What I meant by that
                  expression, is this; Oftentimes, when a traveler is winding his way through a
                  dense and sable forest, imagination puts him to much inconvenience. He sees in the
                  prospective, a dark and hideous looking object, which his affrighted imagination
                  tells him is a huge bear, and he is ready to flee from it, thinking that his life
                  stands in imminent danger—in jeopardy; but as his courage drives him nearer the
                  fearful object, it loses its life-like appearance, and finally is metamorphosed phosed into a decayed stump of a tree,
                  rendered black and hideous by the fire which annually sweeps over those mountains.
                  Again, he sees a monstrous boa, wound about a lofty tree, in the distance, an
                  animal, above all others, to be most dreaded, on account of its powerful strength;
                  but as he approaches his snakeship, it loses its frightful aspect, having
                  under-gone a series of metamorphosis, at last assumes the inoffensive form of a
                  grape-vine. The above will be sufficient to convey my ideas, in reference to
                  imaginary objects, without any further consideration, I presume, at least it is
                  all that I can devote to that subject at present.
               Solum found his journey rather a disagreeable one, in the early part of the day,
                  on account of the wet condition of the underbrush—each leaf was pendent from the
                  weight of the crystal rain-drops that hung thereon, and there had no breeze
                  stirred through the forest as yet, to shake off those diamond-like appendages, but
                  our hermit kept on, heedless of every object that tended to delay his
                  steps—trudging along over difficult ways; such as through bramble bushes, over
                  strata of shaggy rocks and scaling precipices whose frightful declivities allures
                  no traveler to tread its dangerous paths; but by and by he comes to a huge pile of
                  stones, rather more neatly arranged, than those left to careless chance. Those
                  heaped stones reminded him of the Stonehenge, which is said to be
                  the remains of an antique Druidical temple. This colossal statue stood on the
                  banks of a babbling brook, but Solum could not cipher out what could be the origin
                  or design of its erection. Solum sat down on the bank of the brook, to take some
                  refreshments, when the whole mystery was divulged. The pile of huge stones under
                  consideration, was nothing but the tomb of his venerable father, which his own
                  ingenious hands had constructed. My reader remembers of reading in a former
                  chapter, the death of Solum's father, which took place on Mount Aleova's rugged
                  heights, and it was his remains that lay mouldering amid the heap of stones in
                  question. Solum placed his father's lifeless corpse there, having no implements
                  whereby he might dig a grave, and also knowing that the plan resorted to, would
                  render his body more obscure from the curiosity of the meddlesome wild beasts.
               Little did Solum think when he sat down on the mossy bank of the brook, that the
                  pile of stones in front of him, was
                  none other than the monument that stood astride the remains of his departed
                  parent; but when convinced of the fact, sorrow filled his heart; his keen appetite
                  left him, so that he was obliged to pursue his journey with but a mouthful of
                  nourishment. The scene just past harrowed up his memory, bringing to his mind past
                  sorrows, apparently as bitter as when they originally occurred, together with all
                  the difficulties that had beset his youthful pathway—a reminiscence not at all
                  desirable to Solum; so onward he hastens, to leave the dire tableau far in the
                  back-ground. He agrees with the poet, by wishing not to pry into corruption which
                  doeth its work in the grave: 
                     
                        "Hide it up, hide it up, draw the decent curtain:
                        Hence I curious fool, and pry not on corruption:
                        For the fearful mysteries of change are being there enacted,
                        And many actors play their part on that small part, the tomb:
                        Leave the clay, that leprous thing, touch not the fleshy garment:
                        Dust to dust it mingleth well among the sacred soil."
                     
                  
               
               Solum endeavored to drive all those past recollections from his mind, excepting
                  the predictions that were uttered by the trembling lips of his dying father. lie
                  thought how soon he might realize those dying blessings; but while he was thus
                  musing, he came to a natural opening in the woodland, where the massive rocks lay
                  more plentifully, and gigantic trees grew sparsely. From that natural opening,
                  Solum could see the dilapidated remains of Oleva, the home of his childhood. Down
                  below he could see that beautiful lake, where he spent so many happy hours,
                  decoying the unwary "trout." Its beautiful waters spread themselves out like a
                  mighty mirror, reflecting the brilliant rays of the sun with such splendor as to
                  appear like a vast sea of glittering gold. There he could see the mighty forest,
                  spreading out for miles in the distance, through which he used to gambol with
                  unequaled pleasure—where he used to pluck the tiny flowers, whose odors had long
                  scented the surrounding wildwood—where he used to gather the wild berries that
                  grew spontaneously—where he used to hunt the grouse, to supply his mother's
                  tea-table, for that was her favorite fowl, especially, of those undomesticated.
                  But ah! thought he, those happy days are gone. The happiness they afforded can
                  never be again realized on this side the endless ocean of eternity.
               Solum reached Oleva as the brilliant glare of the radiant sun began to wane—just in time to
                  secure a place of lodging for the night. It was too late to search the many
                  dilapidated premises for booty, especially when there was nothing to urge him to
                  secure what was to be had—no rival to apprehend that would rob him, to share in
                  the plunder. In the morning, Solum commenced his tour among the ruined cottages;
                  but oh! what a horrible spectacle presented itself to his view. In every cottage
                  he found skeletons of those who fell a victim to the destructive pestilence; but
                  in many of the houses the wild beasts had effected an entrance, and torn the
                  bodies apart, scattering the bones in all directions. Solum set his determination
                  against a thought of the horrible picture in question, and went about his labor,
                  seemingly unconscious of the frightful tableau spread around him.
               Now was the dream which Solum had fully realized—now was the fulfillment of his
                  father's dying prophesy—now did he feel assured that the barrier which stood
                  betwixt his lady-love and himself would be removed—in a word, he now seemed to
                  realize all that his anxious heart had ever anticipated.
               After he had collected all the silver and gold that he could find in the
                  dilapidated premises, he started for the hermitage with a light and merry heart,
                  feeling with full assurance, that joy and happiness would soon be duly
                  experienced, a boon which he had long been deprived of.
               I believe that I did previously intimate that the forest and mountain of Aleova,
                  teemed with wild and savage animals. Some of them when hungry would attack
                  humanity with undaunted courage, as I shall presently relate. Just as Solum had
                  reached the summit of the mountain, on his return home, he heard a pack of wolves
                  howling, as if on the scent of his track or provision. Solum began to be fearful
                  for his life. He did not know what stratagem to resort to that he might elude
                  their keen search. At last, while they were some ways off, he thought of putting
                  his bag of provisions out of their way, and then ascend a tree, and selecting a
                  seat where he might give each one the headache, as they desired. When he had got
                  nicely deposited in the fork of a tree, far out of the reach of their merciless
                  jaws, the hungry pack came along panting and blowing like a tornado, with their
                  slender tongues reeking in saliva, indicating the ardor of their pursuit. They soon scented Solum and
                  his bag of provisions, when they came to a dead stand, looking up with a
                  wishfulness known only to the hungry and starving. The pack of wolves looked
                  rather wishful, but that did not seem to satisfy craving appetites, and presently
                  they set about knawing the tree above the root, with eagerness so that a person
                  would think that they intended to prostrate it in less than no time, if I may use
                  the expression. Solum watched their game for a moment, when he thought that it was
                  his time to play. He leveled his rifle at one old gentleman-wolf, who seemed to be
                  taking a wishful survey of his (Solum's) person. Thinking that he had looked long
                  enough to have his curiosity gratified, he fired, which dropped his wolfship
                  pretty quick, where he didn't feel any inclination to leave immediately. The rest
                  of the wolves became alarmed at the fate of one of their number, and put off to
                  their retreat, with a speed considerably accelerated from the one they assumed
                  when they left, so Solum descended the tree in better spirits than when he
                  ascended it, in consequence of his success.
               When the wolves had scampered to parts unknown known, Solum shouldered his
                  knapsack and resumed his journey, rejoicing in his miraculous escape. He thought
                  that if he could always succeed in eluding the harbinger, or danger itself in the
                  manner just illustrated, he could have but little reason to become dissatisfied
                  with modus operandi of the world. It is a
                  natural propensity of humanity to dread trials and difficulties—to abhor danger in
                  all its numerous. types. Look into the penetralia of this world's history, and see how many on record, have
                  become the victims of that appalling enemy. Oftentime that formidable monster
                  could be made to quit the field of contest, as a vanquished foe, if its combatant
                  would always possess the requisite weapon, courage. Many persons beset with
                  imminent danger, suffer themselves to be overcome with a panic, an effeminate
                  sensation or terror, being the result of a misapprehension of the danger in
                  question, rendering its victims helpless and inadequate to compete with their
                  foes, paralyzing as it were their every effort. There are exigencies into which
                  mankind are sometimes placed, when it would be vain for them to attempt to elude
                  or otherwise escape the dangerous adversary, short of an energetic getic display of courage, or prowess; by such a
                  noble exertion—by such a courageous attack they may become conquerors, whilst the
                  panic-struck combatant, becomes an easy victim of the fearful enemy.
               Solum at last reached the hermitage, without having to encounter any further
                  difficulty. He was very much exhausted, by the fatigue and excitement of the
                  journey. Besides the difficulties of the way, he had to carry rather a heavy
                  burden, such as a gun and a knapsack laden with provisions, and a great sum of
                  gold and silver, which he brought from Oleva.
               No part of tradition has informed me, what was the precise value of the gold and
                  silver Solum procured in the ruins of Oleva, but we are at liberty to conjecture
                  that it was no small sum, so that he was, beyond a doubt richer than any one of
                  the clan of Aleovan shepherds.
               As a natural consequence, Solum felt extremely anxious to complete what he
                  anticipated or calculated to be his last pilgrimage of necessity through the
                  sombre wildwood of Aleova. A hermit's life had become a drudge to him. The taste
                  of a more civilized life, which he had received while at Castle Pastores, rendered
                  him unfit to finish his earthly career in a hermitage. The love which he had long
                  cherished for solitude—for his lonely hermitage, was now converted into the most
                  intense hatred or dislike, therefore he resolved to relinquish the title of a
                  hermit, and become a member of more civilized society.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               SOLUM'S RETURN TO THE OLD SHEPHERD—HIS RECEPTION AND
                  MARRIAGE.
               On the morning of the second day, after Solum's visit to Oleva, he made up his
                  mind to start for Castle Pastores, where he anticipated he would find his
                  lady-love, Vestilia, in the midst of health and other enjoyments, and also to meet
                  a warm reception from the whole family.
               There was no doubt existing but what Solum would meet with a cordial reception at
                  the house of the old shepherd; for every obstacle that obstructed his way, was
                  happily and successfully removed. On the one hand, Vestilia had succeeded in
                  triumphing over the whimsical by-law which had long held her parents bound in
                  chains of superstition and ignorance, and thereby effecting a complete
                  reconciliation of their intentions to her most earnest anticipations or desires;
                  while on the other hand, Solum had accomplished no less achievements. He had
                  succeeded in procuring the necessary preliminaries, which were absolutely
                  requisite, ere he could become a welcome participant in all the rights and
                  immunities of the society of Aleovan shepherds, which he anticipated to become a
                  member; therefore he was destined to meet a reception of two-fold goodness.
               Solum had risen much earlier than usual on the morning he expected to bid adieu to
                  the hermitage, that he might more successfully enjoy his farewell morning walk.
                  When he had strolled some ways into the gloomy forest, he took a seat on a
                  moss-clad trunk of a prostrate spruce tree, there to ruminate on what had been the
                  character of the transaction of the past, and what aspect or representation they
                  would assume, as they came up consecutively from the obscure morass of futurity,
                  when his thoughts at last broke forth in the following melancholy soliloquy:
                  "Farewell mountain robin, thou herald of the early morning, and to thy loud
                  enchanting songs. I shall no more welcome thy "fairy-like music" as it comes from
                  the sable forest of Aleova. Thy cheerful lays will have to swell in the forest, wild and free; but
                  never to greet my ears again; therefore, noble songster, I repeat adieu. Farewell
                  to thee, chick-a-dee-dee, I shall no more listen to thy tiny voice—thy merry
                  chirping—no more be cheered in my wild hunts by thy sweet chick-a-dee-dee—no more
                  witness thee perch on the slender boughs of the pine and hemlock; making the
                  forest alive by thy tiny company; so fare-thee-well tiny warbler. Now, to the
                  cock-of-the-wood my soliloquy speaks. I shall no more listen to thy loud and
                  clanking voice as it rings through the forest, nor to the many echoes that are
                  awakened by thy repeated thumps on the beetling decay of the forest trees; so
                  farewell giant wood-pecker, farewell. Blue-jay (corvus cristatus), I must not
                  forget thee, thou bird of brilliant crest. I must bid farewell to thy wild shrieks
                  as they echo through the Aleovan foreSt-no more shall I be deluded by thy many
                  cant phrases, imitating the catamount's wild voice; therefore bird of gaudy
                  plumage, fare-thee-well. Now, finally, I turn my attention to the lonely owl as he
                  sits in a drowsy mood in the hollow trunk of an old oak. Thou herald of the
                  midnight hours, I bid farewell to thy doleful hooting, and thy loud and hideous
                  cater-waul, so nocturnal philosopher of the wood, I feel most willing to bid thee
                  my final adieu. And now my dear old "hermitage," I must return to thee once more
                  ere I leave thee forever. I have bade adieu to all my feathered companions, and
                  lastly, I must turn my thoughts to thee and the surrounding groves. Yes, I bid you
                  all adieu—mountains, hills, valleys, woodland, brook, and their sweet companions,
                  the flowers. But lonely cottage, 'tis hard to bid thee and my lovely flower
                  garden, farewell; for in many lonely hours, thou didst cheer and comfort me. Ah!
                  'tis too true, "farewell is a hard word to say;" says the poet: 
                     
                        "We do not know how much we love,
                        Until we come to leave,
                        An aged tree, a common flower
                        Are things o'er which we grieve.
                        There is a pleasure in the pain
                        That brings us back the past again.
                     
                     
                        We linger, while we turn away,
                        We cling while we depart,
                        And memories; unmarked till then,
                        Come crowding on the heart.
                        Let what will lure our onward way,
                        Farewell's a bitter word to say."
                     
                  
               
               Thus Solum finished his soliloquy, and then shouldered his knapsack, with his rifle, and
                  started for his anticipated home—tearing himself away from all that he formerly
                  held near and dear. He would not so much as look back upon the scene that was
                  disappearing in his rear; for fear their allurements might implore him to
                  return—but on he kept, in a Lot-like attitude, until the inducements in
                  consideration, remained far in the background, when his struggles at heart
                  terminated.
               Solum hurried through the forest, on this occasion, with a more accelerated
                  locomotion, than on any previous one. He did not so much as spare time to eat a
                  hasty meal, but kept pushing on till he came to the edge of the Aleovan forest,
                  where he expected to meet his much beloved Vestilia. When he had quit the sable
                  forest, he stopped to look for her, but she was nowhere to be seen. He listened,
                  perchance he might hear the mellow tones of her guitar, as its cadence swelled in
                  the breeze, but all was a profound silence, not even the tinkling of a bell, that
                  bespeaks the whereabouts of the grazing herds, broke the stillness. Nothing could
                  be seen over the verdant fields, but the slender grasses, which waved with beauty
                  in the stiff breeze that swept from the north. Each impulse of the breeze would
                  create a series of waves, or billows, making the scene resemble a vast verdant
                  sea. "Yes a verdant sea," thought Solum, but no mermaid Vestilia, glided thereon,
                  which was the object of his search. He looked to the gloomy shadow of that
                  memorable spruce tree, but he was sorry to learn that it had no visitor: She had
                  taken her flocks to the eastern part of her father's pasture lands, which was a
                  great way off, from where Solum stood, but however he did not intend to remain
                  there long, but resolved to go to Castle Pastores, where he was sure to learn her
                  whereabouts. When he came to the castle, he entered the kitchen where he found the
                  old shepherd and wife alone. They were exceedingly glad that he had returned,
                  especially at the time when they had given up all hope. They welcomed him with all
                  the cordiality and friendship due to a returned kindred. Such a kind reception
                  Solum little anticipated, knowing the extreme coolness he was treated with, on a
                  previous occasion.
               "I am exceedingly glad that you have returned," said Pastores, with a happy
                  air.
               
               "Thank you, Pastores," said Solum. "How have you all been since I left?"
               "All quite well, excepting husband. He has had a very bad spell since you left,"
                  answered Tuelia.
               "I am sorry to hear that, but he has quite recovered has he not?" inquired
                  Solum.
               "I have quite recovered," responded Pastores.
               While Pastores was speaking, Tuelia left the room and went into the kitchen to get
                  her bonnet. She was so rejoiced that Solum had returned that she could not wait
                  until Vestilia came in from the fields, but started out to meet her, that she
                  might early proclaim the gladsome news to her daughter. When Vestilia saw her old
                  mother struggling and toiling across the fields towards her, she became alarmed,
                  thinking that some desperadoes had entered the castle to plunder, but when she
                  came near enough to discern her countenance, she saw a smile, and in a moment she
                  thought that Solum had returned—she uttered:
               "What is the news, mother? Tell me quick. Is it good or bad?"
               "Good news—Solum has come," said her mother, panting for breath.
               Vestilia was so overjoyed to hear the news, that she flew to her mother and kissed
                  her as if she had not seen her for a score. They both hastened home, leaving the
                  flocks to their own discretion; and when they entered the castle, they found Solum
                  in a sober conversation with Pastores. Vestilia was overjoyed when she witnessed
                  the face of her returned lover. She flew to his embrace, saying:
               "Dearest Solum, how happy I feel that you have returned in safety; but I am
                  happier to tell you that you shall never from us wander again."
               But before Solum had time to answer Vestilia, Pastores said:
               "He shall never leave this castle to stay, while I live."
               "No indeed," said Tuelia, "I will never be reconciled to have him return to the
                  hermitage again."
               "I am very thankful to you all," said Solum, "and I consider myself resting under
                  many obligations for the kindness and cordiality with which you have received me.
                  Pardon me, if the question I am about to ask is amiss. Is your former dislike to
                  me still existing in the slightest degree? If it is, I would like to know, for if it does, I
                  can not be the welcome stranger that I appear to you to be."
               "Respected stranger," said Pastores, "I have the pleasure to say to you that the
                  storm of opposition which formerly beat against your desires, has lulled. We
                  considered our daughter's welfare, and in doing so, we came to the righteous
                  conclusion, to disregard the by-law which predicted your banishment, and as a
                  token of the veracity of what I have been telling you, I tender you the right hand
                  of fellowship, and at the same time cordially welcome you to this my home, as long
                  as I live, when time will complete the tale untold."
               "My tongue is too inadequate to express the emotions of my inmost heart. I hope I
                  shall live to pay, if but a mere moiety, of the debt I owe to you all for your
                  exemplary kindness. I have one thing yet to state to you all, not knowing how you
                  will receive it, but I presume with approbation, or else I should prefer to keep
                  the item a secret. What I mean to say is this: I am now justly prepared to
                  receive—to accept your noble daughter Vestilia (pointing to her), from your
                  generous hands, and that without leaving a disgrace remaining, that you had a
                  "poor son-in-law." None of your noble clan can ever reproach you again, saying,
                  "you old fool, what did you let that 'Aleovan beggar-boy' marry your daughter
                  for?" No, they can not. To tell the truth, I look more like a beggar than any
                  person more respectable, but the circumstances under which I lived, is the author
                  of my indifferent appearance, but that shall be speedily remedied. You all think
                  that I am in indigent circumstances, but you are all happily mistaken. 'Tis true,
                  I do not possess extensive pasture land, with numerous flocks grazing thereon, for
                  I never led a nomadic life, like to my esteemed friend, Pastores; but here is my
                  wealth (at the same time emptying a bag of gold and silver on the table). Yes,
                  wealth enough to far surpass any single member of your horde," replied Solum in an
                  eloquent tone.
               When they saw the pile of money on the table, they looked at each other with a
                  satisfied astonishment.
               "We are all exceedingly glad to witness the testimony you now exhibit before us,
                  of your affluent circumstances, not from a mere love of wealth; but many of the clan have busied themselves
                  in matters belonging to myself and family, and ever and anon, they twit some one
                  of the family of "poor Solum;" therefore I am glad on that account, that you are
                  able to throw them all into the shade, if I may use the expression; I mean in a
                  pecuniary point of view," replied Pastores, in an elevated tone.
               "Well I am exceedingly glad on that account, that I possess so much wealth, for it
                  is certainly unpleasant to submit to the gibes or sneers of silly busy-bodies,"
                  responded Solum.
               "How came you in possession of so much wealth since you left here, if I may be so
                  inquisitive?" inquired Tuelia. 
               "You remember that I originally came from Oleva, a little town southwest of Mount
                  Aleova. I fled from that town in consequence of a mighty pestilence which broke
                  out among us. The said pestilence victimized all the inhabitants excepting myself,
                  consequently there was no one to lay claims to the wealth they left behind, but
                  myself. But of that wealth, I never cherished a thought, because I knew it was of
                  no importance to me in my solitary life. But since you expelled me from under your
                  roof on account of my indigence, I have tried to devise plans whereby I might
                  become wealthy, but could not succeed, until I dreamed in two consecutive nights
                  of visiting my native town Oleva, and there finding great quantities of silver and
                  gold. It seemed to me more like a vision than a dream. When I attempted to attend
                  to my secular affairs, I was constantly haunted by the piles of silver and gold I
                  saw in my vision, until finally, I concluded to go to Oleva, to ascertain the
                  veracity of my dream, which I did, in the shape of this pile of money," answered
                  Solum, jingling the coin at the same time.
               "You were certainly a very lucky young man, Solum," remarked Tuelia.
               "Vestilia, who did you leave with the flocks?" inquired Pastores abruptly.
               "No one, father, but I am now going to return," replied Vestilia, cheerfully.
               "I shall be happy to accompany you," said Solum.
               "I thank you Solum—come along. I shall be happy to have you. I hope I shall have
                  you to accompany me every day. I feel happy to know that there is nothing to expel you from my sight
                  again," responded Vestilia.
               "I hope so too," said Solum.
               "Dear Solum, have I told you how my parents became reconciled to let me marry
                  you?"
               "No Vestilia, you have not, but I should like to know."
               "Well, since you left, father took sick, and he feared that his sickness was unto
                  death. He sent for me to come into the room, saying he wished to converse with me.
                  He told me he thought that he was going to die, which made him feel badly, not
                  that he feared death, but that I was not prepared to be left alone. He asked my
                  pardon for past ill-treatment, and told me that I could marry, you as soon as I
                  desired, for he was perfectly willing. At that moment mother entered the room.
                  They both agreed to the same, so that put an end to the whole difficulty."
               Thus Solum and Vestilia conversed in the field till, evening, when they returned
                  to the castle with the folks.
               My diligent reader, it is entirely useless for me to continue my narrative any
                  longer. It matters not how interesting it may be to you, for I presume sume the
                  sequel has been anticipated long ere this; so when that is the case, you might as
                  well say "the story is completed." It will be sufficient for me to state in a
                  concise manner, that Solum and Vestilia, were united in the holy bands of
                  matrimony, about a month after the former's arrival. At the consummation of the
                  nuptials, they held a large festival, after the manner of the Aleovans, and
                  invited the whole clan to the banquet. There seemed to be a universal rejoicing
                  among the Aleovan shepherds on account of the success of Vestilia. The whole clan
                  seemed happy to have Solum initiated into their society, for he was a man all
                  would naturally like, having prepossessing ways and a look not inferior. He was
                  what the feminines would term "good looking, handsome &c.," a face not
                  possessed by every one of the human family.
               Solum was not proud and arrogant, but ever stood ready to administer to suffering
                  humanity. Solum and Vestilia lived happy together, each striving to make each
                  other's journey through life smooth and pleasant—never was there a jangle or a
                  quarrel to disturb their happy home—all was peaceable and harmonious as it should
                     be. Ere a twelve-month had completed its
                  cycle, the happy couple were presented with a little responsibility of the genus
                  "Homo," as a pledge of their love and affections. It was no small advent to Solum
                  I assure you. But I must not forget to mention, that in process of time, another
                  visitor came, of the opposite sex, and according to tradition, that was the extent
                  of their progeny. Before I close, I will say a word about Vestilia's parents. They
                  lived but a few years after their daughter's marriage, when one after the other
                  passed to the grave, with all the hope and satisfaction due dying humanity.
                  Pastores left all his extensive pasture lands, &c., to his son-in-law,
                  daughter, and their progeny.
               Tradition has not informed me anything further of Solum and his interesting
                  family; but if in the future I should get hold of their history, I should be happy
                  to communicate it to you, my reader. In closing this narrative, I tender you all
                  my heart-felt thanks for your forbearance, while I detailed this imperfect
                  narrative, rendered so by numerous "hiatus" in the original manuscripts. So I bid
                  you all an affectionate "good-bye."
