            PREFACE.
            TIMIDLY, yet hopefully, I sent forth these thoughts, fancies, and dreams, which, in
               writing, brightened many a lonely hour; and if they but recall a pleasurable
               recollection, or charm away the dulness of a long winter's evening, my end will be
               attained. True, as Solomon says, "There is nothing new under the sun"—the more
               freely, then, I offer the effusions of a neophyte in the paths of literature. Greet
               me with sweet smiles and gentle words; your heart-warm sympathies will inspire me
               with energy to make renewed efforts for the goal we all strive to win—the approval of
               our friends.

               A CHRISTMAS SKETCH.
               IT was the night before Christmas; the first snow of the season lay a foot deep on
                  the ground; the wind whistled through the deserted streets; the air was biting,
                  intensely cold. Here and there might be seen hurrying home to the blazing fireside
                  the working man, wearied with his day's toil, yet whistling a merry tune as he
                  looked on the frozen meat and rich pie he had bought at the corner shop, for the
                  morrow's feast. A few half-starved, shivering children, too, with baskets on their
                  arms, filled with matches, were hastening to their wretched homes, and as the
                  little naked feet went pattering over the icy snow, wistful were the glances cast
                  into the brilliantly lighted windows, through which sounded the merry laugh, for
                  it presented to their minds promises of warmth and happiness. Each busy housewife
                  was bustling round, sweeping up the hearth, lighting the yule log, and hanging up carefully the stockings of
                  the little folks, that Kriss Kingle might see all things in readiness when he paid
                  his yearly visit. Now the silvery sleigh-bells sounded in the distance; hastily
                  the Christmas Tree, heavy with its charmed gifts, was placed in the corner, and
                  the good mother jumped into bed; now came the sleigh-bells, nearer and nearer,
                  jingle, jingle, on the frosty air, and lo! a sleigh, wide and long, filled with
                  Christmas cheer. There were good wishes, kindly thoughts, kind remembrances from
                  constant hearts; fairy gifts of good temper, faith, and charity; bags full of
                  sugar-plums; warm, downy, white coverings, for the poor and aged; turkeys, plump
                  and tender as young partridges; a host of rich toys and trinkets; pearls from
                  India's seas; sparkling diamonds from earth's darkest mines; charmed emeralds,
                  which paled at infidelity; costly furs, stripped from the minever amid Russia's
                  snows; tiny jewelled bottles of Attar Gul, more precious than gold, distilled
                  beneath the burning sun of Persia; and in the midst of this heterogeneous mass of
                  things sat Kriss Kingle himself. He was dressed from head to foot in shining furs,
                  from beneath which shone his surcoat, worked with gold; long golden curls from
                  beneath his cap streamed on the wind like the dancing plumes on a warrior's
                  helmet; eyes, bright and fierce as young eaglets, looked towards the guiding star
                  in the East, even that star which had gone before, and lighted the wise men to the
                  lowly cradle of the Young Child, and again seemed sounding through the air, "Peace
                  on earth, good will towards men." And the milk-white steeds from the farthest
                  North, with the strength of young lions, with the speed of the antelope, dashed up
                  the house-side, and the gallant old driver entered the spotless chamber of a young
                  maiden, who, with rosy cheek pillowed on her fair hand, dreamt of her lover. In
                  visions she recalled the last fond words; and, as in dreams they were repeated
                  over again and again, the lips moved, and eagerly her hands were outstretched to
                  embrace the loved one. Kriss Kingle bent over, and pressed on her lips the kiss
                  the lover sent. No wonder, then, the smile loitered round them, or that the
                  love-lights, dancing within her eyes, held her senses spellbound in dream-land,
                  till the glorious, life-giving sun had risen, and the noisy little ones, with
                  hands full of flowers, awakened her with shouts of "Merry Christmas, dear
                  sister."
               In a small room, lighted only by the faint moon's rays which struggled through the
                  dust-covered, paper-patched windows, sat a youthful pair—a woman and a man:
                  pinching poverty, care, and sickness had hollowed the cheek, and set deep lines on
                  the forehead. The man had in vain essayed to support himself and wife; a series of crosses had crushed them lower
                  and lower, till, laboring at work which birth and society had unfitted him for,
                  Sickness had laid her heavy hand on his burning brow. Now, perishing with cold,
                  famishing for food, Death, who already was pressing his face against the cold
                  casement, seemed their only deliverer from a world of trial. Jingle, jingle,
                  sounded Kriss Kingle's merry bells; but he rarely entered the abode of poverty.
                  Creak, creak, went the rickety door on its rusty hinges, and in crept a poor
                  starved cat, which, purring round their feet, made a bed on the skirts of Mary's
                  dress.
               "See, Mary; drive that cat out," said the man, as he shivered in the blast, now
                  pouring freely through the open door.
               "Nay, Willie, let the poor animal find at least shelter. True, we have neither
                  food nor fire; still, let us bestow what charity we may, a shelter beneath our
                  roof."
               "Well, Mary, you were ever an angel, and deserved a better fate than a home like
                  this. So let the poor wanderer remain, for who knows but she may bring us luck,
                  for so I have heard it said."
               The cat purred and rubbed her sides against their feet, as though she understood
                  all that was said. The tears were falling from Mary's eyes as she replied: "We
                  should look to a higher source for luck, dear Willie. We have seen sorrow and
                  suffering; but I hope it has been blest to us; to God alone let our prayers ascend
                  for mercy and forgiveness; He only can give us luck; and it may be we shall spend
                  our Christmas in heaven."
               In a mansion far away from the abodes of poverty, in a richly-furnished apartment,
                  sat an aged couple. As they sat opposite each other by the fireside, sadly they
                  looked on the vacant seat placed between them. Thought and memory were busy within
                  their hearts; yet neither spoke. How desolate they looked! their age and their sad
                  silence contrasting with the freshness and beauty so lavishly displayed in that
                  stately room. Rarest exotics, on porphyry stands, diffused the most delicious
                  odor; curtains of heavy damask covered the high windows, effectually barring out
                  Jack Frost; gorgeous paintings, by Salvator Rosa, of sunny lands— 
                     
                        "Where the leaf never dies
                        In the still blooming bowers,
                        And the bee banquets on
                        Through a whole year of flowers"—
                     
                   covered the walls and were reflected from many a noble mirror. The flames
                  curled and hissed round the immense logs, in the huge chimney-place; then, with a
                  roar, ascended, in a shower of sparks, as one of the foremost broke and fell
                  upright in the corner. And now the
                  fancies of those lonely ones clustered round that shapeless log. To their
                  imagination it took a hundred forms. First, their little toddling Mary, trying her
                  infant steps from chair to chair; then, screaming with delight, seeking a refuge
                  in those loved arms; then the school-girl conning her task behind the curtain;
                  and, later still, the lovely woman who occupied that vacant chair, and read or
                  sung to them during the long winter evenings—the same loved daughter whom they had
                  driven, with bitter words, from their hearts and home, because her young
                  affections had gone forth without their bidding. True, they had long since vainly
                  regretted their cruel harshness; but no trace could they learn of their child.
               Now, as sounds of mirth and festivity met their ear, they prayed she might be
                  restored to them. Saddened and subdued, they listened to a tale of suffering an
                  attendant told; how that a man and woman, covered with rags, stiffened with cold,
                  dying with hunger, were borne into a neighbor's, almost as poor, to share their
                  scanty fireside. Shuddering, they thought of their lost child, and resolved to
                  relieve the wanderers.—Christmas dawned bright and clear; the bells of all the
                  churches rang cheerily; the children ran and shouted through the streets; the
                  sleighs kept up a merry chase; and the good wives displayed their Christmas
                  offerings. Within that same stately room, where had sat that aged couple, were now
                  assembled a happy group. The sparkling sunlight, streaming through the crimson
                  curtains, lit faces radiant with happiness; for love, in all its divinity, its
                  infinitude, was there, which ever brings down heaven to earth, lighting its
                  darkness, and coloring its hues with tints as from an angel's wing.
               In the poor, homeless wanderers, they had found their banished child, and her
                  young husband. A mother's kindness had brought back the fleeting life; the magic
                  voice of affection had restored health to the drooping frame; and Mary's heart
                  ascended in a grateful prayer to God, as she looked round on the familiar objects
                  in that dear room, where so many happy hours had been spent. She felt that Kriss
                  Kingle had not forgotten her; for this year his gift was a home in her mother's
                  heart!
            
            
               
               THE MOTHER.
               IN a deep valley, the Spirit of Death tarried for the night, for he was very
                  tired; he had not known rest for many days; a pestilence had followed in his path,
                  and the young and lovely mingled their dust with the aged, who had sighed for his
                  coming. Some hundred leagues beyond, dwelt a poor widow, and her only child had
                  lain sick for many days. She knew that Death was near, and she wrung her hands,
                  praying to the great God to save her child—her only, her beautiful one. Let
                  sickness rack her body, let her be scourged with poverty, sorrow, and
                  persecution—any affliction—if only this bitter cup might pass from her lips, and
                  her boy live.
               As she prayed, an angel appeared unto her and said, "Death tarries hard by; go to
                  him, perchance he may hearken unto your prayer."
               Then she arose, kissed the brow of her child, and wrapping her mantle around her,
                  set forth on her toilsome journey; for it was the depth of winter, and the ground
                  was covered with snow. She heeded it not, although her footsteps were marked by
                  her blood; for the aching of her heart rendered her unconscious of the stones that
                  cut her feet. After she had walked many hours, her limbs became faint and wearied;
                  but her soul was strong, and she said, "I know I can yet reach the valley where
                  Death is;" for the thought of her dying child gave her fresh strength. She pressed
                  onward—when lo! a rapid river rolled before her! Dark and icy were its waves;
                  there was no boat to bear her across; and she threw herself on the ground. Her
                  heart was on fire, her breath came burningly forth—when lo! the river became dried
                  up, and she walked across, and entered the deep valley where Death still
                  slumbered.
               As she looked on him, she was amazed, and said, "Surely, if this is Death, he will
                  grant my prayer; cruelty cannot dwell in that seraphic form."
               Then came again the thought of her child, and she sat down on a stone, and wept
                  bitterly.
               And the noise of her sobs and sighs awoke Death, who said unto her, "Woman, why
                  weepest thou?"
               She answered, "I am a mother, and thou art about to take from me my only hope in
                  life; my own lovely boy. I have come to petition thee for his life. O spare his
                  youth, for I do so love him!"
               And Death said, "What wilt thou give me, if I leave him with thee a little while
                  longer?"
               She replied, "Yes; if it must be even so, only a little while longer. Why, I will give all I possess
                  on earth; or my own life, if thou wilt."
               But he said, "I cannot take thy life in exchange for his; wilt thou give me thy
                  speech?"
               And she said, "O yes; 'tis freely thine."
               Then her tongue lay mute within her mouth; but her eyes still besought him; for
                  their beseeching glances spoke all the unutterable love of a mother's heart.
               Then Death said, "Wilt thou give me now thy eyes?"
               And she bowed her head, and the beautiful eyes, ere they closed, seemed again to
                  cry, "Save! O save my child!"
               And she was smitten with a sudden blindness; but still the upturned, sightless
                  face, the clasped hands raised so imploringly, were eloquent with love.
               Then Death said unto her, "His life is spared! Go thy way." And, in silence and
                  darkness, she retraced her steps, till she came to the rapid river; but now her
                  heart was full of joy; her spirit was so light that it buoyed her up above those
                  icy waves; she was wafted across as a feather, the hard frozen ground scarce
                  feeling the impress of her feet till she came to her own door, and eagerly
                  motioned for her child; they brought him, and she stretched forth her hand towards
                  him, wondering if he yet lived. He welcomed comed her not. Then they told her he
                  had mended from the first hour of the morning; his fever had gone; but with it,
                  also, the light from his mind, strength from his limbs; that such was the nature
                  of the pestilence, those who had been attacked with it, if they recovered health,
                  became helpless idiots. Then the mother saw the sinfulness of her prayer. And her
                  tongue again found utterance, and she cried, "Not my will, O Lord, but Thine be
                  done!" That night, as she prayed beside her boy, a sudden light illuminated the
                  room. She arose, and Death stood by the bedside. His head was crowned with a halo
                  of glory! his face breathing tenderness and love! "Woman, wilt thou now give me
                  thy child?" And she said, "I will give him into the hands of the Lord."
            
            
               
               JACK FROST.
               AN autumn eve; the air was biting cold; the stars twinkled brightly. The round
                  moon lit the forest, so that you could see each blade of grass distinctly as
                  though 'twere noonday. All nature seemed to sleep; when, hark! what noise was
                  that, rushing, whistling, sobbing, sighing? It was the howling Northern blasts
                  coming from their Siberian home. Astride the foremost, rode Jack Frost. A merry
                  little elf he seemed; his eyes so wickedly bright: his face glowing like a lit
                  coal; every hair on his head standing on end, emitting sparks, as if on each were
                  seated a hundred fire-flies; a mantle of crimson cloth streamed on the wind. Now
                  poised on one foot, he shouted in frantic glee, as he tossed his cap on high, "Ho!
                  but this is a glorious time for me!" With a bound, he sprang on the nearest tree,
                  and, shaking it rudely, the few remaining leaves the wind had left, tumbled,
                  circling, to the ground. Then he espied a fine chestnut, some of whose luxuriant
                  foliage still clung to its branches, reminding one of the Summer's departed
                  beauty. Like a roguish boy, he sprang aloft to its topmost branches, breathed on
                  each leaf, till it curled and withered, as if scorched; he clapped his hands, as
                  he merrily blew before him, in clouds, hither and yon, the brown ones so dry and
                  crisp, and cracked the brittle twigs beneath his feet. He whistled, and a sprite,
                  who rode one of the lower blasts, which came quite near the earth, answered, "What
                  would ye?" "Give me," he cried, "my slippers of down. I remember a garden hard by;
                  I was in it this morning, and, hid behind a bush, watched a fair girl as she
                  tarried here and there, tying up the strong, hardy vines, and carefully covering
                  the tender plants with straw. Ah! but I'll have fine sport; I'll deck myself with
                  those beautiful flowers." Speedily the slippers were brought. How soft they were!
                  and how they shone! now he could trip silently along, light as a bird! Quickly the
                  garden was gained. Now he ran about, patting down this bed, leaving it frosted, as
                  if with sliver; dancing on that, crushing the tiny flowerets that had still
                  survived the summer. Then he grasped in his burning fingers a proud dahlia; its
                  crisp stem crackled, and the haughty flower bent its head. He peeped into a bird's
                  nest placed against a tree; but the birdlings had flown; they did not care to
                  await his coming; they had gone to a warmer clime, to remain till spring should
                  chase him back to his storm-bound home.
                  Close to the nest grew a rose—the last of the season. For a moment he ceased his
                  antics, to inhale its delicious aroma. Faint and dying as it was, he had rarely
                  met aught so sweet; for the flowers, if not already gone ere his arrival, died
                  with fear as soon as they heard his frosty voice. He drew in his breath, as he
                  bent over the rose; but she felt his presence, and, from very fear, curled up her
                  velvet leaves, wilted, and died. Angered, he brushed her aside, and flew through a
                  window incautiously left open; round and round he careered, to see what fun was
                  there. In the farthest corner was a little crib; beneath its snow-white covering
                  lay an infant boy, the darling of his mother's heart, and she a widow; his dimpled
                  cheek reposed on his little hand, and a smile played round the beautiful lips, as
                  they murmured in sleep, "Mother!" What wonder Jack Frost—heedless, merry elf, as
                  he was—stayed, charmed for a while by the infant dreamer? Yet he had work to do;
                  he must be gone; he pressed a kiss on those rosy lips, and blew a blast into the
                  face of the careless nurse, who wakened to find the carnation on the cheeks of her
                  young charge deepened into the tint of fever, while the throbbing pulse quivered
                  under the influence of that fiery kiss. He passed from the chamber to the banks of
                  a gentle streamlet, attracted by its rippling voice. A mist hung over its waters
                  as he stooped to see his shadow in its shining depths; the stream hushed its
                  singing, stiffened, and was quiet. His presence had stilled its music! Then he
                  took his way to the sleeping city; he looked down the broad streets, over which
                  the moonbeams cast gaunt shadows from the tall houses on either side; his
                  searching eye descried a pale, drooping form, crouched low on a door-step. Though
                  the head was bowed to the knees, the attitude told a tale of destitution and
                  despair! Again his step faltered. He sat down, passed his arm round the waist of
                  the fainting girl, and gently placed her head on his breast. Its iciness allayed
                  the aching of her brow; for the smile that rested round her mouth was sweet and
                  trusting, as when, an innocent child, she had prayed at her mother's knee. His
                  burning lips pressed the maiden's brow, then invested with the purity death
                  confers: he laid the cold head on its colder pillow. Again he flew over fences and
                  house-tops, at every step shaking the down from his feet, giving alike to the
                  palace and the humble cottage a covering of white. He halted for a moment, to see
                  a lover give his farewell kiss, beneath the midnight heavens, vowing eternal
                  truth. As he drew forth a ring to place on the finger of the maiden, Jack gave it
                  a whisk with his cap. Away it ran on the frozen ground. He caught it, and hung it
                  round his neck, that, when he came
                  again that way, he might test the lover's vow. He retraced his gambols over
                  meadows and field, leaving on all tokens of remembrance in fretted silver. Then,
                  as the sun in a thousand brilliant tints irradiated the eastern sky, he sought the
                  recesses of the wood to hide till the warmth of noon-day should be passed; and
                  then, again, by the light of the twinkling stars and golden moon, start away on
                  his frolics.
            
            
               DEATH OF TIME.
               
                  
                     "AND TIME SHALL BE NO MORE!"
                  
               
               A MAN stricken with age, with locks white as snow, lay on a couch; his bright but
                  sunken eyes were gazing on the last flickering sparks of the smouldering fire; his
                  limbs were shaking with cold; by his side lay a broken hour-glass; it had fallen
                  from his palsied hands. Suddenly, there was a knocking at the door. In a faint
                  voice, he bade them enter; and, tripping lightly to his side, came a laughing
                  girl, clad in green. A tear trembled in her eye, as she looked on the careworn,
                  aged man; with a gentle hand, she smoothed back the straggling hair from his
                  temples, and bent to kiss his brow; it was icy cold!
               "Why, how is this, old Time! thou shouldst be up and stirring; the sky is all
                  ablaze with light; trumpets have been sounding; hear'st thou not? Strange forms
                  are flitting through the air; crowned angels are seated on the clouds, which fly
                  athwart the heavens as though they were winged; a star fell to the earth even as I
                  entered; is it not wondrous, these
                  appearances! what mean they? I came for thy leave to go forth on my yearly
                  mission—to clothe the fields in green, to waken the rivers and streams from their
                  ice-bound sleep, to bid the violet and anemone peep from their snowy bed; for, lo!
                  Winter is beside thee, to say farewell."
               For, as she was speaking, another had entered the room—an old man, also, with
                  features pinched with cold and want. A mantle of furs was wrapped round his gaunt
                  form; shivering, he crouched by the fire, holding his bony fingers over the flame:
                  he, too, seemed dismayed by the appearances abroad. As his young sister, Spring,
                  ceased speaking, he turned towards Time, that he might hear his reply.
               "My children, both of you, farewell! Your day is past; never more shall Winter
                  send forth his howling blasts to desolate and destroy the fair face of nature,
                  nipping the sweet bud of promise, and causing the heart of man to weep in
                  bitterness; neither shall Spring, with her smiles, again clothe earth with beauty;
                  her joy-giving life is ended! She can no more breathe her spirit of fragrance into
                  the flower-cup, or paint its petals in brilliant hues. The rivers and streams by
                  whose banks she strayed with lightsome heart, teaching them to discourse sweet
                  music, will never more awaken to her voice: my strength fails me. Shadows, thick
                  and fast, come before mine eyes; again I hear the great God calling this earth
                  into being. Eden, in its primeval beauty, looms before my vision. Eve, in her
                  transcendent loveliness, wanders forth with Adam, to list as 'the morning stars
                  sing together, and the sons of God shout for joy.' I go forth with Noah, on that
                  happy morn when the dove returned with the olive branch, and the faint sunbeams,
                  struggling through the rosy clouds, announced that the waters of the deluge were
                  spent. Now I hear the voice promising unto Abraham that through him all the
                  nations of the earth should be blessed! I go forth with Isaac to meet his bride! I
                  repose beside the pillow where Jacob slept, when he saw the ladder which reached
                  unto Heaven. I stand with Moses beside the burning bush, as he listens, in
                  awe-struck silence, to God's commands! I am with him as he leads the children of
                  Israel from the proud court of Pharaoh! I journey with them through the
                  wilderness, in the dark midnight, guided by the pillar of fire, unto the Red Sea!
                  I hear the rushing east wind, as, at the voice of the man of God, the waters
                  divide, and are piled up on either side like mighty walls! I am with Mary in
                  Bethlehem, as the wise men from the east bow down before the young child! I stand
                  on the walls of that Jerusalem which the Almighty-He wept over! I am by the Cross!
                  and tremble, as memory recalls those darkened ened hours when the vail of the temple was rent in
                  twain, and the tombs gave up their dead! Once more I sit by the lowly sepulchre,
                  and, looking within, see the angel sitting there, and witness the grief of Mary,
                  as she looks in vain for the body of her Lord! Chasing each other through my
                  brain, are the memories of the mighty nations whose rise and fall I have looked
                  on! Babylon, Nineveh, Egypt, Rome, how have ye fallen! and now I, too, must fall.
                  It is the coming of the Son of Man, whose heralding signs in the heavens have
                  affrighted ye. He has said, the heavens shall depart as a scroll, the earth shall
                  pass away, and 'Time shall be no more!' Lo! even now one waits without, who shall
                  give rest to my weary soul."
               They opened the door. Behold, there was waiting a Pale Horse; and on it sat Death!
                  His face was stern and sad; his eyes were as a flame of fire; their terrible
                  splendor was more potent, more piercing than his shaft. Then was heard a mighty
                  voice from the throne of heaven, crying, "It is done!" The voice reached the
                  drowsy ears of Time! A smile of joy for a moment brightened the wasted features.
                  Then the weary eyes closed; the head sank heavily on its pillow; and the
                  long-suffering spirit slept.
            
            
               QUEEN KATHARINE PARR.
               A LEAF FROM HER LIFE.
               THE frosts of winter were disappearing before the genial influences of early
                  spring. The Lady Katharine, once more a widow, though now wearing, beside the
                  widow's hood, the sweeping sable pall which marked her as the relict of the
                  departed Henry, was residing at Chelsea. It was a delightful morning, and her
                  heart participated in Nature's Jubilate. She walked through the beautiful and
                  extensive pleasure-grounds, and looked forth on the Thames—its rippled surface
                  dotted with many boats, the evidences of active joyous life. She looked upwards to
                  the broad expanse of ether, through which the sun's rays were streaming, gilding
                  the noble trees, now covered with budding verdure; and her spirit rose in a song
                  of thanksgiving on the wings of the up-soaring lark. It seemed to her as though
                  the last toilsome years of her life were blotted from her memory. Again a merry
                  child, crowned with wild flowers, she sported and sang with her only sister Anne,
                  in the verdant vale that bordered the
                  Kent, in her childhood's home.
               For the last six months of her wedded life, alternate fits of terror and agony had
                  racked her soul. She well knew she was "but a poor pensioner on the bounties of an
                  hour;" that the sword suspended over her head was upheld but by a single hair. It
                  was not possible, therefore, she could not feel much sorrow for the death of her
                  sensual, tyrannical husband. No, her "bosom's lord sat lightly on its throne,"
                  inspiring her with a girlish vivacity, very unlike the meek, staid demeanor that
                  had characterized her during her three trials as wife and step-dame. Sir Thomas
                  Seymour, Lord Admiral of England, the only one who had ever possessed her
                  affections, was again a claimant for her hand.
               On this fair morning, she seemed to tread on roses; she had just received one of
                  his passionate epistles, petitioning that the two years she had desired should
                  intervene between their marriage should be changed to months. How could she resist
                  his ardent pleadings? for years he had remained in single loneliness for her sake.
                  Then came the memory of his disinterested affection; the many evidences of his
                  constancy; and with them mingled recollections of her blighted youth, her dreary
                  womanhood, with its days of bitter trial and temptations; and, woman-like, she
                  yielded to her heart's suggestions to see him, as he prayed her, that night.
               As evening drew on, dark heavy clouds, scudding along the sky, seemed to betoken
                  the approach of a storm. But the Lady Katharine gave no heed to storm nor
                  darkness; she thought but of the moments that must elapse ere Seymour could
                  arrive. On this night she had thrown aside her mourning, knowing how unsightly
                  were the widow's weeds to him she waited for. She wore a dress of rich gold
                  brocade; the bodice fitted tightly to her graceful, petit figure; the sleeves,
                  open and flowing from the shoulders, were lined with crimson satin, beneath which
                  hung rich falls of lace, veiling the beautifully rounded arm. Her head was covered
                  with a round of crimson velvet hood, edged with pearls, which well contrasted her
                  brilliantly fair, blooming complexion; from her neck depended a ruby cross of
                  great value. As the quarter-hour chimed from the old clock, she gathered her train
                  across her arm; and, forgetful of dignity, or aught else but love, she sped down
                  the grass-grown walk, through the meadow, loth that any one but herself should
                  perform the office of porteress for him. But the old gate, with its rusty hinges,
                  withstood her utmost efforts to open; in vain she shook and pulled the lock, till,
                  on a more vigorous thrust from the outside, the fastening gave way, and she, no
                     longer Katharine the Queen, but
                  Katharine Parr the loved, the beautiful, is clasped to the breast of him she so
                  dearly loved. It were vain to tell of the pleading words of him so well skilled in
                  the spells that work on woman's heart. With his magnificent voice modulated to the
                  softest, lowest tones of affection, he warmly urged her to become his wife, to
                  reward his tried affection by bestowing on him that hand so long ago plighted him.
                  Katharine's ears were so little used to love's importunities, her former marriages
                  having been arranged solely by relatives, that she was little fitted to withstand
                  Seymour's entreaties, more especially as her own inclinations echoed his every
                  word.
               Casting aside royal etiquette, she permitted Seymour again and again to press her
                  beautiful lips, and place on her finger the ring of betrothal. She only felt that
                  she was passionately beloved by the man of her heart; she cared not for the
                  joyless bauble that sometime graced her brow, but thought only of the tenderly
                  beloved one whose arm now encircled her. With fond caresses and promises soon to
                  meet, the lovers parted. And now, each night saw Katharine standing beside the old
                  gate, her hand clasped in Seymour's, as, with bowed head and tearful eyes, she
                  listened to his fond pleadings. Yet Katharine well knew there were many reasons
                  why their marriage should be for a while deferred. First, the tenor of Henry the
                  Eighth's will, regarding any issue she might have, either male or female, making
                  them heir presumptive to the crown of England, would for a few months prevent the
                  contemplated espousal. Somerset (and his Council, too) was wroth at the
                  presumption, as they termed it, of the Lord Admiral, in aspiring to the hand of
                  the Queen Dowager, and opposed it most strenuously. The Princesses Mary and
                  Elizabeth would also condemn this unseemly haste. All this reasoning she laid
                  before him; but Seymour would not brook delay; and Katharine had either to resign
                  her lover or her scruples. So who can wonder that the lover's eloquence prevailed
                  over punctilio!
               The gay month of May, flinging its engarniture of beauty over leaf and bower and
                  bud, was near its close. The beds of hyacinths perfumed the air with their odorous
                  breath. The rich-hued blossoms of the clustering rose, peeping from their emerald
                  coverings, told that Nature's gala month was nigh. Already the trailing vines had
                  crept round and round the fluted marble pillars—the white buds looking, in the
                  changeful silver light of the young moon, like rows of pearls. It was the Lady
                  Katharine's bridal night. Arrayed in a pure white robe of richest lace, she seemed
                  as radiant as that bright eve; her only ornament the starry wreath of jasmine
                  flowers that bound her brow—that brow,
                  with its pencilled arch, pure as the mountain snows—the tracery of the blue-veined
                  temples, so clear beneath the glossy bands of golden hair; the color on her cheek,
                  like the faint blush of the moss rose-bud. As thus she stood within her lighted
                  hall, waiting for Seymour, she ever and anon would raise her small white hand, as
                  if to list for his well-known step. At length it greets her ear, and Seymour, with
                  courtly grace and lofty bearing, knelt before her. Well he then appreciated the
                  gift of that noble woman's hand, and many were his promises to secure her
                  happiness. And who can tell of the feelings of Katharine on that happy eve, though
                  three times already had she plighted her troth! yet, only now, for the first time,
                  did her heart thrill with tenderness. For a moment her memory reverted to her last
                  gorgeous bridal. She recalled the feeling of that terror-stricken hour, when, as
                  the nuptial ring was placed upon her finger, her cheek blanched, her heart
                  fainted; for the same ruthless hand that then clasped hers had signed the
                  death-warrants of two as lovely, and once as passionately beloved queens, within
                  the last seven years. But now she was girt round with pure and holy thoughts, like
                  ministering angels. In place of the loud pealing of the organ, the low murmur of
                  the mountain rill alone echoed her vows—for the dazzling lights, the trembling
                  light of the moon, now glancing on the flowers, now lost in the shade. Her only
                  perfumes, those which the night-gale wafted round; her brightest jewel, now dearer
                  far than ever England's crown—her husband's love; and, encircled by his arm, her
                  fair head resting on his bosom, she at length gave utterance to the suppressed
                  fondness, the tenderness of a lifetime.
            
            
               
               PARADISE AND THE PERI.
               
                  
                     
                        "Tis written in the Book of Fate,
                        The Peri yet may be forgiven
                        Who brings to this eternal gate
                        The gift that is most dear to Heaven!"
                     
                  
               
               THE bright sunbeams were bidding good-night to earth; tired and wearied of the
                  long summer's day, they were to be at length released, to rest in those cool,
                  brilliant valleys whose azure calm no mortal foot has trodden. How joyous they
                  were, dancing and glistening ere they went in Cashmere's clear lake; now darting
                  upwards, like sparks of fire; now resting on the crested wave, like regal gems;
                  anon plunging beneath, only to rise more resplendent, like youthful maids, from
                  their delicious bath in the sparkling waters; and now glancing upwards, the whole
                  western heavens became crimsoned with their farewell blushes.
               A Peri, listlessly reclining on the dewy bank, had watched the last faint,
                  lingering sun's ray depart, and now could no longer resist the ardent longing that
                  possessed her, to also enter those heavenly vales that had once been her home. She
                  thought of her long exile, her loneliness, her recreant race, and she remembered
                  that Allah was a God of Mercy; per-adventure, by repentance she might gain
                  entrance to those halls of the blest.
               Very lovely she looked as she stood at the crystal gate. As the light from within
                  its charmed portals streamed on her fair brow, her radiant eyes were dimmed with
                  tears; yet she could still see groves of towering palms, Eden's clear fountains,
                  and close to their edge the blue tinted Campac blossoms, that grow nowhere but in
                  Paradise. The moon, also, looking wonderously fair, crowned with a bright circlet,
                  reposed in that dazzling light. Lowly she bowed her head, and tears stole down her
                  cheeks, as the memories of her happy home added to her remorse.
               The pitying angel, who stood within, seeing her disconsolate attitude, half opened
                  the gate, so that the ambrosial air of heaven fanned her fevered cheek. He asked
                  her, "why she wept?" Then, in one long burst of eloquent sorrow, she told of her
                  repentance, her hope of forgiveness, her desire to re-enter and dwell in Paradise.
                  But the angel waved her off, yet gently, for his heart sympathized with her sad
                  prayer to be forgiven. He told her there was a hope for her, a probation of which
                  she might avail herself; that it was
                  written in the Book of Fate— 
                     
                        "The Peri yet may be forgiven
                        Who brings to this eternal gate
                        The gift that is most dear to heaven!"
                     
                  
               
               For a moment she mused; what could she bring to those halls? what gift could
                  compete with their glories? Rapidly, in mind, she scanned the wealth of earth; she
                  knew the very spot beneath the ruins of Persepolis where the genii had hidden
                  immense treasures of burning rubies, along with the jewelled cup of King
                  Jamshid—each gem shining like the steps of Allah's throne. She knew where bubbled
                  the stream whose waters contained the Elixir of Life; one drop of which would
                  confer youth and immortality. She knew where to obtain rarest pearls worth a
                  monarch's ransom. But what would they be as gifts to open to her longing soul
                  those halls of which one moment spent in their holy happiness would outweigh all
                  this unnumbered wealth. As she thus meditated, she cast her eyes downward on that
                  sweet land, so bright and beautiful in the first smile of morning, its air
                  breathing balm, its sparkling rivulets flowing through groves of spice,
                  sandal-wood, cloves, and aloes, the sea of India stretched far in the distance.
                  This seemed, indeed, a Paradise; but man, the destroyer, had brought death within
                  those spicy bowers; the rivers ran with human blood. Mahmood, in his fierce wrath
                  and desire of conquest, had desolated that land of the sun; he had recklessly
                  overthrown the shrines, and trodden their idols under foot. With ferocious cruelty
                  he spared none, however beautiful and loved, that crossed his ruinous path; his
                  bloodhounds tore the child from the grasp of its mother, the maiden from the
                  sacred fane. Sorrowfully the Peri gazed on this scene of slaughter. Adown the
                  war-field, she beheld a youthful warrior—the last of his race. The dead and the
                  dying lay in heaps around; yet bold, undaunted, he gave his proud conqueror glance
                  for glance, and, when asked to surrender, hurled his last remaining dart at the
                  face of his ruthless foe. A zephyr changed its course—the tyrant lived. He only,
                  the last and bravest, fell: his proud heart had broken—its pulse could never more
                  thrill at the mention of glorious deeds. The Peri marked the spot where he lay,
                  and quickly descending on a sunbeam, caught the last drop of life-blood from that
                  heroic heart—the last drop that quivered ere the noble spirit fled; she encased it
                  in pearl, to bear it upward, never doubting it would prove the welcome gift that
                  would unbar for her the gates of light; for, though shed in unholy strife, she
                  knew the heart which had been its
                  well-spring had freely given it in the sacred cause of liberty. That had purified,
                  ennobled it, making it a pure offering for the heavenly gates. Again she winged
                  her flight to that glowing portal. Alas! the crystal bar of Eden moved not.
               The angel took the drop: and although a free welcome is ever accorded the brave,
                  who thus die for their native land, he told her the boon that would gain her
                  entrance must be far holier than that. Saddened, but not dispirited, she again
                  descended to earth. This time, Egypt, with its ruined temples, its sepulchred
                  kings and splendid palaces, was her resting-place. But the charm of those fair
                  scenes had departed. The demon of the plague, on the hot wing of the deadly
                  simoom, had passed over the land, destroying all its bloom and
                  freshness—converting it into one vast pest-house. The dead lay unburied in the
                  streets, making most foul the air; the very vultures sickened and turned from the
                  disgusting prey.
               The Peri, in sorrowing pity for the sights that had met her at every step, as she
                  threaded the close, hot streets, passed into the clearer country, and espied close
                  by a lake of clear, fresh water, a dying youth. The damps of death had already
                  gathered on his brow; his lips were purpled with the dread disease, yet a happy
                  smile rested on them; the terrors of death could not rob him of the consoling
                  consciousness that she he loved was safe—safe, in her father's princely mansion,
                  from dread of contagion.
               While he thus felicitated himself, a graceful, slender girl sprang to his side. By
                  stealth, she had eluded the watchful care that guarded her, and imagining, with
                  the heart's prescience, some evil to him she so dearly loved, had sought the bower
                  close to the lake their love had hallowed, only to find her lover dying on its
                  brink. Kneeling by his side, she raised the aching head, and pillowed the livid
                  cheek upon her breast.
               "And didst thou think thus to desert me? Was it kind? I, who would rather be thine
                  in death than live to gain a throne! Nay, turn not from me that loved face! life
                  or death with thee!"
               And again, and again, she wildly, fondly pressed her rosy lips to his, drinking,
                  in those soul-thrilling kisses, deep draughts of death.
               "Nay, beloved, am I not thy own dear bride? Can I live without thee?" 
                     
                        When the stem dies, the leaf that grew
                        Out of its heart must perish too!"
                     
                  
               
               With a sigh, she fell on the already lifeless form of her lover, and expired,
                  inhaling his last breath.
               "Sleep, fair children," said the Peri, as she softly stole that farewell sigh, warm bathed, as it was,
                  in woman's purest love; "this surely, this pure, self-sacrificing sigh will gain
                  me entrance to Eden."
               Thus saying, she breathed on the dead, dispelling for a while the noxious vapors
                  that had gathered round them—giving them so lovely a semblance that corruption
                  feared to approach. Then, with the first gray tint of morn, as a suppliant, she
                  again bowed before Eden's gate—in vain; it moved not; yet she could see the
                  purified souls within striking their harps attuned to gladness. She inhaled the
                  perfume of the incense clouds flung from golden censers by bright-winged seraphs.
                  She heard the tinkling of the bells that hung on the trees close to Allah's
                  throne, and her heart throbbed with pain. Should she never again enter there? was
                  her search ever to prove vain? The angel had told her the maiden's story was
                  written in characters of light within those halls; but holier far than even that
                  sigh must be the gift that would remove the bar that closed the gates to her
                  longing soul.
               Again earth received her in Syria's garden of roses, where Nature wantoned through
                  a wilderness of sweets; its cool fountains laved her burning brow. The many
                  beauties spread around possessed no charms for her; carelessly she looked on the
                  riches nature spread with so lavish a hand. The notes of the nightingale came
                  meltingly on the breeze, but she heard them not; unclouded skies, with not a
                  floating shadow to dim their brightness, spread o'er-head, but she saw them not.
                  She was weary and sad.
               As her eyes roamed over the vale, a little child, in innocent play among the wild
                  flowers, crushing in his eager hands the brilliant butterflies that fluttered amid
                  the starry jasmine, attracted her attention. As, scarce heeding, she watched his
                  sports, a man, soiled and travel-worn, dismounted from his tired, hot steed, that
                  it might assuage its thirst from the spring that welled so deliciously cool near
                  by. On the man's face was written the impress of the stormy life he had led; wild
                  and furious passions, like lightning clouds, chased each other across his haggard
                  brow; they told dark tales of the past. Suddenly, the vesper hymn, like sweetest
                  music, rose on the calm evening air; the boy started from his play, and, kneeling
                  on the fragrant sod, breathed his pure, child-like petition to the Eternal God.
                  The wretched, careworn, sin-stained man looked on that cherub boy, and his past
                  life rushed before him; his childhood's hour and mother's teachings; boyhood's
                  days, so fair and blest, and the prayer he had been taught to lisp at that
                  mother's knee, returned to his seared memory; then, as the sin-defiled lips
                  uttered that prayer of his sunny
                  boyhood, tears of soul-felt repentance streamed from his eyes. And now he, too,
                  kneels in humble prayer by that little child, while loud hymns and hallelujahs
                  proclaim throughout the court of heaven the triumph of a soul forgiven.
               All heaven and earth were still—a calm, holy silence; for around was diffused the
                  living fragrance of that repentant sinner's acceptance; and now, as the last ray
                  of crimson light faded on the clear air, a smile from the angel at Eden's Gate
                  illuminated the tear drop that still glistened on the sinner's cheek. The Peri,
                  assured by the kindly smile, caught the drop, and on joyous wings sped upward,
                  bearing the glorious gift that would, at length, unbar those crystal gates. 
                     
                        "Joy, joy forever! my task is done -
                        The gates are passed, and Heaven is won!"
                     
                  
               
            
            
               A SCENE AT NIAGARA.
               AT the close of the year 18—, a solitary traveller was seen slowly wending his
                  steps towards the mysterious and magnificent cataract of Niagara Falls. He was a
                  man apparently in the prime of life, of middle stature, of high, pale brow, and
                  deep, melancholy eyes, that burned dark and gloomily, like sepulchral lights; his
                  whole cast of countenance betokened the visionary. Of German birth and naturally
                  melancholy temperament, he had spent his life in a vain search after ideal
                  happiness: his wanderings had extended over nearly the whole of Europe, but in no
                  place had he satisfied the vain cravings of his heart. In the palaces of princes,
                  in the tent of the wild Arab of the desert, in the cell of the devotee, amid the
                  loud warwhoop of the savage Indians, in the scenes of peace and strife, had he
                  sought to realize the dreams that had haunted his youth; but disappointment met
                  him at every step. With a spirit wearied and disgusted, he had bidden farewell to
                  the shores of the Old World, hoping find in the land of freedom the object of his
                  long search. He had been but a short time
                  in Canada, and on this day, for the first time, looked on the immense body of
                  water called Horseshoe Falls. The sun was gliding, with his departing rays, the
                  tops of the tallest trees: the effect was inexpressibly grand. Surprised and
                  delighted at this glorious evidence of God's greatness, he sunk on a low
                  moss-covered stone, and gazed on the wild waste of waters dashing hither and yon
                  like demons in play, dancing a thousand antics as they rushed headlong down the
                  mighty depth below. He shuddered; some irresistible unknown power seemed impelling
                  him to at once bury his discontent in those waters, now so dazzling white with
                  sparkling foam, now dark as the hell of his own thoughts. He turned his eyes
                  upward; the heavens were bright and clear, the fresh evening breeze fanned burning
                  temples and wrapt him for a time in forgetfulness of his wasted life. Gradually
                  the din of the waters became hushed, and the rainbow-seeming vapor that had hung
                  over them in the mild rays of the rising moon appeared like a column of silver;
                  but whilst he looked the rays of light separated, heavenly music floated on the
                  air, around and above him appeared forms of the most transcendent loveliness. The
                  band circled him round, and from their midst stepped forth one so far beyond aught
                  he had ever conceived, even in his wildest dreams of beauty and grace, that
                  involuntarily he knelt in adoration. Her golden hair was bound with a tiara of
                  sparkling gems, robes of azure and gold floated in a wavy cloud around her, and,
                  as her voice broke on the stillness of the air, Rupert Warheim thought he was
                  already entering the regions of the blest, and the celestial voice of the shadowy
                  being before him was his welcome to his everlasting home. Again he hears those
                  tones, so sweetly musical, and now he can distinguish words.
               "Rupert, I am the daughter of that beautiful star, now far away in the western
                  sky; these maidens are my ever constant attendants. At your birth you were placed
                  under my special charge. I was to be the guide, the arbitress of your destiny. For
                  long years I have watched, yet remained idle, curious to see how a child of
                  humanity could live uncontrolled. Now am I satisfied; yet my heart throbs with
                  pity; for the results of my inactivity has been to you years of unhappiness and
                  misery. All mortals at their birth are placed under the tutelage of spirits, and,
                  though in their folly they imagine they are free agents, there is ever a
                  controlling hand stretched forth to guide aright, to shield from dangers incurred
                  through a momentary withdrawal of that protecting arm. You have been left to your
                  own guidance, there incapable of centering hopes and affections on earthly
                  objects; your soul, though you knew it
                  not, unconsciously pined after the spirit-land. I, though seemingly careless of
                  your destiny, love you better, ay, fonder than the bright abodes I am willing to
                  abandon for your sake!"
               "Bright vision, my longing aspirations, my wasted youth, confirm thy words; I love
                  thee fondly as thou canst desire, my spirit's only bride; say, canst thou forsake
                  thy native skies and dwell forever unmurmuringly on earth?"
               "Rupert, I have chosen; yet list to the penalty I have incurred: to my home in yon
                  beautiful star I may never more return; yet think not I have none other shield my
                  sheltered love in. Consent to be mine, mine only, and we will leave this world,
                  where you have known only sorrow, and beneath these waters, so lately whirling
                  round in frantic play, now sleeping calmly in the bright moonlight, we will seek
                  another home, where the skies will smile as serenely as ever in your own loved
                  land, and a king might envy the throne that shall be there yours; neither care nor
                  sorrow shall assail you; a charmed life shall invest you with endless youth. Give
                  your consent, and this night we will spread our nuptial couch far below Niagara's
                  eternal thunder!"
               Rupert had listened in silent amaze to her wondrous pleading: love already
                  possessed his heart, so softening his rugged nature that he felt any spot, however
                  drear or desolate, would be paradise, if blest with her bright presence. "Lady,"
                  cried he, "do with me as thou wilt; I am thine forever!"
               A beautiful smile passed over the lady's face as he spoke; then, desiring him to
                  follow fearlessly, she plunged into the dark waters. Down, down they dived, deep
                  and yet deeper into ocean's hollow, he heedless of aught but that he fulfilled the
                  decree of fate, his destiny in the form of the fair one urging him on. At length
                  they reached ground: a more beautiful, fairy-like spot ne'er greeted mortal sight:
                  palaces formed of the most brilliant crystals and costly gems, magnificent gardens
                  filled with delicious fruits, rarest flowers exhaling sweet perfume, all combined
                  to please the eye, entrance the senses. Rupert rapturously gazed on these
                  submarine treasures—a paradise indeed.
               "And here," said he, "I am to live through unnumbered ages?"
               "Yes, till time shall be no more;" then gracefully waving her hand, pointed
                  upwards through the waters raging above their heads, and bade him look towards the
                  eastern sky, now kindling with the rosy beams of day. He cast his eyes in the
                  direction indicated, then turned to his beautiful protectress. Alas! she had
                  vanished; in her stead horrible forms compassed him round, varying their shapes
                  each instant. A sea of fire rolled at his
                  feet, towards which they tried to drive him; shuddering he shrank from their
                  clammy grasp, made but one step backwards, and fell into the burning abyss. Down
                  he sank, gasping, striving to extricate himself from the excruciating torture he
                  endured; one violent struggle, and, opening his eyes, found it broad day, the sun
                  high in the heavens, the sky "deeply, darkly, beautifully blue," Niagara's broad
                  waters roaring in his ears, the vapor hanging in cloud-like masses, as on the
                  preceding day, and, despite his many cares, his weariness and sorrow, right glad
                  he was to find himself on terra firma; to know the bright temper and the
                  succeeding horrors were but the vagaries of the arch-fiend, Nightmare.
            
            
               THE LOST PLEIAD.
               
                  
                     
                        "A Story from the stars, or rather one
                        Of starry fable from the olden time,
                        When young imagination was as fresh
                        As the fair world it peopled with itself."
                     
                  
               
               MANY, many years ago, there dwelt in Persia a prince renowned for beauty of person
                  and mind—his form of grace, perfect as Endymion; to see him was to love. During
                  the long tedious days of that sultry clime, he was wont to recline in some flowery
                  bower, where, untrammelled by cares of state, he would rear chateaux en Espagne, and his fancy, roaming far beyond
                  cloud-land, revelled in regions where houries dwelt in moonlit halls; imagination
                  often cheated him, as he thus mused, into the belief that he heard the harps and
                  celestial voices of those dwellers in Paradise, and he longed to cast off
                  mortality that he might be blessed with the possession of creatures so beautiful.
                  When night closed over the scene, for a while dispelling his visions, a sail
                  across the glasslike sea varied the monotony to which he was condemned. * * *
                  *
               
               The day had been unusually hot—not a zephyr stirred the white cinnamon
                  blossoms—the hours dragged wearily on—Cyris threw aside his book. He was too
                  languid to read; his raven steed stood idle; but at length even the wearisome
                  hours of that long, hot day came to a close, and "still evening, clad in her sober
                  livery of gray," spread refreshing dews on the parched flowers; the breath of
                  twilight, redolent with perfume, came healing to man and beast. The western sky
                  was radiant was blushes; Cyris seemed inspired with new life; all languor and
                  inertness had fled; he sprang into his boat, and gaily spread wide the silken
                  sail. One, to have seen that delicate ivory skiff, would have fancied it a
                  sea-nymph's cradle, so exceedingly beautiful was its form, and so rare its
                  embellishments: 'twas carved in many a quaint device, like a wreathed shell, lined
                  with cushions, the hue of the rose-bud; the sail was of purple silk, wrought with
                  gold. The boat was wafted onward to where the crimson clouds had faded to a pale
                  amber; the solitude, the soft breeze, and quiet sea well harmonized with the mood
                  that had crept over the prince. How little now appeared to him all earth's
                  greatness compared with the illimitable starry firmament—man's creations, with the
                  mighty deep, unchanging in form and power, the same grandeur now as at creation's
                  dawn. As, one by one, the bright stars arose from the silent waters, he wished for
                  wings to visit them, to know why they were placed there; he thought they looked
                  coldly on him in their gleaming beauty; then their immeasurable distance, and the
                  futility of his desires, filled him with sadness. Oh! that he might meet with some
                  fair spirit who could understand and sympathize with his imaginings—on whose
                  affection he could ever rely—that he might press to his beating heart one whose
                  soul thrilled but at his voice. True, as a monarch's heir, he could command smiles
                  and gay words—aye, and caresses—but these false endearments were not what he
                  craved: the love he sought must be far nobler than any within the precincts of a
                  court could give. Slowly the boat glided 
                     "O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,"
                   and insensibly the motion lulled him to sleep; and, in that deep repose, one
                  could more attentively observe the rare beauty of his countenance. There was but
                  one defect which marred it—the straightly drawn under lip, which, even in sleep,
                  betrayed, by its tremulous quivering, his inconstant nature. This fault alone
                  obscured his otherwise dazzling qualities: brave to recklessness—gentle, yet
                  daring withal, neither danger nor risk could deter from an object on which his
                  fancy centered; but, once gained, too
                  often it was with wilful waywardness cast aside for some newer fantasy. * * * How
                  long he had slept, he knew not; but, as he looked forth, nature seemed to have
                  assumed a new guise; a spell enshrouded him, from before which the earthly mist
                  shrank from his gaze, and to 
                     
                        "His charmed eyes were given
                        The spirits of the starry heaven."
                     
                  
               
               Far in the west appeared heaven's brightest constellation, the cross; high over
                  his head the serpent waved his scales of gold; but lo! a pageant moving slowly
                  towards the sea, "The Lyre of the Pleiades," a lyre whose strings were of gold,
                  borne aloft by seven fair sisters, who, as they bent over the instrument and
                  struck the living chords, filled earth and heaven with sweet sounds. They were,
                  indeed, radiantly lovely; each wore a coronet of gems clasped high upon the brow
                  by a single star, which served as a fillet to bind the dark flowing tresses. One
                  of that bright band, apparently the loveliest, cast a glance of love on Cyris; he
                  could not be mistaken; she whose cheek wore the richest blush, whose eye seemed
                  lustrous with unshed tears, cast on him a glance of intelligent, unmistakable
                  love. Cyris prostrated heart and brow before the lovely one; nor withdrew his gaze
                  till the lyre dipped beneath the sea, and the clouds rolled up their fleecy
                  skirts, while the melodious murmurs of the far-off fountains, the shrill matin
                  song of the birds, all told him that morn was advancing, with rosy steps, to sow
                  "the earth with orient pearls." He returned home, joyous with excitement, to await
                  another twilight. Wearily, hour after hour sped on, till darkness came again; then
                  the purple sail was unfurled, and as a speck of foam, again the little boat danced
                  on the waves, and again the vision appeared; slowly the seven fair sisters uprose
                  on their glittering car, while their song-like music was borne on the breeze.
                  Slowly, slowly, they rose, till, to his strained gaze, they seemed but as burning
                  stars in the far heaven. He watched until the morning mists, gathering in the
                  east, warned them to seek their ocean bower; but, ere they touched the wave, an
                  electric glance was interchanged by the lovers. Night after night thus passed,
                  their eyes alone discoursing love; and well they understood that silent, yet
                  expressive language. At length came the moon, and, under her jealous sway, no star
                  dare appear. Cyris looked, therefore, in vain for his starry lyre. In the mean
                  while, the lovely Pleiad, consumed with passion, had sought her father's enchanted
                  throne; and, with tears and entreaties, besought him to sanction her union with a mortal. King Atlas in vain essayed to
                  say nay to the caresses of this his youngest and most loved child. He foresaw
                  danger and death in the desired espousal. Won by her prayers, he gave the kiss of
                  assent, and her bridal with Cyris was resolved on.
               In a bower of roses, close beside a fountain, whose spray fell like a shower of
                  diamonds, haunting the air with sounds and sighs of melody, leant Prince Cyris; a
                  couch of moss, strewn with blossoms and buds, breathing sweet perfume, was spread
                  at his feet; but he pressed not its fragrant pillow. Suddenly he started, for
                  across the mirror of the fountain a shadow passed; and by the clear, dark eye, the
                  raven tresses, the star upon her forehead, the sparkling coronet, the silvery
                  vest, and robes of azure, half veiling a form of perfect grace, the lovely Pleiad
                  stood confessed. At length his vain aspirings had been gratified; the love he had
                  craved was now his, in all its purity and truth. Was he happy? All day they
                  reclined by the cool fountain, and, looking in each other's eyes, imaged paradise;
                  nor did they separate till night called for her starry host. Then, as he had been
                  wont in other days, Cyris went forth in his fairy skiff to watch his loved one
                  till she again became a burning star; thoughts of blessedness came over his soul;
                  he thought of her affection tion, loving-kindness, devotion, truth, and purity,
                  and longed for the morning hour, that he might again clasp her in his arms, and
                  repeat his protestations of love. Months passed thus, and then came change, like a
                  dark cloud, to dim and soon shut out forever the light of happiness. With Cyris,
                  old feelings began to assume their wonted ascendency; soon indifference usurped
                  the place of ardent love. The vows he had once spoken were like the cold moonbeams
                  on the sea, changing and lost in every successive wave. To Cyris, inconsistancy
                  possessed a charm over which even his immortal bride had no power; to her, the
                  change was frightful; to live, to die with him, had been her hope—to be a sharer
                  of his earth-born lot she had abandoned her glorious sphere; and now, as a flower
                  whose perfume had been inhaled till it had palled upon the senses, she was thrown
                  aside, crushed, and forgotten! Oh the misery of that hour! the waking of the
                  trusting eye, as the careless look and altered tone foreshadowed the future. She
                  had so purely loved him, her woman's heart had made him half divine. She, so
                  guileless and pure, to be consigned to such a fate! to have left her starry home
                  with its happy unconsciousness, her fair sisters' affections, for woman's destiny
                  on earth—sorrow and bitter tears!
                  
                     
                        "They parted as all lovers part—
                        She with her wronged and breaking heart;
                        But he rejoicing he is free."
                     
                  
               
               Again Cyris appeared at court; again the young and fair welcomed his coming; once
                  more he frittered time in idleness, or in pursuit of some vain chimera, which,
                  with reckless daring, he strove to possess. But she—the loved, the lost—she had
                  looked her last on his white plume; she had strained her ear to catch his last
                  footfall; and when it no longer charmed her ear, despair, like a vulture, gnawed
                  at her heart. The shadows of evening were gathering over the sky; the winds of
                  night wailed a mournful response to her sad soul; she bowed her head upon her
                  hands, and burning tears coursed down her pale cheeks. Hark! she hears the voices
                  of her fair sisters: "Come, sister, come; thy place awaits thee." The lyre was
                  rising from the bosom of the green wave, where it had rested amid pearl islands
                  and gardens of coral. In vain they entreated; her place remained vacant; her chord
                  unstrung; and when its music was hushed in the distance, she flung herself on the
                  grass and wept. Ah! how light had once been her now sorrowing heart— 
                     
                        ——"Till loves' witchery came,
                        Like the wind of the south o'er a summer lute blowing,
                        And hushed all its music, and withered its frame."
                     
                   She sought the fountain, and cast into its clear depths her starry crown;
                  then, before its sparkles died in the waters, sprang to meet them! 
               No mortal hand made her grave; none marked the spot; the waters alone sang her
                  requiem; but near there grows a rose-tree, whose blossoms are unlike the summer
                  growth of flowers; each rose is pale and drooping, as though its only dew was
                  tears. Still, on that sky-lyre is there a vacant place; still, a chord mute; for,
                  low and deep in the bosom of the clear fountain, rests the warm, trusting heart of
                  the lovely Pleiad, who there sought to hide her terrible woe, when, too late, she
                  learned that 
                     
                        "Love is of heavenly birth,
                        But turns to death on touching earth."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               THREE DAYS IN THE PALACE.
               THE sun's farewell beams were crimsoning the western sky; fleecy purple clouds,
                  piled mountain high, cast rays of golden light over leaf, and tree, and flower.
                  Sadly musing, by an oriel window, sat a noble lady; her beautifully formed head,
                  with its redundancy of golden curls, rested on the small, fair hand. Perchance,
                  she but gazed on the varied prospect spread before her, noting, contemplatively,
                  the effect of light and shade as evening deepened; and yet, ever and anon, she
                  would shade her eyes from the gathering darkness, and look forth as one who
                  watcheth; but naught answered the searching gaze; the giant trees, like the
                  pillars of some vast temple, cold and immovable as they looked beneath the moon's
                  rays, alone met her glance. The chill night air swept in gusts through the open
                  casement; but still the lady lingered, seemingly loath to leave; yet, as she
                  wrapped round her shivering form the ample drapery that veiled the window,
                  impatiently she beat the soft cushions with her little foot; then, as if she could
                  no longer restrain the chafing of the proud spirit within, arose and hastily paced
                  the room, the small curved lip became more haughtily bent, the pale features
                  assumed a sterner cast. A step sounds in the corridor; a voice sweet as the
                  prattlings of infancy to the mother's ear stirs the profoundest depths of her
                  heart, and Seymour, the Adonis of the court, kneels before her. For a moment the
                  blush of gratified pleasure mounted to her cheek; then, as if the baneful breath
                  of the sirocco had blown over it, the crimson flush faded, and the pale stern lip,
                  and haughty eye, asked of the delay; for, to her, moments, as they lagged on,
                  seemed hours. The Lady Elizabeth had seen the blossoming of but fifteen summers.
                  Ever a child of fairest promise, she early possessed the art of attracting the
                  regard of others. There was a winning fascination in her manner, united with
                  childlike simplicity and gentleness; yet, at times, there was an imperial flash of
                  the eye that spoke of more than the pride of beauty; a look of command on the
                  lofty forehead; and, in the haughty wave of the hand, the fierce spirit of the
                  Tudors. The attentions and caresses of Seymour, seconded as they were by the
                  unprincipled women by whom she was surrounded, wove a spell round her susceptible
                  heart whose potent influence survived long after the scheming brain that had woven
                  the mesh had mouldered to dust. Few young girls were ever in more serious peril than the Lady Elizabeth at this
                  period. Lonely and unprotected; deprived of the counsels of her only friend, Queen
                  Katharine, by death; left solely to her own wild will; exposed to the audacious
                  familiarities of a bold, bad man, who deemed her as the heiress of the crown—a
                  fair stepping-stone to power; and, as such, scrupled at no means to attain his
                  purposes. The difference in their ages (nearly twenty years) only invested the
                  Admiral with a more manly grace. Then, besides, he was her first love—perhaps the
                  only one she ever really loved; and what young heart doth not ponder over its
                  first affection? and, in after years, recall the romance of feeling with which it
                  was cherished—the longing to set at defiance all restraints, and to sacrifice, at
                  the shrine of this first pure love, wealth, ambition, ay, and even sovereign
                  power, were it proffered in exchange for that priceless gift—an honest, faithful
                  heart? With a proud gesture, the lady repulsed the arm that would have embraced
                  her, as she asked why the eagerness of love had already passed from his step.
               "Nay, nay, sweet one, thou wrongest me. There is no need of haste where one
                  knoweth himself beloved. Hark! even now the hour strikes which I appointed! Thou
                  must not so easily take offence, sweet Bessy. Thou knowest I could not see a charm
                  in other save thee. Come, nestle within these arms; let the dove in thy eyes
                  o'ermaster the eagle."
               The full heart found vent in a burst of weeping. In that fond hour all else was
                  forgotten but love; royal estate, her brother's displeasure, and the denunciations
                  of the Council—all were powerless to crush the heavenly germ of happiness that
                  sprung in her heart. She pressed her cheek to his manly breast; and, as he kissed
                  the tears from her eyes, wished she were a lowly cottage maiden, and he the dear
                  one who dwelt beneath the shadow of her roof.
               
               The first of February dawned clear and cold; a crowd of gay nobles and gallant
                  cavaliers thronged hall and court-yard; the sunny air rang with the noisy
                  preparation of departure. Francis, Duke of Anjou, was that day to start for home,
                  accompanied, part way, by the Queen and all her court. The Duke, long a suitor for
                  the hand of the Queen, was at length convinced of the futility of waiting longer
                  for her consent. He was completely wearied of the absurd thraldom in which she had
                  so long held him. Year after year, he had striven to bring her to the desired
                  point in vain; and, finally, had crossed the seas to try the effect of a personal
                  appeal; but, finding she still trifled, he determined to remain no longer the puppet of her wayward will, and
                  announced the day of his departure.
               Now Elizabeth, though loath to wed him, was equally unwilling to lose her lover.
                  His presence seemed to have become necessary to her happiness. It seemed to have
                  imbued her with the lost spirit of her youth, or she was charmed by the romantic
                  gallantry that had induced him to cross the seas in disguise, to throw himself at
                  her feet; but, whatever it was, certainly the Queen committed many tender follies
                  for his sake; and, as though Oberon had anointed her eyes with the charmed juice,
                  seemed to see in the ill-favored, misshapen form, the ugly nose, and marred
                  complexion, but the appearance of a "most marvellous proper man." It must be
                  remembered the Queen was now in her forty-ninth year; therefore, the marks of
                  fondness she bestowed on Anjou seemed, to those who did not regard them as
                  political coquetry, as the unequivocal tokens of doting tenderness. She really
                  appeared, during the three months he remained in London, inspired with a most
                  ardent affection, and, by every wile and endearment, tried to detain him.
                  Numberless were the entertainments devised for his amusement; balls and masques,
                  tragedies and comedies vied for his approval. However, all her enchantments were
                  fruitless to retain him other than as her wedded lord. So, on this bright, frosty
                  morn, the journey was commenced, Elizabeth and all her court accompanying him
                  (despite his wishes to the contrary) part way to the coast.
               After three-days' travel, they arrived at Canterbury. Each day the Queen had
                  thought to say farewell, yet each day she found the word more sad, more painful to
                  pronounce. The Prince now besought her to return, telling her, very cavalierly,
                  she had better go home, he did not need her escort further, and he much feared, if
                  she still persisted in accompanying him, that with her feasting, idle shows, and
                  the delay consequent, the present favorable weather would pass away, and he should
                  be obliged to remain her guest a while longer. As this was what Elizabeth desired,
                  she renewed her loving professions, telling him, if he would only wait a while,
                  she would be able to arrange all difficulties, and certainly marry him; but Anjou
                  was no longer to be cajoled by this modern Circe. So, as the most effectual way of
                  ridding himself of her importunities, he told her that, as the affairs of his own
                  kingdom needed his attention, he must now return home; but that the following
                  March would find him again a suppliant for her favor. Pale, bathed in tears,
                  Elizabeth extended to him her hand, which he, kneeling, pressed to his lips. As he
                  turned away, the Queen's countenance was convulsed with anguish, plainly showing
                  the severe struggle in her heart between
                  tween duty and passion. Henceforth she was her country's bride only; for this
                  parting ended the last matrimonial negotiation in which Elizabeth ever
                  engaged.
               
               The gloom of midnight rested on the lowly cot and the stately palace. In an
                  apartment, hung with rich tapestry, a wan lamp lighted the death-scene of
                  England's Elizabeth. The dim firelight cast its long grotesque shadows over the
                  ancient hearth of that regal chamber; the rare hangings and gilded carvings of the
                  old oaken panels, lit by the flickering embers, seemed to the affrighted watchers
                  forms of life. Three days ago, the court physician had announced that the mighty
                  Queen was dying—yet still the sands of life ebbed. It had seemed impossible to
                  that lion-hearted woman that death could lay his cold numbing hand on her heart,
                  and, as she felt his approach nearer and yet nearer, she flung down her
                  gauntlet—the mighty Queen defying him to the combat. As he grasped the bed, she
                  sprang from its shelter, and most obstinately stood on her feet for fifteen hours,
                  thinking thus to baffle the conqueror. But whether on the cushioned couch, or in
                  the tented field beneath heaven's arch, he is ever near; and, when the appointed
                  moment arrives, quietly stretches forth his hand to the quick soul, and
                  straightway the sinews shrink, the blood stagnates, the heart becomes still! So at
                  length felt this mighty Queen, as she succumbed to his terrible power! All her
                  greatness could not avail her to purchase one hour of life; neither could it quiet
                  the soul's desperate frenzy!
               Where now was her defiant courage, the dauntless energy to banish from her lonely,
                  unsoothed pillow, the spectres of the past? One after the other came her murdered
                  victims—from the rack, the gibbet, and the stake—whispering into her ear sentences
                  fraught with doom! Norfolk, too, was there; and the once dearly-loved Essex. She,
                  too, who had sought the stranger's holy right—hospitality and protection—Mary of
                  Scotland, her unhappy cousin.
               Slowly the dark hours wore on, bearing the Queen to eternity! As midnight chimed
                  from the clock of the tower, her once strong spirit became paralyzed, and sunk
                  into a lethargic slumber, from which she never roused! None knew the moment when
                  the restless spirit passed from its earthly tabernacle. The sonorous bell tolled
                  three ere it was discovered that the Queen had ceased to breathe! Death had
                  entered the palace!
            
            
               
               THE WIND OF THE WINTER NIGHT.
               A RUSHING of mighty wings, and lo! came the blasts of the North, roaring, howling,
                  buffeting, in wild glee. Their frozen chains were rent, and from the icebound seas
                  and bleak wilds of Siberia they rushed madly forth. As they drove before them the
                  black storm-clouds and drifting snow, they halted to spend their fury on a lovely
                  vine-clad land, seemingly embowered in groves of the most delicious fruits and
                  fragrant fields, high with budding grain, whilst here and there between were
                  miniature lakes, whose crystal-like waters lay calm, unruffled as the sleep of
                  infancy. So, we may imagine, lovely and happy was the home of our first parents,
                  before the advent of sin defaced and scattered its beauties. Here all things
                  betokened love, peace, and plenty; to the prodigality of nature, man had added his
                  handicraft; stately palaces, rich with architectural glories, reared their marble
                  fronts to the fury of the tempest; but scarce had it sounded its challenge, in
                  those rushing winds, ere it was subdued; furious and wrathful as they looked, they
                  slowly fell earthward, first rustling over the wheat-ears, then, lower still,
                  sighing, they swept the tall grass, as from a temple near stepped forth the genius
                  of the place, and thus he spoke:—
               "Spirits of the North, in vain ye strive to disturb the harmony of our lovely
                  homes. Here, under the new régime, since man has
                  become convinced that by association alone his terrestrial destiny can be
                  accomplished as God originally designed it should be, all is happiness and
                  content; every evil—vices, crimes, diseases, sorrows of every nature—is forever
                  excluded from our charmed circle. And by the purest simplicity, by the greatest
                  economy of means, by distributive justice, has this great transformation of
                  society been effected. Now we live as one people, with the most perfect agreement,
                  proportioning our labor to the wants and inclination of all, thereby not only
                  conforming to the laws of nature, but our own pure organization, which also
                  enables us, as you see, to subdue the wintry winds, to become absolute masters of
                  the surface of our earth; for in our advanced knowledge of meteorological facts,
                  and the enlarged sphere of our labors, we have so cunningly cultivated the
                  products of mother earth, that by the vegetable growth alone we are enabled
                  skilfully to correct the disturbed electrical equilibrium, and thereby arrest the
                  winter's storm, the summer's hurricane; and by this potent charm we drive you back to the North.
                  Yet, ere you depart, say what are the signs of the times? what have ye seen on
                  your onward course?"
               A dark, scowling form, in obedience to the request, raised his storm-crowned head,
                  and thus replied:—
               "Of the times I know naught. To thy power I yield, and thy wise intelligence must
                  draw the inference from the relation we will give. The Northern Lights, in their
                  crimson glory, shot athwart the sky, dimming with their lurid light even the
                  brightness of the Polar Star, as our chains were removed, and the mandate, 'Get ye
                  forth,' was issued; and from the toppling icebergs we sang a requiem over a
                  gallant band, as, statue-like, they stood on their noble ship, gazing with horror
                  on that waveless sea which held them spellbound on that dread deck to die. We
                  listened to the last cry of their fierce despair; then onward, through those
                  desolate climes where the earth is scarce ever green, where, in mist, and snow,
                  and biting cold, which hugs them in an iron embrace, dwell those unhappy exiles
                  whose destiny is to labor in those icy climes till the throb of the beating pulse
                  shall become faint and numb as the frozen streams around their wretched huts. All
                  things were dead around; clouds and darkness rested on the desolate moor; not a
                  moving thing was to be seen; all nature slumbered. The intense cold of that region
                  had confined all within doors but one, one wretched, careworn man, who, with bowed
                  head, and clasped hands, looked forth on nature's desolation; he thought of his
                  happy home, of his glad childhood; then how love had cast a golden shadow over his
                  manhood, and his treasured bride, and his loved little ones. O God, and was such
                  grief real! Should he not awaken from this cruel dream, in his happy home, and
                  clasp the wife within his arms, and feel the tender kisses of his darlings on his
                  cheeks, and hear their pleading tones? Alas! alas! this living horror was real,
                  was true; in this darkened land, beneath this ungenial sky, far from all he loved,
                  from every human sympathy, he must wait the summons to eternity. As I saw the
                  frozen tear resting on his hollow cheek, I felt that death alone could release the
                  pale slave; so, in pity, I breathed on his heart and froze its currents; when
                  night fell, the sleet formed him a shroud; and, as we sang over him a dirge, we
                  knew he was at rest. Then away to the cloud-capped hills of eternal snow, dusky
                  and huge, the eye wearied in gazing on their heights; but, in the vale below,
                  lovely with waving trees and fair flocks, was a lonely cottage; through the
                  latticed casement we saw an aged mountaineer, who, with his little family, was
                  partaking of the evening meal. With a wild shout we rushed through the mountain
                  gorges, leaping from crag to crag, startling the bold eagle from his eyrie, and casting
                  headlong, down, down, into yawning depths, a chamois hunter, who had sought refuge
                  from the sudden storm beneath those icy rocks; as we mocked with echoes his bitter
                  cry for wife and home, we started an avalanche, tumbling, tearing, with deafening
                  crash; uprooting trees, in its headlong course, it fell in the vale below, and the
                  lonely cot was buried in the ruins as in some mighty sepulchre; then 
                     
                        "Far along,
                        From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,
                        Leaps the live thunder!"
                     
                  
               
               As the storm increased, and the rain poured in torrents, up the mountain side,
                  toiling wearily upwards, came a gentle girl. Her sweet face was pale as her Alpine
                  snows; and, as the big tears gushed over it, we marvelled what brought one so
                  young and lovely to those giddy heights, where only the wing of the vulture or the
                  sure-footed chamois might find a footing. Yet all unconsciously she wandered on,
                  unheeding the yawning precipices, the beating rain, or the forked lightning; her
                  heart seemed turned to stone; and as one who, searching for immortality, knows no
                  fear, so she, groping in the dark, passed the spectre Death again and again among
                  those gloomy solitudes. With the unerring prescience of affection, she found him
                  she sought for. There lay the brave hunter, with the mountain stream for his bed,
                  the brown rock for his pillow. There was none other near to watch over his
                  slumbers but her. She wrapt round him her own mantle, and laying her fair cheek on
                  his mute heart, like a wearied child sunk to rest. We heard, in the distance, the
                  cry of the wolf and the vulture; but she was so fair, so like the sweet flowers
                  which bloom by the clear lake-side, that, though our mission is sorrow and
                  destruction, we would fain preserve her in her purity. We spread over the lover
                  and his bride a snow-white covering, and left them in darkness and loneliness.
                  Then we passed over a battle-field, where lay the still unburied dead; and I bore
                  on my wing the wailings of the widow, the desolate lamentations of the orphan, to
                  that city where, a few hours before, resounded the cry of Liberty and Freedom, to
                  show those boasters how hollow, how false had been their promises. The voice of
                  human sorrow, as the heart-strings shivered, were alone heard for the tones of the
                  trumpet and the inspiring cry of victory. The shell and the ball had defaced the
                  proud walls of many a stately mansion, and, in their ruins, they seemed bound
                  afresh to the tyranny of years."
               And the genius answered: "Thus it is ever. War and antagonism but break hearts and
                  fill graves. Not till the entire
                  association of the human race can man be free; then only will slavery, in all its
                  odious forms, vanish from the earth; then society, freed from its conventional
                  shackles, shall rise superior to the puerile fancies of the day; then only will
                  nation strive with nation in love and confidence—a war of science and of the fine
                  arts; and the command given at Creation's dawn, 'increase and multiply; fill the
                  earth and subdue it,' shall be fulfilled."
            
            
               LOVE AND MINERVA.
               Night's gems were sparkling in the sky. 
                     
                        "The young Moon, like a Roman mother,
                        Among her living jewels beamed,"
                     
                   and stooped to dip her silver bow into the fair fountain, by whose side, on a
                  couch of moss and fragrant leaves, reclined in pensive mood the blue-eyed Queen of
                  Wisdom. The severe dignity of her high pale brow was softened by the influences of
                  the hour; the radiant eyes, like twin stars, beamed with so pure, so chaste a
                  light, that Love, as he crept from beneath a myrtle hedge, where he had been
                  sleeping, forgot, in gazing at her exquisite loveliness, that it was the stern
                  Pallas whose smiles had captivated him. But, he said to himself, "lovely woman
                  never yet refused me her favor; I'll e'en try my luck;" so, very carelessly he
                  threw himself at her feet, and, as he gazed into her lustrous eyes, in rapturous
                  terms commended her fine shape, her hair, her sparkling glances, her rosy lips.
                  The nymph, more pleased by the flattery than she cared to show, blushed, smiled,
                  puckered up her lips, and tried to look more charming ing. Then Love praised her voice, and said, how
                  delicious it would be to lie forever in that cool shade, listening to its dulcet
                  tones; and if he but dared clasp her waist, the bliss of the moment would render
                  him constant ever. The goddess sighed, for joy is ever akin to sorrow. She thought
                  of her reputation; but love's fond whispers were sounding in her ear, his shaft
                  piercing her heart. Her wondrous wisdom had taught her no counter-spell against
                  his power; she looked into the clear fountain, whose shining depths reflected, as
                  in a mirror, her blushing charms, then—for 
                     "Woman at heart is woman still"—
                   sunk into Love's clasping embrace, and hid her blushes on his breast; while
                  from the shade of every tree sprung forth a nymph, some alarmed, some amazed;
                  others struggling with mirth thus to see Wisdom resting in the arms of Love.
            
            
               THE ANGEL AND THE SPIRIT OF DEATH.
               THE shadows of night were gathering over the earth; the moon, as yet a crescent,
                  cast but a faint light; by its glimmer, one could scarcely fail to
                  perceive—indistinctly, though, 'tis true—two figures which seemed to lean against
                  the old Elm, in Catesby Park; the old tree still glowing with verdure, redolent
                  with perfume, albeit a century's storms had howled around its head. One of those
                  forms was an Angel—one of those bright creations who kneel in adoration before the
                  great White Throne, yet, by the inscrutable will of God, unaware of the sufferings
                  to which the sons of humanity are doomed in this probationary state of existence;
                  the other was the Spirit of Death; thus they discoursed. First, the Angel spoke,
                  and his voice stole through the hushed evening air like the strains of some old
                  eastern melody: "I have travelled far and wide, over this beautiful world, in the
                  glorious morning, when the sun first peeped from his rosy curtained clouds,
                  gilding everything on which he shone with joy, sowing the grass with pearls, and inspiring the lark with new songs. O
                  how lovely all nature seemed! And I saw a young lover. He was in his early youth.
                  In the fervor of first love, he knelt beside the maiden of his choice. Their hopes
                  were glowing and bright, as the traditionary flower which grows wherever the
                  shadow of the rainbow falls. Her cheek vied with the rose; her lips fragrant as
                  the breath of morning. I witnessed their bridal, as the stars danced up the purple
                  sky; and the tenderness and devotion of a long life will be a foretaste of that
                  heaven which shall succeed. I then passed through a city; its riches and splendor
                  could not be surpassed; all spoke of happiness and prosperity. I entered, with a
                  group of maidens, a festal hall, where the sunny smile and radiant eye made sweet
                  music. I halted where there was a mighty gathering of the nation; where the red
                  banner of victory floated triumphantly to the sound of the trumpet and the
                  spirit-stirring drum. It was a gallant sight to see those young brave hearts
                  rejoicing in their country's freedom. I could not refrain my voice, as their shout
                  unanimously rent the sky—'Liberty or Death!' Again I paused, in the dim twilight,
                  to listen to the music which appeared, to my rapt senses, strains from Paradise;
                  it was the Convent vesper hymn! How peacefully calm! it breathed the very essence
                  of holiness and content! In sooth, this earth is a very lovely place. Do not, I
                  entreat, pass over her face! stay thy dark wing! let not the happiness God himself
                  has created prove by thy presence so evanescent!" Then the Spirit of Death raised
                  his hand, and by so doing cast from before the eyes of the Angel the filmy veil
                  which, when a mere passer over the earth, had obscured his vision, so that he only
                  saw the outward show of mortality, and bade him go forth and look into the secrets
                  of nature, and, when another moon had waned, to meet him there, and say if he
                  should stay his shaft.* * * Again the moon shone fair upon the old Elm, but the
                  form of the Angel was bowed as if with grief; his face was sad, and most
                  reluctantly he replied to the inquiries of the Spirit of Death: "Yes, I have been
                  on the mountain-tops, and in the lovely valleys. Alas! alas! that happiness should
                  be but outward seeming—gayety but the mask assumed to conceal the breaking heart!
                  The shout of victory, so quickly followed by the anguished cry of pain, the wail
                  of the widow, the orphan's tear! The gay bridegroom had already mingled in the
                  world's tumult; deserted the home of his young affections and gentle thoughts;
                  carelessly he spoke of his love as a dream of fairy-land romance; the freshness of
                  youth had forever departed from his heart; ambition had usurped its place; he was
                  changed, indeed; yet he sought to believe
                  the change was in others rather than himself. And his bride! how sad her looks!
                  how pale her cheeks! her brow thoughtful with care; her lip had forgotten to
                  smile; sorrow's stamp was on her heart, sealing within it the gushing tenderness
                  of early years; the charmed words of love could never again loosen the spell; her
                  affections had become their own grave! I saw the sweet rose which bloomed in the
                  early morn—'twas hanging lifeless on its stem, frozen by the cold northern blast.
                  Again I looked on the city, whose prosperity and riches seemed inexhaustible; an
                  armed legion had swept through its pleasant valleys, and levelled its proud towers
                  in the dust. The cry of battle met my ear, even on the plain where so recently the
                  hymn of the vest band ascended unto God. Then—but for a moment—I was charmed by a
                  minstrel's voice; but I scanned his heart; there was sorrow and wasting care
                  within it; hope had lured him with giddy, empty promises of fame; and the checked
                  frown and hidden sigh strove to be unseen, unheard. He deemed it sufficient, if
                  the world knew not the misery to which he had sold himself. Sad, sad lesson for
                  the heart to learn! And the gay, the young—they are ever striving after the
                  unattainable, or playing with straws—trampling on the few flowers which bloom on
                  their path—only at length rendered conscious by the thorns which pierce their
                  feet! And even the bright sunshine is chased away by the rolling thunder and the
                  driving rain. 
                     
                        "Alas! 'tis all but outward show-
                        The sunshine of yon green earth below."
                     
                  
               
               Spirit of Death! your flight over the earth is indeed a mission of mercy. The
                  wretched and wayworn pray for thy coming. Stay not thy shaft, for it speeds the
                  weary spirit home.
            
            
               
               JEPHTHA'S DAUGHTER.
               
                  
                     
                        "Since our country, our God, O my sire!
                        Demand that thy daughter expire!
                        Since thy triumph was bought by thy vow,
                        Strike the bosom that's bared for thee now!"
                     
                  
               
               COLD and pale broke the gray light of morning over horseman and foot, their
                  helmets and breast-plates gleaming with gold; the crimson banners, inscribed with
                  many a sacred device, flaunting in the misty air—the glistening spears and dancing
                  plumes stretching dusk and shapeless in the distance far beyond the eye's
                  reach.
               'Twas the vast army of the Israelites, led by their chosen captain, the mighty
                  Jephtha, as he thus stood a little aside, supporting his only child, his beloved
                  Miriam. Not a sound of revelry or shouting laughter was heard along the ranks, so
                  deeply they respected the sorrow of that fair girl. Yes, she was fair as the white
                  jasmine; as she half leant on her father's breast, one could not but mark her
                  stately grace as she bowed her gem-encircled brow; the troubled flashing of her
                  brilliant eye, the tremulous lip, the sigh vainly checked, all spoke the heart's
                  agony at this first separation from him who had been father, mother, friend. * * *
                  And Jephtha led the army of Israel, and, as he journeyed, he raised his voice in
                  prayer, that God would be with them in the coming fray—that He would bring him
                  back a conqueror; and then he cried: "Whatsoever thing shall first meet me on my
                  return, that thing shall be the Lord's, and I will offer it as a burnt-offering."
                  Now Jephtha had left with Miriam, to solace the days of absence, one to whom she
                  had been betrothed, on whom she had bestowed the first love of her young heart,
                  and, with him for companion, she wandered out, night after night, at the soft hour
                  when the setting sun closes his portals, shutting out the magic of daylight,
                  giving instead hues which shadow forth the glory of heaven, to watch for the
                  promised messenger to tell of Jephtha's return. How bright in ethereal beauty
                  appeared those hours, as, hand clasped in hand, in silence, they sauntered on,
                  gazing into each other's eyes for answers to question their hearts had framed,
                  forgetting in their strong sympathy the words had been unuttered by their lips!
                  Then, looking upwards to the crowds of stars—some so shadowy pale, others radiant
                  with golden light—blessed God for creating this beautiful world. At length came
                  one who told of Jephtha's return; he was even then at hand. Miriam called together her maidens, saying, "Array
                  thyselves in purple, that we may go welcome my father." Then, carrying branches of
                  the citron, the palm, and the myrtle, scattering flowers in the path, dancing to
                  the sound of the timbrels, they went forth to meet him. Soon they heard the
                  trumpet's tone; then the clash of the cymbals; then rose, in the distance, the
                  banner of Jephtha, whose majestic form appeared riding at the head of the
                  victorious army. With a light step, and a glance bright with happiness, Miriam
                  sprang towards him. No welcoming word, no kindly kiss greeted her. He turned from
                  her with a deadly sickness; for he bethought him of his rash vow, as he beheld at
                  his feet his darling child, whom he had thus devoted to destruction. "My father,
                  you weep! why is this? Alas! that tears should fall, when all are blest by your
                  return; and now you rend your clothes! Speak, that I may share your grief."
               "My daughter, my heart is very sad. I have vowed unto the Lord what, I fear, has
                  been most rash. Listen, my child," and he told her of his vow.
               With a convulsive start, she sprang aside from his encircling arm, while the
                  life-blood rushed in crimson torrents to cheek and brow; then, receding, left them
                  deathlike in pallor. Her lips became white and cold, and, with outstretched arm,
                  as though to ward off some shape of horror, with rigid form, suppressed breath,
                  and eyes straining and staring as though every nerve was stretched to its utmost
                  tension, she presented a ghastly aspect of despair. In that moment she had bidden
                  adieu to life, to hope, to happiness forever. The pangs of death were in that
                  moment's utter agony. In all the wide world, there was not even one straw at which
                  her drowning soul could catch to save her from the terrible fate which menaced.
                  She cast her eyes upward. The sun was shining brightly; the very weeds beneath her
                  feet were redolent with his bright beams; the breeze swept through the myrtles,
                  leaving echoes of sweet words spoken beneath their shade. All was fair; all nature
                  full of grace. She alone was desolate; on her soul rested the shadow which made
                  all earth seem shrouded in gloom. Slowly the tears gathered in the strained eyes;
                  the mouth lost its rigidity; the hand relaxed, and fell to her side; the struggle
                  was over. She had been so strictly taught the duty of obedience, that to rebel
                  from that stern vow never once occurred to her. She met her father's anxious eyes
                  with a faint smile, as she replied: "Do with me as thou wilt; give me but a little
                  while to cast aside this keen bitterness at the thought of death and the tomb. I
                  will retire to solitude, there to prepare for the hour in which I shall go hence."
                  Trembling and pale, she drew her veil
                  over her face, and, supported by her maidens, she passed from before them on to a
                  mountain cave that, in happier days, had been a favorite resort. There she thought
                  she could best prepare her soul for God; and she prayed Him to give her strength
                  to endure; to look calmly on the dusky form of death; to think, without horror, of
                  the separation of soul and body—the great mystery of eternity. * * * Miriam
                  sojourned in the mountains nigh unto two months. One night, with mind o'er-worn
                  with grief and watching, she had, in utter forgetfulness of time and place (in her
                  great despair), flung herself on the ground, hiding her face in the tall rank
                  grass, when she was startled by a footstep near. She raised her eyes, so beautiful
                  in their tearful brilliancy, and met the sorrowing gaze of her betrothed.
               "My Miriam! and is it thus we meet? I come to bear thee hence. Nay, raise not thy
                  hand so imploringly to stay my speech. Is not our God with us? Has He not said,
                  'Thou shalt not kill'? What right has Jephtha thus to dispose of thee? Even now a
                  fleet steed waits at the entrance to the grove, to bear us, far beyond these
                  mountains, to a home so beautiful and bright an angel might dwell there. Secluded
                  from aught of evil, my arm shall be thy protection, my bosom thy shelter. Nay, I
                  will not leave thee. I cannot endure this life-long misery; long years without
                  thee—never to see thee—never to hear thy sweet voice pronounce my name—never more
                  to feel the loving clasp of thy hand! have I no power 
                     
                        'To snatch the loveliest of earth's daughters from
                        A doom my soul sickens at?'"
                     
                  
               
               "Cease, cease; you rive my heart. Thou knowest how dearly thou art loved; thou
                  movest me to bitter sorrow, although thou canst not make me falter in my duty.
                  Seek not to change my purpose; rather strengthen my failing courage by thy
                  fortitude. Nay, clasp me not; 'tis in vain. I cannot consent."
               One desperate prayer to Heaven for aid, one wild caress-and she was gone. * *
                  *
               The hour had arrived; 'twas a sultry summer's day; the sun looked dimly through
                  the dark purple clouds, as if he mourned the mistaken enthusiasm that had
                  assembled that great multitude. Slowly approached Miriam; her face colorless as
                  the mountain snow; her raven hair, freed from clasp or band, fell to her feet; her
                  white robe hung loosely round her lovely form; its purity and simplicity well
                  accorded with her angelic beauty.
               A deep silence reigned around as Jephtha met her. He was much changed; his sunken
                  eyes and haggard face bespoke the agony of his mind; for, though he conceived he had no right to retract from the
                  performance of his vow, his very soul trembled as the angel of death shook his
                  wing over that dear head.
               "O, my daughter! my daughter! gladly would I die for thee; gladly give my life for
                  thine, if so my vow could be fulfilled."
               Slowly the words came from the pale, half-closed lips.
               "Farewell, my father! I have bidden adieu to all I held dear. It matters little, a
                  few years longer—a pang more or less. Prepare the pile!"
               She seemed stunned; more like one who had ceased to feel than the yet living,
                  breathing, and unhappy girl. With a heart bursting with agony, Jephtha led her
                  on—on to where the pile of sweetly-scented wood reared its dark shadow, like a
                  bird of prey swooping to seize a dove. With an unfaltering step she ascended; and
                  as Jephtha applied the burning torch, a cry from ten thousand voices rent the
                  heavens, while the clouds, with giant blackness, poured forth their torrents, that
                  they might sweep away the relics of so foul a sacrifice. Down, down poured the
                  furious rain, as though the vials of wrath were again opened over the devoted
                  earth, and the howling wind scattered the funeral brands; but Death had risen over
                  the pile, and the pure spirit of Miriam was nestling within her mother's bosom in
                  paradise.
            
            
               THE CONVICT.
               NOVEMBER was near its close; all day long the leaden-hued clouds had been driving
                  across the sky, weeping torrents of rain; the wind howled and moaned like a weird
                  thing through the tall masts of the old ship; the black, angry-looking waves
                  dashed over the deck, drenching with their cold spray the wretched crowd that
                  there huddled together, straining their eyes to catch a last view of the white
                  cliffs of Albion, fast disappearing in the distance. There amongst that band
                  gray-haired men, on whose brows time had set his impress, yet they were scoffingly
                  defiant in sin; others looked sorrowfully towards their once happy homes, and the
                  big tears rolled down their furrowed cheeks, for they thought of the dear ones
                  lost to them forever. Men, too, were there, mere boys in years, yet old in crime,
                  who smiled as they gazed; to them, sin-dyed, exile from home, fatherland,
                  presented but little of sorrow; gold, the only guerdon they prized, could be
                  gained in any land by craft and daring. It was a convict ship, with its freight of
                  human souls, journeying to that far land
                  to which the outraged laws of their country had condemned them.
               Crouching close to the vessel's side, far as possible from contract with those
                  rough, rude men, was a female, a child in years, although her slender form had
                  attained the perfection of womanly grace. The tiny hands were clasped so tightly
                  that each blue vein swelled out as though it would burst beneath the pressure of
                  the iron chain that bound them. The upraised, pale, suffering face, so rigid with
                  woe, seemed as if one pang more would transform it, like Niobe's, to stone; but
                  the large black eyes, so full of passion, of power, with their strange, wild look,
                  almost burned the white cheek o'er which they flashed. What could that child have
                  done to incur the felon's lot? to be thus sent far from friends and home, to
                  sorrow and misery, none near to soothe the bitter agony, to bathe the fevered
                  brow, to see the flush of youth fade from her cheek, or shed a tear over her
                  grave? Weeks sped, bearing the convicts, through storm and sunshine, to their new
                  homes. The men, some of them, were even more reckless with jibe and jeer than when
                  they started; even those few who had wept on leaving home had become merry,
                  beguiling the toilsome hours with anticipations of future—how they would build a
                  new home in the wild, by some pleasant murmuring brook, where the birds of spring
                  should come to them, bearing messages of love from the absent; thus cheered, they
                  would commence life anew. Only she, that fair child, bowed down with shame,
                  remembered the past; yet she neither wept nor prayed; she shrank from all
                  companionship; her eye was ever bent on the ground, or watching the far-off
                  billows that were bearing her from all she held dear. Day by day she withered; the
                  blight on her young heart was eating away her life.
               One day she called me to her, and in a sweet, low voice, thanked me for the little
                  kindnesses it had been in my power to bestow; then besought me, when I returned to
                  my home, to visit her old father. "Take," said she, "this curl, my only
                  remembrance; give it to him; he will cherish it for my sake; and tell him"—here
                  her voice faltered—"my prayer, my dying prayer, was for him."
               Need I say I promised all she desired, and then tried somewhat to cheer, to
                  console her; but in vain. Alas! poor mourner! for her there was no future.
               Next morn, as I ascended to the deck for my usual stroll, I observed a coffin
                  lying there—a white pine coffin, merely a few boards nailed together; and they
                  inclosed that once perfect form; that strangely fair face was shrouded forever.
                  Pitying men raised the coffin, prayers were read, a momentary pause, a plunge, causing the very heart to sicken,
                  and the convict had found a grave beneath the surge of the wild sea.
               Some years later, on returning to England, I inquired the history of that fair
                  girl. A few words told her life. She was the daughter of an opulent farmer, who
                  had centred all his pride, his worldly hopes in her, his only child. Possessing
                  ample means, she was sent to a neighboring academy, where she acquired an
                  intellectual culture that totally unfitted her for the sphere in life in which she
                  was destined to move. Thus, completely isolated from all companions of her own
                  age, her rare beauty and many accomplishments united with circumstances to effect
                  her ruin.
               A stranger visited her forest home—one of rank far above her own, beautiful as
                  Antinous, skilled in all arts to win a female heart. Why linger over a tale the
                  same in all ages? Love's commencement is ever a fairy fancy, a glittering network
                  of costly gems; but its ending is despair and death. So Alice found it; she saw
                  the eyes whose light she worshipped grow cold; she heard the voice, so loved, grow
                  strange, and utter bitter, taunting words in reply to fond entreaties, or, worse
                  still, mockingly laugh at her pleadings. He had striven to infuse into her soul
                  the scepticism and dark sinful thoughts that formed his nature; falling his, he
                  left her. Forsaken, yet fond, day after day she watched for his return, arraying
                  herself in the dresses he was wont to admire, twining amid her curls the freshest
                  flowers, thus wearing the semblance of hope and joy, while despair crushed her
                  heart. It was long before she could believe that he whom she had so loved could
                  thus wrong, betray her; but a season came when stern realities forced themselves
                  upon her, dispelling forevermore all day-dreams, and thrusting her into the
                  battle-ground of life. She was about to become a mother; yet the holy name of wife
                  she dared not claim. Who can tell of the terrible awakening? The darkness of the
                  grave gathered round, as she thought of the finger of scorn that would soon point
                  to her disgrace. The river's side was near; anguish and terror had driven the
                  light of reason from her mind; and there, beneath a cloudless sky, in summer's
                  festal month, she had, with a burst of weeping, placed her basket-cradled babe in
                  the silver tide. The water-flags stayed its course, though not its death; it was
                  taken from the winding river, and the mother's doom was sealed.
               Strange reasoning! the plea of insanity was deemed sufficient cause to change the
                  death-penalty to exile. Better far the cold sod resting on that loving heart than
                  severance of all earth's ties. Her crime was known to all; her deep woe, the more than mortal agony, were known but to
                  herself and God, and He is ever merciful. That young heart, with all its weight of
                  sin and penitence, now rests beneath the wave; the gale sings over it an eternal
                  dirge; while he, the wronger, the betrayer, lives amongst England's noble ones,
                  courted and honored. Who can read the ways of the Most High?
            
            
               LOVE AND HOPE.
               A GIRL stood on the pebbly beach, and looked on the summer sea; its blue waves,
                  dotted with foam, played round her feet. As she gazed on that other sky, with its
                  golden and purple clouds, reflected in ocean's waters, fanciful imaginings wove
                  round her their charmed spell. Suddenly, a youth clad in seraphic beauty stood
                  beside her; eyes brilliant as the evening star pierced her soul; his lip was like
                  the scarlet tinted rose; snowy wings, trembling in the evening breeze, casting off
                  sparkling jets of light, hung by his side; his voice was sweet as Israfel's.
                  "Maiden, from my home on Olympus, I saw thy rare purity of face and form; youth
                  has thrown round thee his evergreen; even now thine eyes, beautiful as the wild
                  Merlin's, answer my every glance; thou shalt be mine; we will sip the dews from
                  the flowers of life, bathe in glorious sunlight; when the darkening clouds spread
                  out their skirts, heralding the tempest, we will flee to brighter skies, to sing
                  our jubilate." He clasped her unresisting form to his breast; by that electric
                  touch, warmth and new life sprung in
                  her soul; heaven was brought down to earth; life was half a dream, all poetry; the
                  free zephyrs marvelled at her wondrous loveliness, and, enamored of the crimsoned
                  cheek, kissed it with a lover's freedom. And love set his fiery seal upon her
                  heart; it withered, like a leaf before the breath of the south wind, beneath that
                  burning impress. Yet she clung to him, calling the chains with which he had bound
                  her rainbow links; then, for love is of changeful mood, wailed, wept, and
                  frantically called upon his name—when he would again charm her with the spell of
                  his dazzling beauty, and again bewilder her with dreams, and doubts, and fears. At
                  length came a time when love wearied of his toy; she had been to him ever but a
                  wild flower, blooming by the way-side; her beauty and fragrance had attracted and
                  charmed; for a day, he had enshrined her in his heart, then flung her to the wind
                  to perish. "Nay, dearest," said he, "weep not; I but try a sail on the sunny sea;
                  ere thou canst miss me, I shall return; mourn not." Alas! the girl had learned to
                  doubt his promises; the heavy tears gathered in her eyes, as she bade him
                  farewell. Then arose the storm and the darkness; the booming thunder echoed from
                  the dark rocks, the rain descended in torrents on her unprotected head; there was
                  no shelter near. Overpowered by grief, she flung herself on the wet sand, and gave
                  vent to her despair. As her lamentations mingled with the storm, and her brain
                  seemed rent with agony, she felt a cool hand pressing on her burning brow; Hope,
                  the bright boy, was standing before her, bidding her dry her tears—Love would
                  return anon. "See," said he; "the storm and the darkness are passing away; already
                  the moon's silvery light forms a glittering pathway across the sea, for the return
                  of Love's light bark." Thus did Hope cheer her fainting heart, promising also to
                  remain her companion. Many a weary moment he charmed away with his sportive
                  fancies; oft, too, at the sunset hour, he would wreathe for her hawthorn spray and
                  white lilies, to crown Love on his return. Then he would point to a speck on the
                  distant waters, and tell her it was Love's bark. But at length Hope grew tired of
                  his companion; so one cloudy, dark, stormy day, when most needed, he fled also. 
                     
                        "And only those who know can tell
                        What love is after hope's farewell."
                     
                   When the maiden realized her loneliness, she neither wept nor sighed; the
                  time for tears had gone by; she closed her eyes, and prayed for death. Lo! one
                  approached, a female form, tall and shadowy pale, yet wearing more than mortal
                  beauty on her brow; the mistlike arms were extended embracingly towards her; mournful eyes wore the
                  expression a mother's might wear as she looks on a dearly-loved, long-lost child.
                  The golden curls, streaming on the wind, were cinctured with nightshade blossoms.
                  "My child, I wait for thee; lay thy head on my breast; its coldness will allay thy
                  heart's fever, cool thy burning brain, and give thee peace so profound, impassive,
                  that thou wilt give no thought to the world that has so grieved thee. In my
                  embrace, thou shalt know a repose Love could never have given thee." The girl
                  upraised her tear-stained face, and cast a troubled glance over the sea, striving
                  in vain to see the distant speck towards which Hope had ever pointed. Huge black
                  shadows, like far-off phantoms, alone rested on the wave. The caressing arms of
                  Death received her fainting form. On that cold, quiet breast, the weary one found
                  rest.
            
            
               SKETCH FROM LIFE.
               WHEN I first knew Margaret M——, she was but a petted, lovely child, the darling of
                  her grandparents, to whose protection she had been consigned on the death of her
                  mother. A father's love she had never known—the fiat which had summoned him to the
                  realms of bliss had gone forth before her infant eyes had opened on this world.
                  Yet, though these deepest of all afflictions had thus early fallen on her young
                  spirit, they had saddened and shaded, but not wholly obscured its light. True, she
                  was rarely seen to laugh, but then her smile was so beautiful, so full of
                  truthfulness and love, it almost made one imagine a seraph from on high, in the
                  fulfilment of some heavenly mission, had for a brief space animated her lovely
                  form. At times she was sportive as the mountain roe, and would bound over the
                  hills and through the valleys of her native home, stopping at one cottage to give
                  old Betsy the bouquet of violets gathered in her rambles expressly for her,
                  knowing her fondness for flowers; next at the hut situated by the old
                  chestnut-tree down in the valley, to leave the basket of eggs and fruit, a present to her pretty
                  little namesake, the wood-cutter's daughter; then taking the ruined mill on her
                  way home, an hour would be spent in reading the Bible to poor old John, who had
                  grown so blind that he knew not day from night; then trip home to be ready to
                  place the cushioned stool for grandmamma's feet, and hand grandpa his spectacles.
                  Thus early, both at home and abroad, were her kindnesses and attentions bestowed
                  on the aged and weary. Dearly did I love her, young as I was. Years rolled on, and
                  I departed to a foreign clime, where, amid the turmoils and cares of business,
                  Margaret passed not before my mind's eye; but when the departing sunbeams tinted
                  with gorgeous colors the western sky, and my spirit became infused with the might,
                  the majesty of beauty, or when some of the loveliest conceptions of genius were
                  presented to my sight in forms of rare sculpture or glorious paintings, whose
                  depth of coloring and lifelike tints caused my heart to thrill with rapture, then
                  blest memory restored the past—the "happy, happy hours of childhood" were again
                  enacted over, and Margaret was unforgotten.
               Once more I trod the halls of my fathers; the embraces of relatives, the
                  congratulations of friends scarce over before I hastened to visit my little
                  playmate. She was grown to womanhood; but a fearful change had come over her; the
                  Angel of Death had o'ershadowed her with his dark wing—his herald Consumption, in
                  its loveliest form, had visited her. As I smoothed back from her high marble brow
                  the bright glossy ringlets of auburn hair, and looked into the clear depths of her
                  dark eyes, I murmured at the decree; I cried aloud, in the fulness of my heart's
                  agony, she was too lovely, too pure—oh, my God!—too good to die, too beautiful to
                  lie in the cold dark tomb!
               Day by day I was at her side. Oscar, her brother, was home from West Point, where
                  he had been for about a year; he, and her young sister Josephine, and myself
                  alternately, read to her during the long dreamy hours of August. Terrible was
                  Oscar's grief if one but hinted at the possibility of his sister's death; he clung
                  to her with more than a brother's love; every feeling of his soul seemed centered
                  in that form, wasted almost to transparency; the very thought of laying her in the
                  earth was fraught with madness. Often, at the evening hour, she would recline on a
                  couch, her head pillowed on his breast; Josephine at her feet, seated on a low
                  ottoman, her harp before her, drawing forth low, ravishing notes of melody, till
                  the tears would glisten in the soft eyes of Margaret, and she would bid her repeat
                  again and again the enchanting strain. Hours have so passed, and, as we watched the smile flit
                  over her flushed cheek, Oscar would whisper—"Margaret is better; she will yet be
                  spared to us; Death cannot touch with his serpent fangs a creature so fair." But
                  even while the words were on his lips, she would turn on him her eyes glittering
                  with bright unearthly rays, and shudder with pain: he sickened and lost all hope,
                  for he felt he had indeed been cheating himself with delusive dreams.
               'Twas a tranquil evening in autumn: the sun was rapidly sinking to rest; not a
                  cloud marred the soft light of the sky, not a leaf stirred on the still branches.
                  I had wheeled the couch, from which Margaret now seldom rose, close to the open
                  window; I gazed on her wasted features, and the desolating certainty that we must
                  soon part, for the first time was fully understood by me in all its anguish and
                  misery. The rose I had given her in the morning had fallen from her hair; its
                  leaves were withered, scattered over the floor. I gathered them up and
                  passionately pressed them to my lips. I knelt beside her, and whispered—"Margaret,
                  beloved, you will not leave me? You will not die?"
               A smile of ineffable sweetness passed over her countenance. She extended to me her
                  hand, and replied—"Mourn not, dearest, that I cannot live; my fate has been wisely
                  ordered. I have suffered much and acutely. See the flower you gave me; it was
                  beautiful, yet it is dead. Is it not a type of me? 
                     
                        'Though with fond and gentle care
                        Its bright leaves were shaded,
                        Decay was still there.'
                     
                   And look, dearest; the sun has nearly sunk behind the hill. Pray with me that
                  the light may linger yet a little while to guide me to my home, for I feel I am
                  dying—yet am happy, with your hand clasped in mine—words of love—" Her voice
                  failed. I caught her sinking in my arms; her eyes were closed. Oh, God, was this
                  death? What would I not have given to be able to restore animation to that frail
                  form? Bitter, bitter tears, wrung from the heart, which seldom course over the
                  cheek of manhood, sprang to my eyes. Oh, but for one more glance, one other word!
                  In vain. There she lay, cold and pale, alike unconscious of my misery, and the
                  deep, enduring grief of Oscar and Josephine, who had been summoned by my cries.
                  Soon the aged grandparents, who had so idolized her, aunts and uncles, were all
                  standing round the low couch; and, as the wail of sorrow ascended to the throne of
                  the Most High, the old pastor, who had held Margaret at the baptismal fount,
                  slowly entered the apartment. With faltering steps, he approached the lifeless
                  form; in silence he pressed each
                  trembling hand, then bade them join with him in prayer. Never shall I forget the
                  soul-stirring eloquence of that devout man. With humility and fervor, he besought
                  God that the spirit which had animated the stiffening clay might not depart from
                  its earthly tenement till it had vouchsafed some sign, some token to mourning
                  friends that her faith had been built on the "Rock of Ages." Trusting his prayer
                  to the intercession of His glorious Son, he rose from his knees. A moment scarce
                  elapsed before Margaret opened her eyes: entire consciousness returned; she
                  recognized the good Mr. L——, spoke of her willingness to die, of her faith and
                  trust in Christ's redeeming love, whose arm then sustained her, again bade us all
                  farewell, and her pure spirit took its flight to God.
            
            
               THE LEGEND OF THE BLACK DEATH.
               SPRING was abroad in the valleys and on the mountain-tops; the groves of ice-trees
                  passed away in the warm embrace of the sun; the birch-wood and other forest-trees
                  clothed themselves in tender green; the little streams, again freed, became
                  sparkling crystals singing on their way, while on their banks grew nodding flowers
                  of glittering whiteness, like the snows that still crowned the tall mountains; far
                  above over their heads flew the soft blue clouds, chased by the south wind. The
                  lark sang loud and clear as he soared on tireless wing; the insects brushed their
                  tiny pinions, then somewhat drowsily essayed a flight. Nature seemed fully roused
                  from the torpor of winter; yet a strange stillness rested on all; a shadow
                  darkened hall and cottage, flowing stream, and fragrant wood-flower. 'Twas the
                  silence, the shadow of death. A pestilence, called the "Black Death," had rode on
                  the wind over Norway, staying her steps in the loveliest valleys, kissing, with
                  her foul lips, the fairest and noblest children of the north. Sore dismay may filled their hearts; they cried
                  unto Heaven with a loud voice, that the scourge might depart. Still the evil one
                  lingered; passing from cot to cot, wheresoever she cast her glance, Death, who
                  followed in her train, set his mark. Now it happened that, in a certain valley, on
                  a bright morning in this fair spring-time, a young peasant, of the name of
                  Engstrom, rose from the stupor in which he had long lain, and, opening his eyes,
                  looked around him. On the ground, close by his couch, as though fallen from utter
                  exhaustion while ministering to him, lay the dead body of his mother. The remains
                  of his young sister, her sweet innocent face purpled by the destroyer, was
                  stretched beside her. The fire had burnt out on the hearth; he was fainting for
                  food, so he arose and went forth to search for the living, and to satisfy the
                  cravings of nature. He stood on the door-stone, wondering at the solitude, the
                  stillness. Their trim little garden, that at this season was wont to bear the
                  signs of busy labor, all quiet, deserted; no sound of cheerful horn, calling the
                  cattle together for feeding, greeted his ear, nor merry youthful voices chanting
                  national airs to the hum of the busy wheel; there was but the song of the birds,
                  the ripple of the spring that gushed forth in the shadow of the brown rock, and
                  the beating of his own heart. From cottage to cottage all was the same; all were
                  stiff in death; none were spared.
                     
                        "For the angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,
                        And the eyes of the sleepers wax'd deadly and chill,
                        And their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew still."
                     
                   The companions whom he had seen but a few days before in buoyant health now
                  stark livid corses; so quickly had they been stricken down, there was none left to
                  mourn. Blank despair sat on his brow as he turned from scenes of horror. O! frail
                  are the links that bind us to life, when the chains of affection are broken thus
                  by death; when we see those on whom we have bestowed our all of love and trust
                  lying before us, the same, and yet how changed by a few passing hours, insensible
                  to our grief, unknowing our passionate agony! then the thousand dreams of youth
                  and hope depart forever, and life becomes a weariness, a pain. Engstrom climbed
                  the steep mountain-path; his native land, like a rich flower-garden, spread widely
                  in the distance; he gazed, and the tears flowed from his haggard eyes, for all its
                  beauties could not drive from his memory his once happy home, the tender mother,
                  whose loving care made that home a paradise; sweet sister, loved friends, all were
                  gone; where they once dwelt, now lay those loathliest semblances of humanity that
                  had so affrighted him. A heavy plunge into space would rid him of all misery,
                  reunite him with the lost, for he fully believed he only was living in all the
                  world. At this moment, a low pitiful
                  whine arrested his rash deed; his faithful dog, unnoticed, had followed his
                  footsteps, and now with upraised calm brown eyes seemed to ask, why so little
                  faith? Then, again, he wondered if death had spared but him; and the sweet
                  witchcraft of love whispered, perchance his bride, his betrothed, Marie Steinhart,
                  lived. Hastily he descended the acclivity, determining not to know rest till he
                  had sought for her. Mile after mile his weary feet had trod; evening was drawing
                  nigh; dark and heavy the boughs of the pine forest interlaced above his head; the
                  blast moaned drearily, as if in wrath; huge shapeless shadows gathered round; but
                  he cast his eyes toward heaven, and breathed a prayer for help. Now the light
                  became clearer, for he entered the valley where Marie dwelt—still that appalling
                  silence. The tall fir-trees, dark and gloomy, stirred not a branch; the rapid
                  river rushed on between its high banks without a sound—there was no sign of life.
                  Then, with a mighty cry, Engstrom flung himself on the cold ground to die; sadly
                  his eyes roamed over the darkening landscape; suddenly he started—could it be, or
                  was he dreaming?—surely that was a wreath of smoke curling upwards; some one must
                  be near; he should clasp a living hand, hear words of sympathy from human lips;
                  true, it might be a false lure, but the evening mist rising; still, the faint
                  vague fancy that his first surmise was correct possessed him, so onward with hope
                  for his guiding star. Now he approaches the cottage, breathlessly gazes on the
                  curling columns that slowly mingled with the quiet air, then bounding forward (his
                  dog barking as though he understood his master's feelings), he stood upon the
                  threshold, pushed open the door—behold, upon the hearth, clear and beautifully
                  burned the fire that had been his beacon thither. A young maiden stepped forth. O!
                  joy inexpressible! it was Marie. She, by the inscrutable will of God, was the only
                  living creature in her valley, after the visit of the "Black Death." Their
                  happiness was too intense for words; he could only clasp her again and again to
                  his breast, shedding tears of rapture. The following morning, hand in hand, they
                  entered the chapel, where no priest stood before the high altar, nor clouds of
                  incense perfumed the air. God alone was there, their only witness. Trustingly,
                  confidingly they knelt, asking, as if of a father, that He would bless their
                  union; and the faith, thus humbly plighted in His holy name, He consecrated and
                  watched over. From this loving, devoted pair, descended the noble generations of
                  fair daughters and brave sons that have peopled Norway unto this day.
            
            
               
               SHADOWS.
               
                  
                     "THEY COME LIKE SHADOWS, SO DEPART."
                  
               
               THE dark silent night—and yet I fear it not, but love it; my soul goeth forth with
                  a long mournful wail, into the silent midnight, after companionship. I gaze into
                  space; my heart thrills, for 'tis not alone; some other watcheth, also, the wide
                  solemn heaven; one with whom my soul holds mysterious affinity. Perchance oceans
                  roll between; yet, by the heartthrob, I feel 'tis even thus; and a more cheerful
                  spell, like a healing balsam, falls upon me.
               The holy night! with its gift of thought, restoring gentle hours; the loved, the
                  lost return again. Again, a thrilling voice breathes into mine ear tales of worlds
                  of light, where the tired spirit may find peace. The calm moonlight in a silver
                  flood falls around me. Leaf and tree, and stately walls, are lighted by the moon's
                  cold rays—how solemn she looks, gliding through the deep blue sky; now a cloud,
                  purple-tinged, whispering her, counsels a gayer measure. It may not be; her
                  mission is to give dreams of heaven—to speak of those loved ones who walked awhile
                  on earth, looked on her bright disk, and are now slumbering the sleep that knows
                  no waking. Egypt, in its day of power, she shone on. Calmly, coldly as now, she
                  glided her giant pyramids; young brave hearts looked on her, and dreamt and talked
                  of love. Rome and Carthage looked on her, ere they, too, passed away.
               Away with sleep! I love the varied fantasy that round me press when the day
                  vanisheth. I like the feeling of loneliness which gives unto the soul power to
                  pierce the dim future, to annihilate space, and to traverse on lightning wings the
                  realms of boundless thought. Sparkling, glistening, moaning, lies before me the
                  mighty ocean, bearing on its bosom the lessening sail of the beloved wanderer. I
                  hear the dear familiar tones murmuring my name; but now the wild wind passes, and
                  though 'tis perfumed with the breath of summer, the odor of forest wild-flowers
                  still clinging to its wings, albeit it has a sad note: it speaks of storm and
                  tempest.
               Now, Memory, wave thy wand, that the storm and the darkness may depart! Sweep away
                  the bitter toilsome memories of the day, and give to the night its haunted power!
                  Let me wander in Fancy's fairy realm.
               Lo! I see a little child wandering on the sea beach; he is all alone. How wildly beautiful is the scene.
                  Dark high rocks cast their fantastic shadows far out on the sea, alternating with
                  streams of light on the dancing waves. The boy still loiters, heedlessly gathering
                  sea-shells, and still the waves rise higher and higher on the sands; he seems to
                  have no fear. Ah! now I see, by his azure wings, he is no habitant of earth. It is
                  Love, resting awhile. He ever sports and plays; he opens to the parched, wearied
                  soul, a glimpse of Eden; he promises Paradise—then leaves the stubborn heart, that
                  will not forget, to wither with grief—to discover, too late, his fair promises
                  were but lures that lead to death. Away—away—tempter! I will walk on the wave-worn
                  shore, and the winds of night shall be the only music mine ear heedeth, till the
                  struggling soul breaks the bonds that enthral, and, on soaring pinions, unveils
                  the mystery of Eternity.
            
            
               THE LAMENT OF THE ROSE-BUSH.
               ON the banks of a lovely stream grew a white rose-bush. So loaded was it with
                  blossoms, that its leaves touched the tiny waves that sang and danced so merrily
                  in the early sunbeams. Ah! those were happy hours for the sweet rose-bush. No
                  anticipations of the future darkened her hopes; no cares or sorrows clouded the
                  joyous present.
               As one by one her buds expanded, filling the air around with perfume, feelings of
                  gratified pride animated her bosom. How glorious to her appeared the heavens
                  above, the bright sun, the earth which gave her birth, and her beautiful flower
                  sisters, that grew close to the water's edge—the tall foxglove, its loose purple
                  bells seeming filled with diamonds; Hope's sweet gem, the forget-me-not; and the
                  humble violet, so modestly hid beneath its clustering leaves.
               The western breeze wantoned by; and, after sporting for a while in loving
                  dalliance amid her foliage, bore on his wings a portion of her fragrance to the
                  little cottage, but a stone's throw off. How it gladdened the hearts of its
                  inmates; for it recalled the memory of
                  the past—the promise of their only, their beloved son; he would return to dwell
                  with them when the roses bloomed. How anxiously, tearfully, yet cheered and upheld
                  by hope, had they watched the old rose-bush! and now he would soon be with them;
                  again tread the haunts of his childhood; for the white blossoms hung in the
                  stream. How beautiful was that old bush to them; how graceful her branches; and
                  then how gayly she bowed her head, with its fragrant treasures, down to the very
                  waters. And the stream hushed its singing, to gaze and wonder at her exceeding
                  beauty.
               When their son returned, he accompanied them to admire their favorite; but, alas!
                  already the roses had begun to fall; the ground was strewn with their leaves;
                  their aroma was fast departing. The rose-bush drew together her branches, and
                  sullenly folded them round her fading treasures. Her melancholy moans saddened the
                  hearts of her friends. A shower had fallen, and as she flung from her the
                  glittering drops, mingled with them were her fast-falling tears; while a sweet low
                  voice, seemingly from the centre of the bush, thus spoke: "Why, oh! cruel fate,
                  have you thus despoiled me of my beauty? My blossoms, my sole source of happiness,
                  scattered at my feet; their petals withering, their fragrance fled! Could you not
                  spare to me my loved ones? In what have I offended? Did I not spread my branches
                  to the sun, that the sin of sullenness might not mar their beauty? Have I ever
                  withheld from the toilworn wayfarer my refreshing perfume? Have not all alike been
                  gladdened by my loveliness? Why have you, then, destroyed me? And, as she
                  shuddered, a fresh shower of rose-leaves fell to the ground; and her old friends
                  bowed down their heads and wept.
               A form, as of an angel, stood before them, 
                     
                        ——"With hair of light,
                        And dazzling eyes of glory,"
                     
                   on whose clear brow shone immortality; thus she addressed the mourners:—
               "Know ye not, O sad ones, the laws of nature are irrevocable, and must be obeyed?
                  The blossoms, so dearly loved, must fade and die; but they shall live again. A
                  little while—another season—and the bush will become arrayed in new loveliness.
                  Fresh flowers will put forth from her bosom; again her breath will be precious
                  odor. Murmur not, therefore, loved ones, that the flowers must die, for the
                  benignant Deity, who, during their evanescent existence, lavished upon them the
                  graces you mourn, will anew raise them, in beauty and fragrance, that they may
                  become sweet, although silent messengers of peace and love, from heaven to the dwellers on
                  earth; for this end were they created."
               The angel spread her dewy wings, and passed from their sight; and the rose-bush
                  hung her head; but she sorrowed no more, for she knew the words of the angel were
                  truth.
            
            
               THE GUARDIAN ANGEL.
               A MAIDEN, lovely and youthful, lay on a couch of death; friends stood around, and
                  freely were tears shed and sighs breathed; yet the Conqueror took the worn spirit
                  by the hand, and to the sounds of sweet music, led her up through the starry air
                  to that home of peace prepared from the beginning of the world. She had loved with
                  all the deep and passionate idolatry the heart can know but once; but the light
                  that shone around her proved, in its evanescent splendor, a false meteor, that,
                  when its brightness passed, rendered the darkness more dear and wretched. 
                     
                        "This ever has been woman's fate—to love,
                        To know one summer day of happiness,
                        and then to be most wretched!"
                     
                  
               
               Months passed on, flowers grew over her grave, and birds sang above it; but the
                  gentle spirit of her who slept beneath had received its mission—to watch o'er him
                  loved best on earth: and as a shadow she oft stood revealed in the blue light of
                  morning, or was heard in the moan of
                  the night-wind, when the dew fell heaviest; although to the careless and worldly
                  one the shadow seemed but a passing cloud over the sun's brightness; the moan of
                  the night-wind but the sighing of the breeze among the pines. To him, Mary's
                  dancing step and bird-like voice were forever stilled; if his thoughts followed
                  her at all,it was but to the narrow grave, over which blossomed the early rose.
                  She was already forgotten; yet her sweet guardianship over the loved one, despite
                  the sorrow his cold forgetfulness had caused her, was unceasing. When he mingled
                  with the young and fair, and whispered winning flatteries to not unwilling ears, a
                  low sweet voice, deep in his heart, bade him not crush the wild-flowers of youth,
                  and cause the young eyes to o'errun with tears, by false words. Then the voice
                  borrowed Memory's tone, and recalled the fond trusting heart, now cold in its
                  grass grown bed, mid darkness and decay; and with a shudder he passed by. When, in
                  the festal hall, the wine-cup, mantling with light, was drained again and again,
                  and the crimsoning cheek and flash of the brilliant eye told a sad tale to the
                  fond spirit near, a profiled outline on the wall startled the inebriate, and the
                  sparkling cup was rudely dashed aside. When wandering amid the haunts of vice,
                  fascinated by their false gayety—for misery ever wears a mask—a word, a tone of
                  music, a perfumed air, drove the present from before him, presenting in its stead
                  his early years of innocence and truth; then, by that link of the past, the
                  guardian angel led him from the false and the frail. When, through her gentle
                  ministry, pure thoughts rested within his soul, then Mary's spirit rejoiced, and,
                  with the tenderness of earthly love united to a diviner nature, led him with low
                  and gentle tones away from the revel, first to see unnoted beauties in the silvery
                  moonlight in diamond sparkles dancing on the waters; then in fair earth, changing
                  but ever beautiful, presenting the same variety of charms, whether wrapped in its
                  snowy mantle or arrayed in sunbeams, crowned and wreathed with summer's regalia of
                  flowers. Then upward directing his gaze to that starry sky, where, within its
                  charmed portals, a glad welcome awaited him from those dear ones gone before. Thus
                  ever by his side, restraining his wavering footsteps, warding off the rough gale
                  of misfortune, soothing hours of solitude by sweet thoughts and fancies, softening
                  the hand of sorrow, teaching him not to build his hopes on earth's fragile soil,
                  was her mission mercifully accomplished in the summer sunshine and the winter
                  rain, and ever pointing heavenwards.
            
            
               
               A VISION.
               
                  
                     "I HAD A DREAM, WHICH WAS NOT ALL A DREAM."
                  
               
               I STOOD within the entrance of an ancient temple; Time had passed from his youth
                  since the shrine had been raised, for the roof was gone and half the pillars worn
                  away. The broken columns were twined with wreathing ivy and wild grape, their
                  clusters of topaz-colored fruit hanging in rich profusion over the ruined archway;
                  flocks of doves and wild pigeons, that had built their nests in the eaves, flew to
                  and fro, and, with melancholy cooings, disturbed the lone solitude. Looking afar,
                  I descried a multitude of armed men approaching, presenting an array of waving
                  plumes and streaming banners indescribably brilliant. From their midst there came
                  a man, his face beaming with enthusiasm, lit with the fires of a glorious soul,
                  the personation of a hero; having marshalled his troops, in eloquent accents he
                  bade them strike for the freedom of their hearths. He told them of old histories
                  when Poland was free, ere the furious blast of war had beat down their homes, and
                  darkened their firesides; the ruthless invader, fierce with conquest, had defiled
                  their maidens, and cast them dying by the road-side; the aged sire, scarce cold on
                  the bier, dragged forth to satiate the fury of their bloodhounds; even the smiling
                  innocence of the tender infant was no protection from bitter cruelty; whole towns
                  and villages given to the flames; mortal eyes could not look on such desolation
                  and ruin unmoved. In the very hopelessness of despair, man had risen from his
                  mighty wrongs, and, with pale lips, swore to be revenged or die. My nerves were
                  roused to their utmost tension, in my sympathy for those gallant men;
                  involuntarily, I invoked the spirits of the immortal dead— 
                     
                        "Ye that at Marathon and Leuetra bled,
                        Friends of the world, restore your swords to man,
                        Fight in the sacred cause and lead the van."
                     
                   Suddenly, I saw a cloud of dust rising, I heard the trampling of hoofs.
                  Behold! Wrapped in furs, with banners dripping snow, came Russia's cohorts. I saw
                  the brave chieftain prepare for battle; while afar off, in the clouds, sat Peace,
                  resting her white wings. Sadly she gazed on those warlike preparations and the men
                  who so desecrated her name. In vain, alas! in vain the lofty courage, the high
                  resolve of those devoted patriots; the volleyed thunder, that with deafening crash shook the earth, and mingled with
                  the sweet odor of rose and myrtle that floated on the gale, was the knell of not
                  one, but thousands of brave departing souls; rank after rank fell bleeding to the
                  earth. Soon, the roll of the drum was alone heard, where so short a time before
                  went up to high heaven the shouts of liberty. Poland was dead. Russia had crushed
                  the burning hearts of her sons with the ice of death; she existed no longer on the
                  earth. A little while, and, like a mist, all the well-trained columns of the
                  haughty victors, the heaps of dying and dead, all passed like a wreath of smoke,
                  and deep silence rested on the plain as before.—With quick but noiseless steps, I
                  turned to re-enter the temple. Before I could do so, another mighty army arrested
                  my attention. The young leader, with form tall, powerful as the young pine ere
                  'tis bent by the winter's storm; dark flashing eyes, like the summer's lightning,
                  stood foremost of the throng, shouting his war-cry, in answer to the trumpet's
                  salute of the foe. I prayed that victory might smile on his banners. Peace, too,
                  bent a pitying gaze on the youth. The battalions under his command were composed
                  of warriors from every clime. Those arrayed against them, with snowy plumes, their
                  spear heads glittering in the sun, were led by one who wore a mitre, and carried
                  in his hand the sceptre of the church, for lovely Italie was the plain again to
                  become a battlefield. Now the din of war pealed on the air; the crash of steel,
                  the rush of the deadly ball; hand to hand, foot to foot, was the attack,
                  overpowering, terrible as the winged hurricane. Soon the crimson banners were
                  borne headlong to the earth; trampled and torn, they pillowed the heads of the
                  dying, and drank up their ebbing lifeblood. Victory seemed on the side of the
                  young captain, when, behold! the soldiers of France, republican France, poured
                  into the plain, and, uniting their forces against that now little band, completed
                  their rout. The fight was ended; the mitred ruler extended the sceptre of the
                  church anew over Italia's vine-clad land, and again freedom slumbered.—Once more,
                  I saw a motley crew contending for the possession of a painted bedizened female
                  they called Liberty. As party after party rushing into the mêlée, shouting wildly, the gay lady would coquettishly cast aside
                  her veil, so as to display to the admiring crowd her gem-encircled brow and
                  radiant eyes, which smiled approval. The smiles were showered on all; each panting
                  soldier thought the beaming glance was for him. Then I saw the crown she wore was
                  of false brilliants, false as her smiles, and I knew her as the arch-fiend called
                  Misrule, who had assumed the garb and seeming of Liberty; she but mocked and led
                  those wild spirits to destruction.
                  Again was the desperate strife renewed, again the lovely plain became a slaughter
                  pit. Soon came a single horseman, unattended. Fearlessly he rode amid those armed
                  reckless men; with the fierce courage of a dauntless soul, the power of
                  indomitable will alone, he constrained those vacillating spirits; with eyes stern
                  with resolve, he beat down their banners, and taking to his bosom the
                  purple-vestured female, became at once ruler and dictator. The throne of the
                  Bourbons was trampled beneath the feet of the spoiler; and France, poor
                  France—with her brain of fire, heart of fear, her ardent enthusiasm and noble
                  feelings, was constrained to pay the bitter penalty of want of unity in her
                  leaders and the frivolity of her people. To my wondering inquiries for an
                  explanation of these strange sights, Peace, with her lute-like voice, replied,
                  "You have witnessed a phantasm of the past, sometimes vouchsafed to mortal sight
                  to teach mankind a lesson. The soul, the godlike principle within, still
                  remembering Eden, with its scented gales, pants for the freshness and the beauty
                  freedom's blessed influence alone can confer; Liberty, that shall go forth to
                  earth's dark places, releasing the captive, and distributing with liberal hand
                  food and clothing to the homeless beggar; Freedom, that with mighty hand shall
                  dash the king from his throne, and shiver to atoms his broken sceptre; these have
                  been the thoughts all powerful, that have caused man, again and again, to burst
                  the iron chain of tyranny, and, casting care and sorrow to the winds, have
                  striven, aye, through oceans of blood, to attain that glorious boon. But not yet
                  is the hour; man must rise higher in his intellectual nature, before the dark
                  films of earth can pass away, and the bright sunbeam of truth reveal the utter
                  worthlessness of rank and distinction. On that holy morn, when republicanism shall
                  dawn on the world; when blind, deluded man, freed from the shackles of error,
                  shall look on his fellow-man as brother, war and oppression shall flee away; the
                  fragrant incense of love and charity shall ascend as a perfume to heaven; just and
                  equal laws, preventing oppression, dispensing freely to all nations fair and
                  beautiful gifts, their motto Liberty, shall extend, with charmed influence, from
                  the frozen climes of the north to the burning sands of Africa, and all the sons of
                  humanity shall awake. 
                     
                        "Soon, soon shall the thrones that blot the world,
                        Like the Orleans, into the dust be hurled,
                        And the word roll on like a hurricane's breath,
                        Till the farthest slave hears what it saith,
                        Arise, arise, be free."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               THE TWIN SOULS.
               THERE was music in heaven, as two white-winged spirits left the throne; and,
                  tarrying not for the faint star-rays to fade in the crimson light that heralded
                  the day-god, floated adown the golden flood, towards that world an atoning love
                  had redeemed from sin. There was joy and gladness on the earth in two darkened
                  chambers, where the rose-colored curtains were closely drawn. Softly on the single
                  ray of sunlight, streaming obliquely through the crack in the shutters, entered
                  the pure, snow-white spirits, and nestled within the hearts of the two infant
                  cherubs, holy and innocent as doves, that lay sleeping within their little cots.
                  There they lay, sweetly smiling; for, though weary leagues separated them in their
                  earthly homes, the same love-memories lingered with both, and the remembrance of
                  Eden's bowers, and its entrancing harmonies, radiated amid the dimples on their
                  cheeks. The one, a fair girl, lived on beneath a gentle mother's guardianship,
                  nurtured in kindliness and love, till her soul became an echo, answering to all in
                  nature that was pure and lovely. Yet, though she shook off the soil and the stain
                  which clings to earth's pleasures, she still was uncontent—she sorrowed for her
                  twin companion—for that young, bright-winged spirit, who, in that far-off time,
                  had mingled with her in blest communion. Their homes were far apart, and years
                  passed on, and only in dreams did they glide to each other's embrace; but, then,
                  with the soul's intelligence, they met; hand clasping hand, cheek pressed to
                  cheek, they felt the bliss of loving—they quaffed the cup of immortality. Then,
                  again, with unfolded wings, they together traversed the universe, till humanity's
                  wants dissolved the vision, and they arose, trembling—not with fear, but with
                  sorrow—that the dream had fled. And it came to pass, that, on the evening of a day
                  of unusual disquiet, the young girl met the idol of her dreams. It was at a gay
                  revel, where mirth and laughter held their merry sway; but, despite the levity
                  which reigned around, the maiden felt the presence of the loved one hallowed the
                  hall; fain would her heart have bounded forth to rest at his feet, to bask in the
                  divine light of that wildering smile. She cared not that in the world's seeming
                  they met but as strangers; she knew the haze of mortality alone prevented soul
                  meeting soul in a clasping embrace. A mysterious sense of happiness pervaded her
                  being, revealing itself in playful
                  blushes, as she strove, by various graces, to awaken his remembrances; but, alas!
                  he had too much mingled with the world; and its gross contact, sin-defiled, had
                  brushed the purity from the spirit's pinions; and, though he gazed with tenderness
                  on the lovely girl, whose hand he clasped, he felt not that mystic assurance of
                  recognition, which the girl, with woman's subtler instincts, felt in all its
                  exquisite rapture. He looked on her, and passed by; whilst she, for long, long
                  months, lived but on the thought of that night; in fond worship she hoped and
                  waited for him whom she had enshrined within her heart, musing on the proud smile,
                  recalling the treasured words, and again thrilling at the memory of that lingering
                  touch. Sad perversity of woman's heart; thus loving and trusting him who had
                  already forgotten her very existence. The maiden had been long betrothed to one
                  till now she deemed she loved; too late had the heart revealed itself; she prayed
                  him who had her troth-plight to forgive the wrong she had unwittingly done him;
                  the bond that united them was rent. In that fatal hour, when she met that
                  soul-fraught glance, her fate was sealed; and her warm heart, with all its fresh
                  affections, restlessly waited for him who recked not of the rich offering woman's
                  faith and love proffered. Years passed on, and the maiden dwelt alone; all her
                  kindred were departed or dead. A profound vehement passion still impelled her to
                  weary heaven with prayers for him whom her spirit still clung to;—time had
                  silvered the raven curls, paled the rose on her cheek, and subdued the lightsome
                  step, whose every pace was grace. Still, in visions, she saw that far-off world of
                  light, and the angel soul that could alone make life lovely. Hope, the enchanter,
                  still spread his illusive scenes before her eyes, dazzling her with his phantasms.
                  In the rich twilight of a summer's eve, the maiden was summoned to soothe a soul
                  about to exchange the agony of life for the bliss of Paradise. Sorrowing, the
                  maiden knelt-by the wretched couch, on which reposed the wan, faded form, of him
                  to whom, in the spring-time of youth, she had consecrated her affections, and the
                  soul, on the eve of departure, assoiled of its sins, recognized its twin. With a
                  glad cry the maiden flung herself in the arms outstretched to embrace her. She
                  forgot the long years that had intervened; she forgot the rags and misery that now
                  surrounded him, remembering only that starry night before the throne, in the
                  far-off time; and, like a tired child, nestled within the arms that so lovingly
                  enfolded her. Not a question was asked or answered; but, as he pressed her closer
                  to his breast, he whispered, "I am forgiven, beloved, if thou, in thy purity,
                  shrink'st not from my embrace!
                  Redeeming love will provide a home in eternity." And Peace, inspired by Faith,
                  crept into the maiden's soul, for she felt a spirit, once so pure, 
                     
                        "Is always pure, ev'n while it errs;
                        As sunshine broken in the rill,
                        Though turned aside, is sunshine still:"
                     
                   and, as she bowed in prayer, the soul passed to God!
            
            
               SIN AND DEATH.
               A MORNING in spring; all nature seemed to shout for joy; the very air breathed
                  incense; the east was gorgeous with rose-hued clouds, heralding the god of day. In
                  an embowered shade, half grotto, half cot, knelt a young female; her hands meekly
                  clasped on her snowy bosom, her dark eyes upraised, eloquently repeated the prayer
                  her lips murmured. It was Adah, the beautiful, offering her thanksgiving to the
                  Eternal; and as she prayed, her child, her first-born, crept to her feet, and
                  holding up his tiny hands, lisped, "Keep us from evil."
               Her orison ended, she rose, spread the morning's frugal meal, arrayed her boy, and
                  again looked forth most anxiously for Cain. Not long she waited, ere her heart
                  thrilled at his well-known step; joyously she sprang forward to greet him; but he
                  thrust her back; a sullen frown sat upon his brow.
               "Cain—my beloved Cain, what has angered thee again? Surely an evil spirit counsels
                  thee; I know thee not in this guise."
               "Go to, Adah. I am sick at heart, wearied of this incessant toil; for 'tis naught else; but go,
                  Adah—your household duties claim your attention; nay—I meant not to be harsh."
               "But, Cain—our morning meal—will you not eat?"
               "Yes—yes—I had forgotten;" and, seating himself, he raised the little Enoch to his
                  knee, and gave him to eat of the fruits Adah had placed before them.
               Adah seeing him thus occupied, left him with the child, fondly trusting the
                  innocent gayety of the boy would recall the smiles to his father's face: alas! her
                  hope was vain; evil thoughts had so gained the mastery, that love, which is indeed
                  light from heaven, "a spark of that immortal fire with angels shared," —could gain
                  no entrance to his breast. Again he went forth, and the shades of evening had
                  gathered over the earth ere he bent his steps homeward. Adah sat within her door;
                  tearfully she mused on the days when Cain was gentle and loving; when, hand in
                  hand, they had been wont to offer sacrifice and prayer to Jehovah! Now, how
                  changed; silent, careworn, he gave no thought to God-scarce words to her. She
                  could not comprehend the meaning of the change she mourned. Hark! she hears his
                  footsteps.
               "Ah, Cain, where hast thou tarried? I have waited long thy coming; that eternal
                  frown still upon thy brow? cannot my fond endearments chase the cloud away? Look,
                  then, upon our sleeping boy;" and she drew back the gauze curtain that covered his
                  couch. "See how lovely! his cheeks are dimpled with health; doth not his innocence
                  and love cheer thee? Kiss him, and pray he may be ever preserved from guile and
                  sin. See, he smiles in his sleep."
               "Smiles; ay, doubtless, he dreameth of paradise, my poor, wronged, disinherited
                  boy!"
               Nay, Cain—nay, speak not thus; tear such murmurs from thy heart. Our home surely
                  can be to thee paradise, if thou wilt. Have we not our affection for each other,
                  that must survive all afflictions? And, then, our darling boy and our Eve? our
                  sweet sister, too? Surely, Cain, we have much to be thankful for. I cannot think
                  you mean all the impious words you utter. But we have talked the night away. I
                  must not forget the message I have been charged with. Our brother Abel bade me
                  say, that, in thy absence, he has built two altars, that, together, ye may offer
                  sacrifice. Doubtless even now he waits for thee."
               "I have none to offer; let him go alone."
               "Nay, beloved, a gentle and a contrite heart, with earth's fairest fruits, are fittest offerings
                  to God."
               "And why should I be gentle? why good and grateful? I have toiled in the sun, day
                  after day; for what? Merely bread; grovelled in the dust, to expiate my father's
                  sin; but Abel approaches."
               "Good-morrow, brother; God be with you; Adah, sweet sister, hail! Come, Cain, let
                  us forth to sacrifice; see, Adah has gone with her young charge to inhale the
                  fragrance of the early morn; let us go, also."
               "I pray thee, Abel, leave me, and sacrifice alone; God loves thee."
               "And thou, also, art the child of His guardian care."
               "But, Abel, thee He loves most; and 'tis fittest, for thou obeyest Him in all
                  things."
               "This is very wrong, brother; thou art the elder. Why, then, this reluctance to
                  take thy due precedence in our priesthood?"
               "Abel, I have resolved to pray no more."
               "I entreat thee, do; it will calm thy mind."
               "Nothing can calm me now. So leave me; being determined, I but stay thy pious
                  purpose."
               Cain, I will not be gainsaid; for my sake be prevailed on; choose which altar thou
                  fanciest most, and prepare thine offering."
               "My offering, if it needs must be so, sorely against my will, cannot be of much
                  account; show me thine."
               "Here they are—a shepherd's lowly offering—the firstlings of my flock."
               "Well, I till the ground, and will give what it hath given to me. These fruits I
                  place upon what seemeth to me but turf and stone; and, as I do understand but
                  little of these things, be thou the first to lead the way."
               Then Abel kindled a flame upon his altar, and kneeling besought God to accept his
                  humble offering—nothing in itself, but as the thanksgiving of him who bowed his
                  face before the Giver of all good. And the flame burned with a steady, pure, and
                  bright light, and ascended unto heaven. But Cain, standing erect, shouted forth
                  his impious ravings, insulting the Most High; and a whirlwind overthrew him, and
                  his altar, scattering the fruits over the ground. Abel—in sorrow, in
                  consternation—entreated him to pray for forgiveness; but the evil spirit was still
                  dominant; his anger rose; he attempted to upturn his brother's altar. In vain Abel
                  opposed, and strove to moderate his rage.
               "Stay, brother; my altar shall be thine, if thou art desirous of offering again,
                  in penitence, and with humbler heart."
               
               "Give way, Abel-give way."
               "Thou affrightest me, my brother; what meanest thou?"
               "Stand back from my path! Dost thou not understand plain words? Thy God loves
                  blood! Keep off, or he'll have more!"
               "In His name I stand before thee, and prevent this great sin."
               "For the last time I bid thee stand back—else" —But Abel still resolutely
                  maintained his position; Cain, frantic with rage, snatched a burning brand, and
                  felled him to the earth! Wearily, painfully, the pale eyes opened, gazed around,
                  then closed forever!
               
                  Death had entered the world!
               
               As Cain sat in helpless dismay, looking alternately on Abel, and the blood-stained
                  brand that had given him to that cold embrace, Adah, accompanied by Eve, Zillah,
                  and Adam, came towards him. They had heard voices in contention, and had come to
                  learn the cause. Zillah sprang forward, and, wildly clasping the form of Abel,
                  screamed with affright, "Abel! brother! husband! what means this? Why dost thou
                  not answer me! What means this stony lifelessness? O God, this blood!
                  Cain—Cain—speak to me! Who has done this thing? Was it some prowling beast, become
                  evil, since our expulsion from Eden? O! why didst thou not protect him from this
                  violence, and save me from this despair? My sister Adah, come hither; father,
                  thou, too, look on thy second born, and see the bitter fruits of Eve's
                  transgression!" and with a burst of anguish, frightful in its intensity, she threw
                  herself on the lifeless body of her husband.
               Sadly Adah strove to draw her away; for she saw in the sorrowful countenance of
                  Adam, and in the indignant glance of Eve, their knowledge of the guilt of
                  Cain.
               "Come, Zillah, my daughter," said Eve, "let us away till he is gone. His presence
                  causes my breast to ache with horror. This bosom, that nourished thy helpless
                  infancy, gave sustenance also to thy brother's murderer! Come, dear child; we will
                  return anon. O death! death! 'twas I that sinned! Take my life for his; for I am
                  maddened by this dreadful doom. Hence, fratricide! Thou hast brought sorrow and
                  desolation on our happy home! My life will henceforth be a living death; for thou
                  hast slain thy brother; and my sin has raised the evil thought within thy soul
                  that hath worked us all this woe! Canst ever sleep again, and not see before thee
                  thy brother's bleeding corse? will earth e'er seem fair again, stained as it is
                  with gentle Abel's blood? Away from my sight!
                  
                     
                        'May the grass wither from thy feet! the woods
                        Deny thee shelter! earth a home! the dust
                        A grave! the sun his light! and heaven her God!'"
                     
                  
               
               "Mother! mother! curse him not. He is my betrothed; and still thy son. O! make not
                  life burdensome to him by thy heavy curse; and thou, my father, wilt not add more
                  bitterness to our already o'erflowing cup. See Zillah, our gentle sister, though
                  distraught with grief, mourning the loss of him she dearly loved, yet speaks to us
                  in kindness."
               "No, Adah, I will not add my curse; the remorse that now consumes that proud
                  spirit will prove his deepest punishment. Eve spoke hastily, in the first grief
                  and horror of the dread moment, when she saw the doom foretold in Eden
                  fulfilled—that doom which numbed her heart e'en on the day pronounced, while still
                  the flavor of that delicious fruit, which grew so near and temptingly to our loved
                  home, still clung around her mouth. Go comfort Cain, thy husband; he needs thy
                  soothing words;" and as he spake, he followed Eve, as she led towards their
                  dwelling the grief-stricken Zillah. But Adah returned to the side of Cain; and as
                  she cast her arms round him, stooping to kiss his brow, a voice broke the
                  silence:—
               "Cain! Cain! where is thy brother Abel?"
               With trembling fear, Adah stretched her hands over the proud head, raised so
                  defiantly, as though to protect it; for she felt it was the voice of the Lord, and
                  she knew He spoke in anger. But Cain threw off the protecting arms that would have
                  shielded him from that just wrath, as he replied,
               "Am I my brother's keeper?"
               "Nay, Cain, beloved; listen to me; thou knowest thou hast sinned. Pray, and thou
                  shalt be forgiven, even for this thou hast done. Thou art too stern; bend thy knee
                  in penitence. And thou, O! God, be merciful. He is not ever thus, but kind and
                  loving; ay, and loved his brother well as I did. If there must be punishment, for
                  what I know he bitterly laments, let the suffering fall on my head; let me redeem
                  him, my lover husband, from the consequences of this most foul crime. Listen not
                  to his ravings; 'tis but sorrow prompts them. Hearken: even now he calls on Abel
                  from the dust—to yon poor lifeless clay—to say how he did love him."
               "Adah, the doom thy husband has incurred, must fall upon his guilty head alone;
                  thou canst not save him; he has shed his brother's blood; and thus I curse him
                  from the earth, which he shall till, and to his labor she shall not yield her
                  strength; 'a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be all thy days.'" But Adah cried
                  again for mercy. "O! spare him! This punishment is greater than he can bear;
                     for, behold, if thou drivest him
                  away under this heavy ban, it shall come to pass that whoso findeth him shall slay
                  him."
               "Not so; I will set a mark upon his brow, that he may go forth in safety, and on
                  whosoever slayeth him, I will take sevenfold vengeance."
               And behold! God set a mark upon his brow, which burned into his brain like living
                  coals. Then Cain rushed out with a bitter cry; but Adah followed, and restrained
                  his flying steps, still counselling repentance.
               "Turn aside, Cain, a little while, till I bring our boy; and then, together, we
                  will bid farewell to home, and seek another dwelling-place." Though the wilful
                  heart still rebelled, yet he gave heed to her words, tarrying by the road-side
                  until she brought her boy unto him. Then, in sorrowing sadness, they turned their
                  backs forever on Eden.
            
            
               MEMORY AND HOPE.
               A WOMAN sat beneath a wide-spreading tree; she leant her head on her hands; bitter
                  tears coursed down her pale cheeks; she had bid farewell to one she loved beyond
                  all the treasures of earth, and who had betrayed her trust. Memory was busy with
                  the past; thought succeeded thought, each more tumultuous than the other, like
                  ocean's billows driven by the raging tempest. Now she was again a child, sporting
                  on a wide plain, chasing the golden butterflies as they rested—now on the broad
                  leaf of the tintless lily—now, again, on the wing, brushing in their flight the
                  dew from the richly-scented clover. Then she knew of life but its infantile
                  joys—now came back the school-girl's days, the long hours of study, in the little
                  close room, when she had so longed to be out in the green fields, among the
                  haymakers, instead of listening to the long prosy discourse of Master Walter. Anon
                  came visions, pure as snowflakes, deepening to love's own hue, as in their early
                  glory and brightness they floated on. Oh! she was happy then; life seemed fair as a summer's dream,
                  how the recollection of those happy hours tortured her. He, the loved one, was
                  then faithful—true as the ideal her fancy had created. Now, like Noah's weary
                  dove, drooping and travel-worn, her soul could find no resting-place. All was one
                  dark, dreary solitude. The cool breeze fanned her burning temples; but she saw not
                  that day had passed away; that night had closed round her with its infinity of
                  stars, gazing so coldly, so unpityingly, on the bitter tears which stained her
                  youthful cheek. She knew naught but her love and her despair.
               "O! give to me," she cried, "to drink of Lethe's stream, that the remembrance of
                  past pleasure and present pain may alike fade away. I care not to recall one hour
                  of my life; the past and the future are the same. Let me live only in the present;
                  not one hour of brightness has shone upon me; but, drop by drop has distilled the
                  poisonous Upas—disappointment—which has soon o'erclouded all the sunshine. Not a
                  flower has bloomed on my path, but on its crimson leaves have I discerned the
                  trailing of the serpent. Pass away—pass away—for your memories burn like drops of
                  fire into my heart."
               Lower sank the bowed head, and the tear-drops fell splashing to the earth, to be
                  borne thence, on the wings of zephyrs, to the Recording Angel, to bear witness
                  against that recreant one, and bar his entrance to the halls of light. She felt a
                  hand pressing her shoulder; and, looking up, she saw standing beside her a form
                  like an angel. Mistlike raiment floated round; the radiant brow was encircled with
                  a wreath of snowy blossoms, that glistened like moonlight; the eye, so full of
                  light and love, reanimated her drooping soul.
               "Maiden, I am called HOPE; and though born in heaven, I dwell with the daughters
                  of earth. My mission is now to thee. Bestir thyself; gird on the armor of courage;
                  let not thy heart faint thus! what though the fading light of day has already
                  disappeared beyond those western hills! will not the morrow's sun again disperse
                  the clouds of darkness and shed the rosy light over all the earth? So shall it be
                  with thee. Cast aside this fantasy which has obscured thy reason, and live for
                  what is nobler, better—for the good of thy suffering sisters. In acts of kindness
                  and benevolence thou wilt find peace. I will send to thee my twin sister, FAITH.
                  She will instruct thee, with her voice of more than mortal sweetness, to rest thy
                  heart in heaven. There only can its harmonies be restored, and the clouds of
                  sorrow pass from thy soul, which is now benumbed—palsied—by earthly passion."
               
               As the maiden listened to those gentle accents, she felt the shadows departing
                  from her soul. HOPE'S inspiring promises gave her new life; and, with a smile
                  almost like those of other days, she gave her hand to her heavenly visitant, to
                  lead her to FAITH!
            
            
               THE MAGDALEN.
               IN a gorgeously beautiful room, the floor inlaid with Italian marble, the walls
                  covered with rich folds of drapery, telling many a tale of ancient lore in their
                  inwrought gold and colored silks, the air heavy with perfume, knelt a young
                  female. There were crimson velvet cushions, piled one upon another, near; yet she
                  recked not of their soft voluptuousness. Crouched low on the cold hard stones, her
                  unclosed eye, beautiful as a star, was filled with nameless dread; the moonlight
                  shone on her bare forehead, from which in agony she had flung back the masses of
                  raven hair, scattering the diamonds, with which it had been braided, over the
                  floor. The myrtle and olive grew close beside the casement, through which swept
                  the music tones and gay converse of the festival; yet she heard them not. From
                  bland whispers and flattery, from the sparkling wine-cup and courtly throng, with
                  a feverish, restless soul, craving peace, Mary had sought her stately room. Her
                  heart was indeed sick unto death; in a
                  passionate burst of tears, she vented her deep wretchedness. It was not a
                  momentary grief; no, all the sweet promises of life had fled; listless, she felt
                  no longer interest in the richness and splendor which surrounded her; painful
                  memories had driven love and hope afar. A quick step, a movement near, roused her;
                  a man in the first prime of manhood stood beside her; his arms encircled her
                  waist, his thick clustering curls of golden hair mingled with her own dark braids;
                  in tones sweeter than harp or lute, he breathed words of impassioned tenderness in
                  her ear; the changing light that sparkled in her eye, the faint rose color that
                  wandered over her cheek, showed she was not unmoved; yet, as the passing flush
                  faded, as though she hated herself for the excess of happiness his presence
                  caused, a look of contempt and scorn gathered round the perfectly beautiful mouth;
                  she withdrew from his embrace, clasped her white hands across her heart, as if to
                  stay its bursting throbs, and hurriedly paced the room. "Think not this is
                  frenzy," she said, "though during the last hour my brain, racked with suffering,
                  has seemed as if one pain more would have turned it to madness indeed," and her
                  face became rigid, deathlike, as if from desperateness of pain. Again she spoke:
                  "The stars that now shine calm and bright in yonder blue, had not yet risen when
                  there passed beneath my window the Prophet, Him whom they call Jesus. Attracted by
                  curiosity, I leaned forth to look on the vast multitude that ever follow Him. At
                  that moment, the crowd became so dense that He paused, and raising His eyes, their
                  glance met mine; I heard him say, in a clear, distinct voice, "Though thy sins be
                  as scarlet, they shall become white as snow." Instant it seemed as though there
                  had been a plague spot within my soul, which that look had cleansed away.
                  Wondrously beautiful He was. I could have prostrated myself at His feet for one
                  word of blessing, of forgiveness, but the innate pride of my nature, and fear of
                  the rabble restrained me, till He passed from my sight; then the stars appeared to
                  fade, the lifeblood forsook my heart, my brain was tortured with terror of I know
                  not what—ay, call it fantasy—I know not what it is, I only know from that hour my
                  wasted life has risen in dark array before me, days spent in idleness, in folly; a
                  thousand fanciful things linking themselves in my imagination, my countless wealth
                  spent in such worthless gauds as these," and she spurned with her foot the costly
                  jewels that had bound her dark hair. Calm, stern, and cold, she continued: "Call
                  you that wild feeling, love, which I have lavished on thee? rather call it a
                  blight, that would have festered and consumed thy soul's purity. Seest thou yon
                     dark cloud, like a pall, rising over
                  the moon? So would my love have darkened thy life, for it has ever been but 
                     'A mingled rush of smoke and flame.'
                  
               
               "Nay, if thou wilt cling to me—as a bird who has escaped from the snare of the
                  fowler—accompany me to that Holy Teacher; hand in hand, we will kneel, confess our
                  sins, and pray forgiveness. Oh! I entreat thee, come—see, I have prepared spices
                  and precious oil as gift offerings." He whom she loved smiled derisively at her
                  words; the affection she had vowed to him seemed very pleasant; the life they had
                  led, one of light and beauty; he, at least, desired no other. True, crowds
                  gathered round Him whom she named, but they were principally the poor and lowly;
                  and that she, who had been worshipped as a queen, alike haughty and beautiful,
                  reckless of sorrow, sin, or shame; the woman who bowed only to pleasure, should
                  weep tears of bitterness at the feet of the humble, despised Nazarene—it was
                  indeed madness, a momentary frenzy. With this thought, he drew the lovely head to
                  his breast, whispering consoling, soothing words, in fondest terms of endearment,
                  thus trying to allay her feverish fears, her superstitious terrors, as he deemed
                  them. Now rose on the stillness of the midnight hour the shouts, the loud songs of
                  the multitude; as if the words were a potent spell to draw her throne, she
                  startled from his arms. "Farewell, we shall never meet again." One parting look of
                  sadness, and she was gone. Threading the almost deserted streets of the hot, dusty
                  city, heeding not the words of mockery that pursued her flying steps, guided alone
                  by those notes of rejoicing that in a thousand echoes floated before her, she at
                  length came to the spot where Jesus, surrounded on all sides by the people, was
                  unable to proceed further. Forcing her way through the midst, she humbly knelt at
                  his feet; the broidered velvet robe she wore swept the ground; the moonlight in a
                  rich flood poured over the once proud head, now bowed lowly in the dust. "Woman,
                  what would ye?" Her only reply was a gasping sob, as she caught the hem of His
                  garment with her cold, trembling hands, and pressed it wildly to her lips. Just
                  then a door near by was opened, and Jesus entered to rest awhile; the crowd
                  pressed in till the little dark room could hold no more. Mary sat at His feet,
                  embracing and kissing them; taking from her bosom the box of precious ointment she
                  had provided, she anointed them with it, wiping off the soil and stain of the
                  highway with the long glossy braids of her beautiful hair; tears filled her bright
                  eyes; thence falling to His feet, assisted her loving, self-appointed task. Her
                  cheek was pale as the lily-bell; the flush of earthly thought could never more win it from its hopes of heaven.
                  A smile of rapture lighted the now tranquil features, for the hour of dread and
                  danger was past. Like sudden sunshine breaking from the bosom of a dark
                  storm-cloud, had peace entered her soul; tears of penitence had washed away her
                  sin. That voice, that in her hour of pride she had heard calling the "weary and
                  heavy laden, promising unto them rest," had pronounced her pardon, accepted her
                  humble offering, and she rested her head on his feet like a tired and weary
                  child.
               THE END.

               NOTICES AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMPREHENSIVE COMMENTARY.
               The Publishers select the following from the testimonials they have received as to
                  the value of the work: We, the subscribers, having examined the
                     Comprehensive Commentary, issued from the press of Messrs. L.,
                  G. & Co., and highly approving its character, would cheerfully and confidently
                  recommend it as containing more matter and more advantages than any other with
                  which we are acquainted; and considering the expense incurred, and the excellent
                  manner of its mechanical execution, we believe it to be one of the
                     cheapest works ever issued from the press. We hope the publishers
                  will be sustained by a liberal patronage, in their expensive and useful
                  undertaking. We should be pleased to learn that every family in the United States
                  had procured a copy.

                     large number of very valuable philological and critical notes, selected from
                     various authors. The work appears to be executed with judgement, fidelity, and
                     care; and will furnish a rich treasure of scriptural knowledge to the Biblical
                     student, and to the teachers of Sabbath-Schools and Bible Classes.

               In one super-royal volume. DESIGNED TO ACCOMPANY THE FAMILY BIBLE,
                  OR HENRY'S, SCOTT'S, CLARKE'S, GILL'S, OR OTHER COMMENTARIES: CONTAINING
               1. A new, full, and complete Concordance; Illustrated with monumental,
                  traditional, and oriental engraving, founded on Butterworth's, with Cruden's
                  definitions; forming, it is believed, on many accounts, a more valuable work than
                  either Butterworth, Cruden, or any other similar book in the language. The value
                  of a Concordance is now generally understood; and those who have used one,
                  consider it indispensable in connection with the Bible.
               2. A Guide to the Reading and Study of the Bible; being Carpenter's valuable
                  Biblical Companion, lately published in London, containing a complete history of
                  the Bible, and forming a most excellent introduction to its study. It embraces the
                  evidence of Christianity, Jewish antiquities, manners, customs, arts, natural
                  history, &c., of the Bible, with notes and engravings added.
               3.Complete Biographies of Henry, by Williams, Scott, by his son; Doddridge, by
                  Orton; with sketches of the lives and characters, and notices of the works, of the
                  written on the Scripture who are quoted in the Commentary, living dead, American
                  and foreign. This part of the volume not only affords a large quality of
                  interesting and useful reading for pious families, but will also be a source of
                  gratification of all those who are in the habit of consulting the Commentary;
                  every one naturally feeling a desire to know some particulars of the lives and
                  characters of those whose opinions he seeks. Appended to this part, will be a
                  BIBLIOTHECA BIBLICA, or list of the best works on the Bible, of all kinds,
                  arranged under their appropriate heads.
               4. A complete Index of the Matter contained in the Bible Text.
               5. A Symbolic Dictionary. A very comprehensive and valuable Dictionary of
                  Scripture Symbols, (occupying about fifty-six closely printed pages.)

                  Lancaster, Hutcheson, &c.
               6. The Work contains several other Articles, Indexes, Tables, &c. &c., and
                  is, 
               7. Illustrated by a large Plan of Jerusalem, identifying, as far as tradition,
                  &c., go, the original sites, drawn on the spot by F. Catherwood, of London,
                  architect. Also, two steel engravings of portraits of seven foreign and eight
                  American theological writers, and numerous wood engravings.
               The whole forms a desirable and necessary fund of instruction for the use not only
                  of clergymen and Sabbath-school teachers, but also for families. When the great
                  amount of matter it must contain is considered, it will be deemed exceedingly
                  cheap.
               
                  "I have examined 'The Companion to the Bible,' and have been surprised to find
                     so much information introduced into a volume of so moderate a size. It contains
                     a library of sacred knowledge and criticism. It will be useful to ministers who
                     own large libraries, and cannot fail to be an invaluable help to every reader
                     of the Bible."

               ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES,
               In one super-royal volume. DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM THE MANNERS, CUSTOMS,
                  ANTIQUITIES, TRADITIONS, AND FORMS OF SPEECH, RITES, CLIMATE, WORKS OF ART, AND
                  LITERATURE OF THE EASTERN NATIONS: EMBODYING ALL THAT IS VALUABLE IN THE WORKS OF
                  ROBERTS, HARMER, BURDER, PAXTON, CHANDLER, And the most celebrated oriental
                  travellers. Embracing the subject of the Fulfillment of Prophecy, as exhibited by
                  Keith and others; with descriptions of the present state of countries and places
                  mentioned in the Sacred Writings. ILLUSTRATED BY NUMEROUS LANDSCAPE ENGRAVINGS,
                  FROM SKETCHES TAKEN ON THE SPOT. Edited by Rev. GEORGE BUSH, Professor of Hebrew
                  and Oriental Literature in the New York City University.
               The importance of this work must be obvious, and, being altogether
                     illustrative, without reference to doctrines, or other points in
                  which Christians differ, it is hoped it will meet with favour from all who love
                  the sacred volume, and that it will be sufficiently interesting and attractive to
                  recommend itself, not only to professed Christians of all
                  denominations, but also to the general reader. The arrangement of the texts
                  illustrated with the notes, in the order of the chapters and verses of the
                  authorized version of the Bible, will render it convenient for reference to
                  particular passages; while the copious Index at the end will at once
                  enable the reader to turn to every subject discussed in the volume.
               This volume is not designed to take the place of Commentaries, but is a distinct
                  department of biblical instruction, and may be used as a companion to the
                  Comprehensive or any other commentary, or the Holy Bible.
               THE ENGRAVINGS in this volume, it is believed, will form no small part of its
                  attractions. No pains have been spared to procure such as should embellish the
                  work, and, at the same time, illustrate the text. Objections that have been made
                  to the picture commonly introduced into the Bible, as being mere creatures of
                  fancy and the imagination, often unlike nature, and frequently conveying false
                  impressions, cannot be urged against the pictorial illustrations of this volume.
                  Here the fine arts are made subservient to utility, the landscape views being,
                  without an exception, matter-of-fact views of places mentioned in Scripture,
                     as they appear at the present day; thus in many instances exhibiting, in
                  the most forcible manner, to the eye, the strict and
                     literal fulfilment of the remarkable prophecies; "the present
                  ruined and desolate condition of the cities of Babylon, Ninevah, Selah, &c.,
                  and the countries of Edom and Egypt, are astonishing examples, and so completely
                  exemplify, in the most minute particulars, every thing which was foretold of them
                  in the height of their prosperity, that no better description can now be given of
                  them than a simple quotation from a chapter and verse of the Bible written nearly
                  two or three thousand years ago." The publishers are enabled to select from
                  several collections lately published in London, the proprietor of one of which
                  says that "several distinguished travellers have afforded him the use of nearly
                     Three Hundred Original Sketches" of Scripture places, made upon
                  the spot. "The land of Palestine, it is well known, abounds in scenes of most
                  picturesque beauty. Syria comprehends the snowy heights of Lebanon, and this
                  majestic ruins of Tadmor and Baalbec." The above work can be had in various styles
                  of binding.
               Price from $1 50 to $5 00.
            
            
               THE ILLUSTRATED CONCORDANCE,
               In one volume, royal 8vo.
               A new, full, and complete Concordance; illustrated with monumental, traditional,
                  and oriental engravings, founded on Butterworth's, with Cruden's definitions;
                  forming, it is believed, on many accounts, a more valuable work than either
                  Butterworth, Cruden, or any other similar book in the language.
               The value of a Concordance is now generally understood; and those who have used
                  one, consider it indispensable in connection with the Bible. Some of the many
                  advantages the Illustrated Concordance has over all the others, are, that it
                  contains near two hundred appropriate engravings; it is printed on fine white
                  paper, with beautiful large type.
               Price One Dollar.
            
            
               LIPPINCOTT'S EDITION OF BAGSTER'S COMPREHENSIVE BIBLE.
               In order to develop the peculiar nature of the Comprehensive Bible, it will only
                  be necessary to embrace its more prominent features.
               1st. The SACRED TEXT is that of the Authorized Version, and it printed from the
                  edition corrected and improved b Dr. Blaney, which, from its accuracy, is
                  considered the standard edition.
               2nd. The VARIOUS READINGS are faithfully printed from the edition of Dr. Blaney,
                  inclusive of the translation of the proper names, without the addition or
                  diminution of one.
               3rd. In the CHRONOLOGY, great care has been taken to fix the date of the
                  particular transaction, which has seldom been done with any degree of exactness in
                  any former edition of the Bible.
               4th. The NOTES are exclusively philological and explanatory, and are not tinctured
                  with sentiments of an sect or party. They are selected from the most eminent
                  Biblical critics and commentators.
               It is hoped that this edition of the Holy Bible will be found to contain the
                  essence of Biblical research and criticism, that lies dispersed through an immense
                  number of volumes. Such is the nature and design of this edition of the Sacred
                  Volume, which, from the various objects it embraces, the freedom of its pages from
                  all sectarian peculiarities, and the beauty, plainness, and correctness of the
                  typography, that it cannot fail of proving acceptable and useful to Christians of
                  every denominations.
               In addition to the usual references to parallel passages, which are quite full and
                  numerous, the student has all the marginal readings, together with a rich
                  selections of Philological, Critical, Historical, Geographical, and
                  other valuable notes and remarks, which explain and illustrate the sacred text.
                  Besides the general introduction, containing valuable essays on the genuineness,
                  authenticity, and inspirations of the Holy Scriptures, and other topics of
                  interest, there are introductory and concluding remarks to each book—a table of
                  the contents of the Bible, by which the different portions are so arranged as to
                  read in an historical order.
               Arranged at the top of each page is the period in which the prominent events of
                  sacred history took place. The calculations are made for the year of the world
                  before and after Christ, Julian Period, the year of the Olympiad, the year of the
                  building of Rome, and other notations of time. At the close is inserted a
                  Chronological Index of the Bible, according to the computation of Archbishop
                  Ussher. Also, a full and valuable index of the subjects contained in
                  the Old and New Testaments, with a careful analysis and arrangement of texts under
                  their appropriate subjects.
               Mr. Greenfield, the editor of this work, and for some time previous to his death
                  the superintendent of the editorial department of the British and Foreign Bible
                  Society, was a most extraordinary man. In editing the Comprehensive Bible, his
                  varied and extensive learning was called into successful exercise, and appears in
                  happy combination with sincere piety and a sound judgement. The Editor of the
                  Christian Observer, alluding to this work, in an obituary notice of its author,
                  speaks of it as a work of "prodigious labour and research, at once exhibiting his
                  varied talents and profound erudition."
            
            
               LIPPINCOTT'S EDITION OF THE OXFORD QUARTO BIBLE.
               The Publishers have spared neither care nor expense in their edition of the Bible;
                  it is printed on the finest while vellum paper, with large and beautiful type, and
                  bound in the most substantial and splendid manner, in the following styles:
                  Velvet, with richly gilt ornaments: Turkey super extra, with gilt clasps; and in
                  numerous others, to suit the taste of the most fastidious.
               
                  OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
                  "In our opinion, the Christian public generally will feel under great
                     obligations to the publishers of this work for the beautiful taste,
                     arrangement, and delicate neatness with which they have got it out. The
                     intrinsic merit of the Bible recommends itself; it needs no tinsel ornament to
                     adorn its sacred pages. In this edition every superfluous ornament has been
                     avoided, and we have presented us a perfectly chaste specimen of the Bible,
                     without note or comment. It appears to be just what is needed in every
                     family—'the unsophisticated word of God.'
                  "The size is quarto, printed with beautiful type, on white, sized vellum paper,
                     of the finest texture and most beautiful surface. The publishers seem to have
                     been solicitous to make a perfectly unique book, and they have accomplished the
                     object very successfully. We trust that a liberal community will afford them
                     ample remuneration for all the expense and outlay they have necessarily
                     incurred in its publication. It is a standard Bible. "The publishers are
                     Messrs. Lippincott, Grambo & Co., No. 14 North Fourth street,
                        Philadelphia."—Baptist Record.
                  
                  "A beautiful quarto edition of the Bible, by L., G. & Co. Nothing can
                     exceed the type in clearness and beauty: the paper is of the finest texture,
                     and the whole execution is exceedingly neat. No illustrations or ornamental
                     type are used. Those who prefer a Bible executed in perfect simplicity, yet
                     elegance of style, without adornment, will probably never find one more to
                     their taste."—M. Magazine.

               The Errors of Modern Infidelity Illustrated and Refuted.

               We cannot but regard this work, in whatever light we view it in reference to its
                  design, as one of the most masterly productions of the age, and fitted to uproot
                  one of the most fondly cherished and dangerous of all ancient or modern errors.
                  God must bless such a work, armed with his own truth, and doing fierce and
                  successful battle against black infidelity, which would bring His Majesty and Word
                  down to the tribunal of human reason, for condemnation and
                     annihilation.—Alb. Spectator

               JOSEPHUS'S (FLAVIUS) WORKS,
               FAMILY EDITION. BY THE LATE WILLIAM WHISTON, A. M. FROM THE LAST
                  LONDON EDITION, COMPLETE.
               One volume, beautifully illustrated with Steel Plates, and the only readable
                  edition published in this country.
               As a matter of course, every family in our country has a copy of the Holy Bible;
                  and as the presumption is that the greater portion often consult its pages, we
                  take the liberty of saying to all those that do, that the perusal of the writings
                  of Josephus will be found very interesting and instructive.
               All those who wish to possess a beautiful and correct copy of this valuable work,
                  would do well to purchase this edition. It is for sale at all the principle
                  bookstores in the United States, and by country merchants generally in the
                  Southern and Western States.
               Also, the above work in two volumes.
            
            
               BURDER'S VILLAGE SERMONS;
               Or, 101 Plain and Short Discourses on the Principal Doctrines of the
                  Gospel.
               INTENDED FOR THE USE OF FAMILIES, SUNDAY-SCHOOLS, OR COMPANIES
                  ASSEMBLED FOR RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN COUNTRY VILLAGES. BY GEORGE BURDER.
               To which is added to Sermon, a Short Prayer, with some General Prayer for
                  Families, Schools, &c., at the end of the work.
               COMPLETE IN ONE VOLUME, OCTAVO.
               These sermons, which are characterized by beautiful simplicity, the entire absence
                  of controversy, and a true evangelical spirit, have gone though many and large
                  editions, and been translated into several of the continental languages. "They
                  have also been the honoured means not only of converting many individuals, but
                  also of introducing the Gospel into districts, and even into parish churches,
                  where before it was comparatively unknown."
               "This work fully deserves the immortality it has attained."
               This is a fine library edition of this invaluable work; and when we say that it
                  should be found in the possession of every family, we only reiterate the
                  sentiments and sincere wishes of all who take a deep interest in the eternal
                  welfare of mankind.

                  BYRON'S WORKS.
                  COMPLETE IN ONE VOLUME, OCTAVO.
                  INCLUDING ALL HIS SUPPRESSED AND ATTRIBUTED POEMS; WITH SIX BEAUTIFUL
                     ENGRAVINGS.
                  This edition had been carefully compared with the recent London edition of Mr.
                     Murray, and made complete by the addition of more than fifty pages of poems
                     heretofore unpublished in England. Among these there are a number that have
                     never appeared in any American edition; and the publishers believe they are
                     warranted in saying that this is the most complete edition of Lord
                        Byron's Poetical Works ever published in the United States.
               
               
                  The Poetical of Mrs. Hemans.
                  Complete in one volume, octavo; with seven beautiful Engravings.
                  This is a new and complete edition, with a splendid engraved likeness of Mrs.
                     Hemans, on steel, and contains all the Poems in the last London and American
                     editions. With a Critical Preface by Mr. Thatcher, of Boston.
                  "As no work in the English language can be commended with more confidence, it
                     will argue had taste in a female in this country to be without a complete
                     edition of the writings of one who was an honour to her sex and to humanity,
                     and whose productions, from first to last, contain no syllable calculated to
                     call a blush to the cheek of modesty and virtue. There is, moreover, in Mrs.
                     Hemans's poetry, a moral purity and a religious feeling which commend it, it an
                     especial manner, to the discriminating reader. No parent or guardian will be
                     under the necessity of imposing restrictions with regard to the free perusal of
                     every production emanating from this gifted woman. There breathes throughout
                     the whole a most eminent exemption from impropriety of thought or diction; and
                     there is at times a pensiveness of tone, a winning sadness in her more serious
                     composition, which tells of a soul which has been lifted from the contemplation
                     of terrestrial things, to divine communings with beings of a purer world."

                  Cowper and Thomson's Prose and Poetical Works.
                  COMPLETE IN ONE VOLUME, OCTAVO.
                  Including two hundred and fifty Letters, and sundry Poems of Cowper, never
                     before published in this country; and of Thomson's new and interesting Memoir,
                     and upwards of twenty new Poems, for the first time printed from his own
                     Manuscripts, taken from a late Edition of the Aldine Poets, now published in
                     London.
                  WITH SEVEN BEAUTIFUL ENGRAVINGS.
                  The distinguished Professor Silliman, speaking of this edition, observes: "I am
                     as much gratified by the elegance and fine taste of your edition, as by the
                     noble tribute of genius and moral excellence which these delightful authors
                     have left for all future generations; and Cowper, especially, is not less
                     conspicuous as a true Christian, moralist and teacher, than as a poet of great
                     power and exquisite taste."

                  COMPLETE IN ONE VOLUME, OCTAVO.
                  WITH SIX BEAUTIFUL ENGRAVINGS.
                  The beauty, correctness, and convenience of this favourite edition of these
                     standard authors are so well known, that it is scarcely necessary to add a word
                     in its favour. It is only necessary to say, that the publishers have now issued
                     an illustrated edition, which greatly enhance its former value. The engravings
                     are excellent and well selected. It is the best library edition extant.
               
               
                  CRABBE, HERBER, AND POLLOCK'S POETICAL WORKS.
                  COMPLETE IN ONE VOLUME, OCTAVO.
                  WITH SIX BEAUTIFUL ENGRAVINGS.
                  A writer in the Boston Traveller, holds the following language with reference
                     to there valuable editions:-
                  "Mr. Editor:—I wish, without any idea of puffing, to say a word or two upon the
                     "Library of English Poets' that is now published at Philadelphia, by
                     Lippincott, Grambo & Co. It is certainly, taking into consideration to
                     elegant manner in which it is printed, and the reasonable price at which it is
                     afforded to purchasers, the best edition of the modern British Poets that has
                     ever been published in this country. Each volume is an octavo of about 500
                     pages, double columns, stereo-typed, and accompanied with fine engravings and
                     biographical sketches; and most of them are reprinted from Galignani's French
                     edition. As to its value, we need only mention that it contains the entire
                     works of Montgomery, Gray, Beattie, Collins, Byron, Cowper, Thomson, Milton,
                     Young, Rogers, Campbell, Lamb, Hemans, Heber, Kirke White, Crabbe, the
                     Miscellaneous Works of Goldsmith, and others masters of the lyre. The
                     publishers are doing a great service by their publication, and their volumes
                     are almost in as great demand as the fashionable novels of the day; and they
                     deserve to be so; for they are certainly printed in a style superior to that in
                     which we have before had the works of the English Poets."
                  No library can be considered complete without a copy of the above beautiful and
                     cheap editions of the English Poets; and persons ordering all or any of them,
                     will please say Lippincott, Grambo & Co.'s illustrated editions.

                  the utmost facility, even by failing eyes. The book is stereotyped; and never have
                  we seen a finer specimen of that art. Everything about it is perfect—the paper,
                  the printing, the binding, all correspond with each other; and it is embellished
                  with two fine engravings, well worthy the companionship in which they are
                  placed.

                  surprised if this convenient traveling edition does not in a great degree
                  supersede the use of the large octavo works, which have little advantage in size

               The publishers have received numerous flattering notices of the great practical
                  value of these works. The distinguished editor of the American Farmer, speaking of
                  them, observes:—"We cannot too highly recommend these books, and therefore advise
                  every owner of a horse to obtain them."
               "There are receipts in those books that show how Founder may be
                  cured, and the traveller pursue his journey the next day, by giving a tablespoonful of alum. This was got from Dr. P. Thornton, of Montpelier,
                  Rappahannock county, Virginia, as founded on his own observation in several
                  cases."
               "The constant demand for Mason's and Hinds's Farrier has induced the publishers,
                  Messrs. Lippincott, Grambo & Co., to put forth new editions, with a
                  'Supplement' of 100 pages, by J. S. Skinner, a chapter from Supplement, 'On the
                  Relations between Man and the Domestic Animals, especially the Horse, and the
                  Obligations they impose;' or the one on 'The Forms of Animals;' but that either
                  one of them would overrun the space here allotted to such subjects."
               "Lists of Medicines, and other articles which ought to be at hand about every
                  training and livery stable, and every Farmer's and Breeder's establishment, will

                  English, with Illustration, Historical and Idiomatic.
               NEW AMERICAN EDITION, CORRECTED, WITH ADDITIONS.
               One volume, 12mo.
               This volume comprises a copious collection of legal and other terms which are in
                  common use, with English translation and historical illustrations; and we should
                  judge its author had surely been to a great "Feast of
                  Languages," and stole all the scraps. A work of this character should have an
                  extensive sale, as it entirely obviates a serious difficulty in which most readers
                  are involved by the frequent occurrence of Latin, Greek, and French passages,
                  which we suppose are introduced by authors for a mere show of learning—a
                  difficulty very perplexing to readers in general. This "Dictionary of Quotations,"
                  concerning which too much cannot be said in its favour, effectually are themselves
                  ignorant of the meaning of the terms they employ. Very few truly learned authors
                  will insult their readers by introducing Latin or French quotations in their
                  writings, when "plain English" will do as well; but we will not enlarge on this
                  point.
               If the book is useful to those unacquainted with other languages, it is no less
                  valuable to the classically educated as a book of reference, and answers all the
                  purposes of a Lexicon—indeed, on many accounts, it is better. It saves the trouble
                  of tumbling over the larger volumes, to which every one, and especially those
                  engaged in the legal profession, are very often subjected. It should have a place
                  in every library in the country.

                  admirable Treatise on Political Economy; a work which not only
                  improved under his hand with every successive edition, but has been translated
                  into most of the European languages."
               The Editor of the North American Review, speaking of Say, observes, that "he is
                  the most popular, and perhaps the most able writer on Political Economy, since the
                  time of Smith."

               To commend or to criticise Sterne's Works, in this age of the world, would be all
                  "wasteful and extravagant excess." Uncle Toby—Corporal Trim—the Widow—Le
                  Fevre—Poor Maria—the Captive—even the Dead Ass,—this is all we have to say of
                  Sterne; and in the memory of these characters, histories, and sketches, a thousand
                  follies and worse than follow are forgotten. The volume is a very handsome
                  one.

               "'Money-Bags and Titles' is quite a remarkable work, amounts to a
                  kindly exposure of the folly of human pride, and also presents at once the evil
                  and the remedy. If good-natured ridicule of the impostures practised by a set of
                  self-styled reformers, who have nothing to lose, and to whom change must be
                  gain—if, in short, a delineation of the mistaken ideas which prevent, and the
                  means which conduce to happiness, be traits deserving of commendation,—the reader
                  will find much to enlist his attention and win his approbation in the pages of
                  this unpretending, but truly meritorious publication."

               HAW-HO-NOO:
               OR, THE RECORDS OF A TOURIST.
               BY CHARLES LANMAN,
               Author of "A Summer in the Wilderness," &c. In one volume, 12mo.
               "In the present book, 'Haw-ho-noo,' (an Indian name, by the way,
                  for America,) the author has gathered up some of the relics of his former tours,
                  and added to them other interesting matter. It contains a number of carefully
                  written and instructive articles upon the various kinds of fish in our country,
                  whose capture affords sport for anglers; reminiscences of unique incidents,
                  manners, and customs in different parts of the country; and other articles,
                  narrative, descriptive, and sentimental. In a supplement are gathered many curious
                  Indian legends. They are related with great simplicity and clearness, and will be
                  of service hereafter to the poem-makers of America. Many of them are quite
                     beautiful."—National Intelligencer.
               
            
            
               LONZ POWERS; Or, The Regulators.
               A ROMANCE OF KENTUCKY.
               FOUNDED ON FACTS.
               BY JAMES WEIR, ESQ.
               IN TWO VOLUMES.
               The scenes, characters, and incidents in these volumes have been copied from
                  nature, and from real life. They are represented as taking place at that period in
                  the history of Kentucky, when the Indian, driven, after many a hard-fought field,
                  from his favourite hunting-ground, was succeeded by a rude and unlettered
                  population, interspersed with organized bands of desperadoes, scarcely less savage
                  than the red men they had displaced. The author possesses a vigorous and graphic
                  pen, and has produced a very interesting romance, which gives us a striking
                  portrait of the times he describes.

                  up in the following concluding sentences: "Adhere steadfastly to your business;

               In one volume, 12mo.
               WITH ONE HUNDRED ILLUSTRATIONS BY JAMES HAMILTON.
               The work is compiled from his original journals and correspondence, and includes
                  an account of his services in the American Revolution, and in the war between the
                  Russians and Turks in the Black Sea. There is scarcely any Naval Hero, of any age,
                  who combined in his character so much of the adventurous, skillful and daring, as
                  Paul Jones. The incidents of his life are almost as startling and absorbing as
                  those of romance. His achievements during the American Revolution—the fight
                  between the Bon Homme Richard and Serapis, the most desperate naval action on
                  record—and the alarm into which, with so small a force, he threw the coasts of
                  England and Scotland—are matters comparatively well known to Americans; but the
                  incidents of his subsequent career have been veiled in obscurity, which is
                  dissipated by this biography. A book like this, narrating the actions of such a
                  man, ought to meet with an extensive sale, and become as popular as Robinson
                  Crusoe in fiction, or Weems's Life of Marion and Washington, and similar books, in
                  fact. In contains 400 pages, has a handsome portraits and medallion likeness of
                  Jones, and is illustrated with numerous original work engravings of naval scenes
                  and distinguished men with whom he was familiar.

               "The superiority of this edition over the ephemeral publications of the day
                  consists in fuller and more authentic accounts of his family, his early life, and
                  Indian wars. The narrative of his proceedings in Mexico is drawn partly from
                  reliable private letters, but chiefly from his own official correspondence."

               WILLIAMS'S TRAVELLER'S AND TOURIST'S GUIDE
               Through the United States, Canada, &c.
               This book will be found replete with information, not only to the traveller, but
                  likewise to the man of business. In its preparation, an entirely new plan has been
                  adopted, which, we are convinced, needs only a trial to be fully appreciated.
               Among its many valuable features, are tables showing at a glance the
                     distance, fare, and time occupied in travelling from
                  the principal cities to the most important places in the Union; so that the
                  question frequently asked, without obtaining a satisfactory reply, is here
                  answered in full. Other tables show the distances from New York, &c., to
                  domestic and foreign ports, by sea; and also, by way of comparison, from New York
                  and Liverpool to the principal ports beyond and around Cape Horn, &c., as well
                  as via the Isthmus of Panama. Accompanied by a
                  large and accurate Map of the United States, including a separate Map of
                  California, Oregon, New Mexico and Utah. Also, a Map of the Island of Cuba, and
                  Plan of the City and Harbor of Havana; and a Map of Niagara River and Falls.

                  Jefferson's Manual, and copious Indices; together with a concise system of Rules
                  of Order, based on the regulations of the U. S. Congress. Designed to economize
                  time, secure uniformity and despatch in conducting business in all secular
                  meetings, and also in all religious, political, and Legislative Assemblies. BY

               "Those who know Lord Jeffrey only through the pages of the Edinburgh Review, get
                  but a one-sided, and ont the most pleasant view of his character."
               "We advise our reader to obtain the book, and enjoy it to the full themselves.
                  They will unite with us in saying that the self-drawn character portrayed in the
                  letters of Lord Jeffrey, is one of the most delightful pictures that has ever been
                  presented to them."—Evening Bulletin.
               
               "Jeffrey was for a long period editor of the Review, and was admitted by all the
                  other contributors to be the leading spirit in it. In addition to his political
                  articles, he soon showed his wonderful powers of criticism in literature. He was
                  equally at home whether, censuring or applauding; in his onslaughts on the
                  mediocrity of Southey, or the misused talents of Byron, or in his noble essays on

                  volume can hardly be opened at any page without arresting the attention, and the

                  easy, flowing, and yet sententious. Altogether, we consider it a highly valuable
                  addition to the literature of our age, and a work that should find its way into

                  "There most tastefully printed and bound volumes form the first installment of
                     a series of State Histories, which, without superseding the bulkier and more
                     expensive works of the same character, may enter household channels from which
                     the others would be excluded by their cost and magnitude."
                  "In conciseness, clearness, skill of arrangement, and graphic interest, they

                     become familiar, not only with the history of his own State, but with that of
                     the other States; thus mutual interests will be re-awakened, and old bonds

               NEW THEMES FOR THE PROTESTANT CLERGY;
               CREEDS WITHOUT CHARITY, THEOLOGY WITHOUT HUMANITY, AND PROTESTANTISM
                  WITHOUT CHRISTIANITY, With Notes by the Editor on the Literature of Charity,
                  Population, Pauperism, Political Economy, and Protestantism.
               "The great question which the book discusses is, whether the Church of his age is
                  what the primitive Church was, and whether Christians—both pastors and people—are
                  doing their duty. Our another believes not, and, to our mind, he had made out a
                  strong case. He thinks there is an abundant room for reform at the present time,
                  and that it is needed almost as much as in the days of Luther. And why? Because,
                  in his own words, 'While one portion of nominal Christians have busied themselves
                  with forms and ceremonies and observances; with pictures, images, and processions;
                  others have given to doctrines the supremacy, and have busied themselves in laying
                  down the lines by which to enforce human belief—lines of interpretation by which
                  to control human opinion—lines of discipline and restraint, by which to bring
                  human minds to uniformity of faith and action. They have formed creeds and
                  catechisms; they have spread themselves over the whole field of the sacred
                  writings, and scratched up all the surface; they have gathered all the straws, and
                  turned over all the pebbles, and detected the colour and determined the outline of
                  every stone and tree and shrub; they have dwelt with rapture upon all that was
                  beautiful and sublime; but they have trampled over mines of golden wisdom, of
                  surpassing richness and depth, almost without thought, and almost without an
                  effort to fathom these priceless treasures, much less to take possession of
                  them.'"

               LIPPINCOTT'S CABINET HISTORIES OF THE STATES.
               THE subscribers have been for some time preparing to publish a series of CABINET
                  HISTORIES of all the States of the Union, to embrace a volume for each State; and
                  they have so far completed all their arrangements as to be able to issue the whole
                  series in the shortest possible time consistent with its careful literary
                  production. Several volumes are now ready for sale.
               The importance of a series of State Histories, like those now in preparation, can
                  scarcely be estimated. Being condensed as carefully as accuracy and interest of
                  narrative will permit, the size and price of the volumes will bring them within
                  the reach of every family in the country, thus making them home-reading books for
                  old and young. Each individual will, in consequence, become familiar, not only
                  with the history of his own State, but with that of the other States: thus, mutual
                  interests will be reawakened, AND OLD BONDS CEMENTED IN A FIRMER REUNION.
               The talented authors who have engaged to write these histories are no strangers in
                  the literary world. What they undertake, the public may rest assured will be
                  performed thoroughly, and that no sectarian, sectional, or party feeling will bias
                  their judgements, or lead them to violate the integrity of history.
               In this series of histories the authors, while presenting a concise but accurate
                  narrative of the domestic policy of each State, will give greater prominence to
                  the personal history of the people. The dangers which continually hovered around
                  the early colonists; the stirring romance of a life passed fearlessly amid peril;
                  the incidents of border warfare; the adventures of hardy pioneers; the keen
                  watchfulness, the subtle surprise, the ruthless attack, and prompt retaliation—all
                  these, having had an important influence upon the formation of the American
                  character, are to be faithfully recorded; while the progressive developments of
                  the citizens of each individual State, from the rough forest life of the earlier
                  day to the polished condition of the present, will exhibit a picture of national
                  expansion as instructing as it is interesting.
               The public may depend upon one thing, that these books are not to be mere hurried,
                  superficial, catch-penny affairs; but carefully prepared, accurate, and reliable
                  histories, in which matters of interest and importance, scattered through many
                  bulky volumes, will be brought, as far as regards each State, into one, and the
                  entire history of each individual State, from its origin to the present time,
                  given in a clear and continuous narrative.

               LIPPINCOTT, GRAMBO & CO., Philadelphia, HAVE JUST PUBLISHED AUNT PHILLIS'S
                  CABIN; or, Southern Life as It Is. BY MRS. MARY H. EASTMAN.
               This volume presents a picture of Southern life taken at different points of view
                  from the one occupied by the author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
               The writer, being a native of the South, is familiar with the many varied aspects
                  assumed by domestic servitude in that sunny region, and therefore feels competent
                  to give pictures of "Southern Life as it is." Pledged to no clique or party, and
                  free from the pressure of any and all extraneous influences, she has written her
                  book with a view to its truthfulness; and the public at the North, as well as at
                  the South, will find in Aunt Phillis's Cabin, not the distorted picture of an
                  interested painter, but the faithful transcript of a Daguerreotypist. It is the
                  truth that all profess to seek, and in a matter of such vital interest to the
                  whole nation as Domestic Slaver, Truth—not highly-wrought imaginary
                  representations—is above all things demanded. Such truth, in the enticing garb of
                  a skilful fiction, will Aunt Phillis's Cabin present.
               The author does not come before the public as the apologist of Slavery, but with
                  the earnest desire to represent it as its is; and in doing so, she will show its
                  ameliorating features in strong contrast with the painful scenes so elaborately
                  set forth in "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
