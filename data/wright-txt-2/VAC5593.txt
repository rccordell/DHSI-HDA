            A TALE OF THE REBELLION OF 1798.
            
               CHAPTER I.
               EARLY SCENES.
               MY first distinctly-remembered impressions of myself and those about me were
                  received on the morning of my fifth birthday. This sharply-defined impression was
                  undoubtedly the result of the unusual circumstances which marked this particular
                  day, causing it to stand apart in my memory, an era in my childish life.
               On that day I arrived, a weary little motherless waif, at the home which was to be
                  mine for the future.
               It was in fulfillment of a sacred promise, that my father, on his second marriage,
                  transferred me to the care of my grandmother. On her death-bed, my mother, who was
                  a Protestant, had exacted of my father, a faithful and zealous Catholic; the
                  solemn promise that in case he married again, and the new wife was a Catholic, he
                  would permit his only child to retain the faith of her mother, and remove her to
                  the protection of her mother's family.
               My father had readily consented to this; no doubt he thought, in the fullness of his grief, that no
                  new wife should ever take the place of the dying—for they had been wed but a few
                  years, and were tenderly attached. But time brings changes; the thing he deemed
                  impossible had come to pass, and he was married again. And, true to his plighted
                  word, he had brought me this morning some six or seven miles across country, in
                  his little donkey-cart, and delivered me, with all my "belongings," to the full
                  and undisputed control of my grandmother.
               My grandmother's home was different, indeed, from the one I had left. It was a
                  picturesque cottage, with pointed gables and overhanging eaves, embowered in
                  flowers and vines and scented shrubs. The "lodge" it was called, an appendage to
                  the Hall just discernible through the spreading branches of the grand old trees
                  that lined either side of the broad, winding avenue, stretching up from the gates
                  to the great house.
               My grandmother had been brought up as an upper servant at the Hall. Faithful and
                  disinterested, the Greyton family were to her world and worship, and she in turn
                  was held in high regard by them. Late in life she had married the head gardener on
                  the estate, and my mother was the child of that marriage. When she became a widow
                  the faithful servitor was installed portress of the lodge, a place which she had
                  held now for many years.
               The old master and mistress of her time, however, were long since dead, and the
                  present Sir Robert, their only child, with his family, occupied the place. The
                  change made no difference in my grandmother's situation. Sir Robert was her
                  staunch friend, and always bore himself toward her with a kindness almost
                  amounting to tenderness. She had been his nurse in early years, and it was said
                  that there had been a certain romance connected with his days of youthful folly,
                  when she had saved him and the honor of the family. And for this he ever, in
                  after-years, held her in grateful remembrance. The tale, as I afterward learned
                  it, was on this wise:
               My mother, carefully reared, and educated above her class, had developed into
                  great beauty. The young heir at the Hall meeting her occasionally in his rambles,
                  or on his visits to his old nurse, fell rapturously in love with this young
                  creature, just budding into sweet girlhood. Any special devotion to her under her
                  mother's watchful eye was, of course, out of the question; and so, disguising
                  himself as a rustic, the lad followed her from place to place, becoming more and
                  more infatuated. A thoughtful young friend, seeing the impending danger,
                  remonstrated with the youthful lover; the sole result of the expostulation was a
                  quarrel, followed by a duel, in which the impolitic friend was severely wounded.
                  Robert Greyton was obliged to fly. Still, so blindly was he infatuated, that on
                  his knees he entreated my grandmother to let her daughter accompany him. He would
                  marry her on the instant; she was dearer to him than life. But my grandmother was
                  too wise to listen to such pleadings, and besides, the honor of the Greyton family
                  was at stake. Through none belonging to her should a tinge of disgrace tarnish its
                  ancient nobility. He must go; she would preserve her child.
               He secretly left the country, and did not venture to return (although his wounded
                  friend recovered) until summoned by the
                  death of the old lord. Then he came back, bringing with him a young wife, an
                  English lady, said to be possessed of great wealth.
               My mother, it was said, grieved for awhile, but her affections had not been deeply
                  engaged, and she was very young. Submitting to the inevitable, she finally married
                  in her own position in life—my father being a small farmer; and with him she lived
                  happily the brief life allotted her.
               The reader may gather from this outline some idea of those among whom I was
                  ushered on the morning of my arrival. I did not then understand the deep sadness
                  overshadowing the faces I looked upon, nor did I know of the many tender memories
                  stirred that morning by my presence. It frightened me to see my father shed tears,
                  and to hear my grandmother sob as she accepted the charge of her poor Honor's
                  child. I looked from one to the other in childish terror, and when my father rose
                  to depart clung to him tenaciously. No persuasion could lure me away, and it was
                  amid cries and tears that I was torn from his arms.
               My poor father! the struggle was a hard one for you, too, as I knew well in
                  after-days.
               Scarcely had I been quieted after my father's departure, when the rattle of wheels
                  announced the approach of a vehicle. My grandmother knew it well; it was the
                  family coach, and with her it was almost a religious duty to open the gates with
                  her own hands whenever Sir Robert and his lady drove through. But she could not
                  get rid of me; I was still in a painful tremor of excitement, an undefined terror
                  lest something dreadful was about to happen, and I held to her so closely that she
                  was obliged to open the gates as best she could, encumbered by my clinging
                  hands.
               In imagination I can still see those huge steeds, as with prancing steps and
                  foam-flecked jaws they proudly entered. Viewed from my diminutive standpoint, and
                  judged by an experience limited to the dear old donkey that browsed in front of my
                  father's door, the well-kept animals did indeed appear like some gigantic monsters
                  ready to swallow me up, and, in view of this danger, I kept myself prudently in
                  the shadow of my grandmother's skirts.
               In the carriage, a large, open one, sat a stately company, whose names I afterward
                  knew. They were Sir Robert and Lady Greyton, and their two children, Arthur and
                  Florence.
               "Ah, who have we here?" said Sir Robert's hearty voice, as he looked down into my
                  frightened face. "A bright little maid, by my faith!"
               "Who?" echoed her ladyship, while the children in different strains caught up the
                  interrogation.
               My poor grandmother's heart was still full of tears, and she answered with a
                  broken voice, "It is my poor Honor's little girl, come to me at last."
               "Ah!" said Sir Robert, and there was a pause. Then he added, looking at me, "But
                  there is little resemblance to her mother, now. She is more like yourself."
               "So they say," answered my grandmother with a deep sigh.
               "And how old is the child?" asked Lady Grace.
               Just five to-day, my lady."
               "Dear me! our Florence is just five years old to-day, also, and how much stouter this little girl is.
                  What is her name?"
               "Olive."
               "A pretty name," said Sir Robert. "Come, let the little girls kiss each other on
                  their birthday;" and in a twinkling I was lifted into the centre of the group. I
                  remember the sweet kiss of the little fairy who sat there embowered in silks and
                  roses; I remember a strange sensation, as if I were being wafted through the air
                  amid sweet sounds and floating perfumes, and then everything vanished. Overcome by
                  fatigue and excitement, I had fainted away.
               When I opened my eyes again they rested upon my grandmother nodding by the
                  bedside. It took a little time to recall my scattered wits. I was not hurt, I was
                  not scared; I felt, indeed, decidedly happy; why then was I lying here? What did
                  it all mean? The room was a small one. I had never seen anything so nice before;
                  so cozily shut in and comfortable. The walls were white, the curtains of the bed
                  white, the covering under which I lay was like a snow-drift. Looking through the
                  open door just beyond me, I saw an outer room of apparently much larger
                  dimensions. Beneath an open window in this room (a latticed window nearly darkened
                  by close-clustering vines) sat a young boy. He seemed to me very tall and fair. In
                  front of him, upon a table, was spread out a map or paper, I could not tell which;
                  his head was bent down over it so intently that I could not see his face. The
                  light was very uncertain and dim, only as the breeze outside fluttered the thick
                  vine-leaves could a glimpse of the fading sunlight enter, yet the lad still pored
                  over his studies, unmindful of the gathering shadows. I looked long and
                  wonderingly at this picture, framed in the vine-hung window opposite, and finally
                  I asked, "Who is he?" I put the question in a whisper, touching my grandmother's
                  sleeve as she sat at my bedside.
               "Bless me, child!" was her startled exclamation, "I thought you were still
                  asleep."
               "Oh, no; I've been awake ever so long—but who is that?"
               "Why, that's Walter, my pretty bird. And are you really quite well, now?" My poor
                  grandmother was evidently much relieved to find me "coming to" again with a
                  child's natural inquisitiveness. She called cheerily to the young student, "Come,
                  Walter, Olive wants to see you."
               My heart leaped out to the bright smiling face that now came towards me. Walter
                  lifted me from the bed with strong and careful arms; he carried me out into the
                  large room.
               There we presently had tea; and Walter was so kind and I was shown so much honor,
                  and so humored with all the dainties on the table, that I was charmed out of my
                  usual shyness. All this was so different from my accustomed fare of porridge and
                  milk, and I was so hungry, that I think a happier child than that evening closed
                  upon was not to be found in Ireland.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               NEW FRIENDS.
               AFTERWARD I learned more about Walter. The lad was an orphan. His father had been
                  a laborer upon the estate, and at his death Sir Robert took charge of the boy, who
                  was without near relatives, and when he was old enough to be of some service
                  transferred him to my grandmother to be made useful about the lodge.
               He had not been there long before my advent. My grandmother, not much given to
                  manifestations of affection, had nevertheless taken kindly to the boy; indeed, I
                  believe now she had a much more tender regard for him than she ever had for me. My
                  shy ways and constrained habits, which to one of her quick and energetic nature
                  must have appeared as either sullenness or stupidity, contrasted unfavorably, I
                  doubt not, with his earnest, direct looks, and frank, open demeanor.
               "I can always tell what Walter wants and thinks," the old lady would say; "but I
                  cannot do so with you, Olive."
               But Walter understood me better; I felt sure of this. From the first we were good
                  friends. Being a few years older than myself gave him an importance in my eyes,
                  and great authority; I was always ready to be guided by what he said; and, indeed,
                  in those early days he taught me whatever I knew.
               Before he came to the lodge, when he was living a lonely little fellow in his
                  father's cabin, the old priest of the parish had been attracted by his bright
                  intelligence, and had taught him to read and write. Walter was an apt pupil. "We
                  will make a priest of him yet," the good father would say; "I am doing the church
                  some service, my lad, in bringing such gifts to the altar."
               When the boy was removed to my grandmother's care the persistent father still
                  continued his visits and lessons. My grandmother put no obstacles in his way, but
                  she was very careful to have me out of hearing. I believe she would rather have
                  had me grow up in utter ignorance than have caught one gleam of knowledge from
                  what she deemed so unholy a source. But to Walter's transferring this knowledge to
                  me there could be no objection; and I came to long for the evenings when, with
                  books and maps, and primer and slate, Walter, constituting himself my instructor,
                  labored diligently to open the channels of my slow understanding. I took delight
                  in those lessons, so new, so strange a world they opened to me; and gradually but
                  surely I grew to feel the joy of acquisition apart from the mere pleasure of my
                  young teacher's approbation. Those were happy, innocent hours; if I tasted no keen
                  delights I knew no special deprivations, and with a child's adaptability I had
                  transferred all my affections and interests to my new home.
               Thus passed five years. I had no companion outside of our little home; in truth, I
                  desired none. My grandmother would not admit of any association with those of our
                  own rank in life. She was an humble
                  woman, she would say, but she could not allow that. Her aspirations soared much
                  higher; humility was certainly not one of her weaknesses. One who was honored by
                  the protection and regard of the Greyton family, and had been so long one of them,
                  should feel it her duty to preserve an exclusive dignity. And she obliged me to do
                  so, too. Walter, as an occasional indulgence, was permitted to visit some young
                  friends at the little town of Arklow, a few miles distant; but I must keep at
                  home.
               Yet I was far from unhappy. I desired nothing more. Walter was everything to me,
                  and would he but tell me all he saw and heard I was fully satisfied.
               Of the young people at the Hall all this time I saw but little, and that little at
                  a distance. Concealed behind the overhanging vines of my grandmother's porch, I
                  would often gaze in a sort of fascinated wonder out over the broad avenue, and
                  under the branching trees, on all that was visible of that life beyond me, so
                  exalted, as I deemed it, yet so luring to my fancy. Often gay groups of visitors,
                  in every fanciful variety of dress and color, would saunter about on that lawn,
                  where to my eyes the grass looked greener and the sun shone brighter than anywhere
                  else. But the figure that ever most fixed my rapt attention was that of the little
                  girl Florence, as she flitted about followed by her dog, a fine specimen of the
                  Irish greyhound. She was truly a revelation to me; her fair hair, her white, gauzy
                  dress, and blue sash ever fluttering in her quick movements,—she was a vision, a
                  dream, to my excited imagination. I never connected myself in any way with what I
                  saw, I would not even speak about my fancies to Walter; I had an instinctive dread
                  that he might laugh at me for a miserable little idolater.
               But circumstances were most unexpectedly bringing about some changes that were
                  likely to draw me into that charmed circle whether I would or not.
               One day Lady Grace made a visit to the lodge. This was quite an unusual
                  circumstance; I had seen her once in our cottage, but that was when my grandmother
                  was ill. On this morning of her visit she spoke to me most kindly and asked my
                  grandmother many questions about me, and then I was requested to walk out in the
                  garden a little while; I might pick her ladyship a bunch of flowers. She wished to
                  speak with my grandmother alone a few minutes.
               The result of this interview was an invitation for me to spend a few days at the
                  Hall. The cause which led to the unexpected honor was this: the young daughter of
                  the house was growing up in feeble health; there was much anxiety about her. The
                  family physician had recommended out-door exercise,—not the formal routine of
                  riding or walking with governess or nurse, but real, downright romping and playing
                  with those of her own age.
               Some weeks previous a young relative of Lady Grace had been sent for from London.
                  She had come accompanied by her mother for the purpose of making a long visit; but
                  Florence had taken a dislike to the young miss; they could not assimilate. The
                  young lady had to be entertained, not to entertain; the pursuits of a country life
                  did not suit her. She might have borne with Arthur, who was now a large boy, and
                  came nearer her own age, but Florence she could not have forever after her; and so no love was lost,
                  and the attempt had finally to be considered an utter failure.
               Sir Robert and Lady Grace then turned their thoughts on me. I was the right age,
                  strong and sturdy; and any one under my grandmother's care must be well brought
                  up, of this they were sure. At any rate the trial might be made, and so the
                  invitation was given.
               I strongly opposed the arrangement. My grandmother scolded, "Was I not ashamed?
                  Had not little Miss Florence sent me so many pretty playthings, dolls and the
                  like? and now, when she wanted to see me and have me with her a little while, I
                  was crying about it."
               And I was ashamed, but I had such a dread in my shyness of going anywhere, and,
                  above all, among such wonderful people, that the anticipation lay like a nightmare
                  on my dreams. But I must submit; and so, dressed in my clean new gingham, my face
                  swollen with tears and shining with a generous ablution of soap and water, I set
                  forth, accompanied by Walter, who was to introduce me to the housekeeper, Mrs.
                  O'Neil.
               "Good-by, grandmother," I cried, scarcely able to restrain my tears, as I looked
                  back at her standing in the doorway.
               "Only for a day or two, you little simpleton," she said, but smiled more kindly
                  than her wont.
               "And I suppose," said Walter, as we walked slowly along, "you will get to be so
                  grand at the big house, you'll forget all about us!"
               Walter spoke with asperity. Ah, he little knew the terror that big house and all
                  about it had for me to-day. I could scarcely keep down a sob.
               "And Master Arthur," added he, "will be so pleasant ant, no doubt! oh, amazingly
                  condescending! But I hate Arthur,—yes, I hate him! even though everybody calls him
                  so handsome and so genteel. He's no gentleman! He kicks the
                  stable-boys and puts on such airs."
               "Oh, dear, what a bad boy!" I answered, in sympathetic indignation. "I'm sure he's
                  not a bit handsome,—not half so handsome as you are, Walter. I heard Father Keane
                  say to grandmother the other day that you were the handsomest lad in the
                  county."
               This seemed rather to mollify my companion; he spoke in rather gentler tones, as
                  he said, "Master Arthur is as good as others, I suppose, but they all think they
                  may knock us boys about. They'd better not try it on me," he added, with a
                  suggestive shrug; "I will go to America, where the people are free, as soon as I
                  can. Mike Noonan and I are going, for he says we can be as good as anybody
                  there."
               "Oh, Walter! not before I come back!"
               At that Walter laughed; and, chattering thus, we reached the side entrance of the
                  Hall.
               The family were not yet stirring, but Mrs. O'Neil received us into her room and
                  invited us to breakfast. Everything looked very tempting, and the walk in the
                  fresh air had whetted my appetite, so I partook with considerable zest of the nice
                  muffins and eggs so kindly pressed on me, and almost forgot the dreaded ordeal in
                  store.
               When Walter left, my heart-sinking came back; but Mrs. O'Neil was so kind and
                  talked so pleasantly, telling me what a nice little girl Florence was, and how she
                  knew I would like her, that I quite cheered up again.
               
               At length a servant came and said Lady Grace wished to see me in the
                  breakfast-parlor. I followed her through a long passage, and then another and
                  another. A door opened, I saw a glare of light, I heard a hum of voices, and all
                  the rest was a bewildering chaos. It seemed as if some great eye were upon me,
                  transfixing me into stone.
               Then I heard a voice, as if far distant, saying, "Come, my dear, speak to me;" but
                  I could not move, neither utter a sound.
               At that moment some young people, entering through the low window, bounded into
                  the room. The suddenness of their appearance roused me a little: I could see
                  Florence and Arthur; I knew their faces, but who the tall girl was who pushed in
                  front of them I did not know.
               As she looked at me she burst into a loud laugh, whispering to Arthur so that I
                  could hear, "Did you ever see such a guy?"
               I was not insensible to this rudeness; it stirred my pride and restored me
                  somewhat to myself. I could now both see and hear Lady Grace, as she said, "Adele,
                  be more careful; this is our young friend from the lodge."
               "Friend!" repeated the pert girl, "Florence's friend? Ha! ha! do introduce me!"
                  and again she burst into immoderate laughter.
               Sir Robert now rose hastily from the table where he had been looking over the
                  morning papers; he came forward with an angry frown. "Stop your confounded
                  impudence," he said, harshly, "or you shall leave the room on the instant."
               Of course there was some confusion. The young lady pouted and her mother said some
                  indignant words, but I was relieved, for Florence and myself were left alone.
               And what a relief it was! The little girl, on the first rude outbreak of her
                  companion, had crept close to me and taken my hand, and then had put her arm about
                  my neck. My whole heart went out to her; yet even then, when we were alone, my
                  tongue refused to utter a sound, although in my overwhelming gratitude I could
                  have knelt down and worshiped her.
               But Florence did not heed my silence; she was only intent, in her sweet, simple
                  way, on making me happy. She brought me her books and toys, and we sat down on the
                  carpet—that carpet that seemed to me indeed a bed of roses—and looked over the
                  treasures together.
               Such contentment I felt! The sun was shining in on us; the beautiful park outside,
                  the splendors within, the shining mirrors, the beautiful pictures, the
                  everything,—and I there, and so happy! It must be a dream.
               We sat there some time; the servants were in and out clearing away the breakfast
                  things, polishing the tables, and putting all things in order. Suddenly, as I sat
                  there absorbed, my eyes busy with what was before them, a sound reached my ear; I
                  started up, scattering everything about. "Oh, let me go!" I cried.
               "Where,—what is it?"
               "She's coming!"
               "Who?"
               "That girl!" I exclaimed, shivering; "that horrid girl! Oh, let me get away!"
               
               "Yes, let us run and hide," responded Florence, quickly; "it'll be such fun!" And
                  in an instant we had leaped out upon the gravel walk.
               Outside we paused a moment. Yes, there were the voices again. She was with Arthur,
                  coming back, doubtless, to have a little more sport tormenting me.
               But we were off. How we ran! They missed us from the house, and now they were
                  calling us by name, and evidently in close pursuit. Still, on we flew. Gaining the
                  garden and feeling secure, as we skirted along its high hedge, we scampered on,
                  turning over flower-pots, jumping flower-beds, to the general detriment of all
                  that came in our way.
               Our pursuers had evidently taken another track now, for their voices grew more
                  distant; still we eagerly sought a more secure hiding-place.
               Florence pointed out, at the extremity of the garden, a low door, almost hidden in
                  the wall, which was covered by vines and bushes. Could we but open that we would
                  be safe. It yielded to our vigorous efforts sufficiently to let us pass through,
                  but with considerable damage to our bare arms and summer frocks. That was a matter
                  of small importance, however, under the circumstances. We were completely out of
                  sight now. A flight of stone steps descended steeply from the gate to a rapid
                  stream in a wild gorge below, which formed the boundary of the grounds. There were
                  plenty of scraggy bushes and wild vines to shield us there, and with laughter and
                  suppressed exclamations of delight we awaited the result; I forgetting all my
                  shyness in companionship with this bright little wood-spirit at my side.
               We could still hear the voices calling us, and with every sound we gave way to
                  fresh bursts of delight, Florence fairly dancing with glee.
               Presently there was utter silence. "They are gone," I said, drawing a long breath.
                  "No, they are only making-believe gone." And then we waited, it seemed for a very
                  long time, hovering on tiptoe in our covert, and keeping an outlook for the enemy.
                  By-and-by we heard voices again: many voices, and among them the agonized tones of
                  Lady Grace, as she cried, "They have opened the gate; they are down by that
                  dangerous stream. Oh, Florence, Florence!"
               "Mamma, mamma, here I am!" cried the little girl, springing toward the group who
                  now pushed open the gate. "Here I am! Don't be frightened, mamma, it was only fun!
                  Only fun, papa!"
               Others now came running up, servants and visitors and gardeners. There had been
                  great alarm, we had disappeared so suddenly and inexplicably. Sir Robert smiled
                  and frowned both; he made some attempt at reproof, but seeing our disordered
                  appearance, and the earnest, flushed face of his little daughter, he suddenly
                  caught her in his arms, saying, "Well, Grace, I believe we have found the right
                  thing, after all. Let the little maidens work it out in their own way."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               A HOLIDAY.
               THERE were now many changes brought about; my invitation was extended to a month.
                  The children were to have a holiday. Arthur had begged that he, too, might be
                  released from books and study, and have a season of relaxation and sport in the
                  open air as well as his sister; and, after some coaxing, his father had
                  consented.
               So tutor and governess were relieved for a time, and there was a general stir of
                  hilarity. Adele and her mother only wore clouded countenances. It was quite
                  evident they were piqued, although they would not admit such was the case. Adele
                  declared she would not, could not stay in this "horrid Ireland," and Mrs.
                  Fortescue, her mother, when politely pressed to leave the young lady behind on her
                  departure, haughtily responded that "no persuasion could induce her to leave her
                  child exposed to certain influences." Poor me! if I thought at all, it was the
                  first time I surmised there was any influence about me.
               Of course after such insinuations there was no obstacle put in the way of their
                  speedy departure. Sir Robert was to accompany them to the English packet.
               It appeared the lady took occasion during the journey to advise and warn Sir
                  Robert.
               "It is about our dear Florence, so innocent and guileless, that I am most anxious.
                  Poor Grace is so, yielding (there might be two opinions about that,
                  doubtless thought Sir Robert), and she has become so accustomed to these people,
                  that she really does not perceive the danger; but we who see with English eyes,
                  are more, more—ah, you perceive?"
               "'Pon my word I do not," returned the gentleman, completely mystified.
               "Well—ah—you saw the quick repugnance of my Adele to that little low-bred
                  rustic?"
               "Yes, now you speak of it, I do remember. But I think I would give it another
                  name, my good cousin."
               "The name is of little consequence," said the lady, sharply, "it was the instinct
                  I noticed. But Florence, sweet child, seemed to adapt herself at once to the
                  circumstances; and it is to warn you, as a friend, against such tendencies, that I
                  venture to speak, Sir Robert. An aptitude to low tastes cannot too early be
                  repressed. Remember she is the child of my much-loved Grace,—let that be my
                  apology."
               There were some uneasy motions and clearings of the throat on the part of the
                  listener, as if he were undergoing the process of mental suffocation; still no
                  word was spoken.
               "But," continued the lady, "I would not have you misunderstand me. I do quite
                  admire the Irish."
               "Thank you, thank you," with a smile of somewhat dubious meaning playing about his
                  frank face, "I am, we are infinitely obliged to you for your flattering
                  opinion."
               "You mistake, my dear Sir Robert; I should never think of classing you with these people. You are
                  one of us."
               "Thank you, thank you again!" with the same questionable smile, "but I believe I
                  must decline the honor. I am no cosmopolitan,—I prefer to belong somewhere, and at
                  present I am quite content. In truth I must confess"—and here there was something
                  of haughty elevation in his tone—"I am rather proud of my home and
                  birthplace."
               All this I heard as Sir Robert repeated it to Lady Grace on his return. I suppose
                  he thought so stupid a little thing as myself would not understand the drift of
                  all this,—a rather risky experiment.
               "But," he continued, "you know she was under my escort, and gallantry would not
                  permit me to do otherwise than I did; but I longed to say to her as I do to you,
                  Grace, that I considered her a confounded fool."
               I fancied her ladyship did not listen to her husband with cordial sympathy, and I
                  was very sure she did not look on me with pleasant eyes. "It is unfortunate," she
                  sighed; "Adele would certainly have been a much better companion for our
                  Florence."
               "I'm not so sure of that," was the blunt reply, as Sir Robert rose to leave the
                  room.
               On the morning of her departure Adele had declared her sentiments in regard to me
                  without any of this circumlocution. I was wandering listlessly among the paths
                  about the house, anything but happy in this new state of things; I longed to see
                  Walter, and to be with my grandmother again. I was indeed miserable and lonely;
                  the garden and house were solitary; only the servants apparently were astir. I was
                  wiping away a few tears shyly, as not to be acknowledged even by myself, when I
                  was startled by the sudden appearance of Adele, who, gliding softly through the
                  low window of the drawing-room, where the maids were dusting, came hastily to my
                  side. She whispered in my ear hurriedly and sharply these words,—I remember even
                  now the thrill almost of fear with which I heard them:
               "How I hate you, you mean, sneaking little jackanapes! Nobody wants you here!
                  Everybody hates you as I do, except that silly Florence, and she'll soon find you
                  out!"
               To this hurried communication I had not a word to answer; in fact, it was all a
                  sort of muddle to me, the prominent thought in my mind being—what was there to
                  find out; what could it be?
               After the departure of these guests things began to work smoothly, and we entered
                  gleefully into the preparations for our gala days. Florence was to be dressed
                  loosely and coarsely like myself. Even Arthur was to be transformed into a country
                  lad, and with our dogs we were to be at liberty, under certain restrictions, to
                  range where we pleased. Oh, the pleasure of looking back on those days of freedom!
                  Freedom was the great idea; Florence was in an ecstasy, and Arthur also, as far as
                  his dignity would permit.
               Fortune had favored us in fixing our birthplace in one of the loveliest spots of
                  the island. Wicklow, "the Garden of Ireland," as it is called, is not as famous as
                  many other places for its antiquities, or the wildness of its scenery; but for
                  finished cultivation and picturesque loveliness it can hardly be surpassed. And fearing that my enthusiastic love for the
                  dear place may mislead my judgment into exaggerated statements, let me use the
                  words of another, who says,—
               "In this district of Ireland are to be found assembled a variety of natural
                  beauties, heightened and improved by the hand of art. Here we may behold lakes of
                  more than Alpine beauty; streams that wind through quiet dells or roll their
                  sparkling waters down rugged precipices; deep glens and sombre ravines where the
                  dark mountain-shadows make twilight of the summer noon; mountains whose bare and
                  craggy peaks seem to pierce the clouds; romantic woodlands, picturesque glades,
                  with fertile fields and warm, pleasant valleys, whose quiet pastoral beauties
                  remind us of the Golden Age."
               And this is neither an ideal nor an exaggerated picture. Among such fair scenes,
                  with youth and health, how could we fail of enjoyment?
               Of course it will not be supposed that in these childish explorations of our
                  beautiful island we looked on with either an appreciative or an instructed eye.
                  Our enjoyment was rather sensuous than sentimental. It was only in later years
                  that these scenes and sights became the living memories on which we loved to
                  dwell.
               It was customary to send for us to the drawing-room after our day of sport,—that
                  is if no company were present; and we were expected to relate our adventures, and
                  encouraged to speak freely of our rambles and pleasures. I could not possibly
                  overcome my shyness on these occasions, but Arthur and Florence rattled on without
                  restraint.
               "Indeed, papa," said Florence, after a jocose remark mark from Sir Robert that he
                  wondered whether I could talk, "Olive can talk; you ought to have
                  heard her when we were among the beautiful mountains to-day. Olive said more than
                  any of us, till she began to cry."
               "Cry?"
               "Yes; I hardly know what for,—but something she said about it making her feel like
                  kneeling down—as if—as if—oh, papa, as if God was there!"
               "Why, the little maid has the soul of a poet, after all. Come, my little girl, you
                  need not be ashamed."
               And drawing me kindly toward him, Sir Robert stroked my hair, as he looked in my
                  burning face with inexpressible kindness, and said, "You need not be ashamed, my
                  child. It was the natural instinct of worship, honorable to your intelligence and
                  heart."
               Of course I did not wholly understand these words, but I did understand the warm
                  approval, the cordial manner; these helped me to a confidence I greatly
                  needed.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               ADVENTURES.
               OUR holiday-month was drawing to a close. With something more than regret we saw
                  our four weeks of unfettered out-door life passing away; such regret as I fancy a
                  vagrant gypsy-band might feel when called in from their wild roamings to undergo
                  the restraints of conventional life.
               To me it had been a time of uninterrupted felicity. I had come to feel quite at
                  home with my young companions in these unrestrained days; joyous, innocent freedom
                  had for a time overcome my clumsy shyness, and bridged over the wide chasm of
                  social distinction between us. I forgot, and I think they also forgot, that any
                  difference existed.
               Arthur would occasionally, boy-like, assume authority, but this same authority was
                  equally exercised over his sister. He was a good leader, and would we always
                  follow his guidance (which we generally did) without question, then there would be
                  less occasion, he hinted, for the exercise of his superior masculine wisdom. Also
                  there would be fewer sneers—which a little fretted us sometimes, especially
                  Florence—at our girlish incompetency. But still these troubles were but momentary,
                  generally ending with a laugh. We had a great respect for the young gentleman, his
                  three additional years of life's experience giving him great importance in our
                  eyes, and as a matter of course it was our place to submit.
               And then Florence, like a sweet wild flower, kept the fragrance of beauty and love
                  around me, charming to awakened life those deeper emotions which in my duller
                  nature had laid comparatively dormant, and I clung to her with a sentiment akin
                  almost to adoration.
               She had grown so strong and blooming in this month of joyous liberty that it was a
                  pleasure to look at her. The fair, pale face was now as blushing as the rose, and
                  the brightness and elasticity of healthful life was in her every movement.
               "And must we," said her father, looking fondly at her, "again impose those rules
                  and restraints that nearly killed the child?"—Florence was jumping out of one low
                  window and in at another, her great dog, almost as high as herself, bounding after
                  her, while Arthur and I sat apart listening to what was said—"Yes, break her down
                  to them by clipping these butterfly wings. By Jove! Grace," he added, partly
                  aside, "I feel disposed to break loose and let her have her own way."
               "Be careful, Sir Robert," answered her ladyship, guardedly; "such sentiments are
                  dangerous for the young people to hear: our children are born to a certain
                  position, and we would fail in duty to them as well as to society were they not
                  fitted to sustain it."
               "Society," was the rather contemptuous reply; "and what is society? Is it our best
                  friend, our dearest and wisest, to whom we would turn for counsel and
                  encouragement? No, emphatically no; it is a bubble, a sham, forever working under
                  false pretenses. If I am up, it will puff
                  me still higher; if I am down, it will crush me still lower. Confound it, we are
                  society-slaves; it is not what we think best, it is what the world will
                  approve."
               Oh, dear! I thought, he must be very angry. I looked at his flushed face in alarm
                  as he sat bolt upright on the edge of his great, comfortable chair, beating an
                  impatient tattoo with his foot; and then I looked at Lady Grace; but there she sat
                  as unruffled as the flowers she was creating on the canvas in her
                  embroidery-frame.
               I was reassured. Her ladyship knew her husband well, perhaps better than he knew
                  himself, and felt there was no occasion for alarm. Large-hearted, impulsive, with
                  generous emotions easily roused, he lacked that persistency which would have made
                  his theories and notions effectual. The resolves of to-day with him would vanish
                  with the difficulties of the morrow. He loved ease, pleasure, and abundance; all
                  these he could command; why trouble himself about that he could not alter? after
                  all he might be in the wrong. And so his many resolves and plans about what might
                  be generally ended, and her ladyship had her way.
               Lady Grace loved the world and all its belongings; with her its wishes were final,
                  and its minutest decrees sacred as the laws of antiquity. An excellent person she
                  was, exact, conscientious, but limited in her loves and sympathies as she was in
                  her tastes and passions.
               But we were not yet to be deprived of our gypsy roamings. A note came from Miss
                  Lucas begging off for a few days, and Arthur's tutor had not yet returned; so
                  another day might be ours at any rate; and the Hall, too, was filled with guests;
                  there was some famous hunt going on, and we could very well be spared.
               This suited us exactly. There was one other exploration we wished to make. At
                  least Arthur had talked us, simple girls, into the desire. Oh, yes, we would, we
                  must go! It would be delightful; and yet all the time we had a secret
                  consciousness we ought not to go. The proposed expedition would not meet the
                  approval of our elders, in fact it would be, we knew, considered dangerous; and
                  although not in words forbidden, yet we understood it the same. The gorge, or deep
                  ravine, that bounded the Greyton estate, leading off we knew not where, we had
                  talked so much about, and listened to so many stories of its wild loneliness, that
                  I fear the spirit of adventure roused had deadened our sense of duty. We had
                  planned a secret expedition thither.
               "Oh, I do so wish we could go!" whispered Florence.
               "And I will go," was Arthur's bold rejoinder.
               "But papa and mamma—."
               "They will not know anything about it."
               "Oh, Arthur!"
               "You always take me up so quick. I mean we need not trouble them about it; papa
                  goes with the gentlemen to hunt in the morning, and mamma drives with the ladies
                  to the Dargle, intending to luncheon there. I heard them make all the
                  arrangements; so if we start early, before any one is up, we can be back before
                  they return, and then they will be saved all fear about us."
               The argument was hardly conclusive, even to our unsophisticated ears; but the
                  temptation was so strong, that even Florence at last yielded.
               Arthur won the good housekeeper over—although much against her judgment—to give us an early
                  breakfast in her room.
               It must be admitted that this secrecy and little dash of daring added much to the
                  interest of the thing. The early morning proved all we could desire; the air was
                  bright and beaming; it was an exhilaration to breathe it. All life and joy, we
                  glided noiselessly along the house-paths; our merry hearts were full of
                  anticipation of childish glee; Sappho following with becoming gravity, as if
                  impressed with the importance of his mission, carrying our little basket of good
                  things between his great jaws.
               We need not have had any fears of being discovered; the long line of windows in
                  the tall house were still tightly closed; even the servants were scarcely
                  astir.
               "I do wonder," said Arthur, with an almost contemptuous pity, "how people can shut
                  themselves in their close rooms, and lie in their beds such a morning as
                  this."
               "It is well for us they do not take a peep out," answered Florence, quickly.
               "Do you suppose I should care if they did, Miss Pert?" was the impatient reply;
                  adding with more dignity, "I do wish you would have less to say."
               Poor Florence was used to these rebuffs, but gave them little heed; at this time
                  it was doubtful if she heard; for, before his sentence was finished, she was in
                  full race over the park grass, scattering the diamond-drops of early dew without
                  any reference to wet feet or drabbled skirts. It was impossible not to follow, and
                  we were soon all with headlong speed making for the declivity we were to descend
                  to the stream.
               When we had descended the steep, zigzag path that brought us to the bottom of the
                  ravine, we were quite out of breath, but instead of sitting down to rest, we were
                  so impatient to see more that we pushed right on.
               The narrow path we kept alongside the stream made anything but pleasant traveling;
                  it was rough and uneven, often interrupted by masses of fallen stone from the
                  rocks above; but it would have taken many more difficulties than these to dampen
                  our adventurous ardor. We could climb and jump, but we had not calculated on the
                  fatigue a few hours of this jumping and climbing might bring, till, alas! we found
                  ourselves feeling very tired indeed. Still, with renewed courage and a cheering
                  word from Arthur we would again move on bravely.
               The clear water of the narrow stream that flowed by our path was bright and
                  bubbling; relieving, by its sweet and gentle murmurings, the profound stillness of
                  the glen, which had become almost oppressive.
               "Dear me, how quiet it is! where are we going?" asked Florence, in a frightened
                  tone, as her eyes wandered timidly over the steep, smooth sides of the wall that
                  now closed us in on either side. "Oh, dear, it is so dark and deep; let us go
                  back, Arthur! Come, Olive, I cannot stay."
               But Arthur's spirit rose with the occasion; he ridiculed such fears. "Go back! no
                  indeed," and again we started forward. We found it, however, hard work: even our
                  brave guide began to fail; and, indeed, it was beginning to be evident that even
                  if we wished we could not go much farther. The path was now a mere strip, and soon ended altogether against a
                  projecting ledge of rock too high to mount and pass over.
               We were now in despair; we had been hoping there might be some lowering of these
                  fearful walls, or some outlet where we could free ourselves from this prison; but,
                  alas, for these vain hopes, we were more shut in than ever. What would we do? Go
                  back? that was impossible, we were so thoroughly tired and we had passed over so
                  many dangerous, difficult places, we dare not face them again.
               Florence began to cry bitterly, "Oh, dear, we have been so wicked; poor papa and
                  mamma! We knew we ought not to have come. We will die, we will be lost in this
                  horrid place, oh, dear! oh, dear! And the mischievous fairies would love to drag
                  us into that deep water. They always come to such dismal holes, and when one has
                  been bad, too. Dear! dear! Kathleen told me so."
               Fortunately for me I never had a Kathleen to fill my young brain with imaginary
                  terrors. I began to look at the situation as it was before me. The water in this
                  narrowed strip looked most uninviting; it seemed as if the huge rock in the bed of
                  the stream had been cleft asunder to barely admit its passage. It was deep and
                  dark, there were no pebbly stones invitingly in sight, nor soft murmurs to beguile
                  away fear; but I will try it, I said to myself; and while Arthur was vainly
                  endeavoring to reassure Florence, I had slipped off my shoes and stockings and was
                  trying the depth of the stream. To my unexpected joy I found foothold; when with a
                  loud cry of exultation I sprang around the ledge, calling on the others to
                  follow.
               Such was the change, and such the sense of relief, that we were, for the moment,
                  wild with delight at our escape from the desolate ravine to the bloom of verdure,
                  sunshine, and light. Those great walls had receded, leaving this little spot of
                  enchantment, while still farther on we could see that although the hills were
                  still precipitous, yet they were evidently subsiding, and hope again revived.
               The midday sun was pouring its rays into our little valley, and revelling in its
                  warmth Florence and I spread our garments on its grassy banks, drying as best we
                  could our drabbled skirts; while Arthur, relieving Sappho of his charge, took out
                  the contents of the basket, and if ever hungry children and hungry dog enjoyed a
                  feast we did then.
               But now we must be moving again to find our way out. What was care or trouble to
                  us now? we were as blithe as the lark, refreshed and rested; Florence and I
                  singing loudly, while an occasional shout from Arthur made the old hills echo in
                  their reverberations as we rambled on, quite forgetting we were still miserable
                  wanderers, far away from home and knowing not whither we were drifting.
               We had proceeded but a short distance when we were startled by an unusual sound.
                  "What's that?" we all exclaimed, in breathless affright.
               "Oh, nothing," said Arthur, in a moment ashamed of his alarm; "it is only the
                  sighing of the wind, or the distant bark of a dog."
               "Yes, it is something else; don't you hear it again?" This time it was more like a
                  shout, and looking upward in the direction of the sound, we saw high up on the embankment, among the shrubs and bushes,
                  a handkerchief waving.
               In an instant all Florence's fears were gone; some one was suffering, some one
                  needed help, that was enough; and, making a spring, she began clambering up the
                  steep sides, catching from bush to bramble, till she reached the object of her
                  search.
               A gentleman had slipped and fallen, spraining his ankle. "Oh, dear, sir, what can
                  I do for you? you are very much hurt," were the first words she uttered, as almost
                  breathless she reached the top.
               By this time Arthur and I were beside her, he also making every offer of
                  assistance.
               "You are kind, truly," said the gentleman,—with a twitch of pain,—"and can help me
                  indeed; you see I am held fast. What should I have done if you had not been near?
                  I am too far from home to be heard there, and but few pass this way. I might have
                  suffered long and fearfully. Now, my young sir," turning to Arthur, "will you
                  enter those old walls,"—pointing to a huge pile we had not noticed before, rising
                  in solitary gloom above a point of rock on a curve of the ravine,—"and have them
                  send from there a couple of men to carry me home, and I will remain your debtor
                  for life."
               Arthur was off in an instant. The stranger had spoken so cheerily, and to our
                  young eyes looked so venerable and good, that involuntarily Florence and I, when
                  Arthur had gone, drew nearer to him with affectionate confidence.
               "And now, my little cherub," he said to Florence, as he looked pleasantly on her
                  sweet face, "come nearer, and whisper in my ear where you came from to save me.
                  Did you drop from that white cloud up yonder, or glide down on this sunbeam by my
                  side?"
               "Dear me! no, sir; nothing of the kind," was the answer, in all the directness of
                  her simple innocence. "I came, we all came, by the path below."
               "Then who may you be?"
               "I am"—was the reply, with that attractive, innocent directness so peculiarly
                  hers—"Florence Greyton, daughter of Sir Robert Greyton, of Greyton Hall; and
                  Arthur is my brother."
               "Ah, is that so?" and a pause followed, interrupted presently by Florence, who
                  asked simply, "Do you know my papa?"
               "Well, no—yes—hardly;" and as if to avoid further questioning, the gentleman
                  turned to me, saying, "Where did you pick up this sturdy little maiden,
                  Florence?"
               "Pick her up?" she repeated. "Indeed, sir, I did not pick her up. My mamma invited
                  her to come to me."
               "What, then, is her name?"
               "Olive, sir."
               "A very pretty name! but has she no other?"
               "Well, sir, I do not know. I believe not; have you, Olive?"
               Pride for once overcame my awkward shyness. To be a nameless thing—it was too
                  much! and with burning face I stammered out, "I have a name."
               "I knew you had," was the response in such a kind, encouraging tone, that it acted
                  as an instant soporific on my disturbed equanimity.
               
               "Come then and tell me it yourself, my little girl," as he reached out his hand
                  and drew me towards him.
               "It is Olive Lacey," I said, with almost a sob.
               "Lacey, Lacey, I know that name. Is your father Richard Lacey?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "And your father is Richard Lacey—strange, indeed! And your mother was—well, no
                  matter. Your father I knew well—a fine fellow;" and after a moment's pause, he
                  added, "Come nearer, child, and look right up in my face."
               I had been looking aside and blushing, and casting my eyes everywhere, but now
                  with a strange confidence, an almost yearning love, I raised my eyes to his. He
                  had won my heart for ever and ever by these kind words.
               Ah, they who are always smiled upon, and petted, and loved, are hardly aware of
                  the tumult of joy, the living sense of gratitude, a word of appreciation, a simple
                  smile of approval, may bring to the sensitive nature doubtful and uncertain of its
                  own worth.
               He looked long on my face, and then shook his head. "A nice, a good girl, I am
                  sure, but how unlike!"
               The attendants now came with all their appliances, when, raising their master on a
                  chair, we were soon all en route for the old castle. We had never seen anything
                  like it before. Gloomy enough it was, almost a ruin, the ivy hanging close over
                  its gray walls; but there was such a grandeur about it, so much of mystery in its
                  lonely isolation, that my imagination was fairly taken by storm.
               We passed through a low archway well secured by a portcullis at either end—those
                  heavy spiked gates of the olden times made to crush or fasten in the invading
                  foe—into a square or court from which you entered the habitable parts of the
                  building.
               The gentleman, amused at our wondering looks as they put him down in front of a
                  closed door, asked if it was not a curious old place. "But pleasant to me for all
                  that," he added. "It is my home, and some day I'll be proud to show you some of
                  the old relics it contains. But now you will excuse my not inviting you in. I must
                  have this unlucky leg at once cared for. I am in considerable pain; and then I
                  have an aged invalid sister whom it will not do to alarm, and she would be alarmed
                  did she suddenly see new faces. But I will take an early opportunity to see you
                  again, and express my great gratitude, my noble little deliverers. So now,
                  farewell."
               Of course, before we left, we disclaimed all thought of gratitude or return for
                  what we had done; we were only made too happy by having it in our power to have
                  done what we had. "And can we not do something else? Can I not find a physician,
                  sir?" said Arthur.
               "No, no, nothing else. I am something of a doctor myself; at least, with the help
                  of my good Philip here, I can manage this little matter. But about your getting
                  home, my little friends—it is too far for you to walk; it is much farther by the
                  road than by the pass you came through. And now, Thomas," turning to the other
                  man, "get the jaunting-car, with the pony, ready at once, and bring it round."
               We would rather have walked, but he would not allow it; at least we must be driven to the main
                  road, that was a couple of miles off.
               This seemed to be a day of unusual adventure. We had left the car but a few
                  minutes, and were walking along the road, when we saw, but a few steps ahead, what
                  appeared to be a bundle of rags, but on nearer approach we descried rising from
                  their midst the old patriarchal head of one we knew well. But it had never struck
                  us with such a sense of reverence before; we had only noticed the wonderful
                  combination of rags and patches. Now the sunlight shone on the white hair lying on
                  the bent shoulders, and the long snowy beard, and for a moment the wayside beggar
                  was transformed, to our eyes, into the embodiment of venerable dignity. Beside the
                  old man lay stretched full length on the grass a strange, misshapen lad, snapping
                  a whip and whistling a merry air with the keenest relish.
               The pair were quite familiar. We had often seen them in their repeated visits to
                  the Hall, where they were well cared for. Even my thrifty grandmother, who
                  despised all of their race, treated them kindly if they ventured as far as the
                  lodge.
               "Old Doughty" was the prince of beggars, one of those inveterate professionals to
                  the manner born, who think the world owes them a living, and who almost think they
                  do you a service by giving you the opportunity to exercise the sweet virtues of
                  charity. At any rate, poor old Doughty was not troubled with those nice
                  sensibilities that might lead to delicate scruples. He simply took what was given,
                  and, it might be, was only sorry it was not more.
               And his boy "Tim," or the "innocent," as he was called by the poor people,—which
                  means half-witted, or idiotic,—was an excellent accompaniment—a poor little
                  unfortunate he had picked up somewhere, carrying the boy about with him, and
                  proving his business capacities by this farseeing care of the future. For old
                  Doughty's supplies might have suffered by this increased demand, were it not for
                  the growing and varied interest excited in the community by the accomplishments of
                  this young hopeful.
               "Tim" was anything but an "innocent." He was, in fact, one of the shrewdest little
                  rascals that ever lived, his eye twinkling with an intelligence that few could
                  mistake; but cunning and dissimulation were the lessons he learned with his
                  earliest breath and to fool his betters was ever a source of supreme delight.
                  Deformed and stunted, he had learned to make capital of his infirmities, sometimes
                  exciting pity by his weakness, or again creating laughter by the contortions of
                  his supple frame.
               As Tim advanced in years he became a mine of wealth to the old man. The lad was a
                  natural musician, and from his ever-ready fife could bring forth the wildest
                  strains of native melody, wringing the hearts of the old to softened memories of
                  dear ones gone; "of days and hopes long passed away, ochone, ochone!" or, in
                  changing mood, his merry tunes would bring the lads and lasses to their feet,
                  whirling about in the gay dances of their country.
               This brought in half-pence and farthings in showers, and to these simple people it
                  sometimes seemed as if the old man was becoming rich. "Nae, nae, dears," he would say, with the most insinuating
                  sigh, "don't think so. It's he, the daft thing, keeps me the poor craythur I am.
                  Lord bless ye's, dears, it takes all I can gather to put the bit in his mouth and
                  cover his back, the ne'er-do-well! It was an evil day for poor old Doughty when he
                  laid eyes on the wee, decrepit thing;" and thus he would whine, but no one
                  believed him for all that.
               The old man was so fully occupied looking over the contents of his many bags and
                  bundles, that he did not notice us until right upon him, when, startled, he cried,
                  "Up, Tim, and do yer reverence to the quality; here's the young master and the
                  ladies."
               In an instant, the young scamp was on his feet, flourishing his apology for a cap
                  around his head, and throwing it down to the earth as he bent low in mock
                  reverence.
               There was mischief in his eye; we all laughed outright, we could not help it. His
                  short, ludicrous figure, his great shaggy head, with the overflowing sense of fun
                  revealed in his supple movements, excited our mirth irrepressibly.
               "Where's your fife, Tim?" said Arthur at once; "we want some music."
               "Sure and ye'll have it, masther," and the boy began to fumble among the many
                  folds of his old tattered jacket, and plunge his hands frantically into the
                  pockets of his many-colored unmentionables, exclaiming as he did so, "May I
                  niver,—by gorry if it isn't gone. Och, musha, musha!"
               "Gone!" screamed the old man in his piping voice, "gone! I'll have yer life,
                  ye—ye—limb of—"
               "Och, murther, an' here it is!" cried the mischievous imp, as he drew the fife
                  from the depths of the tattered mysteries that surrounded him, "here it is!" and,
                  quite regardless of the foaming rage of the old man, he raised it with a cool
                  professional air to his lips, saying, "An' now, masther and the young ladies,
                  what'll ye's have?"
               "Oh, anything," we all cried; "anything you please."
               And then he sent forth such a wail of melancholy, that I fear me Florence and I
                  might soon have been in tears, when Arthur, interposing, called out, "Come, now,
                  Tim, we don't want any of your dismals." Tim changed his style without loss of
                  time, and gave us one of the liveliest of jigs, which soon sent Florence and
                  myself spinning around like a pair of madcaps, Arthur clapping and cheering at the
                  top of his voice.
               The uproar and confusion I suppose bewildered the poor old man, for he soon cried
                  out, "Tim, ye divil, stop that screeching."
               Of course there was a sudden lull, but Arthur could not seemingly at once check
                  the exuberance of his spirits, and the next best thing was to tease Tim; so he
                  began by provokingly touching him lightly with his little whip on head or
                  shoulders.
               Tim bore this for awhile with laughing good humor, parrying the thrusts as best he
                  could with his fife. Thus they had crossed the road, the one backing and the other
                  following, until they reached the bank on the other side, when Tim, throwing down
                  his fife, cried out, putting himself in position, "Come, now, young sir, let's
                  have a fair 'bout with the natheral weapons."
               
               "Hurrah!" answered Arthur, delighted. He had been well instructed in what is
                  called the manly art of self-defense, and, squaring off, with scientific accuracy
                  of aim he made a playful lunge at the young savage.
               But, alas for recognized rules of combat,—we had scarcely realized what they were
                  about, when a trip, a helpless roll, and Arthur disappeared down the steep
                  embankment into the ditch below.
               Florence and I stood horror-struck and screaming wildly; while the old man,
                  starting from his lair, rushed across the road with garments streaming, and fell
                  upon Tim with murderous intent.
               "Bad luck to ye, ye murtherin' villain; ye unnatural baste, ye've ruined me
                  entirely! How can I look the ould masther in the face agin! an' he was my best
                  standby;" and with every fresh remembrance of what he had lost would come a
                  renewed volley of thundering blows, till, the yells of the prostrate lad becoming
                  fainter and fainter, it fairly seemed as if he were at his last gasp.
               "Oh, don't, don't!" we cried, forgetting all else as we ran to them; "you will
                  kill him; don't, don't!" And with our best efforts we tried to pull the old man
                  off, when to our great astonishment a corner of the old gown was gently raised,
                  and the horrid boy, thrusting out his shaggy head, winked knowingly at us, as if
                  to say, "Ye're a pair of dupes, it's only a lark!"
               Arthur now sprang up the bank, shaking the dirt and dust from him, hardly willing
                  to admit that his had been anything but a lark also, and telling the
                  old man he was not a bit hurt, it was only fun, tried at once to extricate Tim. He
                  had not been enlightened by our by-play, and really thought the boy was hurt. The
                  poor old man, completely exhausted by his impotent effort, could scarcely drag
                  himself back to the old bags and bundles, while Arthur with benevolent pity was
                  trying to comfort the artful little rascal at his feet.
               "Get up, now, Tim," he said, coaxingly, "get up; I'll help you."
               "Och, yer honor, I'm kilt; the ould brute has broken my bones, an' what is a poor
                  craythur like meself to do? If I had but enough to get a bit of plaster or a
                  crutch. Ochone!"
               "I'll give you money, plenty of money, Tim, only try to get up; here it is," and
                  the contents of one pocket went into the outstretched hand. A great struggle, and
                  Tim wriggled across the road a little way; but his groans and sighs continued
                  until both pockets of his dupe were emptied, and then he managed to throw himself
                  into the place he had left, a great relief indeed to all of us, for Florence and I
                  had again been most woefully deceived, and thought he might die on our hands.
                  Sappho seemed to be the only being of any sense or penetration among us; he
                  appeared fully to understand what was going on. We could scarcely keep him from
                  flying at Tim and tearing him to pieces, as if he thought him truly an unmitigated
                  scapegrace.
               Quiet being finally restored, we left amid a shower of blessings,—"May the heavens
                  be yer bed! may glory be with ye!"
               And we had the further satisfaction of knowing that Tim was quite restored to
                  health and spirits by the repeated whoops and halloos that reached us for some
                  distance on our way.
               "Of course you will not say anything to papa or mamma about this," said Arthur, a little nervously.
                  "You know they would not like our speaking to such people."
               "Oh, dear, no," both of us loyally exclaimed, although it was exceedingly doubtful
                  if Florence could restrain herself so much; "we will not say a word."
               "Now, if you do, Florence!" was the threatening rejoinder.
               "Upon my word and honor I will not. You are always so afraid," she added, with a
                  little pique; but in a moment after she was overflowing with the remembrance of
                  the merry things Tim had said. "Oh, it was such fun, such fun!"
               "Yes, that is the way it will be," said Arthur, fretfully; "it will all come out,
                  just like you!"
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               OLD ACQUAINTANCE.
               WE were not back to the Hall any too soon. In a short time we should undoubtedly
                  have been missed. The different parties had returned, and the dressing-bell for
                  dinner was sounding.
               We glided in unnoticed, and soon, under the skillful manipulations of Florence's
                  maid, she and I were made presentable in case we should be sent for.
               As we expected, during the early evening all three of us were sent for to the
                  family parlor to say good-night night to Sir Robert and her ladyship. "And how has
                  my beauty spent her day?" were the cheerful words of Sir Robert, as he kissed his
                  little girl.
               "Oh, papa, such times, such delightful times!" she exclaimed, her sweet face
                  glowing with all she had to tell. Arthur moved uneasily; but she was so full of
                  what she had to say about this gentleman who had so taken her fancy, that she
                  forgot all else. "He was so handsome, so pleasant, and so grateful to us for
                  saving his life!"
               "What, what! Saving his life? What does this mean?" was the astonished
                  question.
               And now Arthur came forward to explain.
               "Ah, that was fine; and what may be the gentleman's name?"
               "I think, sir, it is Massarene. I heard the servants say this as we went into the
                  castle yard."
               "Massarene, Massarene," repeated his father, a frown evidently gathering on the
                  usually pleasant face. "Massarene—well, my boy, I am happy you have had it in your
                  power to serve any one, but—but—" with increasing severity, "I thought my commands
                  were that you should not enter the premises or grounds of any one with whom I was
                  unacquainted?"
               "I know, papa; but what could I do?"
               And now Lady Grace interposed, and thought Arthur ought rather to be praised than
                  blamed for what he had done.
               "Well, we will let this pass, but I hope it will not be repeated."
               Florence, disappointed, eagerly cried out, "Oh, papa, don't say so; we were
                  invited to the old castle to hear all
                  about it, and he is such a dear old gentleman!"
               "Ha, ha, ha!" with a sudden turn of good humor. "That's rich! Dear old gentleman!
                  why, he is not as old as I am by some years."
               "Why, papa, I thought you said you did not know him," was the wondering child's
                  quick reply.
               There was no answer for a moment. It was evident, however, that something was
                  wrong, for the angry glance came again as he almost thrust her from him, saying,
                  "You are entirely too forward, Florence," and to Lady Grace, "cannot something be
                  done to restrain this child?"
               Poor Florence, as sensitive to blame as to praise from her father, turned away,
                  her great eyes filling with tears.
               But tears in the eyes of Florence were more than Sir Robert could well bear, and
                  calling her instantly back, he caressingly apologized for his hastiness.
               "I did not intend to say I did not know Mr. Massarene; but we have been long
                  estranged. A difficulty in our young hot-headed days separated us; since then I
                  have seen or heard so little of him, that I had almost forgotten such a person
                  existed. I do remember some years ago hearing he had gone into absolute
                  retirement; shut himself up in the old Abbey—Glen Abbey, as we used to call it—and
                  would not see any one. But I am glad he feels some interest in my little girl, and
                  happy indeed that she feels such an interest in him. I once loved him as myself. I
                  still love him, and will always venerate him for the high character he has
                  sustained. You and Florence," speaking to Arthur, "are at perfect liberty to enjoy
                  his friendship, only I cannot see him."
               We knew there was some mystery, but none felt at liberty to ask questions, and
                  with a pleasant goodnight we went to our own rooms; highly delighted with the way
                  matters had turned out.
               The time had come for me to leave. Florence was sobbing, "Oh, mamma, why cannot
                  Olive always live with us?" Even Arthur looked sorry. Sir Robert stroked my hair
                  as he kissed me good-by, saying I must come often to see Florence; every day, if I
                  chose.
               But Lady Grace put in a prudent reservation; she was sure Florence would wish to
                  see me often, and she, Lady Grace, would send a servant for me to the lodge
                  whenever I was needed.
               There was quite a serious time when I returned home. I cried and mourned with a
                  sullen persistency, until my grandmother, not much given to tender sentimentalism,
                  became angry and scolded me to silence, I sobbing, "I will be good, I will stop
                  crying; but I do so love Florence!"
               "Tut, tut, child," was the answer, but in a softened tone, "this will not do. Miss
                  Florence is a dear, sweet young lady, but her way through life will take her far
                  from you; she will soon forget, and so must you. I blame myself; I ought not to
                  have let you have a glimpse of this world, so different from our own; it only
                  leads to discontent. I well remember, saucy girl that I was, how poor and desolate
                  my mother's cottage seemed when I came from the grand folks, and how all her kind
                  words fell listless on my ear."
               
               "But grandmother," said I, interested, "the lodge does not seem desolate, it looks
                  to me sweet and pretty." And how could it seem otherwise, with its scent of roses
                  and woodbine and the shining cleanliness of everything about it, while my
                  grandmother herself, in this her vigorous old age, would have added dignity to any
                  abode.
               From this time it was understood to be a forbidden subject, this about Florence or
                  the Hall; nevertheless, I did not forget. Walter was my only comfort; to him I
                  could talk and secretly tell all my feelings.
               In a week or two we fell into our old ways, I doing what I was called to do under
                  grandmother's instructions during the day, and in the evening being taught by
                  Walter.
               Thus weeks went by; it was getting into the short days of winter, and not a word
                  or message from the Hall. Carriages passed often through the great gate; but I did
                  not see anything of Florence. Still my dream went on. In all my silent hours she
                  was with me, and I was living again in that atmosphere of light and beauty which
                  seemed her natural surrounding. I did not wonder at not hearing from her, or go
                  into any imaginings why it was so; I felt content in what I had enjoyed, as one
                  would with a jewel they never expected to wear, but considered themselves
                  inexpressibly rich in its possession.
               At length, early one afternoon, a summons came from the Hall for my grandmother.
                  Even then there were no speculations raised in my mind as to what this might mean;
                  I let her quietly depart without a thought, and I went on, seated at the little
                  diamond-shaped window, with my morsel of sewing, which my thrifty kinswoman always
                  insisted should be in my hands when not otherwise employed.
               She had dressed herself carefully, as she always did when summoned to the Hall;
                  and I could not but think as I cast my eyes up the long avenue and saw her still
                  upright figure moving slowly on, that she looked about as grand as any of the fine
                  folks there. The wardrobe of the old mistress, had fallen to her share, and the
                  well-preserved silk dress and mantle added dignity to her naturally fine
                  presence.
               Her return was delayed until the old elms of the avenue began to throw out their
                  darkening shadows; and when she did come back, and sat down in our little parlor,
                  her face looked more care-worn than I had ever noticed it before.
               I was always somewhat in dread of my grandmother. She had not spoken, but I
                  ventured to draw near and say, "May I not untie your bonnet and take off your
                  cloak, grandmother?"
               "No, dear," was the unusually kind reply, "I have a little farther to go yet."
               "You have not had your tea, and it is getting late," I again made bold to
                  remark.
               "That is true, child, but I have not the heart to eat till this matter is settled.
                  Do you know, Olive,—" with a sudden burst of feeling,—"they want to have you and
                  keep you at the Hall."
               "Me, grandmother?" I cried in unutterable astonishment.
               "Yes, child." It was some time before she could command her voice to speak, and I
                  answered, "But I will not go there,
                  grandmother. I will not leave you."
               And then she drew me to her, and talked with me with the most loving tenderness,
                  and I came to know, young as I was, that she would suffer a great deal more than I
                  would or could in this parting. "You are my all, Olive; but it is not our present
                  feelings, it is your future good we are to consider, and it is this takes me to my
                  wise, good friend, Mr. Massarene, for advice."
               "Mr. Massarene, grandmother? Why that is the name of the gentleman who said that
                  we saved his life."
               "Saved his life?" she repeated. "Saved his life? Is the child demented?"
               And then I tried to stammer out an explanation.
               "And why did I not hear this before?" was the angry inquiry.
               "Why, why, grandmother, "I began to cry, frightened, hardly knowing where the
                  wrong was, but aware that something was the matter—"you know you would not allow
                  me to speak about any of these things," and Walter, coming in, corroborated my
                  statement with telling energy.
               "True, true, children, this was ever my way; ready with the hasty word, closing
                  people's mouths, and then angry if they did not open them. I see it all now;
                  there's none to seek my counsel;" and she sighed, "but, I fear me, it is too late
                  to mend."
               It would seem the advice she sought favored the change; for, before long, I was
                  duly transferred to the Hall to be educated, trained, and reared as companion to
                  the daughter of the house.
               It seemed (although I only learned this in afteryears years) that Florence had
                  conceived such a deep-rooted affection for me that no efforts that were made could
                  eradicate it. She had been taken among friends and relatives in England and
                  distant parts of the country to divert her mind; but, never used to self-denial in
                  the slightest matter, the child, it was found, must have her way, or the
                  consequences might be painful; her life was so made up of emotion that her parents
                  became anxious about her health, and after due deliberation this proposition had
                  been made, and her little playmate was restored.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               A LEAF FROM IRELAND'S HISTORY.
               LET me still solicit the patient forbearance of the reader who has followed me
                  thus far, while I pause to make a few extracts from the history of this period,
                  before entering upon the main incidents of the next ten years of my life.
               It is the habit, I had almost said the fashion, of our English-speaking nations to
                  represent the Irish character in the most preposterous light. While we know that
                  education is the great leveler, and that the cultivated of all countries become
                  much alike in modes of communication and habits of thought, the Irish are
                  apparently made the sole exception to this rule. In the works of "distinguished"
                  authors,—travelers, novelists, etc.,—we
                  find such phrases put into the mouths of educated ladies and gentlemen as might be
                  expected from the peasant or workman, and the manners and language of the stable
                  transferred to the nobleman's drawing-room.
               So, from our travelers, we hear little of spacious cities, with their fine
                  buildings, parks, colleges, and flourishing commerce, or of thriving towns, fine
                  roads, and well-cultured lands, or of noble rivers, whose waters glisten with busy
                  sails, and whose banks are studded with the tasteful residences of opulent
                  proprietors. They prefer the description (perhaps intermixed with some
                  enthusiastic admiration of picturesque scenery, of bewitching lakes, grand ocean
                  views, etc.) of the miserable potato-patch, the mud-hovels, the squalor, filth,
                  and beggary of the Irish peasants. These themes are dwelt upon until the
                  imperfectly instructed almost incline to think there is nothing else to be seen in
                  Ireland. And the native-born, away from the influences of home, and, it may be,
                  somewhat timid and not over-patriotic, begin to be ashamed of their country, and
                  to feel almost like apologizing for their nativity. If there is any loophole of
                  escape, it will be caught at; it may be through some remote ancestor, who has been
                  fortunate enough to hail from some other clime, let it be Phœnicia, Egypt, or
                  anywhere else; and then, happily, they are Phœnician-Irish, Egyptian-Irish, or any
                  other Irish, rather than of the true Milesian type.
               The Irish are called, by their calumniators, turbulent, vindictive, and
                  unmanageable. Without admitting that this is or is not the case, let us say it is
                  fortunate we seldom find men unmitigatedly bad. Irish nature is human nature, and
                  the causes which lead to certain results are about the same with them as with
                  others.
               The Irish are a conquered people, and have been ruled by their conquerors over six
                  hundred years, and what are the consequences? We find the answer to this question
                  oftener in the writings of their enemies than of their friends; doubtless the
                  juster judgment would be found in the line between the two extremes.
               During these six hundred years many efforts have been made by the people to free
                  themselves from a very galling yoke, but one after another these have failed.
                  Perhaps no country ever received less sympathy in its struggles. There could be
                  many reasons given for this coldness, but the one sufficient and prominent is the
                  want of success. Success throws a halo of glory over efforts which the want of it
                  would sink to the level of contempt. All history attests this truth.
               Again, if successful, the wrongs which led to the struggle are forgotten; if the
                  effort, on the contrary, be a futile one, these wrongs become a rankling sore that
                  cannot be healed. Thus, with the people of Ireland, has been transmitted, from
                  generation to generation, a gloomy legacy of hate. But the worst effect has been
                  that produced upon the character of the nation. Irritable, reckless, impatient of
                  rule, they are a living proof that events have quite as profound a bearing on the
                  characteristics of races as of individuals.
               But it may be said that England and Scotland were also conquered countries, and
                  were ruled by their conquerors for centuries with the same contempt for their
                  laws, language, and institutions as was exhibited by the conquerors of Ireland.
                  Why not the same results? Simply because
                  of fortuitous circumstances. England became the seat of government and the home of
                  its invaders; a complete union of interests and races took place. In time, its
                  monarchs, its princes and nobles, were natives of the soil; and the land and name,
                  once despised, became the pride of conqueror and conquered. So with Scotland;
                  marriage and intermarriage gradually made of those who dwelt upon the borders one
                  people. In their bitter warfares, border feuds, and national animosities they were
                  still as one family, united by natural bonds that could not be severed.
               Not so with Ireland; in her isolated position she was a stranger to her rulers,
                  yet she must be ruled. So the favorite at court for reward of services, the
                  spendthrift lord, the needy adventurer, were well provided for out of Ireland's
                  misfortunes. Any one who would hold the reins tight enough might hope to be
                  happily appointed governor or viceroy of the king, to look after the affairs of
                  that miserable country, to raise money for his majesty, and to maintain home
                  authority. There was neither sympathy, common interest, nor affection to be
                  cultivated with the inhabitants. Those who went thither were as strangers and
                  aliens in the land. When they had attained a certain object, and received all they
                  could hope to obtain, they would leave the country forever. A present footing was
                  all they needed; and with a strong force to back their efforts, they found little
                  difficulty in creating dissension among the native, half-barbaric chiefs. A subtle
                  policy was maintained, in which the real promoters of feuds or outbreaks enacted
                  the part of apparent mediators, and came in, thereby, for the lion's share of
                  whatever booty was in question. This policy was continued even down to the days of
                  Queen Elizabeth, as is evident from a certain letter of her majesty's minister to
                  the then viceroy of Ireland, in which he says, "In these disorders are our
                  safety." "They must soon," he continues, "acquire power, consequence, and riches,
                  and the inhabitants may seek to erect themselves into an independent state;"
                  therefore, he infers, in these internal jealousies and divisions lies the only
                  safety.
               Later came religious animosities; and, in their train, obnoxious laws and cruel
                  persecutions. Then the demon of discord, uniting with whoever was in the
                  ascendency, inaugurated the cry of "No faith with the party down." Were that party
                  Catholic, then no faith with the heretic; were it Protestant, then no faith with
                  the Catholic.
               But we will leave these early times, where, as in the beginnings of all
                  communities, we find the quick emotions and stronger passions have their sway, and
                  come to a later period, where we expect that with the progress of intelligence
                  these rudimental ills will disappear, and a more thoughtful wisdom guide our
                  councils.
               In this year, 1782, by the united determination of the people, without reference
                  to sect, condition, or creed, a great moral victory had been achieved.
               In the strong vitality of the native character, and in the immense recuperative
                  powers of this beautiful island, she had outlived in a great measure the
                  accumulated difficulties that had so long retarded her progress, and riches,
                  prosperity, and intelligence were abundant; not so widespread by any means as they
                  should be, but still enough so to give
                  the people a right to demand a yet further lifting off of their burdens.
               In protecting the commerce and trade of England and Scotland, Ireland, with her
                  activities and greater facilities for these, was found to be in the way. The
                  lesser must give way to the greater, and so she was crippled; her most valuable
                  exports were so hampered and restricted, as to be rendered almost valueless. So
                  with some of the most flourishing trades; they were so burdened that they fell
                  into disuse. And now they said these burdens must be removed. And they were
                  removed. And they said, also, "We must have our own free parliament, independent
                  of British legislation; we must be judged by our own laws without the appeal to a
                  higher tribunal." And even this was granted them; and there was a general
                  rejoicing all over the land. The gentleman of leisure, the doctor, the lawyer, the
                  merchant, mechanic, farmer, and peasant, all, all rejoiced.
               But alas! alas! this universal joy was rather premature. There were the promises,
                  but not, as yet, the realization of these promises. These concessions had been
                  forced, and they were felt to be so by the mass of the people; therefore they
                  failed to elicit that gratitude they would otherwise have done.
               In this year, also, the revolt of the American colonies was drawing to a
                  successful close. The French revolution was in fierce progress. Thrones were
                  tottering. The divine right of royal lines was being doubted, and a stronger faith
                  in the power of self-government was fast gaining ground. Therefore the home
                  government dare not turn a deaf ear to the reasonable demands of its Irish
                  subjects. But government had still the power to madden, irritate, and put
                  obstacles in the way; and if, in the progress of my narrative, I may be obliged to
                  relate some things that, to the just-minded, may seem incredible, I can only refer
                  them to the statements of the times, wherein they will find mention of still
                  grosser outrages, that I would not even dare to relate.
               "I have," said Lord Moria, in his speech in the English house of lords, "a
                  knowledge of these tortures and cruelties of which I speak, so revolting to all
                  our ideas in the present civilized state of the world; and, I must say, I have
                  seen the most disgusting tyranny in Ireland that ever any nation groaned
                  under."
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               LIFE AT GREYTON HALL.
               FIVE, yes, six more years passed contentedly away—six quiet years in which there
                  were few events worthy of record, yet their influence in the after-circumstances
                  of my life was keenly and deeply felt.
               Sir Robert and Lady Grace fulfilled every promise made to my grandmother,—nay,
                  even more. I was not only cared for as a favored dependent, but almost or quite as
                  though I were a daughter of the house. Florence knew no half-way measures in her
                  generous and unselfish love for me; I was educated under the same masters, clothed
                  as expensively, and I joined in all her
                  amusements; she would have it so, playfully introducing me as her twin-sister.
                  Were we not born on the same day? she would say in her loving persistency.
               We became more closely knit together, perhaps, because of the opposite qualities
                  which characterized us, and were mutually benefited by the contact of contrasting
                  dispositions. I unconsciously caught from her delicate grace a certain pliancy,
                  while she gathered from my native obduracy of temper a firmness lacking in her
                  own. Ours was indeed a happy, thoughtless girlhood, with no fears for the future.
                  And why should we fear? Health, joy, and sunshine, were all we knew; and did a
                  little cloud at any time drift into our horizon it only made the light more
                  intense when it disappeared. Youth does not analyze, it simply desires and
                  accepts; it is only in later years the emotions born of our susceptibilities are
                  fully developed; and then it is that, accordingly as our capacity for nice
                  distinctions is sharpened and quickened by the growth of the intellect, so will be
                  the acuteness of our sense of suffering, if suffering comes.
               But, at present, we were in the happy state of unquestioning acceptance; at least
                  I was. I soon became accustomed to that which was so fully accorded me, and seldom
                  questioned my right to the gift.
               Seldom, I have said; yet, even in the midst of my happy thoughtlessness, there
                  were moments, only occasional, however, when I was made to feel that, though one
                  of the household, I was not one of the family. Lady Grace, I conceived, did not
                  like me, and would rather not have had me there. But in this I might be mistaken;
                  her ladyship was not demonstrative. Her temperament was cold, formal, and precise;
                  even to her daughter, who was her idol, she seldom showed marks of warm affection;
                  but she was just and highly conscientious; and I could remember so many of her
                  acts of kindness that I was always ashamed of myself when I got into these
                  doubting moods, and would make every effort to drive off such ungrateful
                  thoughts.
               Arthur, in our days of early roaming, had become so accustomed to the society of
                  Florence and myself, that, apparently, he could not altogether abandon it. His
                  dogs and ponies had lost their interest; and he so managed it that many of our
                  studies were recited together; indeed, in some of them, we had the same masters
                  from the city; and, in the long winter evenings, with our books and lamp, we would
                  sit round the little table, and, under the supervision of tutor or governess,
                  prepare our lessons for the next day; or else, in the late summer twilight, take
                  our seats on the grass and work away until time for rest.
               We liked it much; never tiring; for where Florence was there was an endless
                  variety. She was quick as thought in mind and action. Arthur was slow; it was
                  difficult for him to comprehend; and when she had dashed through with her lessons
                  he would still have to plod on; this irritating him, no doubt, there would be
                  sharp words if she disturbed him, which she usually did, in her light, airy way,
                  at such times, and then the war began. "You are such an incessant chatterbox,
                  Florence!" and "You are such a stupid, Arthur!" till Miss Lucas would interfere,
                  lecturing Florence on the impropriety of a young lady using such language, and
                  declaring she was afraid she would have to report to mamma.
               
               "Oh, do not, dear Miss Lucas!" would be the penitential cry.
               "Well, I wish you would," Arthur would say. But I fear had the lady done so she
                  would have created a very uncomfortable state of affairs for herself; for although
                  the lad was at times disposed to be sarcastic and severe himself, yet he would
                  allow no one else that liberty. He loved his sister dearly, and thought her all
                  but perfect. With myself he got along more quietly; I was not so much in his way.
                  That silence so natural to me stood my shield; I could be angry, provoked, and
                  blame severely, but fortunately I could keep it all to myself, and then it would
                  be forgotten without mischief being done; but Florence, in the artless singleness
                  of her nature, knew no such self-repression.
               In this six years we had been much with Mr. Massarene, and learned to love him as
                  our best friend. Lady Betty had told us all about him. And this reminds me that I
                  have not yet introduced her ladyship to the reader.
               Lady Betty Nugent, a maiden lady of strong character, was Sir Robert's aunt, his
                  mother's youngest sister. She was now past her three-score years and ten, but
                  still strong and vigorous in mind and body. Many called her eccentric; but her
                  eccentricities consisted more in living out her own true self-hood than in
                  anything else; there was nothing artificial or made up about her ladyship. Blunt,
                  plain, strong, she had no sympathy with weakness, nor patience with any mediatory
                  measures of conciliation. "A wrong is a wrong," she would say, "and anything you
                  may urge cannot make it right;" and such invariably would be the testy old lady's
                  last word in an argument.
               An ardent lover of her country, she would hear to no apology for the stranger's
                  rule therein. There was but one thing to do, "Drive them out! Do you think I would
                  make terms with the robber who sought to force my door and take possession of my
                  house? No; it would be compounding a felony, Sir Robert!"
               Poor Sir Robert would be in despair whenever he ventured on this disputed ground.
                  Even though one-sided, and judging mostly from her prejudices, there was so much
                  directness and so much energy in her arguments that it was difficult to put them
                  aside.
               She loved her nephew, but she looked upon him as rather pusillanimous. "He is not
                  a Nugent," was her favorite remark, "or he could not be ruled as he is." She did
                  not like Lady Grace. "She is a prig," said the old lady, her nose becoming more
                  elevated and the lines around her mouth more tightly compressed as she reiterated,
                  "She is a prig!"
               But this dislike could be very easily accounted for. Lady Grace was an
                  Englishwoman; and, to Lady Betty's mind, nothing good could come out of that
                  country.
               Neither was Lady Grace partial to her Irish aunt; she too had her prejudices; but
                  for her want of partiality in this instance she had some reason. Lady Betty could
                  be very disagreeable when she chose; and, it must be admitted, she too often
                  chose. And then Lady Betty had seen fit, in religious matters, to join herself
                  with the Dissenters; and, to the mind of Lady Grace, this was about as serious a
                  falling off though she had lapsed into
                  Catholicism. "It is a dangerous precedent," she had said to the rector's
                  appreciative wife, "this thinking for ourselves, and deciding for ourselves away
                  from established authority. It may do for the common people; it amuses and
                  satisfies them; but for us, with the eyes of the world upon us, it is dangerous,
                  very dangerous!"
               Of course Lady Betty had few intimates, and necessarily lived much alone in her
                  old dilapidated home by the sea. In this home she had spent her early childhood;
                  and now she was wearing out in it the few remaining days left to her.
               But she was neither despondent nor unhappy. There was such a fierce energy in her
                  character, such a powerful antagonism to all that she considered wrong, that her
                  mind, ever active, still working, dispelled all loneliness, while it brightened up
                  the old dark chambers with the phantom opponents with whom she was ever
                  battling.
               Her income was limited; but she managed to keep up the old state with all its
                  paraphernalia. The old family coach, servants, and liveries, with the diamonds and
                  the velvet train, if ever she felt disposed to honor Sir Robert's drawing-room by
                  her presence on any special occasion, were all made to do duty.
               With all her warfare with the world, and her anger at its ways and doings, there
                  was one love had crept into her soul unawares which had its own softening
                  influence. She loved Florence, the sweet Florence, with all the love of her heart.
                  Of Arthur she was proud. "Yes, he will redeem the honor of his family," said the
                  old lady, eyeing the lad approvingly, when sometimes in our talk he dilated with
                  boyish enthusiasm on his love of Ireland and Ireland's people. To me she was
                  always kind; but Florence was her darling. Perhaps in the young girl she discerned
                  another phase of that frank fearlessness of character which was her own
                  distinguishing peculiarity. "She has the Nugent blood in her veins," said Lady
                  Betty, triumphantly. But she did not perceive the essential point of
                  difference,—with Florence these spontaneous impulses so freely expressed, that
                  singleness of purpose that knew no guile, were all influenced by the one
                  motive-power of her nature,—love,—true, genuine, human love.
               But it would be doing Lady Betty injustice to insinuate that she was entirely
                  controlled by the opposite qualities. She was too apt to judge hastily, and not
                  always wisely; she allowed her better nature to lie dormant, and made use of her
                  discernment rather to see faults than reasons for pity and forgiveness; but her
                  intentions were right; it was in outward acts she failed.
               Mr. Massarene was one of her few favorites. "Only he lacks spirit," she would say,
                  "though he worked hard, I admit, in that corrupt parliament, which all of you, no
                  doubt," looking round on our three listening faces, "hear talked of as the
                  'bulwark of Irish liberty.' Pshaw! But what could he do against English
                  pretension, English gold? he was disgusted, he was disheartened, and left. But I
                  would have let them tear my eyes out before I would have succumbed to their
                  injustice; yes, that I would!"
               And none of us doubted she would.
               "And then to think of his shutting himself up in that old rookery to take care of
                  a mad sister!"
               
               "Mad! Oh, Aunt Betty, Mr. Massarene says she is an invalid."
               "Invalid! fiddlesticks! she's as mad as a March hare, and fancies herself the
                  Virgin Mary, or some other wonderful personage, and he humors her in it they say.
                  But she was always a feather-brained thing; when we were girls together her head
                  was turned with vanity; and then she must go to Rome to worship the pope and idols
                  there. Probably she tired of praying and counting her beads; at any rate, the
                  result was, she married some Italian prince, who proved to be a scamp and deserted
                  her. The little wit she ever had then left her, and penniless, starving and alone,
                  her brother found her in the Eternal City; pope, priest, and all having forgotten
                  such a one had ever been; but he brought her back, and has devoted himself to her
                  ever since."
               "Poor lady," said the sympathetic Florence, almost in tears, "and how good of
                  him!"
               "Well, as for that, he owed her much; she was enough older to be his mother, and
                  when he was left a helpless infant she was as a mother to him."
               "Then it is good in him to remember it so gratefully, isn't it, Aunt Betty?"
               "So it is, my child," was the answer in her gentlest voice. She always spoke
                  gently to Florence when speaking to her personally.
               These were indeed hours of unmixed pleasure to me, as I sat with the others in
                  that dark, wainscoted room, listening to the firm voice of the old lady, when
                  disposed to talk to us, and the continuous dash of the white wave as it foamed
                  around the rocks beneath the windows.
               And how much we heard there that we would not have heard elsewhere, nor would have
                  been permitted to listen to now had the theme of our conversation and the
                  influence it had upon us been known.
               Lady Betty was an uncompromising rebel; and love for her country and for its
                  freedom burned as a flame within her breast. She had studied its language, and in
                  her native tongue had read its traditions,—its histories,—the poems of its ancient
                  bards, with all their fervent mixture of war, love, and wrong.
               These she would translate for us, in all the rich abundance of their own
                  figurative rhetorical exuberance, till our enthusiasm was roused to the highest
                  pitch, or again, when a deeper pathos moved the song, the melting tones of its
                  agonized sorrow would tear our young hearts with an anguish of tenderness and pity
                  we had never before known.
               "Aunt Betty," Arthur would say, in the height of his enthusiasm, "I will be a
                  soldier, and help make my beautiful country what it might be if free from this
                  self-imposed thraldom."
               "No, my lad, the Greytons never were soldiers; and denunciatory and uncompromising
                  as I may appear, I am not for the spilling of blood, or for having men meet as
                  wild beasts to bite and tear each other in order to right a difficulty. But you
                  may serve your country in a much better way, if you and all like you prepare in
                  the honest uprightness of your hearts to meet the arguments of those self-seeking
                  sycophants who persuade the unthinking, and those afar off that do not know us,
                  and those whose interest it is to have it so, that it is best for poor Ireland to
                  remain as it is. Meet them and confound
                  them on their own ground; let that be your work, my boy."
               These were dangerous sentiments to instil into the mind of the coming
                  representative of the loyal house of Greyton, and would have caused great
                  confusion in its household had it been known; but there was nothing in the society
                  at the Hall, nor in the spoken sentiments of his parents, to call for frankness of
                  expression on political matters; indeed, they had ever been studiously avoided
                  before us, and therefore our conclaves continued unchecked. Arthur was now
                  approaching manhood, with few fixed ideas on these matters; but his feelings were
                  roused, and his sympathies, it must be admitted, were all with his country.
                  Whether he was of the material to make a determined stand for its benefit had yet
                  to be proven; but we went on, day after day, in our afternoon freedom to gallop
                  our three miles to Darkcliff, as we playfully called it, to place ourselves under
                  the spell of Lady Betty's fascinations.
               And Darkcliff was a most appropriate name; for, truly, everything was dark around
                  Lady Betty's little domain. If we left the Hall in the glowing sunshine, and raced
                  along the hedge-bound roads, and by the meadows, with the afternoon sun
                  brightening the many colors of the wild flowers, buttercups and daisies, yet, as
                  we neared the close, heavy-studded gate, and entered within its walls, all was
                  dusk and shadow again.
               The old trees, stunted by the ocean breeze, closed their heavy leaves and tendrils
                  close around the eaves, gables, and parapets of the ancient manor; even the little
                  piece of ground facing the sea was darkened in this continuous shroud; only under
                  this low mass of foliage could there be caught occasional glimpses of the moving
                  waters beneath, to lighten up the perpetual gloom.
               But I liked this darkness, and the rolling of the waters, and the hazy mists
                  forever rising; they suited my mood, and threw about the place a dreaminess and
                  mystery I loved. Still, I knew there was little of shadow or mystery around our
                  straightforward Lady Betty; but in the quiet and darkness, listening, listening,
                  the imagination could take flight and dream and wonder, and shape out its own
                  world of mysteries.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               AN OLD CASTLE, AND ITS INMATES.
               IN the early days of our visits to Glen Abbey we had not seen anything of Mr.
                  Massarene's sister; and, although Lady Betty had raised our youthful curiosity in
                  regard to her, we were, of course, too considerate to let this appear.
               With Mr. Massarene we had become quite intimate. The venerable aspect he first
                  presented to our young eyes had quite worn away. We were charmed with his gracious
                  manner, his commanding appearance, and always anticipated our visits to his place
                  with great pleasure. He had shown us many of the mysteries of the ancient edifice:
                  its dark prisons, its unroofed towers, through whose mouldering loopholes wary watch was kept in the olden time, and
                  from which the archers sent forth their weapons of death on the approaching foe,
                  or guarded the persons of the goodly abbot and his followers should they choose to
                  disport themselves on the greensward of the valley below. But the religious uses
                  of the old castle had long since passed away, and in later times it had been, as
                  far as possible, the peaceful residence of the lords of the soil. But farther than
                  the few apartments appropriated to Mr. Massarene's individual use we had not yet
                  penetrated.
               One day he said to us, "You have not seen—would you like to see the few pictures
                  left in the old gallery? Come, follow me."
               "I am very sorry," said Arthur, as we passed through some long-disused passages,
                  "to find you still continue lame, and cannot yet do without a cane; your injury
                  must have been more severe than you supposed."
               "No; you mean the slide on the precipice? Well, that was bad enough, but a few
                  weeks got me over it. This lameness is of many years' standing, the result of a
                  youthful episode." And, seeing our questioning looks, he added, with a smile,
                  "Perhaps I may some day tell you all about it."
               We were now in the gallery,—a long, narrow apartment, lined with the dark arbutus
                  wood, the native growth of the country, whose dusky hue made the place seem
                  gloomy. There were many old family portraits on its walls, dignified, austere, and
                  unsmiling, as though questioning our right to be there; but there were other
                  pictures to take our attention, exquisite gems, well calculated to attract even
                  the uninitiated, and our host seemed to enjoy much the crude criticisms he
                  heard.
               I had wandered on alone, charmed, but incapable of expressing what I felt, as the
                  others could so engagingly, when most unexpectedly I came to a painting so
                  different from all the rest that it held me spell-bound; and I gazed awe-struck,
                  in a transport of admiration, with my whole soul in my eyes, till tears
                  overflowing, I found them coursing down my face. Ashamed, indeed, I hastily wiped
                  them away, when I saw Mr. Massarene standing by my side.
               "Ah! I see you appreciate this wonderful work, Olive," he said, putting his hand
                  gently on my shoulder; "you must have something of the artist's soul."
               I could now have sobbed aloud. "This is an original," he continued; "the work of
                  that good old monk, Fra Angelica; and truly," he said, looking up reverently at
                  the forms before him, "no waking eye could ever have looked on the faces he
                  portrays; it must have been in dreams or visions he beheld the ideal loveliness
                  caught, as by inspiration, upon his canvas. In the solitude of his cell, in lonely
                  hours of meditation, such beings, stepping over the border-land, must have
                  revealed themselves, the loving types of what we deem purely imaginative
                  conceptions."
               My attention, taken from the painting, was now held by the glow and enthusiasm of
                  the speaker; he seemed to make the beautiful creation a part of himself; and
                  Arthur and Florence, coming up, became as much absorbed as myself in all he said,
                  as we grouped around him.
               At this moment we were startled by an unusual noise at the extremity of the
                  gallery, and looking quickly up we saw a
                  hand putting aside a piece of hanging tapestry, from beneath which a tall figure,
                  most fantastically attired, followed by a shorter one equally strange in
                  appearance, came towards us.
               In an instant we conjectured this must be the Lady Annastene we had heard so much
                  about, and the other person, who was dressed as a nun, was probably an
                  attendant.
               We were, however, much alarmed, and could not avoid showing a little trepidation,
                  and Mr. Massarene was evidently annoyed. "I might have known this!" we heard him
                  mutter.
               The lady slowly approached with great dignity. There was something almost regal in
                  her style and demeanor. She bore a strong resemblance to her brother, or rather he
                  to her,—there were the same high features, the same fair complexion; but she was
                  now in extreme old age, wasted and pale, her face almost ghastly in its pallor;
                  but her eyes, bright and dazzling, burned as though lighted from a fire
                  beneath.
               Her dress was peculiar, probably one of those in which she had shone triumphantly
                  in the days of her power, when admiring eyes followed her every movement, in those
                  gay saloons. A rich, embroidered silk of brilliant color, with flowing train,
                  swept the floor; and on her shoulders was thrown a short scarlet mantle caught by
                  a heavy chain, from which was suspended a large gold cross. Her head was crowned
                  with a glittering tiara, bright with many a gem, while her hair, white with the
                  frost of age though still abundant, fell in profusion around her person.
               As she drew near she frowned darkly on us; and turning ing sharply to her brother
                  demanded who we were, and if we knew who she was.
               "I fear not, Annastene."
               "Then instruct them in their duty."
               When, bending down, he whispered impressively, "Kneel, my dear young friend, and
                  kiss the lady's hand."
               Instantaneously, without thought, I at once obeyed; indeed, I was in such a state
                  of terror I hardly knew what I was about.
               The action, however, pleased her, for laying her hand gently on my head she
                  murmured some words, as though in blessing. And then her brother, before she had
                  time to turn to Arthur and Florence, who stood gazing in mute astonishment, took
                  her hand in the most deferential manner, begging to have a few words with her, and
                  led her away, followed by the silent attendant. Passing under the drapery, they
                  disappeared, and we heard a door close quickly behind them.
               We looked at each other bewildered; the thing had passed so quickly it seemed like
                  some shifting scene in a drama. "I am so frightened!" said Florence; "I wish we
                  were at home."
               Mr. Massarene soon returned. He looked dejected and sad. I felt a strange pity
                  fill my heart for him.
               "My poor sister!" were his first words, and turning to me he said, "Olive, will
                  you forgive me for asking you to so humiliate yourself?"
               "Humiliate myself!" I spoke low, with half-stifled utterance, still full of that
                  great pity. "No, sir; no, Mr. Massarene, it is no humiliation to kneel for the
                  blessing of such a venerable lady."
               
               "Thank you! thank you!" he repeated, with touching tenderness; "you are right. A
                  certain homage to some ideal is all she asks, and we might well afford to indulge
                  the innocent fancies of one so afflicted as she."
               I know not whether it was my ready obedience, or from some other unaccountable
                  cause, I was always, after this, marked by her peculiar favor; and when the many
                  infirmities of old age crept over her, and the tension of the irritated nerves was
                  stilled, and she sat in her soft, rolling chair, helpless as a little child, then
                  she loved to have me by her, holding my hand, smiling, and caressing me, as though
                  I took the place of some one far back in the indistinct, misty memory of her faded
                  life.
               
               But a few years more, and childhood, with all its gay, light, keen, but evanescent
                  emotions, was passing away, and the real play of life, whether for tragedy or
                  comedy, was opening for us. Florence and I were now seventeen; and Arthur, three
                  years older, had finished his studies, and was to travel until he had attained his
                  majority, or, at least, within a short time of it.
               This separation was our first great trial, at least we considered it one of the
                  gravest importance; for a time we were inconsolable, the interest and zest seemed
                  taken out of everything, and in the companionship of our mournings and
                  sentimentalities we enjoyed all the luxury of our first days of woe.
               But this could not last; the buoyancy of life and health was too strong within us;
                  and soon returning hours brought with them their desires, and our many vows to
                  devote thought, feeling, everything, to the contemplation of the dear absent one,
                  began to vanish into thin air.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               YOUTHFUL PATRIOTISM.
               ARTHUR was away. He had graduated creditably from Trinity College, Dublin, and was
                  now traveling with his tutor, expecting to be absent until he attained his
                  majority.
               Every week there were letters from him,—long letters to his father and mother,
                  descriptive of the places he visited and the people he met. With these generally
                  came two dainty notes for Florence and myself,—his little sisters, as he styled
                  us. These billets for our own special perusal were brimming with youthful
                  vivacity, and were fresh and loving as their boyish author.
               The reception of these epistles and inditing suitable answers to them occupied a
                  large portion of our time, one perusal and discussion of their contents being
                  altogether too brief a consideration of documents so important. Every little
                  incident in our daily lives became vivid and interesting, because we were to
                  describe it to Arthur. Daily visitors, daily discussions, the excitement of the
                  times, which I, especially, felt without really comprehending, made up a large
                  portion of our letters.
               Sometimes the little notes which I received were so ardent in expression, I shrank from showing them to
                  Florence. Mere boyish words, perhaps, but I blushed as I read them: "He must fly
                  to me!" "He could not live without me!" These were dangerous words; I felt them
                  so, by the echoes they awakened in my own heart. I must battle against every
                  inroad of sentiment such as this. Who was I, to dare indulge in or awaken such
                  feelings as these? I might, however, love him as a brother—perhaps that was all he
                  meant—a dear, good, loving brother. I wondered if he used such endearing,
                  heart-stirring expressions to Florence, but I could not ask.
               And then other letters came to me, more lengthy, full of inquiries about the
                  country. He was hearing most unfavorable reports. Could I not get him some
                  reliable information through Mr. Massarene or Walter? The English papers were
                  filled with contradictory statements; they urged such severe measures that
                  sometimes his fears, sometimes his indignation and patriotism, were roused. "A man
                  must be a patriot," said Arthur, "and stand by his own people if he is a man at
                  all. For my part, my blood boils as I read the slanders that are published against
                  Ireland. The turbulent Irish, forsooth! 'Crush them,' cry the cold-blooded
                  Englishmen; 'force is the only thing they understand.' Let them dare attempt it,
                  we will see what Ireland's sons can do! But, Olive, gather all the facts for me,
                  will you? Let me know, and quickly, how things are with the dear old land."
               When in England, Arthur grew still more excited, as still wilder statements and
                  stranger rumors reached him from day to day.
               "It is a fashion here," he wrote, to throw everything Irish into contempt. I am
                  constantly in open warfare with those about me: I vindicate my country; they
                  condemn it. Then I am angry with myself for being so roused by those who only
                  judge by their prejudices, and whom I should treat with silent scorn. I am
                  astonished to find how little is known of our country and people, even among those
                  most intelligent."
               These letters I showed to Mr. Massarene, who read them calmly and
                  thoughtfully.
               "Is there not hope for our hardly-used country," I exclaimed, impatient for a
                  response to my own enthusiasm, "when its young men hold such sentiments, and are
                  ready to make such sacrifices? Oh, is he not generous-hearted and noble, Mr.
                  Massarene?"
               "Generous and noble he is, Olive, but—"
               "Oh, do not say 'but'; let it be all right."
               "But I must say I do not see the sacrifice, as yet. He is young, my girl, and has
                  yet to be tried." Then seeing my crest-fallen countenance, he added, kindly, "But
                  I hope he may prove all you anticipate."
               I was disappointed. I thought Mr. Massarene, who had inspired us with patriotic
                  fervor, and had always himself manifested so warm an attachment to his native
                  land, would have been elated as myself at finding Arthur's attachments like his
                  own. But then I whispered to myself, "Mr. Massarene is old; and that, they say,
                  makes people cautious,—he does not wish to venture a decided opinion. I find it so
                  in a great many other things."
               I was walking through the lane that led from Mr. Massarene's grounds to the back avenue of the Hall,
                  as I pondered my disappointment, when, looking up, I saw Walter approaching. "Ah,"
                  I thought, "Walter will understand all this; I will tell him what Arthur says."
                  With restored equanimity, I smiled and greeted my friend perhaps more cordially
                  than usual. I delivered Arthur's message desiring some information from him, and
                  read some passages in Arthur's last letter, which I deemed aglow with
                  patriotism.
               Walter listened as I read, but there was quite a pause before he answered; then he
                  said abruptly, "If he is in England and so near us, I think he might come and hear
                  for himself. Such as he are much needed now, I can tell you, Olive. If he feels
                  all he says, let him come home, and that at once."
               "But you know, Walter, he cannot come home without his father's consent; and that,
                  I am sure, will not be given."
               "I do not know any such thing," he answered, sharply. And then, looking me keenly
                  in the face, he asked, with something of a sneer in his tone, "Why is it, Olive,
                  that you are always defending and excusing Arthur?"
               As he spoke and looked the blood rushed to my face, forehead, neck, even to the
                  very tips of my fingers; and before I could, in my confusion, find words to reply,
                  he had turned and walked away.
               Angry and mortified, I stood still in the spot where he left me, vexed with
                  Walter, doubly vexed with myself for this exhibition. I defend Arthur! What was
                  there to defend? How everybody misunderstood me—how unfair Walter was!
               Thus I stood, so absorbed in thought that I did not notice, till he spoke, that
                  Walter had returned.
               "Olive," he said, gently.
               I looked up, and seeing the sad expression of his face, my heart relented at once.
                  Was he in trouble? What could I do for him? I wanted to ask him this, but I could
                  not find courage to speak. I had lately become a little afraid of Walter, he was
                  so fitful in his moods: sometimes tender and kind, sometimes harsh, almost
                  discourteous, in his bearing towards me. I did fear him a little.
               There was a message which he had forgotten to deliver, he said. It was from my
                  father, who had been at the lodge that day, and would be there again in the
                  evening. My father desired that I should meet him there.
               I nodded assent and hastened on. Florence would be waiting for me to join her in
                  her afternoon ride. But I could not get Walter from my thoughts. He seemed so
                  changed, so different from the bright-faced boy who used, when we met, to open his
                  arms wide for me to jump into. Well, I was a little girl no longer,—perhaps that
                  was it. But he had been my only friend in those days, the only one to whom my shy
                  nature could freely unburden itself. Now things were changed it appeared—sadly
                  changed; a great, an unspeakable something had come between us. I could talk to
                  Arthur, Florence, any one, more readily. It was not that I no longer respected
                  Walter. I still acknowledged his superiority, though, perhaps, a more cultured
                  taste and refined associations rendered his workman's garb and coarse hands unduly
                  repugnant to me. Yet within the rude
                  exterior the MAN was always visible. If my fastidious tastes were sometimes
                  shocked by his want of polish, the awkwardness of his movements, I knew that
                  behind all this was a mind of rare force; and I could not but own that, with
                  Arthur's advantages, Walter would have been far in advance of him. But Arthur was
                  so much more companionable, one was so much more at ease with him, though he could
                  occasionally play the tyrant, as I well remembered; but then he was so readily
                  influenced—well—there I stopped the enumeration of my hero's fine qualities, for I
                  felt myself getting on dangerous ground.
               As I reached the Hall, I saw Florence standing in the portico waiting for me. Very
                  lovely she looked, with the afternoon sun slanting on her bright hair and the
                  drapery of her green riding-habit which swept the marble at her feet. If I could
                  have conveyed to canvas the impression her whole appearance made upon me at that
                  moment, rare would have been the tints, exquisitely delicate the penciling which
                  embodied the radiant and spirituelle maiden who stood smiling and beckoning me. A
                  strange feeling swept over me at the moment, a thought scarce breathed to myself,
                  and vanishing instantly. Could it be that this rich flush of early opening would
                  ever be otherwise than now? Would the fine petals unfolding, fragrant and glowing,
                  fade slowly as hardier blossoms fade? Yet why indulge such ominous forebodings in
                  presence of this overflowing life and vivacity? I shut away my silly shadows,
                  born, no doubt, of the depression caused by my interview with Walter.
               Florence had fulfilled every promise of her childhood, both in mind and person;
                  frank, innocent, and pure, she loved me now with the same confiding friendship
                  that she had in the first years of our intimate association.
               I hurried up to my room, and was soon equipped; and, mounting our ponies, we
                  cantered away, followed by the groom.
               It was a fine autumn afternoon, and the trees were glowing with their October
                  splendors, every copse and wood-crowned slope, of the great park shone jewel-like
                  in the mellow sunshine. Florence was in high spirits, and my own soon caught the
                  infection. For the sake of variety, it was proposed that we should take a new way
                  to reach the "glen of Downs," our usual place for a gallop, and the fashionable
                  resort of the gay neighborhood. We would go through a by-way or cut in the woods
                  bordering this beautiful road. Through the narrow by-way, however, we found it
                  only possible to pass one at a time, and Florence led the way, riding at full
                  speed, and being under such headway, as we merged into the open road, that she
                  almost came in collision with two gentlemen, who were quietly walking their horses
                  under the shade of the trees.
               Of course there was a full stop; the gentlemen reining in their startled animals
                  in time to prevent any mishap, as the unexpected vision bore down upon them.
                  Florence was all confusion and blushes; she apologized with the utmost
                  earnestness.
               "Not a word, not a word, my dear young lady," said the elder of the two gentlemen,
                  gallantly. "A spirited steed and a spirited rider need no apology. I feel myself the gainer by the encounter. I only
                  fear," he added, glancing at his young companion, who sat speechless, the reins
                  falling loosely from his hands, as he gazed at the fair apparition, "I only fear
                  that my young friend has been struck."
               "Oh, I hope not," Florence replied, with perfect naïveté. Then seeing him smile,
                  she colored still more deeply; and, the groom coming up, we bowed to our two
                  knights and rode away.
               "What a hoyden they must have thought me!" said Florence, with something of
                  chagrin in her voice. "What would mamma say if she heard of it? Oh, dear! my
                  'usual heedlessness,' I suppose, would be her comment. Olive, it does
                  seem as if I never should get to be a reliable and decorous personage."
               Lady Grace was very strict in all conventional matters, and the prospect of her
                  displeasure was no light matter; still we could not help laughing at the mishap,
                  and more merrily still at the piteous picture of herself Florence presented in the
                  garb of "a decorous personage." We cantered on gayly towards the seashore,
                  chattering as we went, when suddenly the sound of a fife broke in upon our "high
                  discourse."
               "That is Tim," said Florence, listening. "Yes, I am sure that is his fife. I
                  should like to see him; wouldn't you, Olive?"
               We had not met either old Doughty or Tim for a long, long, time; and, drawn by the
                  sound of the music, we set out to get a sight of them.
               Passing through a rough, overgrown path, leading from the main road to the
                  outskirts of the wood, we came upon a sort of mud hovel raised among a clump of
                  trees; and there, sure enough, at its door, sat Tim enthroned on a rough box, and
                  blowing away with such earnestness that he did not see or hear us until we were
                  close upon him, when he jumped from his seat and gazed upon us in utter
                  astonishment.
               The boy was little altered since we saw him last, though it was some years ago.
                  His head was, perhaps, huger than ever, covered with its immense brush of hair,
                  but nature seemed to have stopped with that effort; his twisted and misshapen
                  limbs were not improved by time or growth. Tim's face had lost, in a measure, its
                  droll and quizzical expression; evidently the world had used him hardly.
               "You do not remember us?" we said, in answer to his bewildered gaze.
               "Be jabers," he said, with his old knowing look, "how should I remember such grand
                  young ladies?"
               We reminded him of that day by the roadside when we were all so frightened at his
                  encounter with Arthur.
               His face lighted up.
               "Thrue for yees!" he cried; and taking off his old cap, swept the ground with it
                  in the profoundness of his salutation. "Ay, thrue for yees! I might well remember
                  it." And he screwed up his crooked shoulders significantly, as if still suffering
                  the effects of that memorable battle.
               "But, troth and upon me conscience," he added, rubbing his head and scanning us
                  critically, "who would have thought yees would ever have been such splendid young
                  ladies? and, asking yer favor, miss," looking at me, "espicially yerself. Whew! by
                  gorry, it takes me breath away to look at yees."
               
               "And where is the young master?" continued Tim, before we could reply to this
                  overwhelming compliment. "He'd hardly like to have a bout with the likes of me by
                  this time."
               "I suppose not, and be worsted," said Florence, laughing. "But where is old
                  Doughty—he is not dead?" she added, in a subdued voice.
               "Lord, no, miss; there he is." And he pointed to what I had supposed was a heap of
                  rags in the corner.
               Poor old creature! there he lay, a repulsive sight, with his tattered gown over
                  him and one of his many bundles under his head. Stretched at full length on a low
                  platform slightly raised from the ground, the miserable beggar seemed to us to
                  have arrived at the last low ebb of humanity.
               "How uncomfortable he must be, poor old man!" we both exclaimed,
                  compassionately.
               "Not he, ladies; he is as happy as a king."
               "And what does he have to eat?"
               "Sorra a bit these ten days, only the dhrop of whisky that puts heart into
                  him."
               As if to corroborate the statement, the old man raised his head, looking around
                  with glittering eyes.
               "Tim, where's the bottle?" he said; then dropped back with a groan. Tim quickly
                  administered the dose, and the invalid lay tranquil again. But there was a ghastly
                  look on his shriveled face, and a bright spot burned on either cheek. The eyes
                  were alert and shining yet, but the lips were pale, as with the touch of death.
                  Indeed, this was no pleasant sight to come upon out of the radiant sunshine and
                  the glad outer air. I could not help shrinking back a little as Florence, full of
                  interest and commiseration, hung over the tattered wretch, who seemed taking his
                  farewell of a forlorn existence to the sound of Tim's fife; departing as he had
                  entered the world, not knowing or caring whither.
               He lay still a moment and again called Tim, and fumbled with his skinny hands
                  among his rags. The sense of property was always strong in old Doughty, and he was
                  minded to pass away properly, surrounded by what had accompanied him in many a
                  roadside tramp,—his bundles, his scraps of cast-off clothing and of broken meats,
                  his tatters, great and small, and all else that should be his.
               "Tim," said he, piteously, as he groped about, "Come, Tim, give me the ha'pence.
                  Give me the ha'pence."
               "Whist, ye old blatherskite!" shouted the impatient nurse. "Whist! the quality's
                  here."
               "Oh, Tim!" said Florence, shocked beyond measure, "don't speak to the poor old man
                  in that way."
               "Lord, miss, he don't know! Say me love an' me dear, it 'ud be all the same."
               "Then, why do you talk so?" she said.
               "Because—well, by gorry, I must—if I didn't I'd beat him!"
               "Oh, Tim!"
               "Sure me heart's broke wid him, and I get mad an' savage. It's nothing but liftin'
                  an' layin', running with the dhrop of whisky, or screeching on the fife night an'
                  day. I've no rest,—I'm kilt entirely."
               "And does he love music so well?" still continued Florence.
               
               "Sorra a bit he cares for it, miss, but it keeps him quiet,—he thinks the pennies
                  are coming in. I've whistled and blowed for him this long year, but divil a penny
                  he'll give. Do ye hear them clinking under his bed?"
               "Tim, Tim, ye'll move me now!" groaned the old man.
               As Tim performed that office, he jerked the bag under the old man's head
                  (willfully I am afraid); the action brought a volley of oaths and exclamations, as
                  old Doughty spasmodically clutched his treasure.
               "Ye limb of the divil, ye'll never have it!" he gasped, falling back as he said
                  it, like one in the last agony. "Tim, darlint," he whimpered, in a moment after,
                  "give me the whisky."
               After the whisky, Tim was called upon to give him another turn.
               "So it goes," said Tim, philosophically.
               Pained and almost sick with the scene, we turned to go.
               But it will not be long you'll be troubled, Tim," I said, softly, as we were about
                  to leave.
               "Why, how, miss?"
               "Because he will soon be gone."
               "Where,—to the poorhouse, miss? Now, divil a fut will he go there while Tim's
                  alive."
               "No, not to the poorhouse," I said, vehemently; "he's going to die! I see it in
                  his face,—he'll not live a day longer."
               "Die is it? Die? Oh, cushla, me old man,—me father and me mother! Oh, no; he
                     can't die; he mustn't die; I'll not have it!" And he set up such a
                  yell that even the deadened ears of the old man tingled with it.
               "Tim, Tim, who's harmin' ye?" he cried. "Off man, I say, an' let him alone; he's
                  but a puir body. Bring me the pennies, Tim; no, here they are, I've got 'em fast,
                  never fear."
               Glad to escape, we left the hut, telling Tim, whom we left moaning and sobbing,
                  that we would send help to him very soon. How sweet the outer air felt after that
                  stifling atmosphere, that scene of human degradation! Mounting our ponies, we soon
                  reached the road; and had gone but a few yards, when we saw one of those monkish
                  figures, which are no strangers to the eyes of travelers in Ireland, approaching.
                  A singular figure, with eyes cast down upon the ground, and wrapped in a long,
                  gray woolen robe girt at the waist with a stout string. His head was bare, the
                  hair closely shaven, with no protection from the weather but a cowl or hood
                  attached to the dress. Coarse sandals were bound on his bare feet, his hard and
                  weather-beaten features were by no means prepossessing; a low forehead, heavy
                  features, and eyes of dull blue were its distinguishing characteristics.
               Florence, with her quick impulsiveness, instantly bethought herself that here was
                  the proper person to attend old Doughty.
               "Good father," she said, riding up to him, "there is one dying near by. Would you
                  in mercy visit him?"
               The friar, still with eyes bent on the ground, answered, "Lady, my vows forbid my
                  holding converse with one of your sex." He spoke with a foreign accent.
               
               But Florence, always ready and resolved in her purpose, turned quickly to our
                  groom.
               "Riley," said she, "you will explain to this father, and lead him to old Doughty.
                  We will proceed on our way home alone."
               "Well!" exclaimed Florence, as we rode away; "a self-made martyr to be sure! I
                  have no patience with such. Mortifying themselves indeed—it is self-exaltation
                  instead. They think they are doing great things. In my opinion it is very poor
                  work indeed. Not speak with one of our sex, Olive, think of that! A little of
                  their advice might do him good, I fancy."
               She had almost worked herself into a passion over the poor priest, when we came in
                  sight of the Hall. Anxious to get help for Tim, we rode into the back entrance,
                  and hastened up to the drawing-room to see Sir Robert and Lady Grace before taking
                  off our riding-habits. To our consternation we found ourselves in the presence of
                  the two gentlemen whom we had encountered on the road.
               Our confusion was unnoticed by Sir Robert, who, taking his daughter by the hand,
                  presented her to his guests. The elder was Lord Castlereagh; the younger, Major
                  Trenchard. I also was kindly introduced as his ward.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES—LORD CASTLEREAGH.
               LORD CASTLEREAGH! The name with which Ireland rang at that time; the name which
                  was at once the centre of hope and the centre of discord. The mention of that
                  lofty title acted as a spell upon me; and for a time I was utterly silenced. To
                  meet our heroes of the road quietly domesticated on our own hearthstone was
                  astonishment enough; but to find ourselves face to face with so great a man,
                  stumbled upon accidentally, like any other mortal, was like a return to the old
                  days when the gods walked in disguise.
               Some laughing explanations took place as to our having met before, and some faint
                  attempts at censure were made by Sir Robert and Lady Grace; with playful
                  threatenings of greater vigilance, if this was our manner of proceeding when out
                  of sight,—running down peaceful travelers on the highway, and putting quiet
                  horsemen in peril of their lives.
               Florence, with her ingenuous apologies, her innocent blushes, and, above all, by
                  her recital of our interview with the dying beggar, made a conquest at once, both
                  of her parents and of their guests, especially of the younger gentleman, whose
                  admiration was plainly written in his face.
               For myself, my attention was absorbed in Lord Castlereagh. Much as I had heard
                  about him, I found that he differed
                  essentially from the portrait my imagination had drawn. We always personify those
                  whom we hear much about, and I had supposed his lordship an aged man; grave,
                  stern, and inflexible; borne down by the weight of his responsibilities. But here
                  was almost a young man, a man full of vigor, ability, and, apparently, reserved
                  force. Grave and dignified he certainly was, but a man of the world, nevertheless;
                  not withdrawn by loftier affairs from appreciation of the social amenities of
                  life; he was elegantly attired, with even scrupulous attention to the fashion of
                  the day. It seemed to me that his mind, remote and far (as I regarded it) above
                  the trifles that filled our lives, sought ease and rest by occasional mingling
                  with his fellow men on their own ground.
               Yet, after all, the topics of conversation at the time of which I write were such
                  as might have interested the profoundest statesman. Politics were the fashion;
                  political discussion was familiar to all classes, from the peasant to the peer. In
                  the lowest hovels and pot-houses, as in the fashionable club of the capital or the
                  drawing-room of the aristocrat, the condition of affairs, the prospects of the
                  country, were the absorbing theme.
               Even among the ladies discussion and argument on these topics were quite general.
                  I had listened to many a drawing-room chat between lofty legislators and fair and
                  fashionable women. But gentlemen seldom do more than play at argument with the
                  gentler sex. They cannot snub the fair creatures, to be sure; but they are
                  non-committal, play off all the artillery of male coquetry. An expressive shrug,
                  an appreciative smile, a condescending "Oh," and "Ah!" and "I quite agree with
                  you, my dear madame!" these serve to ward off the attacks of the amiable
                  politicians in petticoats, who are best no doubt kept in the background,—who may
                  see too far, know too much, and who can't hold their tongues about state affairs
                  and governmental secrets, you know, any more than about other things. It is best
                  to fight shy of them.
               But, as I have said, politics were now the fashion. In the small dinner-parties,
                  lately so frequent at the Hall, nothing else was heard; and among the names most
                  often mentioned as leader in the Irish Parliament had been that of Lord
                  Castlereagh.
               He seemed to be the especial hope of his party; regarded by them as a close
                  reasoner, a skillful statesman, a friend of the government, who wished to benefit
                  the people of Ireland through legitimate channels, and would put down imperatively
                  any attempt at resistance to established authority. In the after-dinner gathering
                  of the ladies, I heard his virtues discussed, his faithfulness to his friends
                  descanted upon, his social and domestic gifts. My humble judgment had not
                  dissented from the general voice which proclaimed this man a hero, and I stood in
                  his presence somewhat awed and silent.
               Seeing me thus withdrawn, as it were, from the animated group about me, Lord
                  Castlereagh kindly drew me into conversation, asking me some local questions in
                  regard to the country, and expressing himself pleased with my answers. I felt
                  indebted to his courtesy, and charmed by his affability; yet, at this very moment,
                  by some strange transition, my mind recalled some sinister things which, amid the
                  general acclamation tion, had been
                  whispered in regard to his official career. I remembered a conversation held with
                  Mr. Massarene, in which, after I had been expatiating with great warmth on what I
                  had heard of this celebrated man, my old friend said quietly, with his peculiar
                  smile, "Keep cool, my little girl,—wait a little. Do not judge too hastily. Your
                  little inexperienced head cannot take the measure as yet of this polished
                  diplomatist. You cannot penetrate his complicated motives. Never was Ireland," he
                  added, "in greater need of a master-mind; one that, above the small ambitions of
                  party and the influence of cliques, could legislate for its universal interests;
                  but Lord Castlereagh is not that pre-eminent mind. He sees quickly but not
                  profoundly; self-concentrated, unsympathetic, without comprehensive genius, he
                  knows but little of those whom he would rule. He is essentially a party
                  leader."
               I remembered this, and much more of like import, as I stood for a few moments
                  talking with this courteous and elegant guest. I tried to read in his face what
                  manner of man he might be; the suave smile, the subtle glance of the keen, gray
                  eye eluded my research. I left the problem for the future to decide.
               After this we saw his lordship and Major Trenchard frequently at the Hall. Indeed,
                  at this time, our house was thronged with visitors from far and near.
               The Greytons, of Greyton Hall, were among the oldest and most influential
                  Protestant families in the southwest of Ireland; and it was necessary, in these
                  times of wide-spread disaffection, to conciliate, in every way, all those who
                  might add to the strength of the British government. Statesmen, councillors,
                  judges, now formed our society. His excellency the lord lieutenant and his lady,
                  in their carriage and four with outriders, were often seen on their way to Greyton
                  Hall. Post-coaches, with distinguished strangers direct from ministers in Europe,
                  dashed along the quiet road to our home. They came to consult confidentially with
                  Sir Robert; apparently they could not do him honor enough. Lady Grace was in her
                  element, this atmosphere of almost official importance and influence suited her
                  well. I had never seen her so lifted from her formal uniformity of bearing as at
                  this time.
               Perhaps the capital and the entire country never presented such a scene of gayety
                  as during this fall and winter of 1797. Regiment after regiment marched into the
                  various garrisons. Generals, colonels, and captains were bringing their families
                  to spend the winter at the centre of life and attraction, the busy capital.
                  Noblemen, long absent with their families, were returning to their neglected
                  estates to look after their interests. Startling reports of the unsettled state of
                  the country had doubtless reached their ears abroad; but here—here they saw
                  nothing to give rise to disquiet. The only agitation was that of pleasurable
                  excitement, surely. Entertainments of all kinds were in progress; military reviews
                  and parades were the order of the day. A gay and busy season, truly; under whose
                  animated current only the knowing ones discerned, perhaps, the signs of the
                  times.
               Young ladies and gentlemen fresh from the London metropolis, who had bemoaned
                  their fate and the cruelty of papas and mammas who brought them to horrid Ireland,
                  found themselves agreeably surprised.
                  Why, Dublin and Dublin society was absolutely delightful! Such drives! such balls!
                  such polite people!
               So the butterflies flitted secure in the sunshine of the present, caring nothing
                  what came with to-morrow.
               Lady Grace, as I have said, was unusually animated. Her sympathies were, of
                  course, with her kindred and the land of her birth. She was an Englishwoman, and
                  had many relatives in England. To be sure she had lived many, and, perhaps, her
                  happiest years in Ireland, as she often remarked still, had she to choose between
                  the two, her heart was with those among whom her childhood had been spent. She was
                  thoroughly English in sentiment. Not so Sir Robert. I could discern, at this time,
                  through all the gloss of his cordial hospitality, his hearty welcome of strangers,
                  his cheerful bearing to his guests—I could, I thought, plainly discern—a
                  deep-seated uneasiness. At times this amounted to actual unhappiness; once,
                  especially, after bowing out with courteous smiles some emissaries with whom he
                  had been closeted, I saw him return and, throwing himself in his chair, absolutely
                  weep. His heart was with his country; but he had not the power to battle with
                  circumstances, and stand forth in its defense. Weak, irresolute,—anxious to do
                  right, yet timid in its execution,—this man was truly to be pitied. His ancestors,
                  in the many outbreaks that had in past times distracted this unfortunate country,
                  were always on the side of the government, and he supposed he must do as they had
                  done. Then his family interests, his duty to his son, now arriving at majority,
                  were all on the side of conservatism. Altogether, he was very unhappy. Many years
                  of intercourse with the frank and friendly Sir Robert enabled me to read his mind
                  without a word being spoken. And, perhaps, an inkling of the state of things had
                  reached beyond his own demesne, and caused this constant and unusual attention
                  from distinguished parties without. They knew their man: he must be conciliated,
                  he must be reasoned with. Once committed to their policy, his sense of honor would
                  bind him to his party; until then there might be danger.
               Major Trenchard, as may be conjectured, became our constant guest. His regiment
                  was garrisoned just below Arklow; and when off duty, which must have been
                  frequent, he was always at the Hall. I saw that Florence was becoming as deeply
                  interested in him as he was in her. The frank openness peculiar to her character
                  rendered it impossible for her to conceal even these most delicate emotions. I
                  was, however, her only confidante. To me she poured out her feelings. How
                  wonderful, how brave, how handsome he was! I think she almost marveled there was
                  not some public recognition of his claims to universal homage. Then, again, she
                  was troubled with doubts. Could he love her—this military
                  archangel?
               At which uncalled-for humility, I laughed outright. I was not in love
                  with Major Trenchard. In fact, when I first became acquainted with him, a feeling
                  something like repulsion affected me towards the epauletted stranger; and it was
                  with a feeling of pain that I noted the growing interest with which Florence
                  regarded him. This feeling gradually wore away, however, when I saw his real
                  devotion, his anxious tenderness for my friend.
               
               Never was Florence more perfectly lovely than at this time. This great and growing
                  passion gave to her almost childlike beauty the added charm of thought. She was
                  living now for another.
               Yet, with all her bloom and beauty, she was but a fragile flower. A slight fatigue
                  exhausted her; a sharp, cool breeze would often give her a troublesome cough. The
                  careful watchfulness of her lover, his exceeding attention to her health and
                  happiness, worked a miracle in his favor. I dropped my dislike, and became a warm
                  advocate of this major.
               In our afternoon rides Florence had proudly taken him to visit the celebrated
                  places in our neighborhood. In these rides I was fain to confess that the
                  enthusiasm of our gallant escort was all that could be desired. He was in raptures
                  with the wild glens, the lovely lakes, the mountain passes, the glories of the
                  sea-side.
               "But I want you to see the inside of some of our Irish cottages," Florence would
                  say after one of these outbursts. "I know how you English people talk about them:
                  papa has told me all that. Because some of them are too bad to mention, you will
                  have it that all are so. I want you to see for yourself. I have one little gem in
                  my mind,—the nicest, tidiest little place; I mean Dolly Jamieson's. Olive,
                     isn't it nice?"
               I assented; adding, with a smile, "But the major will hardly consider this a fair
                  specimen, will he, Florence?"
               "There are plenty more quite as comfortable," said Florence, quickly, "but I mean
                  to begin with this."
               The major assured her, solemnly, that he was waiting and anxious to be
                  enlightened; that, as the subject of Irish tenantry was one on which he had no
                  fixed opinion, she might mould him with her plastic hand. "Only," he added, "let
                  the process be a merciful one. Begin with the best, by all means."
               The cottages on the Greyton estate were in much better condition than many others,
                  thanks to the constant care and vigilance of Lady Grace. She had her schools, her
                  institutions for the destitute, her visiting days for oversight and instruction,
                  her hours for care of and reading with the sick. Everything was thought of and
                  looked after. In fact, the great trouble was that too much was done.
               Her plans were all admirably arranged: so much so, that the worthy rector, her
                  adviser and particular friend, had taken occasion to speak of them publicly in a
                  most approving manner, and, with his bustling and cheerful wife, had held them up
                  in private as a shining example of what other noble ladies might effect. Yet
                  somehow, with all this commendation, but few things worked exactly right. There
                  was a fearful wear and tear of conscience among her beneficiaries. They must
                  listen to the good lady who had done, and might still do, so much for them. Sure
                  an' it must be the truth that comes from such blessed lips,—Heaven be her bed!
               Ingratitude is not the sin of the Irish peasant, but questions which have puzzled
                  wiser brains were not likely to be unraveled by their simple processes of thought.
                  Between the doctrines and benefits of her Protestant ladyship, and the commands of
                  the priest, there must be some middle course. There must be truth in the good books she sent them; troth! they
                  believed every word she said. But if Father Brenan should hear of it! Wasn't it
                  only the other day he tould us from the holy altar, on the peril of our sowls, not
                  to listen to "delusive doctrines from whited sepulchres?" "Them was his very
                  words," said good Mrs. Brady, one of Lady Grace's most exacting and able-bodied
                  "poor."
               "Whited sepulchres?" repeated the bewildered woman. "Surely he couldn't mean our
                  good lady. Lord forbid! But sometimes, they do say, the devil comes in the
                  grandest ways. Ochone! what'll I do?"
               And then the gaping youngsters would be threatened with vengeance dire—they would
                  be kilt entirely—if they ever dared to mention what they had heard, or to name her
                  ladyship before his reverence.
               My lady was reputed a zealous proselytizer; and so, in some quarters, there was a
                  jealous watchfulness of her doings, and whispered threats and innuendoes were not
                  wanting to urge that conscientious religionist to an unbending discharge of her
                  duty.
               She would have been surprised, doubtless, if some good angel had whispered her
                  that, after all, most of the good that was done her tenantry reached them through
                  her daughter Florence,—Florence, who made no effort, Florence, who made no
                  sacrifice,—whose simple, impulsive nature was adapted to win love and kindness
                  everywhere. When she appeared there were no fears nor concealments, no anxious
                  efforts to please. It was natural to love her, and the good people did this with
                  all their hearts.
               Dolly Jamieson was one of our pets; and so, with great confidence, we set out at
                  the appointed time, armed with a message from Lady Grace, who had heard, she said,
                  that the good woman was in some trouble.
               No trouble, however, appeared on the smiling countenance which greeted us as we
                  dismounted at the cottage. Buxom and full of good-humor, Dolly ushered us within
                  with bustling hospitality; scattering, with a vigorous sweep of her apron, some
                  stray chickens in the doorway, and administering a sharp rebuke to a group of
                  little ones who stood staring at the visitors with mouths agape.
               At length we were fairly seated, Dolly herself remaining standing,—a comely figure
                  in her short blue petticoat, tightly-fitting curricle, and check apron, the corner
                  of which was flung over her stout, rosy arm.
               "Mamma has heard you were in trouble, Dolly," said Florence, when the excitement
                  of our entrance had subsided. "She hopes it is nothing serious."
               "Thrue for you, miss, I am in throuble," answered comfortable-looking Dolly,
                  lifting her apron to her eyes, "in sore throuble; but it isn't for the likes of me
                  to spake of such things before your ladyships."
               "Oh, do, Dolly! tell us what is the matter," we both exclaimed. "Is Matthew sick?
                  or has he lost his work? or what else is it?"
               "Oh, no! not that, my ladies; it's a heart trouble, and the Lord knows what may
                  come of it. But ye'll laugh at me, young ladies" (which we earnestly assured her
                  we would not); "ye scholar-bred folk don't think of these things as we do. But its
                  rale sorrow. I never knew but ruin to come of it."
               
               "How sorry I am!" said Florence, with her ever-ready sympathy.
               "Thank ye, miss; and I'll begin an' take it up from the first. Well, last Sunday
                  evening, after the childher was in bed and asleep, I says to Matthew (who is
                  always quiet and at home—not, like some of our neighbors, off to the pot-house on
                  the holy days), I says to Matthew, 'let's take a walk.' An' sure we did, an'
                  wandered on till we came to the beach and clear down, by the ruins of the ould
                  castle—ye remimber it, miss—that used to belong to the O'Toole family; and a grand
                  place it was then, fit for a king, as I've heard my grannie tell. Well, miss, it
                  was a fine, clear night, not a cloud anywhere, and yet the wind blew, and the
                  waves came rolling in along the beach and dashed among the old foundations with a
                  sound like thunder. I says to Matthew, 'No good can come to us if we stay here;
                  some fearful thing is at work!' says I. 'Let us go home.' With that, Lord preserve
                  us! above all the din there came clear to my ears, from among the ould walls and
                  towers, the awful cry of the banshee! 'Matthew,' says I, 'there's the ould O'Toole
                  banshee. There's trouble coming!' My heart was in me mouth with fear, an' I got
                  home all of a thremble."
               "Maybe it was a screech-owl?" suggested Florence, innocently.
               "Lord bless ye, miss! haven't I heard it before? an' it always brings the
                  throuble. An' sure enough it came the very next morning, miss, for in comes my
                  young brother Dennis, an' says he was going to be married the morrow, miss, which
                  is this very day—"
               "Oh, dear!" we both exclaimed, too much relieved to wait the remainder of the
                  story, "is that all? That isn't so bad, is it?"
               At which I saw that Major Trenchard had much ado to keep from laughing; but Dolly
                  proceeded more vehemently than ever. She was evidently warming with her
                  subject.
               "Not so bad is it, miss? Why, won't he be the third in the family that has married
                  within the two weeks? My two sisters on Saturday, and now himself, the spalpeen!
                  an' it niver fails to bring the bad luck."
               "But won't he wait?" said Florence, deeply interested at this aspect of
                  affairs.
               "No, miss. I've begged it on my knees, but he declares to God he'll marry the day
                  or niver."
               Just then the figure of a strapping young fellow darkened the low doorway, and,
                  with a spring, Dolly bounded toward him, taking his arm in her strong grip, and
                  turning him in a twinkling into the middle of the room and right in front of us.
                  He was evidently dressed in his best apparel. The gray frieze coat sat well on his
                  broad shoulders, a gay, loosely-tied necktie adorned his throat, and from the
                  buttonhole of his bright red vest was suspended the wedding-favor. Corduroy
                  small-clothes, white-ribbed stockings, and high, well-polished brogans, well
                  became the youthful figure of this rustic beau, whose holiday attire was completed
                  by a high, narrow-crowned hat, set jauntily on one side his close, curly head. A
                  manly fellow he looked, of whom no bride need be ashamed.
               At first the youth was much abashed at being so suddenly presented, but the
                  earnestness of his feelings overcame
                  his awkwardness. At this supreme moment of his life he was the equal of any
                  one.
               His sister tenaciously held his arm,—this was her last opportunity. She plead with
                  him vehemently.
               "An' sure, dear, ye'll think of your poor sisters and their families, and not do
                  it the day?"
               "Not do it the day!" he answered, violently, striving to get his arm away from her
                  grasp. "Indade an' I'll be damned if I won't!"
               "Ochone! ochone!" she cried, piteously; "is there no mercy in yer sowl?"
               She still clung to his arm as though to prevent his leaving the house. The affair
                  was so sudden we had not thought to interfere, sitting astounded spectators of the
                  exciting and somewhat ludicrous scene.
               Dolly now changed her tactics; she appealed to his feelings.
               "Will ye not listen for the sake of the mother that bore ye,—that died for
                  ye,—will ye have her curses instead of her prayers, ye unnatural baste? An' but
                  for meself, where would ye have been the day? Did I not take ye as a baby, and do
                  for ye? and ye'd bring us all to ruin! Ochone! ochone!" And again came another
                  burst of despair.
               The youth was evidently wavering; he began to look quite pale.
               "But what will Mary say?" he cried, making one more effort to release himself.
                  "Let me go! let me go, I say! Isn't Mary waiting?"
               "An' would ye bring sorrow on us all for her waiting,—on yer own flesh and blood?
                  Divil a foot ye'll stir."
               We now began to entreat for him. It was quite painful to see his
                  agitation,—painful at least to us; on his sister neither that nor our entreaties
                  had any effect. She only became more wildly obdurate. She went upon her knees and
                  cursed him at one moment, the next fondled and coaxed and prayed, until the poor
                  fellow, utterly prostrated, was obliged to submit.
               "An' ye'll swear by yer dead not to do it?" cried Dolly.
               "Yes, yes; anything!" was the answer; as, with a wild cry, he tore himself from
                  her and rushed from the house.
               We were all much shocked, this finale was so violent. But Mrs. Jamieson
                  immediately recovered her equanimity.
               "Don't you think he may go now and be married after all?" said Florence,
                  breathlessly, having entered into the scene with intense interest.
               "Oh, he daren't!" answered Dolly, triumphantly. "He knows there would be a blight
                  on his sowl. He has taken the vow, and must abide by it."
               Shortly after this we took our departure. Florence and I were a little flurried,
                  but Major Trenchard could scarcely wait till we were beyond hearing of the
                  victorious Dolly ere he burst into a fit of laughter, repeated at intervals as he
                  looked at the discomposed face of Florence.
               "Well, if that wasn't the richest treat," he said. "Why, she's a regular Nell
                  Gwynne."
               "Poor woman, but didn't she feel bad?"
               "Bad!" he echoed; "did she look like it when the contest was over? Poor fellow, he'll
                  suffer, but she had a most enjoyable time."
               
               Two important events marked the coming week. Major Trenchard proposed, and was
                  accepted; not that there was exactly a formal engagement, Sir Robert and Lady
                  Grace objecting to this, as Florence was so young and had not yet been out in the
                  world. But the suitor had their full approbation, and as for my young friend, she
                  knew she would always love him.
               Sir Robert would doubtless have preferred that his daughter should have made
                  choice of one of her own countrymen, but her ladyship was well pleased. The major
                  stood high in his profession; his family were among the noblest; there was only
                  one life between him and an earldom. A coronet would well grace the brow of her
                  lovely daughter.
               The other event was the announcement of Arthur's immediate return, and also that
                  he would be accompanied by my old adversary,—Adele. Her brother had been ordered
                  to Ireland with his regiment, and her mother had wished Adele to take the
                  opportunity of visiting her dear friends in Ireland. She had hastened her
                  preparations in order to accompany Arthur, as the regiment might not leave London
                  for a couple of weeks.
               With Arthur's letter of announcement came as usual a private note to myself and
                  one to Florence. Hers I did not see, and mine I did not dare to show her, so full
                  was it of tender protestations of regard. Oh, I wished he would not speak thus!
                  And yet the words awoke a strange echo in my own heart. I would not acknowledge to
                  myself the feeling they aroused; I was ashamed of it as of something to which I
                  had no right; as though I were meanly stealing something which I should not dare
                  to touch openly.
               Arthur spoke very kindly of Adele. She was much changed and improved; in fact,
                  quite another sort of personage. She had endeared herself to him by her frank
                  admission and deep repentance of her girlish haughtiness and folly. "She hopes you
                  will forgive her that little past squabble, Olive. I know you have forgotten it. I
                  told her so, and told her all about you. She loves you like a sister."
               But I had not forgotten it, and I doubted the sincerity of Adele's protestations.
                  However, ashamed of the keenness of my recollections, and that my sensitiveness
                  still retained the sting of what had transpired so many years ago, I resolved to
                  regard the coming visitor in an amiable light, and follow her bright example of
                  forgiveness and forgetfulness. If she had made me suffer, and wounded my childish
                  pride to the quick, probably I had been obstinate and easily offended. At any
                  rate, she was the near relation of my benefactress, and as such must be
                  welcomed.
               Great were the preparations made throughout the mansion; a beautiful boudoir was
                  fitted up for Adele, and Arthur's favorite apartments were rearranged and
                  beautified.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               A LOWLY REVOLUTIONIST.
               THE reader will recollect that I had received a message from my father on the day
                  of our encounter with Lord Castlereagh and his friend. So busy have I been
                  detailing events which grew out of that adventure, that it will be necessary to
                  retrace my steps somewhat to take up the thread of narrative from that point.
               My father's visit at the lodge was an unusual thing. Only once a year, on my
                  birthday, did he make his appearance there. Poor father! in his struggle for
                  subsistence he had little time for sentiment,—he knew that I was well cared for,
                  and it sufficed. Yet I retained a strong attachment for him. Differing in
                  appearance and manner from those with whom I was associated, there was yet a great
                  power about him which inspired respect. He was grave, somewhat silent, having
                  little of that hopeful buoyancy so natural to his class, which enables them to
                  bound up from even the most depressing circumstances. He was not morose nor sour,
                  but rather thoughtful, as one who ponders unfulfilled desires, and waits the issue
                  of events. Of course he was uneducated,—at least so far as book-education
                  went,—but he was a close observer, and had made himself something of an English
                  scholar. I had heard from Walter that he was quite unhappy—troubled with the
                  aspect of the times. I knew that Mr. Massarene highly respected him, and that
                  there was a confidence between them in regard to political opinions, but that was
                  all I knew. My grandmother was not in sympathy with anything that disturbed the
                  present state of things,—indeed, she could not understand what better could be
                  desired.
               The conversation during the evening was general, inquiries for old remembered
                  friends and neighbors, and the like, but I felt that this was not the purpose of
                  my father's visit. When he arose to leave, he said, quietly, "It is a pleasant
                  evening, Olive; put on your bonnet and walk a little way with me. Walter will
                  return with you."
               I was soon made acquainted with his reasons for wishing to see me. He was about
                  starting for France.
               "France!" I repeated in astonishment.
               "Yes; and upon a mission of some importance, and it may be danger. You are no
                  doubt surprised that they should send a man so obscure on an important errand
                  connected with state affairs. But there are valuable papers to be conveyed to
                  persons in France; any distinguished person might be suspected, and discovery
                  would implicate a great many persons here. So they chose one in my unknown
                  position, as being unlikely to be missed. A common countryman, you know, Olive,"
                  he said, with a quiet smile, "would not attract any attention. There are men
                  enough, higher and better than I am, who are ready to go and take all the risks,
                  but they would become objects of distrust to the government, and perfect secrecy
                  is absolutely requisite. I am sure I can trust you, Olive; you have something of
                  my nature in you,—safe and silent as a rock. Walter knows all about it, too,—but I
                  wanted to see you, my girl, before I
                  went so far away. And if anything should happen when the water is between us, you
                  will look a little after my good woman and the little boy, though they be not
                  exactly your own kith and kin."
               I promised everything he desired.
               "But remember," said my thoughtful father, "I do not want you to go near them,
                  only in case of need. Where you are it will not answer to have anything to do with
                  the like o' them. It is only if I do not come back. The two of them are sickly
                  like—and I doubt they will bear the trouble easily if it comes."
               "But why go at all?" said I, in a sudden burst of grief. "There are young men
                  without families, let them go. And your farm and your cattle, what is to become of
                  them? and how will your family get food when you are away?"
               For France seemed to me a great and far-off country that would take a long, long
                  time to reach and to return from.
               "Why, Olive, you talk as if this were a life-work. I expect, with fair wind, to go
                  there and be back in a month. But perhaps I ought to tell you all,—I have no
                  cattle and no farm, Olive. I am a desperate man. But do not start, child; I am no
                  worse off than hundreds of others. Poverty and sore want are driving us on. It is
                  this that stirs the devil in us."
               "Do not talk in that way, father," I exclaimed, excitedly; "you will break my
                  heart if you do."
               "Well, well, my girl, I have no right to do that. I would not have told you
                  anything, only I think you have now arrived at an age when you ought to know
                  things as they are. The times are bad, terribly bad, my child; and among those you
                  are with you will hear much against our class, the 'miserable, half-brutalized
                  peasantry,' as they call us, and you may learn to despise us like the rest."
               "No, no;" I utterly disclaimed such a possibility.
               "Well, it would only be natural. There is little to love about us, I will own. But
                  who made us so?" he cried, with a sudden fierceness of energy. "Not the God above
                  us—surely not, such work is done in this world. Olive, I think the very brutes are
                  happier than we are. They have no dreams nor desires, they only suffer when cold
                  and hungry, they lick the hand of the giver when plenty comes. But we are not all
                  brutes," he groaned; "though, because we cannot eat the food they give us, and
                  grovel behind the walls of their pastures, they drive us into the shambles, as
                  ugly, refractory beasts, fit only for the knife."
               "But this is all folly," said he, after a pause; "all folly, Olive, to be
                  troubling a girl like you with this."
               "No, no, it is not folly," I said, hurriedly. "I am learning more and more, and
                  thinking more and more about these things every day, father. I know I am but a
                  helpless girl, but—but were I a man—"
               "Stop, stop," said my father with a quick laugh, his native humor touched with my
                  bravado, "this is treason. Why, my brave little girl, these loyal supporters of
                  his most gracious majesty may thank their good fortune that fate has it
                  otherwise."
               "Now don't laugh," I said, somewhat hurt.
               "I will not again, indeed," answered my father, as, putting his broad hand on my
                  shoulder, he said with loving kindness, "You are a good, warm-hearted girl, my own true daughter, and becoming a
                  fine lady has not spoiled your generous nature. But the plain facts of the case
                  are these: Many years ago, before you were born, I leased a bit of land, a few
                  acres, the owner of which had always lived in England. When I took the ground it
                  was a poor, barren spot; stony, bleak, without bush or tree; but I was young and
                  hopeful then, and I went to work with a will. I picked out all the stones, made a
                  neat wall with them all around my place, raised my little cabin, cultivated my
                  ground, and had as nice a spot as was seen in the country round,—was it not,
                  Walter?"
               "True for you," was the answer; "there was not another place like it."
               "Well, all this time, with all I could do, I was but just able to keep body and
                  soul together. What with rent to pay, and taxes and tithes, there was little left
                  to clothe, and feed us. Indeed, the chickens and eggs my wife sold, and the cow
                  and the pig, were about all we held our own. Still we kept along and were not
                  beholden to any one. But, about a year ago, my lease ran out; and then word came
                  that my rent was doubled; and when I expostulated, they said if I could not pay,
                  there were others stood ready to take the place. Had the landlord been here, and
                  if he was a gentleman, I could have talked with him, and told him of the hardship
                  of the thing, and how I had really made the place, and was paying a rent that took
                  all I could get out of it, and what could I do more? but he was away; he knew
                  nothing about us, and what did his agent care?
               "Well, I stayed on, hoping against hope, that something might turn up, and when
                  the six months came round I paid a little and begged off for awhile. Another six
                  months passed; I was no better off, but I sold everything I could rake and scrape.
                  I sold the cow, the pigs, the chickens, but all I could get together was little
                  towards the amount required. Olive, it ended that all I had, even to the bed we
                  lay on, was taken, and I was turned out. All my saving and hard labor for so many
                  years would only serve the young masters and misses in London for a day's feast,
                  but they got it. Justice—the devil's justice, not God's—said it was theirs and not
                  ours. They say that many of the landowners are coming back to look after their
                  estates; they are scared at the way things look. But it is too late; the mischief
                  is done; they can't stop it now with soft speeches. Do they think we are fools to
                  be wheedled by their proclamations? They have given us ten days to give up our
                  guns and our pikes, and return to the loving fold of our protectors. Ha! ha!"
               My, father's laugh, full of bitter meaning, made my blood tingle. It seemed to
                  ring with death and danger.
               "It seems to me, father," said I, "that if you were to represent the cause of all
                  these poor people—"
               "And," said my father, turning to Walter, and paying no heed to my words, "and if
                  we do not give up our arms, what does my lord lieutenant say through his fast
                  friend and abettor, Lord Castlereagh? Why, forsooth, if we do not, the soldiery
                  will be let loose on us, our cabins will be searched, the utmost penalties of the
                  law will be ours. And what does even our own most Catholic bishop of this diocese
                  say to all this? He desires his priests to declare the heinousness of attempting
                  to subvert the government of his most
                  gracious majesty. He bids us not be misled by wretched speculations on the rights
                  of man, or the majesty of the people—fatal heresies—disastrous theories he calls
                  them."
               "Fatal they are, indeed," said Walter, "to the shame of our rulers be it
                  spoken."
               "Why go on?" said my father; "words are useless, weapons are what we want; when
                  even among our own spiritual fathers place and power have such strong influence,
                  and they speak from interest rather than principle."
               Unable to restrain myself, and alarmed at the bitterness with which he spoke, I
                  laid my hand upon his arm to interrupt the fierce torrent of words. He looked down
                  upon me kindly, his face and voice softening instantly.
               "Have I frightened you, my little girl?" he said, soothingly. "Well, well, do not
                  mind all I say, child. I am vindictive,—I cannot help it,—but be sure I will never
                  dishonor you, Olive, by word or deed; nor will I dishonor myself."
               He stooped and kissed me, and we parted.
               This interview left me distressed and miserable. Walter, as we walked to the Hall,
                  was very kind and gentle, and endeavored to comfort me by showing the most hopeful
                  side of affairs. He had gotten over the ill-humor of the afternoon, and begged
                  that I would forgive his apparent rudeness.
               To be sure I would forgive him—I had hardly felt anger, I said,—I was only sorry
                  that he should feel so hard towards Arthur. There was no reply to this for some
                  minutes. Walter paused an instant in his walk. I heard him sigh; it was almost a
                  stifled groan. Then he said, in a singularly subdued voice, "Olive, I will deem it
                  a favor if you will never mention that name to me again."
               I was surprised. Never mention his name! why, it seemed to me the most natural
                  thing in the world to speak of Arthur.
               I suppose that the moonlight shining down upon us revealed the expression of my
                  face, for he said, hastily, "No, you cannot understand it; do not try.
                  Good-night."
               We were now at the Hall, and, shaking hands, we parted.
               
               That night I lay long awake, uneasy and excited. My father's desperate state of
                  mind filled me with anxiety; it seemed to me that he might be tempted to commit
                  some violence. And then Walter was so strangely whimsical,—sometimes so
                  sympathizing that I felt like telling him every thought, again so hasty, harsh,
                  and inconsiderate, that my heart utterly withdrew from him. Weary and full of
                  misgivings, I tossed about until morning, resolved that at the very earliest
                  opportunity I would ride over to see Mr. Massarene, and talk with him about my
                  father.
               Everything in the morning proved favorable to my plan. Sir Robert, with his wife
                  and daughter, were going in the carriage to make a formal visit to a new neighbor,
                  or rather to welcome an old one, a Mr. Neville, who had, with his family, been
                  residing for many years in England. This family had returned to occupy their
                  long-deserted mansion, now almost in
                  ruins, because the extravagance of its growing sons and daughters and the expenses
                  of London life could no longer be supported from their Irish estates. They had
                  come to Ireland to retrench. Many others, as I have intimated, were doing the like
                  at this time.
               This Mr. Neville was, I conjectured, from the similarity of the name, the very
                  landlord who had brought such distress on my father. This raising of the rents on
                  his estate in Kildare had given great dissatisfaction.
               "But," said Sir Robert, as he stood at the door, waiting for his carriage, "I
                  consider that every one must manage his own affairs. I think he has been guilty of
                  gross injustice, however; and, although I make it a point of etiquette to call on
                  him, I must say I consider the man a great rascal."
               Lady Grace did not appear to hear this; she was occupied in adjusting her
                  robe.
               I thought to myself that it was a great pity Sir Robert, with his assured
                  reputation and standing, could not be independent, and manifest his disapproval of
                  wrong and injustice when he saw it so clearly.
               I did not delay an instant after their departure; my pony was quickly saddled, and
                  I set out on the road to Mr. Massarene's.
               It was a lovely morning in the month of November, a season which, in this climate,
                  is generally damp and misty; this year, however, it had been remarkably clear and
                  bracing. The air was delicious, and everything that met my eye seemed lovely,—the
                  undulating landscape of hill and valley, the changing leaves, the sparkling waters
                  beyond,—all these were inspiring; my spirits rose; the depression of the previous
                  night vanished as I cantered along the winding road; nor were they very much
                  dampened even when, turning into the lane leading up to the abbey, I encountered
                  the monk whom Florence and I had seen on the day when we visited old Doughty. His
                  down-looking countenance, passing a woman with averted eye, as though she were an
                  evil thing, had provoked Florence to mirth and an unwonted expression of disdain;
                  and, as he moved silently on, without sign of recognition, I could not avoid a
                  certain chill sensation, not the result of the November atmosphere.
               As I entered the archway and passed into the courtyard, I saw in front of the main
                  entrance two footmen, in showy livery, pacing up and down.
               "This must be some visitor of distinction," said I to myself, holding the reins
                  suspended, undecided what to do.
               But it was decided for me. A servant came from the house; Mr. Massarene had seen
                  me and desired that I should come in.
               I was ushered into the small sitting-room, and found myself in the presence of Mr.
                  Massarene, his sister Annastene, and their visitor, who was introduced to me as
                  Father Bochera. A high dignitary evidently was the father, and a foreigner,—a
                  refined and courtly personage, perhaps somewhat older than Mr. Massarene. He bowed
                  low and with condescending grace when I was presented, and taking my hand with a
                  kind and fatherly pressure, said that I was the first young Irish lady to whom he
                  had had the honor of being introduced; adding that my blooming cheeks spoke well
                  for the healthfulness of the sea-girt island.
               
               Of course I was confused and fluttered; my native shyness, as usual, turning
                  traitor to my self-possession. Mr. Massarene, however, spoke for me, and I heard
                  him mention my father's name in an undertone, at which the reverend gentleman
                  scanned me more closely, and said, "Is it possible!"
               I seated myself beside the Lady Annastene, who smiled upon me pleasantly as I took
                  the low ottoman at her feet; while the two gentlemen resumed, in a low tone, the
                  conversation apparently interrupted by my entrance.
               "Are they talking of us, my dear?" whispered the poor old lady. A certain
                  confidence, if it might so be called, had grown up between this lady and myself,
                  though we seldom saw each other. She always, in our visits, seemed to prefer me to
                  Florence, perhaps because I was more sedate. Old age was now telling upon her; she
                  was no longer so haughty and irritable as in former days; her nerves were quieter.
                  With a priest from Rome before her, the representative of her beloved religion,
                  she sat with the sunlight glancing in on her silken train and splendid
                  toilet,—dress was even now her passion,—the personification of rest and trust. It
                  had become evident to me that she had a certain terror of Sister Theresa, a terror
                  expressed unconsciously in her actions, and she would take my hand at times in her
                  helpless way, as if it gave her strength and a sense of protection. Occasionally I
                  was sent for; and her brother, whose attention to her wants never abated, seemed
                  well pleased when I answered the summons.
               I liked well to be with these two. The trust and friendship of the lonely woman,
                  the intelligent conversation sation of the brother, gave me a better feeling
                  towards myself, and a more restful and satisfied spirit than I ever felt
                  elsewhere. For, indeed, the questions of the times, the exciting themes of the
                  day, pressed sore on my youthful heart, and made me feel, at times, utterly
                  dissatisfied with my quiescent and questionable position. I longed to be doing
                  something to help this striving, struggling world, and to lighten the misery,
                  which, shut from my actual experience, was yet evident to my observation.
               Mr. Massarene talked much with me over the topics which then absorbed the thinking
                  minds of the country, and I felt honored by his confidence,—a confidence which
                  drew us together in closer bonds of friendship than are usual between youth and
                  later life.
               This morning it was evident that some important projects were in discussion. I
                  could hear the persuasive voice of the churchman occasionally rising in
                  expostulation, and, as I thought, the still obstinate refusal of his host. I had
                  taken up a book of prints, endeavoring to keep my attention from themes not meant
                  for my ear; and the Lady Annastene, lulled by the hum of low voices, had fallen
                  asleep in her chair.
               At last the visitor rose to take leave. As he wrapped about him more closely the
                  dark cloak that had enveloped him from head to foot, I caught a glimpse, beneath
                  it, of a long, scarlet robe.
               In fact, as I learned afterwards, this courtly gentleman was no other than
                  Cardinal Bochera, who had come to Ireland on a secret mission to the influential
                  Catholics of the country.
               On the departure of the august visitor, I expressed regret that Lady Annastene had not been awake to
                  receive his parting blessing.
               "He may be here again," was the answer; "we did not part satisfactorily. However,
                  do not let us say anything to my sister about it. I doubt if she will remember his
                  being here at all when she wakes."
               "Poor lady!" I sighed; "perhaps there may be some vague impression, as if a bright
                  dream or vision had passed before her."
               "Probably," said her brother. "Happy is she in her profound and childlike
                  adoration of all connected with her faith,—we need not grieve for her."
               "Surely not," I replied, sympathetically. But, returning to my own perplexities, I
                  added, "I could not avoid hearing my father's name mentioned by that gentleman;
                  what may he know about him? and my poor father is in such trouble, and going away.
                  It was that brought me here this morning."
               "Has he gone?"
               "Yes; he went last night."
               "About this person, knowing him and his movements, I am as puzzled as any. I fear
                  there are traitors around—but who, that is the question. This father has been in
                  the country but a few hours, and yet he knows names and circumstances—it is
                  astonishing."
               "May not that strange friar have told him?" I suggested.
               "What strange friar?"
               "That disagreeable Italian monk," I answered, with a shudder.
               "Oh, one of your antipathies;" and he smiled. "But you are wrong this time. He is
                  away; left some days ago for Boulogne, where your father is to meet him, and
                  together they will go to Paris; he is to act as interpreter."
               "He is not gone," I interrupted, hurriedly. "I saw him passing out of the lane as
                  I came in a few moments ago."
               "Is it possible! Are you sure?"
               "Perfectly sure."
               "This looks bad," was the thoughtful rejoinder, "very bad. Now I remember; our
                  visitor was called out, some person wished to see him outside the walls. It must
                  have been so, Olive. The monk has told him all; there has indeed been
                  treachery."
               "And is my poor father in danger by it? Do, Mr. Massarene, tell me," I said, in
                  great distress.
               "I will tell you, Olive," he replied, with one of his pleasant, approving looks;
                  "but it is not every one of your age whom I would trust so far; you are strong,
                  however, and clear-headed, and willing, I think, to undergo some pain for your
                  country's sake."
               I could only answer with my tears.
               "It is a difficult matter,—very complicated,—but I will endeavor to explain. There
                  is a secret society existing; you may have heard of it."
               I said I had; Walter had told me about it.
               "It is called 'The United Irishmen,' this among themselves. Its aims are to free
                  the country from a galling yoke; to have, as in the new world, a republic, a free
                  government, where political and religious freedom, with just and equal rights,
                  will be secured to all. The intention of the society, at its commencement, was to
                  do this without violence; to wait until strong enough, and then by a united, persistent, moral
                  force, to gain their object.
               "At one time it really seemed as if this might be done; for in its organization
                  are comprised some of the highest, best, and most enlightened elements of the
                  country; in its ranks are the rich and poor of every sect and creed, who, without
                  distinction, are willing to throw aside all minor differences for the general
                  good. But lately the government, long cognizant of the society, but never able to
                  reach it, has determined to use vigorous measures to extirpate it if possible.
               "There is now a reign of terror fully inaugurated; no one feels safe. The jails
                  are crowded with state prisoners. Martial law is proclaimed. The habeas corpus act
                  is suspended. Then there is the gunpowder bill to disarm the people; the
                  convention bill to prevent their assembling to remonstrate; in fact, everything is
                  done, as it were, to goad them on to a sudden outbreak of fury, as it is felt
                  that, in their present unprepared state, they could then be utterly crushed. So
                  now their only hope is from outside aid; France has promised it. Alas! I fear it
                  will be but a frail support. There are those there actively at work. Documents and
                  statements must be furnished them. Your father has been chosen to carry these; his
                  honesty and devotion are well known; and then, from his humble position, he is not
                  as likely to be missed as one more prominent."
               "Ah, I see it now!" I said, with a heavy sigh.
               "The matter might be quite safe," he continued, "but the treachery of this priest
                  may jeopardize the lives of all concerned. What a rascal! I must take some means
                  to counteract his efforts, at least to let those here look out for their
                  safety."
               "And this holy father,—what can he have to do with it?"
               "It may be he fears this heterogeneous element that is astir, and, with the
                  barbarous reasoning of some, holds to the sacrifice of the few here for the good
                  of the many hereafter; but I don't know, at any rate I will have nothing to do
                  with it. You know, Olive, my family have always been Catholic, and suffered sadly
                  for their faith. Fines and confiscations, in their strict adherence to it, have
                  brought our once broad lands to the few acres around these old walls; but I would
                  rather let all go, yea, and my life, too, than have this fair island brought under
                  ecclesiastical rule. We have, alas! had too much of it already."
               A great sadness was over Mr. Massarene as I parted from him. And with a heavy
                  heart, full of forebodings, I returned to the Hall.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE RETURN.
               THE lingering hours drifted slowly away. It was getting towards twilight. On this
                  day of days, full of excitement, full of expectation, the young heir of the house
                  was waited for with love and honor befitting a young prince, and still he delayed.
                  Sir Robert and Lady Grace could not conceal their impatience, and Florence and
                  myself were glad when the arrival of Major Trenchard helped to divert our thoughts
                  for a time.
               At length the sound of wheels was heard. All rushed eagerly to the portico; but
                  the lumbering vehicle turned off to the back entrance,—it was only the carriage
                  with the luggage. On the box, however, sat Arthur's valet and Adele's spruce
                  little maid. These, at least, brought news of the lingerers. They were on their
                  way, would be with us soon, the cause of detention being that Mr. Fortescue, a
                  younger brother accompanying Adele, had stopped at the Castle in Dublin, with
                  papers from the government that must be at once delivered. With this excuse, of
                  course, we were obliged to be satisfied; but the hours of waiting passed slowly
                  and wearily as we lingered outside, the beauty of the cool, clear sunset, as it
                  bathed everything around in its soft golden light, scarcely exciting our slightest
                  attention.
               But hark! again there is the distant sound of wheels out on the road. Surely this
                  time they are come. Yes, this time there was no mistake. The great post-chaise,
                  with its foaming chargers, dashed up the drive.
               At this moment a deadly faintness came over me; my head reeled; I felt as if I
                  must sink to the floor. I could not remain thus to welcome the expected
                  guests,—impossible! Unobserved, I glided back to the Hall, and through the
                  drawing-room out to a side balcony, in the hope of regaining command of
                  myself.
               I heard them alight. I heard the glad words of welcome; and presently I heard
                  Arthur's voice, quick, impatient, asking where was Olive.
               "Where, indeed?" echoed Florence. "She was here a moment since."
               A step sounded on the floor of the drawing-room. I knew the step. There was no
                  time for escape. Passing through the open window out on the balcony where I had
                  taken refuge, Arthur stood before me.
               He must have imagined the cause of my absence, for he made no complaint, but,
                  taking both my hands in his, he said, "My own dear Olive, I am blest in seeing you
                  at last!"
               I know not how I replied. The look which accompanied these words, the touch of the
                  hands, the old, familiar voice, thrilled me with an exquisite joy. Like one in a
                  dream, I passed through the necessary introductions, greetings, and
                  compliments.
               Adele met me with gay good-humor. "Is it possible," she said, glancing brightly
                  over my face and person, "this is my
                  old antagonist? But how pale you look, and how you tremble!"
               I now raised my eyes to hers, determined to throw off my embarrassment, and answer
                  as I should her prompt salutations.
               That instantaneous glance revealed to me a fact which covered me with confusion. I
                  saw that Adele had discovered my secret,—a secret scarce known, at least scarce
                  acknowledged, to myself, and certainly never suspected by those about me. She knew
                  that I loved Arthur,—that this was no common meeting.
               Oh, the humility of having all I had held thus sacred brought so rudely to
                  light!
               But I must command myself. I called in the aid of my pride, and, with a powerful
                  effort, succeeded in regaining composure. I recalled the time when this same Adele
                  held such a freezing control over me, when every faculty of my being seemed to
                  stagnate in her presence, and I resolved it should not be so again. Indeed, I had
                  no right to charge her with any attempt to distress me. She was all frankness and
                  joyousness, and the ease and pleasure she evinced soon diffused its influence on
                  every side.
               When the travel dispersed to their dressing-rooms to rest and refresh themselves
                  after their journey, the family comments began. Lady Grace thought Adele charming,
                  and Sir Robert declared her a splendid-looking girl, though rather too
                  self-assured for his taste. Major Trenchard pronounced her glorious.
               "But no one says anything about Arthur," cried Florence. "When he was at home, and
                  always with us I did not think how he looked; but now I see him as others would,
                  and I think he is very handsome. Don't you, Olive,—though I remember you always
                  like dark complexions, and Arthur is very light, but so clear and fair and
                  striking. Major Trenchard, I know you will agree with me that Arthur is handsome,
                  very handsome."
               "Certainly," whispered the gallant major. "I could not think otherwise when he so
                  much resembles his lovely sister."
               Whereat Florence frowned playfully, blushing the while, and declaring that these
                  compliments were not to her taste.
               How beautiful she looked sitting there, her eyes beaming upon the man she loved,
                  her face lit with a happy smile!
               Yes, these two were happy, I thought. The world laid its treasures at their
                  feet,—love and wealth and honor. For me my one first hour of half-acknowledged
                  love dawned in misery and anxiety. Not as a prince, whose right it was to reign,
                  crowned, honored, and fêted, came my love to me, but rather as one sore pressed,
                  with face averted, disguised, distressed, a fugitive; almost, it seemed, a
                  traitor.
               By the time that dinner was announced I had, however, recovered my composure.
                  Whatever might be the result, I was resolved not to betray any weakness.
               Adele, in full dress, now entered the dining-hall resplendent in her charms. She
                  had certainly grown to wonderful elegance of appearance and bearing. Hardly to be
                  called handsome, she nevertheless commanded admiration by a grace and fascination
                  of style which is often more attractive than beauty.
               
               I could not help gazing upon her with some surprise as I recalled the ungainly and
                  awkward girl of former days.
               Perhaps this feeling was reciprocated by the fair Adele. Certain it is that I
                  underwent at her hands a curious and circumspect examination, as though she were
                  searching for the secret which had worked my transformation. All this, however,
                  under a mask of playful interest and the frankest friendliness. Adele was
                  evidently a woman of the world, an adept in its ways and wisdom.
               We all found her charming during the dinner hour. She was so overflowing with wit
                  and repartee that the whole party became inspired with unusual gayety. Even Sir
                  Robert and the dignified Lady Grace joined in the general hilarity. During the
                  evening we had music; Adele, whose voice was really a splendid one, sitting at the
                  piano until it was nearly time to retire, when we separated, apparently in fine
                  spirits.
               "How do you like her?" was the first question of Florence as we sat undressing by
                  the fire in our cozy little chamber. This was the time for all our secret
                  communings, when we spoke as freely as we thought, knowing that the words of each
                  were sacred to the other, locked up from the outer world as surely as though never
                  uttered.
               "How do I like her?" I repeated. "Why, she is very agreeable. Don't you think
                  so?"
               Florence sat musing an instant, and then answered, in her usual frank way, "Yes,
                  she is agreeable and handsome, and talented, I should say; but—it is hardly fair
                  to be governed by one's impressions—but I don't like her, Olive; no, I really do
                  not. Her despotic manner, her perfect self-possession, are not to my taste. How
                  constantly she exacted the attention of Arthur and Major Trenchard during the
                  whole evening! One must turn the leaves of her music and one must accompany her
                  with his voice. I do think it was really unfeeling, when Arthur had been away so
                  long; and then I was left to entertain that conceited Mr. Fortescue. But pshaw!"
                  said Florence, suddenly repenting, as was her habit after any little outbreak of
                  temper or fault-finding, "how I have been talking! I think the trouble must be
                  with myself, Olive. Everything seems to be wrong with me tonight. Never mind;
                  to-morrow we shall have Arthur all to ourselves."
               But to-morrow brought its own engagements. Adele, either at the hotel where they
                  landed from the packet or at the one where they had stopped to dine, had left a
                  box of jewelry,—very valuable jewelry, it appeared,—about which she was very much
                  alarmed. We all sympathized with her. The missing casket must be searched for
                  without delay. Sir Robert offered to send his faithful man of business to hunt it
                  up, but Adele objected. People at hotels were so cunning; the gems might have been
                  stolen by the servants, and unless skillful management was made use of they might
                  never be recovered.
               In this dilemma, Major Trenchard, who had ridden over early in the morning,
                  volunteered his services, saying that he was free for the day. But then Arthur
                  must accompany him, that was admitted; the gallant major must have a companion,
                  and Arthur knew where they had been. It
                  was absolutely necessary he should go.
               "Why would not Mr. Fortescue answer?" timidly suggested Florence. "He, too, was
                  with them."
               But Mr. Fortescue knew nothing of the country or people,—could not be ready for
                  any emergency that might occur. Arthur must go: the fates had, it seemed, decreed
                  it so; and so for another day we gave him up.
               But Adele made amends for his absence. She certainly was a great acquisition to a
                  quiet country-house. She had so much to tell us of the gay world outside, was so
                  full of life and animation, and her brother proved himself so much more agreeable
                  than we had anticipated, that, with a walk in the park and a visit to the
                  conservatories, we got through the day quite pleasantly.
               The gentlemen did not return until quite late, and were so much fatigued that they
                  retired immediately to their rooms, Major Trenchard remaining all night.
               Adele was profuse in her expressions of gratitude on meeting the gentlemen next
                  morning.
               The major was obliged to ride over to the barracks very early; he must be there
                  before midday. It was such a lovely morning. "Let us all go," said Adele. "I am
                  dying to see the old castle and the quarters of the garrison. My brother will be
                  there soon, you know. I hear you have such a splendid view of the ocean from the
                  heights. Come, do let us go!" Of course, the major joined in the request. No
                  matter how urgent or important his own business might be, this gentleman was never
                  known to neglect the behests of a lady.
               But Florence had been forbidden to ride on horseback until her cold was better,
                  and I would not go if she did not. Still Adele persisted. The day was too
                  beautiful to be thrown away, she said, with so much longing in her animated face
                  that no one could gainsay her; and Arthur must accompany them, because young Mr.
                  Fortescue would not know the way back.
               "I should be lost under his protecting care," said the young lady, smiling, and
                  showing her pearl-white teeth. "He is as absent-minded as any old philosopher;
                  aren't you, Tom?"
               Tom kindly assented to this description of his youthful peculiarity, and Arthur
                  went.
               So another day went by, for the party did not return until nearly nightfall. There
                  had been so much to see, so many departments to visit, and some dear, delightful
                  old officers they had met abroad had insisted on their staying to luncheon, and
                  the ruins of the old rock-fortress were so interesting! What
                  strongholds those old Irish kings protected their royalty in, to be sure!
               But this was only a beginning. Every day there were new plans. The country in
                  every direction was to be explored, all its picturesque spots and old ruins
                  visited, and, not least nor last, there were such glorious sea-side rides. Adele
                  was a practiced horsewoman, and her health and spirits were unfailing. She must
                  have Arthur with her to lead and direct; her brother was no horseman, he must stay
                  at home and entertain the ladies; and, as it would not answer for Arthur and Adele
                  to go on these excursions alone, why Major Trenchard must accompany them.
                     Florence, too, insisted that he
                  should; she would not have him shut up in the house for her sake, when he enjoyed
                  horseback exercise so much.
               Thus it went on day after day, until we at last gave up all hope of having Arthur,
                  as of old, our own property, Adele was in her element, and was, by her buoyancy,
                  spirit, and ever-ready wit, fast becoming a general favorite. Her enthusiastic
                  praises of the country even won the heart of Sir Robert, who, an ardent lover of
                  his native land, found it a pleasant thing to hear its praises sounded from the
                  lips of a stranger.
               One soft, sunshiny morning, Lady Grace proposed that the ladies should take the
                  close carriage and make a few long-delayed calls in the neighborhood. Florence
                  could join them, thus protected from the air, without detriment to her health, and
                  the gentlemen could accompany the party on horseback.
               Florence was pining for outer air, having been kept in-doors for many weeks by an
                  obstinate cold. Well wrapped up, and with her soft eyes beaming upon her attendant
                  lover, she descended to the carriage. We were about ready to start, when Adele
                  suddenly discovered that she could not ride in a close carriage; it always made
                  her sick. She would take her brother's horse, and he could take her seat in the
                  vehicle.
               There was no changing her plan; and so, after a little delay, a side-saddle was
                  brought, and she galloped off in company with the gentlemen.
               I saw Florence turn pale as Major Trenchard rode gayly by, touching his hat to her
                  as he passed to join those in front. Perhaps she thought he would have guided his
                  horse so as to remain near her; and then she had been ill, and was so used to
                  being petted and indulged that, having made this effort to come, she was
                  disappointed that he took it so lightly. But she soon rallied. She was too
                  unselfish to allow the pleasure of others to be overclouded by her gloom, and we
                  soon had a laugh at the expense of Mr. Fortescue, who, snugly ensconced in the
                  corner of the carriage, gave vent every now and then to an unguarded exclamation
                  of surprise at what he saw.
               "Oh, ah! really, now, I thought—I had heard, I mean—that your houses in the
                  country districts were built mostly of mud, and here are some noble—yes,
                  noble—specimens of architecture," pointing to a few fine country-seats in the
                  distance.
               Even Lady Grace smiled, though she checked by a look the continuance of Florence's
                  mirthfulness.
               But we must return; Florence was getting very tired. We had made a few short
                  calls, and Mr. Fortescue expressed himself as charmed and bewildered by the beauty
                  and grace of the young ladies to whom he was introduced. "Deuced fine girls, 'pon
                  honor!" which was generally the extent of his encomiums. In ability, social
                  qualities, and worldly polish this young man suffered in comparison with his
                  brilliant sister. He accepted his position as a sort of attendant in her train
                  with an innocence and quietness which should, doubtless, rank among his good
                  qualities.
               Our companions, who preferred going on to calling with us, were now far out of
                  sight, and we drove back to the Hall without them. It was some hours before they
                  returned, overflowing with good spirits, and declaring they had never seen such a
                  glorious day.
               
               I saw that Florence was wounded, she could not conceal it from me; but she only
                  complained of being fatigued. Not all Major Trenchard's devoted attention during
                  the evening, nor his expressions of regret that she had over-exerted herself,
                  could restore her to her usual light-heartedness. She was weary and listless, and
                  she and I retired early.
               When in our own room neither of us seemed at first disposed to speak; there are
                  some feelings too tender, too sensitively shrinking, to bear utterance. Thus we
                  sat in silence until I saw the great tears roll down the sweet face of my
                  companion, and then I rose and threw my arms around her, and she laid her head on
                  my shoulder and sobbed like a little child. Oh, how freely I could have wept with
                  her! "Olive," she said, "I am hurt, my heart is sore."
               "I know it is, dear."
               "Why, why is it," she added, "that I have felt so unhappy ever since Adele has
                  been here? Is it that I have changed? I used to love everybody, and everybody
                  looked kindly on me; but now I am suspicious, easily offended, and dissatisfied
                  with myself and every one else. I just feel as if I could cry, cry, and still it
                  does not ease me."
               I could have answered, and did in my inmost thoughts, that some have the genius of
                  spreading discontent, as some have of diffusing love, where all are unconscious
                  from whence it comes; but I only replied, "There is one thing, Florence; you must
                  assert yourself more decidedly. There are some persons who can only understand
                  timidity as inferiority."
               "You are right, Olive," she answered quickly, as if stirred with a new idea. "I
                     have been weak, indeed; I see it plainly now. I will be so no
                  longer, and you must help me, Olive. Adele does not understand our courtesy toward
                  our guests; she has mistaken our hospitality, our giving way to her in everything,
                  for a tacit acknowledgment of her own superiority. We have allowed her to go
                  forward, direct, and assume authority until she has forgotten her position, I
                  think."
               I smiled at my companion's impetuosity, and said some soothing words; but Florence
                  was now fully roused, and paid no heed.
               "It vexes me beyond expression," she said, the color rising to her delicate
                  cheeks, "to feel her condescending manner—her kindly patronage of me; as if I were
                  a pretty doll. I hate her compliments, her anxious solicitude, her overwhelming
                  apologies. Oh, she is false, false! I know it, and yet everybody is blind, I
                  think; even—" She checked herself; the name of Major Trenchard she could not and
                  would not mention, though perhaps his interest in the charming newcomer was one
                  secret source of my friend's irritation.
               "Do you know," said she, laughing, as she lifted her head with a pretty
                  haughtiness, "she actually apologized to me for the constant attention paid her by
                  our visitors! It pained her, forsooth, when she was well aware that I
                  was the person entitled to them. Think of that, Olive! when it is so evident that
                  her efforts are all directed to that end."
               But Florence stopped. She had already expended her brief indignation. She began to
                  make apologies: "I am sorry I cannot like Adele; I have tried, you know I have,
                  Olive; and you know, too, that I would
                  not talk about her in this way to any one else. And she is mamma's near relative,
                  too; and mamma thinks so well of her."
               Our "plan," as Florence designated it, was carried out. The next evening, when
                  music was proposed, she led the way to the music-room, and, sitting down at the
                  piano, played a brilliant bravura. There were but few visitors, and all seemed
                  astonished to find the usually retiring Florence so fine a performer. Major
                  Trenchard and Arthur were delighted, and as she and I joined in singing some old
                  Irish melodies, there rose in the room a pleasant murmur very like applause.
               Our recreant knights became our slaves again for the time at least, and Florence
                  looked happy.
               I will confess to having made unusual exertions that evening, and to feeling the
                  exultation of a not very amiable pride when complimented on the richness and
                  purity of my voice. I knew Adele was listening. This, I will own, was not a
                  respectable motive; it was mean, and I felt ashamed of it; but I knew,
                  notwithstanding the civilities which passed between that young lady and myself,
                  that Adele was my determined enemy.
               Arthur seemed bent upon conversing with me this evening. He seated himself near me
                  upon the sofa, his arm resting upon the back of it. "Olive," said he,
                  reproachfully, but speaking in so low a voice that it could reach no ear save my
                  own, "Olive, why have you so persistently avoided me since my return home?"
               "Avoided you!" I repeated in astonishment.
               "Yes. It was a cruel return for all the months I have given to constant thought of
                  you, and lived upon the hope of meeting you again.
               "I too have waited," I stammered out, scarce knowing what to say in my
                  excitement.
               "But you did not meet me as I met you; and since then, Olive, I have noticed a
                  constant restraint and desire to avoid me."
               Oh, if he could only understand the depth of emotion with which my heart responded
                  to his voice! But I could not speak; I could not explain.
               Arthur saw my agitation; and, I think, somewhat understood it, for he continued
                  more tenderly: "I know, Olive, you were never very demonstrative in your actions,
                  nor very profuse in your words of affection; but I always did imagine you loved me
                  a little,—just a very little."
               I could scarcely restrain my tears.
               "I see we are watched," said he, abruptly, yet speaking still lower; "but whisper,
                  Olive; whisper this to me, and I will bide my time; tell me that it was not any
                  falling off of esteem that has made you shun me; say this, Olive, only this!"
               "Say it!" I repeated, vehemently, my voice choking with the violence of my
                  suppressed feelings, "say it! Yes, a hundred and a hundred times I will—"
               At that moment Adele came up, all smiles and courtesy, to say that they were going
                  to dance, and his mother wished him to lead with Lady Mary Chichester.
               He left me, but I was happy. Oh, the joy, the heartfelt peace of those few hours,
                  brief, flitting, as they were! Neither time nor circumstance can altogether efface
                  their memory. Arthur loved me. He had not said it in words, but I knew it full
                  well. It seemed that evening, with all the light and brilliance about me, the hum of voices, the graceful movement
                  of the dance, the rising and falling music, it seemed as though I was bathed in
                  some strange, delicious atmosphere, which nothing earthy could penetrate; an
                  aroma, as of a soul come newly into bloom, shed itself about me. I walked and
                  moved apart from the rest of the world; not to be approached, depressed, or
                  irritated longer by its petty cares or joys.
               Not even was I greatly disturbed when a whispered conversation among a group, of
                  which Adele was the centre, caught my ear, and sent the blood tingling to my
                  cheeks. At that moment, though excited, I was too much etherealized to suffer.
               The party was being made acquainted, as others had sedulously been, with the fact
                  of my peasant origin. Suppressed exclamations, lady-like oh's and ah's, and
                  sidewise glances over fair shoulders, indicated that I was being weighed in the
                  balance.
               "And she owes everything to the bounty of dear Lady Grace!" "Is it possible!" and
                  "How independently she carries herself," and "One can see it after all her pride
                  of bearing," were among the encouraging comments that reached my ears in the
                  musical accents, and soft, harmonious voices, of unquestionable birth and
                  breeding.
               But what did I care, to-night? I was a plebeian, but my love was divine. And,
                  after all, perhaps these things were wholesome reminders; for among these dear
                  good friends, and with Florence always beside me, I was in danger of forgetting
                  that I was in truth a peasant's daughter.
               On the following morning, at the breakfast-table, Lady Grace casually remarked
                  that she hoped Walter's conservatories would furnish her an abundant supply this
                  evening, both of fruit and flowers.
               Walter was now head gardener at the Hall.
               "Walter!" repeated Arthur, with some vexation, "that is too bad. I have not seen
                  him since I came home. He is one of the finest fellows in the world; I used to
                  love him as a brother."
               "As a brother!" laughed Adele, "and who next will be your sister? Shall I
                  introduce you to my pretty maid?"
               Arthur colored, but Lady Grace hastily interrupted any unpleasantness by saying
                  that as Adele had not yet seen the conservatories or hot-houses, we might all pay
                  them a visit, and, if scientifically inclined, we would find Walter most
                  intelligent in giving us information.
               "Do you know, Arthur," she added, "that some of his written statements about our
                  native plants have received high commendation from the 'National Horticultural
                  Society'?"
               Of course we were all ready to go. We only waited Major Trenchard's arrival. "Wrap
                  yourself up well, Florence," said her careful mother, for Florence was not yet off
                  the sick list, and her cough was a subject of some anxiety to those who loved her.
                  Bright and delicate as a dream, there was, however, nothing of the sick-room
                  atmosphere about the young girl; she was neither depressed nor depressing.
               Arthur gave me his arm, and Adele was left to the gallantry of her brother, whom
                  she always snubbed without mercy. But she revenged herself on the party by taking exclusive possession of
                  Walter. There was so much to learn, so much to see! Oh, what an attractive field
                  of knowledge! And as they passed and repassed us in the flower-bordered alleys,
                  she wore quite an air of triumph.
               But I saw or thought of little else than Arthur, on whose arm I hung. At his side,
                  listening to his voice, a delicious delirium steeped my senses. At some future
                  time it might be—some far future time—this cup of joy must be put from me. But
                  now, now let me taste its nectar, uncaring, with youthful inconsequence, whatever
                  might come hereafter.
               Walter and Arthur met rather coolly. But I blamed Walter for this. Arthur had
                  gathered a few flowers for me, and was in the act of putting them in my hand, when
                  Walter and Adele approached.
               I said, playfully, "Walter, will you allow this—that we should pluck your flowers
                  without so much as saying 'by your leave'?"
               Walter made no answer, and looking up I saw in his face an expression so strange
                  that it pained and puzzled me. It might be bitterness, it might be hate; I
                  shuddered and turned away. Why did he fix his eyes upon me so strangely? Was he,
                  too, thinking that I was growing forgetful of my plebeian origin?
               Neither Arthur nor Adele noticed this by-play; they had turned away at the moment
                  to examine some rare and curious plant which hung its fragrant festoons just
                  beyond us.
               I was glad when all proposed to leave, and we had turned to go home.
               A few hundred feet beyond the conservatories rose a gentle eminence commanding an
                  extensive view. Many legends of old times were connected with this spot. Tradition
                  held that here rival septs or chieftains had waged fearful battle over their
                  dividing lines. A fair heritage it was, well worthy warrior's sword.
               The ancient lore of his country was one of Arthur's hobbies, a taste first
                  stimulated to activity by Mr. Massarene, and now he stopped to point out to Mr.
                  Fortescue the position which each clan occupied in the fight, and the admirable
                  adaptation of the spot for a fray.
               At that moment I recollected a message in regard to the fruit and flowers which
                  had been given me by Lady Grace for Walter. It had slipped my mind altogether. I
                  ran back hastily, as they all stood absorbed in Arthur's description, my intention
                  being to deliver the message and return before my absence was noticed.
               I went the entire length of the principal conservatory, and still did not see
                  Walter.
               Pushing open the door of a small room at the end, where I knew he used to pot his
                  plants, I entered. There stood the object of my search, his face buried in his
                  hands, which rested on a cross-beam; he was evidently under the influence of some
                  strong excitement, and did not hear my step as I approached.
               "Walter! Walter!" I cried, "what is the matter?" But he took no notice.
               "Walter, will you not speak to me? Oh, what is the matter; what have
                  I done? Oh, why did you look at me so, Walter?"
               He turned at my incoherent appeal, as one who makes a strong effort at
                  self-control.
               "Olive," said he, grasping my hands between his, "bear with me a little while. You cannot understand
                  this, Olive; you have not done any wrong, sweet love; but bear with me for old
                  times' sake. I will soon get the mastery of myself."
               I was about to answer; my heart was filled with pity, my voice shook with emotion,
                  when looking toward the open door I saw Adele gazing intently upon us. I withdrew
                  my hands hastily, ready to cry with vexation. I knew the use she might make of
                  this; but I did not know the cruel extent to which she would carry her revenge
                  upon me.
               When I returned to where the others were, Arthur was just getting through with his
                  explanations; he had just fought his battle, and dispersed his invisible army. No
                  one had missed me. Why, then, had Adele? Why had she followed me, unless it was to
                  watch my movements?
               Arthur remarked that I looked flushed.
               "You and Adele have been stealing a march on us," he said, carelessly; "walking
                  into rosy cheeks and flashing eyes, while we have been boring ourselves over musty
                  antiquities."
               All that day I could not throw off the depression that beset me. I could not get
                  Walter, his words and looks, from my mind.
               Towards evening, as we were all assembled in the drawing-room, Lady Grace
                  remarked, "I begin to feel a little anxious about the flowers and fruit. Walter is
                  not apt to be so dilatory."
               I started with a frightened exclamation that caused all to look at me. At that
                  moment I remembered that I had again failed to deliver the message. In the
                  conflict of feeling, all thought of it had vanished from my mind.
               "Oh, Lady Grace," I gasped, "do not blame Walter; it is my fault. I went back—I
                  went back—" and unable longer to control my pent-up feelings, I burst into a
                  passion of tears.
               "Olive, my child," said Lady Grace, in astonishment, "what does this mean?"
               Arthur now came forward with a cold, frowning countenance.
               "There is no occasion for this excess of feeling," he said, severely. "I will
                  attend to the matter myself." And with hasty steps he left the room.
               I was now sick, indeed. Continued excitement, suppressed emotion, the
                  misunderstanding, which I felt rather than saw, were too much for me. My head
                  reeled, my limbs trembled. Soon as it was possible I retired to my room, and did
                  not leave it for some days. Feverish, unnerved, anxious, I was ill; ill indeed,
                  with a sickness which not all the tender solicitude of Florence nor the matronly
                  prudence of Lady Grace were likely to cure.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               LOVE.
               FOR some days after this I kept my room, really ill with the fever and excitement
                  caused by the apparently unimportant occurrence I have related.
               The trifling omission of forgetting the message intrusted me by Lady Grace had
                  brought upon me exposure, mortification, and utter misapprehension. For a time my
                  spirit quailed before the entanglement of circumstances, which seemed to have
                  woven a net about me.
               And then Arthur was so harsh. But why did I show such unusual feeling? It
                  certainly might create suspicion. Ah, could he but know all, how simple it would
                  seem!
               And then I knew what Adele would make of it; I saw it by the malicious triumph in
                  her eye. I knew that by this time Arthur had been told everything, and told with
                  all the art such a skilled deceiver could command. How cruel it seemed! Had I
                  loved Walter, and Walter had said he loved me, then I could boldly avow my
                  sentiments. Why need I be ashamed? As a man, in natural endowments, he was far
                  superior to any around me. This I knew, but it did not help me. I did not love
                  Walter,—I mean in that acceptation which made him dearer to me than any one else
                  on earth. There was a tenderness in my feelings towards him; had always been. A
                  deep sense of pity filled me at any slight, at any disappointment put upon his
                  proud spirit, while I sympathized with all his aspirations, his broad,
                  warm-hearted desires. And now had come this added sense of gratitude, this
                  humbling realization of my own obtuseness, that he, through all the apparent
                  insensibility I had manifested, had continued to regard me with such steadfast
                  devotion, and I had not seen it.
               For, of course, that brief scene in the conservatory, that deep emotion
                  interpreted into broken words, had revealed to me this truth,—Walter loved me. By
                  the light of this revelation I now understood clearly what had hitherto seemed
                  eccentric, harsh, or unkind in his bearing toward me. But I could not return this
                  devotion; therefore, I must guard his secret as a sacred trust; no, not even
                  Florence should know it.
               And then, in my musing, I would still repeat that Arthur need not have been so
                  harsh; and he might, in these days of my absence, have easily sent some kind,
                  inquiring message by Florence. The warm-hearted girl would have given it to me
                  with so much pleasure. But, from all I could gather, he had not even mentioned my
                  name. Oh, I knew it all: he now despised me; he turned loathingly from my seeming
                  mean duplicity.
               But why could he not seek an explanation? I would with one I loved; I would not
                  condemn unheard. But explanations between us would be dangerous; I dared not allow
                  myself to think of them; it was better even though my heart should break,—better
                  that he should despise and avoid me,—oh, much better!
               Ought I, could I, in honor, listen to the words explanations planations might bring? My mind was awakening to
                  this; bitterly was I realizing the anomaly of my position. Could I accept, even if
                  offered, the affections of this cherished son of my generous benefactors? No, no,
                  I could not be so unjust, so cruel, as to bring on them the sneers and the pity of
                  their world; dash all their hopes to the ground, wound them in their tenderest
                  sensibilities. No, no, rather let that vain, heartless girl have her triumph. I
                  would bear myself with apparent insensibility, even though every heart-throe
                  threatened to snap my thread of life asunder.
               It was well Lady Betty came in. She had heard I was sick. "I will not have this
                  moping!" were her first words; "come down with me to the drawing-room." I
                  expostulated; but it was vain to expostulate with Lady Betty when she decreed a
                  thing. "Come, smooth your black hair and put this yellow rose in it. Why, girl, do
                  you know you are getting to be quite a beauty!" This was a great deal from the
                  dear old lady, who was much more apt to see flaws than perfections, even in those
                  she most admired.
               I followed her down-stairs. In the drawing-room was a stranger, one of those
                  arrivals of now almost daily occurrence, a British officer, who, with his
                  regiment, was just from London. They had marched to their station in the barracks
                  of the old castle, or fortress, at Arklow, and he had at once ridden over to call
                  on his relatives. Florence introduced him to us as Captain Fortescue, Adele's
                  eldest brother.
               Arthur was also in the room, but his only recognition was a distant, formal bow. I
                  felt a little sore at this. I had been sick; I was even now very weak; he might at
                  any rate have found me a seat. But Captain Fortescue was all gallantry; and,
                  during the short time we remained, he was most assiduous in his attentions.
               Of course, Lady Betty, during this interview, held as usual her scornful,
                  supercilious air. She looked upon these red-coats, as she called them, with utter
                  detestation. "They are our licensed butchers," she would say to her nephew, "come
                  to try their knives on our poor countrymen. How can you entertain—how can you
                     endure them?" she would add, with increased asperity.
               Poor Sir Robert could only reply with a kind of stifled groan. He could have told
                  her much, have explained a great deal, but silence was his only safety with his
                  hot-headed aunt.
               She would only remain a few minutes this morning. While Captain Fortescue,
                  Florence, and myself were engaged in one of those desultory chats made up of
                  nothings, she and Arthur had withdrawn to a far corner of the room, and seemed to
                  have some high words together.
               "Come, Olive, my dear," the old lady said, brusquely, sweeping across the room in
                  her rustling silks, "you're to drive out with me to-day, you know, and I've no
                  further business here."
               There was no resisting this imperative invitation, and so, escorted by the gallant
                  captain, I was soon seated beside Lady Betty in the old coach.
               "I've no patience with Arthur!" exclaimed my companion, as the coach-door closed
                  and the captain bowed adieu. "No patience; he's lost all his spirit." She was
                  silent a few minutes, but soon recovered her animation. "And now, my dear," she said, as we
                  drove along, "I want you to be well. There is to be a great dinner-party at the
                  Hall, and you must be there. The guests will not be numerous, but will consist of
                  the highest political magnates. My Lord Castlereagh, of course, will be present,
                  and our lord lieutenant, with others; it is in honor of some minister fresh from
                  the British court, some one high in favor with his most sacred and also most
                  imbecile majesty. Faugh! But my reason for being there will be to meet that noble
                  vindicator of our poor, hunted countrymen in these wretched 'State trials,' Mr.
                  Curran,—you have heard of him, my dear?—than whom no nobler soul liveth," added
                  the old lady in her energetic enthusiasm.
               Yes, I had heard of him; Walter had told me all about him,—how he had risen
                  trumpet-tongued to defend those whom no one else would dare raise a voice to
                  shield. And Walter had read to me some of those glowing speeches, those
                  heart-thrilling appeals, till my eyes would overflow with tears and his voice
                  would be choked with emotion.
               "Oh, yes, Lady Betty, I have heard of him,—heard of him so much! I love him with
                  the warmest gratitude. Is he indeed to be there?"
               "Yes; and would you believe my Lady Grace is opposed to it? 'He is so uncouth,'
                  she says, 'and is not one of our set, and you know my Lord Castlereagh and he are
                  always antagonistic, and dear Lady Emily cannot endure him. How could you, Sir
                  Robert, be so imprudent as to invite him at this time? Is there no way you can get
                  out of it,—send an apology, appoint some other time,—anything?' And I do believe
                  the poor, wavering fellow would have had to submit had I not been there! Bless me!
                  I sometimes think he is not sure his soul's his own."
               Poor, dear Lady Betty, she was ever at war. It would seem as if to her the world
                  was one vast arena of pointed weapons, with which she must do battle. But I loved
                  her; warm-hearted, impulsive, her sympathies were ever with the oppressed. She
                  hated all pretension. Management, long-waiting, persuasion, were her abhorrence.
                  She had no patience with those who, loving peace, would seek to bring about their
                  objects by such means, neither had she patience with those who, even for the
                  ambitious and self-seeking, might find a word of apology. In her strong
                  one-sidedness, she did not always judge aright; seeing but in part, she would
                  condemn, when in her moments of calmer retrospection she could not but admit she
                  had been wrong. But I loved her; I knew the strong pulses of her heart beat for
                  the right, and I rejoiced in their strength.
               When we, or rather I, returned to the Hall,—for Lady Betty left me at the gate,—I
                  found Florence alone. The other ladies, with Arthur, were out for a drive before
                  luncheon, and the gallant captain was gone.
               Florence was in high glee; I had made a decided conquest, she said. This was a
                  delightful case of love at first sight. Oh, the captain had asked so many
                  questions about me! If Ireland produced such forms and faces, he was a most lucky
                  fellow to have been sent here.
               "But do you know, Olive," she said, laughing, "that cool-headed Arthur had the
                  heart to interrupt his rhapsodies, by quietly remarking you were father's ward. And then I said, I fear a little
                  maliciously, that I doubted if he would find favor in your eyes so long as he wore
                  that uniform, for you were a staunch Irish girl. But the captain didn't mind our
                  raillery; he laughed, and said he would hope to blind your eyes to that, for there
                  was such a thing as being color-blind as well as love-blind, and in the red you
                  might come to see only the green. But Olive," she said, suddenly changing her
                  tone, "what ails Arthur? He quite reproved me for my levity. I do not think there
                  was anything wrong in what I said, do you?"
               "No, dear, Captain Fortescue would understand it was all in jest."
               "Certainly he would." And after a pause, her sweet face brightening, she added, "I
                  have it all now; it is because it was Adele's brother, he is afraid of having
                  anything done to give offense. You would be astonished to see how intimate they
                  have become, all within a few days; there is so much whispering and talk between
                  them. If Major Trenchard were to come now, I could have him all to myself. But you
                  have heard, Olive, he is appointed aid to Lieutenant-General Lake,
                  commander-in-chief of all his majesty's forces in Ireland, and they have been off,
                  scouring the country. He has not been here in some days, but I have just had a
                  note from him, saying he will be back to-morrow or next day; at any rate, he and
                  the general will be here at papa's dinner-party. You have heard of that, dear,
                  have you not?" I told her I had.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               A FEW IRISH CELEBRITIES.
               THE evening of our small, but brilliant dinner-party had come. I was to have the
                  pleasure I had so desired of seeing Mr. Curran face to face. Curran, whose name
                  Walter and I had so often pronounced with enthusiasm! Curran, the daring defender
                  of the unfortunate State prisoners! Curran, who never drew back from danger in his
                  country's cause, and whose burning denunciations against the wrongs inflicted upon
                  his countrymen had, for a moment, arrested the attention of the corrupt, and
                  stayed the uplifted arm of cruelty for a brief, astonished pause! I was to see
                  this man; I was to hear his voice, be near him a whole evening. The thought filled
                  me with excitement and a fluttering expectation.
               But why had Sir Robert so determinedly invited him at this time? He must have
                  known that most of the distinguished guests invited were the strong political
                  opponents of Curran,—that even more than political animosity existed between
                  them—that there was strong personal dislike also. Lord Castlereagh, of course,
                  would be there, and all knew the bitter animosity between them; also his
                  excellency the lord lieutenant, and the many military officers, with their chief.
                  Of course, with none of these could there be any sympathy with this advocate of
                  the people, and yet Sir Robert had
                  invited him. It was quite a mystery to me. Could it be that he wanted it seen and
                  felt that he was not wholly with the governing party? It might be so; I could not
                  think of any other solution.
               The dining-hall shone brilliantly on this evening, as the guests paired in in
                  their proper order. Lady Grace, with the honorable Mr. Pelham. Then his excellency
                  Lord Cambden and lady, followed by General Lake, commander-in-chief, who had taken
                  under his escort the fair daughter of the house. Then, following Lord Castlereagh
                  and the Lady Emily, came a few honorables and right honorables of both sexes, with
                  young officers in their scarlet uniforms, and bright maidens in all the flutter of
                  gauze and gossamer, while the rear was brought up by the venerable Lady Betty with
                  Mr. Curran and Sir Robert on either side. Adele had secured Arthur, and Captain
                  Fortescue, her brother, claimed me as his partner.
               I would much rather have had it otherwise. I should have liked to sit apart
                  unnoticed,—to watch the gay scene, the varying countenances; to listen to the wit,
                  the repartee, the graceful words and polished phrases, coined, I was sometimes
                  disposed to think, rather to conceal, than to express, thought.
               And truly it was a brilliant scene. At either end of the long hall huge fires
                  blazed in the ample grates, diffusing a cheerful glow and warmth; over the long
                  table, glittering with silver and cut glass, hung the immense chandelier, with its
                  numerous wax-lights, and along the walls the oval mirrors, with their branch
                  candlesticks, reflected and repeated the brightness. On the spacious sideboard,
                  fruits and flowers, heaped in splendid profusion, diffused a delightful fragrance
                  over the room.
               I think all felt the charm of the occasion, for the steps of the guests grew
                  lighter and their smiles gayer, as they entered the cheerful hall.
               "I think I never saw a beautifuller set of people," whispered Jenks to his
                  powdered assistant, in my hearing; "and how grand the young master looks!"
               I was well pleased with the place assigned me, though I would have preferred not
                  to have had Adele and Arthur immediately opposite. I could have a good view of the
                  faces I most wished to see. Mr. Curran and Lady Betty were next below Adele and
                  Arthur, nearer Sir Robert, who seemed determined to pay the gentleman all
                  honor.
               Conversation, during the different courses, was quite animated; there were no dull
                  pauses of comparative silence, but it was at first confined mostly to those in
                  close proximity; as the dessert was removed and the fruit and wine were
                  circulating it became more general.
               There was great praise bestowed on the fruit and flowers, so abundant at this late
                  season.
               You must have a jewel of a gardener," said one of the right honorables to the
                  host.
               Truly, he is a jewel," answered Sir Robert, with warmth; "a splendid fellow, a
                  true, natural genius."
               "And who is this splendid fellow?" asked Captain Fortescue, speaking to Arthur
                  across the table.
               "Well, ah!"—altogether taken by surprise, Arthur began, "He is, he is—"
               When Adele, taking the words from him, said, "He is a young rustic,—a protegé of
                  the family in whom Sir Robert takes
                  some interest." This was said with a loud voice, that all could hear. And then
                  Arthur, as if ashamed of his wavering, added, "He is, as my father has said, a
                  truly noble fellow, and one whose capacity we might all envy."
               As he said this he fixed his eyes on me, and I felt the blood mount to my cheeks,
                  and fancied I saw that half-sneering smile on Adele's face which always provoked
                  me. I was most painfully agitated. I had listened with pleasure to Walter's
                  praises; but now, because Arthur looked at me, because I supposed I knew what was
                  in his mind, I must connect it with myself, and act in this ridiculous way. How
                  provoking! I did not know whether to be most angry with Arthur or myself. Did he
                  suppose he was grandly magnanimous, when he thus patronizingly echoed the praises
                  of one who could be great without them? But I was too angry to be just or
                  generous; I felt this, and it made me still more vexed.
               Fortunately, Captain Fortescue had not noticed my embarrassment, and continued
                  talking, much to my relief, for the effort to catch his words, and answer as I
                  should, diverted my thoughts from myself.
               Politics had been avoided, no doubt purposely, during our meal; this rather threw
                  a restraint on conversation. It was felt there were contending elements near, and
                  subjects of discord were prudently avoided; there had been many other topics
                  touched upon, but politics being the real interest of the day, every one's mind
                  being full of them, made all efforts on other subjects grow inevitably tame and
                  uninteresting.
               Mr. Pelham, the honored guest of the occasion, was not much of a talker; he
                  confined himself mostly to questions and monosyllables. He had been picking his
                  filberts and sipping his wine with quite an occupied air, when he suddenly looked
                  up, and, addressing the gentleman seated opposite to him, Lieutenant-General Lake,
                  said, "I hear, General, that you and one of your aids have been scouring the
                  country."
               "Yes, we have had a very pleasant run," was the answer; "haven't we, Trenchard?"
                  turning to the major, who was near.
               "Yes, yes, very," answered the major, so much occupied at this moment with
                  Florence, he hardly knew the question asked.
               "And what did you see?" was the gentleman's next inquiry.
               "Well, not much," was the rather tardy reply; "everything appeared quiet." The
                  general was evidently annoyed at these repeated questions.
               "Ah, just like them!" were Mr. Pelham's half-sneering words; "just like them! the
                  rebel dogs, skulking in their holes and coverts, ready to give the back-handed
                  blow when they dare. No,"—and now he spoke with a force in strong contrast with
                  his former drawling, half-sleepy words,—"no, by everything I love, I never yet
                  knew an Irishman who could face a manly foe!"
               Here was a firebrand thrown in our midst; I was in a perfect flame of indignation.
                  I looked at Florence; her eyes glittered with suppressed emotion, and Lady Betty,
                  with a low growl, was striving to keep her words down. Sir Robert looked dark as
                  night. This was a wanton insult; but as host, and in consideration of his other
                  guests, he refrained from answering.
               
               I dared not look at Arthur. How could he keep so quiet? How could he refrain from
                  striking this insolent man to the earth? But he was at his father's table, and if
                  Sir Robert did not choose to resent, it was unbecoming his son to do so, and Adele
                  was making every effort to distract his attention.
               There was quite an embarrassing pause after Mr. Pelham had ceased speaking. Mr.
                  Curran had not yet made any sign. Indeed, I will confess, after all I had heard, I
                  was much disappointed in him. Plain of feature, and small in stature, there were
                  apparently few of the marks of that giant intellect I had heard so much about. He
                  looked dull and dispirited all through the dinner-hour, saying little, and
                  scarcely answering Lady Betty, who sat next him, when she spoke. But I heard
                  afterwards that he was unusually exhausted on that particular evening, having been
                  in court all day, pleading with all his energies, as only he could plead, for the
                  life of one whom his eloquence had failed to save.
               But now a change came. The fire of life was in his eye and every motion. His
                  breast heaved, the great head, before drooping, now towered upward, and the whole
                  person assumed, to my eyes, larger proportions, as he said in a low, but distinct
                  voice, heard by every one present, "If these, Mr. Pelham, are the views of your
                  countrymen, of my countrymen, and of the court you have so lately left, we need
                  not wonder at much we see around us; but," he continued, in the same tone, "may I
                  ask the honorable gentleman how many Irishmen he has the honor of knowing?"
               "Not many, thank Heaven!" was the rude reply.
               I was so provoked now I could not help speaking to my neighbor in indignation.
               "Oh, this is nothing," he said, with a smile.
               "It is something," I answered, "when you hear such sentiments, or their
                  equivalent, echoed by strangers who know so little of us, judging alone by their
                  prejudices, and then assuming a superiority which gives them the right to condemn;
                  it is contemptible, it is unjust," I repeated, scarcely able to restrain the tears
                  of vexation that would come unbidden.
               "But you must not include me," whispered my companion, "in these angry
                  denunciations. I have learned to appreciate and admire much, very much, in your
                  country." This he said with a softened voice, which made me momentarily ashamed of
                  my absurd impetuosity.
               Mr. Curran was, however, still pursuing his questionings. "And may I ask, Mr.
                  Pelham, if not from personal knowledge, from what other source did you derive this
                  information as to our national characteristics?"
               The gentleman looked much puzzled. Mr. Curran was so calm, and yet spoke with such
                  an intensity of purpose, there could be no evasion; he must answer. He said, with
                  as much calmness as he could assume, "Oh, I have read much, and heard a great deal
                  more."
               "But was this reading and hearing from interested or disinterested parties, may I
                  again ask?"
               "Zounds, sir!—beg pardon, ladies,"—looking along the table, "but I would have this
                  gentleman know I am not in a court of justice under cross-examination!"
               "No, sir," was the answer, with heightened voice and increased severity. "No, sir;
                  but you have made a public accusation
                  reflecting on the honor and manliness of my countrymen, and you are bound either
                  to substantiate or withdraw it."
               The matter began to look serious and smell somewhat of powder. There were oh's and
                  ah's and smothered exclamations of excitement.
               I fear the sympathies of most were with the stranger. There is so much of toadyism
                  about. He was the lion of the feast, though not a very agreeable one, it must be
                  confessed; but then he was a celebrated person, known to hold confidential
                  relations with that weak, half-imbecile old monarch, George the Third, who hated
                  as much as he dreaded his Irish subjects. This position, of course, gave him great
                  importance; the odor of royalty still lingered round him, and he might be forgiven
                  some presumption under such circumstances.
               Lord Castlereagh was about to speak, when his wife, the Lady Emily, always timid
                  and frail, laid her hand entreatingly on his arm; "Do not, my lord, do not
                  interfere in this foolish quarrel!" But his lordship persisted, saying that, as a
                  native Irishman, he might be allowed to speak, and might be supposed to hold the
                  honor of his country as dear as any; and he had listened to the remarks of his
                  right honorable friend, but had not attached any importance to them, considering
                  them simply as mere passing words.
               "Ah, my lord!" was the answering response of bitter irony, "you have chosen the
                  better way,—you pour the oil of peace on the festering sore, while I irritate it
                  to keener anguish; but, my lord, you may not know, as the ear can be attuned to
                  acute sensibility, so that a false note, be it ever so indistinct, will thrill its
                  every nerve with pain, so the emotions, in their severe training, may become so
                  acutely susceptible that even the very atmosphere they breathe, full of discordant
                  elements, will rouse them to a maddening frenzy; but, my lord, I may remember your
                  lordship has never been put through such hard schooling, therefore it cannot be
                  supposed you will understand these things as readily as those who have."
               There was now a most uncomfortable silence, only interrupted by an occasional
                  drumming of Lady Betty's fingers on the table, who seemingly must do something to
                  allay her excitement. Lady Grace had been throwing indignant glances at her
                  much-abhorred guest, and, indeed, many others had followed her example. They did
                  not stop to consider the merits of the case; they only felt they were disturbed,
                  that their hostess was annoyed, and so they looked on with contempt; but Mr.
                  Curran did not heed all this. Was he thinking of that day's work of his, when,
                  with heart and soul and every energy he possessed, he had been striving to save
                  the life of a fellow-being, an honorable, just, high-minded man, but without
                  avail? He must suffer, condemned by laws both cruel and unjust,—laws made for the
                  occasion, and pushed through by some among these courteous, elegant gentlemen,
                  among whom the one to whom he had been last speaking was one of the chief. Was it
                  all this that had so embittered his thoughts? Was he going through that hard
                  schooling of which he had been speaking, which made the very air he was breathing
                  with them a furnace which was heating his blood to a maddening fury?
               Ah, how I wished I was like the young people I saw there! How many of them knew little and cared less
                  about all that was going on about them! I almost envied their indifference. How
                  lightly and airily and unbiased they could enjoy, could wonder, and raise their
                  eyebrows in pretty alarm!—"A slight unpleasantness, easy to forgive." "Dear Lady
                  Grace, never mind, we do not care for this little discourtesy." But
                  withal, every one felt uncomfortable.
               Mr. Pelham, however, by this time seemed to become aware how discourteously he had
                  acted, considering by whom he was entertained, and, bowing to Sir Robert, hoped he
                  would be pardoned for anything unseemly he might have uttered. "But the fact is,
                  Sir Robert," he added, with still culpable thoughtlessness, "when I say Irishmen,
                  I do not include any I should expect to meet at your table; it is but the rabble I
                  mean."
               This rather dubious apology was not at all calculated to allay unpleasant
                  feelings. Sir Robert still frowned darkly, even while bowing acceptance of what
                  was said, and Lady Betty drummed more loudly than ever on the table as she
                  fidgeted uneasily in her chair, while Mr. Curran sprang to his feet as if unable
                  to control his passion, his face burning as a flame of concentrated indignation,
                  while he said, with that terrible force of his, "And is this, sir, your
                  explanation of the insulting words used to our host and to his countrymen
                  present?"
               Mr. Pelham's countenance fell, and he fairly quailed under the searching glance of
                  that eye that seemed to penetrate his very soul, as he answered, with an
                  assumption of coolness, "Well—yes—not exactly—no insult was intended."
               "Well, then," was the deliberate reply, "I understand stand your meaning is
                  precisely what mine would be should I say, 'I never saw an Englishman who was not
                  bombastic, filled with his own importance, a petty tyrant, an oppressor, a greedy
                  gatherer of other men's gains,' and should shelter myself by declaring 'it is only
                  the rabble I call Englishmen!'" This was said with a withering sneer, a scorn, a
                  glance of the eye that seemed to flame down upon his victim like a devouring fire.
                  "Am I right?" he added.
               For an instant there was a perfect hush, then Lady Grace arose, her eye glanced
                  lightning at her husband, and her voice was clear and sharp, as she said, "Ladies,
                  we will retire to the drawing-room. Gentlemen, it is my desire that you follow us
                  immediately—you, also, Arthur," glancing at her son. The dignity and self-command
                  of the hostess seemed to recall all present to their senses. All rose from their
                  seats, and in a few moments the room was cleared, only Sir Robert, Mr. Curran, and
                  myself remaining. Lady Betty, I know not why, followed with the crowd. I had
                  begged Captain Fortescue to leave me. As I looked at Mr. Curran his head was
                  drooping on his breast. He was indeed like a flame fairly burned out. "Can you
                  forgive me?" he said to Sir Robert, raising himself wearily up; "I have forgotten
                  myself, insulted your guests—fool that I was, to come with this inflammable temper
                  of mine, where I knew I should meet those with whom my whole life is at war. Can
                  you forgive me? to you I owe every apology."
               "Forgive you!" said Sir Robert, warmly grasping the hand held out to him, "forgive
                  you! Why, Curran, all that I feel is honor for you, and shame for myself, that I can sit by without finding a
                  word to resent these damnable affronts."
               "But you are held by motives," was the kind and soothing answer, "that I know
                  nothing about."
               "Yes, the trammels by which all weak minds are held, the dread of consequences,"
                  was the half-angry, despairing reply.
               "Not so, my friend, not altogether so. A nicely-balanced conscience that weighs
                  its duty everywhere, may force us to sacrifice the strongest desires of our heart.
                  You have the interests of a wife and children to remember, the honor of an ancient
                  name to transmit. I know your difficulties; forgive the part I have played to give
                  you trouble; I will never so err again, believe me;" and with another warm
                  pressure of the hand he was gone.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               OLD LADY BETTY.
               SIR ROBERT sat for some time in moody silence, with occasionally a sigh that
                  seemed absolutely bursting from his breast. At last he looked up, and started when
                  he saw my pitying eyes fixed on him. I feared he might be angry to find me
                  watching when he supposed he was alone, but instead of that he looked into my face
                  with kindly affection, as he said, "Yes, Olive, you know how it feels. It is hard,
                  but we must go on playing our part. Now, my girl, to the drawing-room. I will
                  remain behind a few minutes longer."
               When I reached that apartment I found evident consternation on every face. The
                  ladies and gentlemen were ranged on either side the long room, leaving a wide
                  space, which Lady Betty was traversing with slow, measured steps. She did, indeed,
                  look formidable. I had never before seen her with such an air of majesty. Her
                  black-velvet robe swept the floor, while the band of brilliants on the aged head
                  trembled with every violent pulsation of her heart. Many eyes looked on her with
                  timid terror; it might be her reason was really dethroned by excitement. Her
                  actions were denunciatory, but she seemed unable by words to express those
                  feelings. As she came near, I caught the low murmur, "And has it come to this?" As
                  I looked, she tottered,—she was ghastly white,—while a strange expression at the
                  moment passed over her face.
               Regardless of all eyes, thinking only of my kind old friend, I ran to her, dear
                  Lady Betty! I put my arm around her waist. I was tall and strong and could support
                  her. Many now rose in alarm to assist, but she motioned them away in such an
                  imperious style that none dare follow, as I drew her towards a small ante-room,
                  where, placing her on the sofa, I closed the door by her command.
               As I turned to her, she was still helpless and pale. I raised the pillow from the
                  sofa, and, placing it on the arm, laid the aged head gently upon it. My whole
                  heart went out to her in pity. What could I do for her. So solitary had been her
                  life, so peculiar in its antagonism, there were none to love, none to come near
                     her in tender solicitude in this her
                  old age. I could not blame any; she had been a strange mystery, an enigma, to
                  most.
               But I loved her; I thought I understood her, dear old lady! My tears fell fast as
                  I kissed the rigid lips, and chafed the cold thin hands. She seemed to sleep at
                  last, and her respiration became more soft, her face lost its rigidity, an
                  unusually gentle look suffused her features, and she lay like a child who, in the
                  intensity of its emotions, had sobbed itself to rest.
               Yes, with my full heart I pitied her, as I sat there in silence watching what
                  almost seemed to me her flitting breath. So few understood her; so broad had been
                  her ambition, so unproductive her life. Of the riches of human love she possessed
                  a large share, but so eccentric had been its course among the ruins and outposts
                  of humanity, so little had been available for the social and ordinary amenities of
                  life, that many supposed she neither knew nor cared for friendship; but I knew she
                  did. Her ambition had not been for self, or individual aggrandizement; it had been
                  for her people, her race. Neither had it been that they might become a powerful
                  nation, ready to hurl defiance, and absorb other nations as they had been
                  absorbed; but that they might be individually elevated, be all they might be. She
                  knew well they possessed the qualities which, under a right state of things, would
                  make them the equal of any; this was what she desired, only that they might be
                  truly themselves.
               Poor old lady! Her one idea became a ruling passion, too often unmanageable. With
                  her uncontrolled energies, her aptness for hasty conclusions, her imperative
                  perative temper, her best-intentioned efforts often fell powerless, and she was
                  disappointed and embittered; blaming others, when the fault was chiefly her own.
                  She had gone by the straight way, the right way, the honest way; why should she
                  fail? And why should others think to succeed by devious ways, by windings and
                  turnings and subtle diplomacy? Hers was eminently a direct nature, and she could
                  not conceive that others, without the basest of motives, should seek to attain
                  their ends by another policy. So she had little patience with Sir Robert, or with
                  those who bore the evils inflicted upon their country quietly, hoping for better
                  things.
               Presently she opened her eyes, and looked at me with a sort of surprise; then,
                  seeming to recollect herself, she said, "Ah, Olive; it is you, child! Yes; now I
                  remember. I will go, my dear, this moment. I must go home." And then she attempted
                  to rise, but her head fell feebly back.
               "Oh, Lady Betty, do not; you are not able!" I answered, in alarm. But I forgot the
                  old nature, that only gained strength by opposition.
               "But I must, I will go home! Olive, say not another word." And now she raised her
                  head and straightened herself on the sofa.
               "Go now, child, and call Millicent,"—Millicent was her ancient maid who had waited
                  on her from a girl,—"and mind you are to go down the back stairs; and tell her to
                  make no fuss, but have Hodge here with the carriage, at the private door, in ten
                  minutes; she can bring my wraps with her."
               I knew there was no use in my wasting any more entreaties, and so I at once attended to her
                  commands. She would hardly allow me to assist her, when all was ready, down the
                  few steps, but she kissed me affectionately when I wrapped the shawls around her
                  in the carriage. "Come to me to-morrow, dear," she said.
               I felt a painful sense of sadness as I said good-by. I should have liked to have
                  accompanied her home, but I knew it would not do to make such an offer; it would
                  have given offense to have implied any sense of weakness.
               I now went to my own room. I could not bear to go back among those who would be
                  making comments, and might ask unpleasant questions; and so, taking a book, I
                  waited for Florence to come when all were gone.
               In the morning, however, I was early at the lonely mansion of Lady Betty. The
                  morning was cloudy, with a heavy sea-mist, and the old place, with its
                  surroundings, looked drearier than ever. The large gate in the high wall was open.
                  That seemed strange, it was always so scrupulously closed after the ingress or
                  egress of any visitor, and it was so early; and the main entrance door of the
                  house too was open, but I did not see any one. I hurried through the hall, and up
                  the wide, dark stairway, to Lady Betty's room, and there I saw it all—the old lady
                  was seriously ill. Two physicians were present,—her own and a stranger. She lay
                  prostrate. Still, when I spoke to her, she knew me; at least smiled when I kissed
                  her hand and her forehead. How white she looked; how strangely near to death! She
                  had been attacked again in the night. Medical aid was at once summoned; she was
                  pronounced nounced to be laboring under a severe stroke of paralysis.
               Gradually, however, the dangerous symptoms abated, and she recovered; but not as
                  Lady Betty again. Dear old lady; the turmoil of life with her now was past! The
                  quick pulsations of all those restless nerves were stilled forever. All that had
                  been was henceforth to be to her as a dream; and a pleasant dream it must have
                  been, for she often smiled, and always looked serene and calm.
               But how sad to us who looked on! It seemed as though I could sob my heart away, as
                  I looked at her, day after day, in that helpless, half-childish contentment. Had
                  she been less strong, more yielding, more of a dependent nature through her life,
                  I could have borne it better. But to see her thus, to miss the sharp, decisive
                  tones, the spirited readiness for combat, was pathetic and pitiful beyond words,
                  and beyond words I sorrowed over and sympathized with Lady Betty.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               FESTIVE PREPARATIONS.
               FOR two weeks after the sudden illness of Lady Betty, I saw little of the inmates
                  of the Hall. I remained at the bedside of the invalid, doing what little was in my
                  power to soothe and ease her. There were messages to and fro, and visits of
                  condolence from Sir Robert and Lady Grace, Arthur and Adele, but it was, I
                  confess, a relief to me, for a time, to remain apart from my friends. But at
                  length, when the old lady had recovered sufficiently to sit up, attended by her
                  old servitors, there was no longer any necessity for my presence; and when
                  Florence rode over one morning, asking playfully, but sadly, if I had utterly
                  forsaken her, I no longer delayed my return to the Hall. Great festivities were
                  shortly to take place there, to celebrate Arthur's attainment of his majority. A
                  dinner was to be given to the tenantry; a grand ball was to signalize the evening,
                  on which occasion, also, Florence was to make her first entrance into the great,
                  fashionable world. It saddened me to leave my dear old friend, so strangely
                  stricken, so sadly changed. On my knees beside her, as I held her hand to my
                  heart, I tried to recall her recollection of me. But no; I was to her as though I
                  had never been. She stroked my head, and played with my long locks; but she called
                  me Mytha,—a name, doubtless, of some dear one long passed away.
               On my return home, I found everything in the bustle of preparation for the great
                  event; every one busy,—servants, housekeeper, upholsterers, decorators,—and all
                  under the superintendence of Adele; even Lady Grace was waiting her advice.
               "And," whispered Florence, as she drew me away to our own room, "we may as well
                  stay here; we are not needed. In fact, we are entirely superseded, and may as well
                  make the best of it. I shall not fret; mamma thinks nobody can do anything right
                  but Adele, and Adele is fully persuaded of that fact herself. And to do her
                  justice, Olive, she is wonderful; she thinks of everything, and never tires. Dear
                  mamma has such boundless faith in her that any little interference I have
                  attempted has only made trouble, so I intend gracefully to retire; and you and I
                  will have quite enough to do to fit ourselves out. Papa has given me carte-blanche as to dresses, so we must find our
                  modiste at once, to make us presentable for the grand occasion."
               "Make us!" I repeated, "Why surely, Florence, you do not think of
                  anything so preposterous as presenting Olive Lacey to the world as one on the same
                  footing with yourself?"
               "And why not?" said the generous girl. "Nature has settled that; you
                     are fitted for any station. Yes, Olive, you would stand as a queen
                  among hundreds. Has not the brilliant Captain Fortescue, spite of his sister,
                  discovered and proclaimed that fact?" she added, mischievously. "But, Olive, my
                  friend," she said, thoughtfully, her smile vanishing, and her voice taking that low, sweet tone which was its
                  peculiar charm, "there is no jest about this. You are my adopted sister, the one
                  who has, as papa says, sustained me in life, strength, and happiness. You must
                  still be my sister, whatever may come, and you will not, and cannot, thwart me in
                  this. If you do," she added, impetuously, "I will throw this thing up, and have
                  nothing to do with it."
               It is unnecessary to say that I yielded to Florence's wishes. Perhaps I hung back
                  a little, dissuaded her a little, and flattered myself that I displayed a little
                  philosophy in so doing. But what girl of eighteen can withstand the 
                     eclät
                     éclat
                   of dress and admiration, and all the thousand expectations and brilliant
                  promises of a first entrée into society?
               I was soon as deep in all the mysteries of fashion as Florence could desire.
               It seemed that this matter of my presentation had been fully discussed in family
                  conclave. Lady Grace had opposed it, but Florence and Sir Robert had been
                  persistent. Sir Robert's obstinacy had no doubt been intensified by some
                  thoughtless remark of Adele, that such a thing would not be allowed in good
                  society in England. Sir Robert hated such allusions.
               "Confound her impudence!" was his after-comment to his wife, "I will teach her
                  that in Ireland such upstart impertinence will not be tolerated. She is neither in
                  mind nor person to be compared with Olive. English good society forsooth!"
               But Lady Grace soon quieted her irate lord, excusing and palliating Adele's
                  offense as attributable solely to thoughtlessness and youthful high spirits.
               During this week of preparation we seldom left our own cozy little sitting-room;
                  our dresses were being made in the city, but we had a great deal else to do, and
                  were fully occupied. Occasionally in the morning a few callers would drop in, our
                  apartment being about only one in the house not subject to the invasion of
                  upholsterers. Sometimes Captain Fortescue came with Major Trenchard to spend an
                  hour or so, or we were enlivened by a call from our new neighbors, the Misses
                  Neville, accompanied by their shadow, the younger Mr. Fortescue. The Fortescue and
                  Neville families had been quite intimate in London, but Adele now saw fit to
                  "snub" them, as she did her young brother, without mercy; so they betook
                  themselves to Florence and myself for entertainment, invading our little boudoir
                  of a morning in a flutter of excitement about the ball—what they should wear, and
                  what they should do.
               These young ladies were about the average young ladies to be met with every
                  day,—occupied with themselves, full of the present with its enjoyments, and
                  troubling themselves little about the future, whether for good or ill,—which was
                  judicious, perhaps, for with their small amount of native character it would be
                  made or marred by the circumstances surrounding them.
               Now they chose to adopt the rôle of the martyr. "Papa would have them
                  remain in this horrid Ireland; it was always wet and always muddy, and they were
                  always drabbled and not fit to be seen!" they exclaimed, as they bustled into our
                  sweet little gem of a room, where Florence and I were plying our needles in quiet
                  comfort.
               Florence always received them good-humoredly; had she respected them more, perhaps she would have
                  resented their unconscious rudeness; as it was, she found their childish chat
                  amusing.
               "And why did you not have your carriage? even though the distance is short, it is
                  not worth while to expose one's self to such inconvenience," she said; "I shall be
                  most happy to send you home in my pony-phaeton."
               No, they would not allow that; they would be distressed, they would have colds,
                  even if it were for nothing but to spite papa; he was so mean and churlish about
                  the carriage!
               This species of martyrdom is rather enjoyable, be it known, to those who suffer
                  it, and to deprive them of their laurels would be a thankless task.
               "But," said Florence, "I have heard that your English winters are even more wet
                  than ours, and that your London fogs exceed anything we can get up."
               "Oh, dear!" said Miss Charlotte, "I suppose Major Trenchard has told you this.
                  Everything in Ireland looks bright to him now, I suppose."
               Florence blushed, but she appealed to the silent Mr. Fortescue to say if it were
                  not so.
               That young gentleman was considerably startled by the appeal. He was accustomed to
                  listen complacently to the rattling remarks of his lady friends, but as to drawing
                  any conclusions from what they said, that was entirely out of his range.
               "Well—ah—I declare!" he said, with his accomplished drawl, "I—ah—really hardly
                  heard what was said; but, ah—" and here he looked uneasily out of the window, but
                  the prospect could hardly assist his decision, for there was a fine misty rain
                  falling—"it's deuced hard to say," he added desperately, "but I am disposed to
                  think both young ladies may be right."
               This sententious conclusion, being an uncommonly exhausting effort for the young
                  gentleman, was accepted as satisfactory all around. The young visitors proceeded
                  without delay to set forth the special object of their call this morning.
               "Mamma wished to know if we could be supplied with flowers on the night of the
                  ball. We hear that your gardener has such abundance of rare ones. Papa will not
                  allow us new dresses, he is so stingy. He says we had so many in England—"
               "And such lovely ones they were, too!" chimed in the sister.
               "That it has broke him, and he says there is no squeezing any more money out of
                  these 'cursed' Irish estates." I thought of the ruin of my poor father, and my
                  heart rose with indignation.
               "Gentlemen will speak out, you know," added the speaker, archly. "Everything is
                  going to ruin by the improvidence of these miserable, lazy people—but excuse me,
                  Miss Greyton, I forgot; you see we have to suffer for all this."
               "Yes, I will excuse you," replied Florence, with much dignity, "because you do not
                  know of what you are talking; but remember, I am an Irish girl, and raised under
                  the same sky and on the same soil with that 'miserable' set, and I can say truly I
                  am proud of it."
               "Oh, dear!" said the thoughtless girl, momentarily touched, "I am ashamed of
                  myself; do forgive me!" And then she
                  rattled on in the same heedless manner, "Mamma says that with some fixing, and
                  plenty of fresh flowers, the dresses will do very well for—for—" She stopped
                  confused.
               "A ball in Ireland," added Florence, laughing.
               "Charlotte is such a blunderer," said the elder Miss Neville.
               "Never mind," said Florence, good-humoredly, "you shall have all the flowers you
                  want."
               On the last day before the entertainment, etiquette being somewhat suspended in
                  the general bustle, I hastened up-stairs immediately after dinner, expecting to be
                  joined by Florence, that we might together put the finishing touches to our toilet
                  preparations. Florence herself had proposed this hasty exit, but she lingered
                  unaccountably below, while I waited impatiently,—now smoothing out nervously a
                  shining ribbon, now trying the effect of a bit of lace. Around me in splendid
                  confusion lay spread our dresses, just sent from Dublin. Of course I was full of
                  excitement with anticipated pleasure; but Florence did not come.
               At length, however, I heard her step in the corridor, and she entered with a
                  flushed face and eye that indicated something was amiss. I asked no questions. She
                  sat silently awhile looking out of the window; at length she broke forth as if it
                  was impossible to restrain her feelings:
               "I was so angry, I could not help speaking, although mamma was
                  displeased. After you left the room, Olive, Captain Fortescue and the major
                  detained me a moment in the drawing-room; and, as they were rising to go, the
                  captain asked me if you would be present at the ball, and continued making some
                  complimentary remarks. I was uneasy, knowing that you were waiting, but the poor
                  fellow was so enthusiastic about you, Olive, that I had not the heart
                  to interrupt him. I suppose Adele began to think he was about making proposals for
                  your hand, for she suddenly stopped talking to Major Trenchard, and said, in her
                  confident but airy way, 'Now, captain, you shall not torment Miss Olive; I won't
                  have it; besides—'
               "'Besides what?' said the captain, turning sharply upon her, in a way that
                  startled me.
               "'She is engaged to one in her own station in life,' said his sister.
               "Of course, Olive, I knew that it was not so, and denied it with more vehemence
                  than necessary, I dare say."
               I had been expecting some such effect of Adele's espionage, so that I was not so
                  much surprised as Florence had been.
               "To whom does she say I am engaged?" I asked calmly.
               "To Walter, of course. But how can you take it so quietly, Olive? I feel as if I
                  must go to her and say all that is in my mind. I will not profess friendship for
                  one so false! Oh, if you had heard her, had seen the air with which she said, 'Why
                  is it so impossible—why blame her—is it not natural?' turning and appealing to
                  mamma: 'Should she not be attracted to her kind?'
               "Olive, I was vexed; I almost lost my temper. 'It is not so, she is
                  not engaged to any one,' I cried, 'it is cruelly wrong to say it!'
               
               "Then Arthur broke in with his sternest voice, and demanded if to my certain
                  knowledge what I asserted was true. I declare I felt as if I were being tried for
                  my life; and so after blundering yes, and no, and being utterly confused, I must
                  finish by bursting into tears. Mamma was angry; every one was angry. She said I
                  was a slave to my attachment to you. I wish papa had been there; he would have
                  taken my part, I know. Indeed, Captain Fortescue was the only one who showed any
                  kindness. Major Trenchard was deeply occupied turning over the leaves of a book—it
                  must have been an interesting volume! I really do believe he is afraid of Adele:
                  he chimes in with all she says, follows her about, and does her bidding as though
                  she was the arbiter of his fate. But, Olive, why don't you speak?"
               Agitation, and a feeling of disdain for the petty yet inextricable tangle in which
                  I found myself, had kept me silent while Florence poured forth her flood of
                  feeling. She was my friend, my sole, true, faithful friend. I looked
                  up to her, with glad and grateful eyes, as I said, "And how did it all end,
                  Florence?"
               "It ended thus," said Florence, smiling in the midst of her tears. "As I rose in
                  my excitement (with anything but dignity, I assure you) to beat a hasty retreat,
                  Captain Fortescue gave me his hand to lead me to the door, and pressed mine
                  reassuringly, saying he for one appreciated my spirited defense of an absent
                  friend! I somehow imagine that Adele was providentially sent here to teach me and
                  all my friends that I am not an angel."
               I had the key to all this in my own secret keeping, and gladly would I have laid
                  bare every thought to Florence, as she would freely have done to me, but I could
                  not yet. Her simple, direct nature knew no complications, but mine was full of
                  them. I could scarce myself analyze the various emotions that swayed my mind as I
                  thought of Adele's treachery, of Walter's anguish, of Arthur's stern bearing, his
                  haughty manners, which brooked no explanation. Pride at that moment had full sway
                  over me, and not even to my noble, ingenuous Florence could I freely humble myself
                  to tell all. I could only soothe and thank her, and in my heart of hearts love her
                  more dearly than ever.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               THE YOUNG HEIR.
               THE auspicious day at length arrived, ushered in by merry peals from the great
                  Hall tower, and an answering chime from the pretty parish church near by, whose
                  rector was a particular friend of the family.
               The heir of Greyton Hall had now reached full manhood, and was to add another
                  honorable link to the long chain of representatives who had upheld the dignity of
                  the ancient house.
               In the days gone by such an event would have been hailed by loud rejoicings,
                  universal feasting, frolic, and fun. But now a gloom was over the country,
                  distrust and suspicion were everywhere; even the immediate dependents of the household were not free from
                  it,—the very air was filled with rumors and plots; every stranger was looked upon
                  as an enemy, and every native as a bloodthirsty rebel; all the horrors of a
                  dreaded civil war hung as a pall over every thoughtful spirit.
               The Greyton family, though ever staunch supporters of British rule, had always
                  been regarded as steady friends of the people. Their representatives for many
                  generations had ranked with those of sound, upright principles, and the present
                  Sir Robert was looked upon as a worthy scion of the old stock. He was much loved
                  even by those opposed to his principles, from the generous urbanity of a manner
                  prompted by a natural kindliness of feeling.
               His tenantry worshiped him; he had always been a just and liberal landlord; few of
                  the farmers and peasants of the neighboring counties could boast of the
                  comfortable circumstances enjoyed by those on his estate. They knew this, and they
                  would have died rather than harm should come to him in any way; but they could not
                  protect him from others. His principles were known. He entertained largely the
                  British legions that were overrunning the country, and it was talked about widely
                  that the young heir had also identified himself with the leading powers, and would
                  soon lead to the altar a proud English girl, who had little love or care for them
                  or their interests.
               Thus, a gloomy atmosphere made itself perceptible. Of course the family knew
                  nothing of these wild reports and personal misgivings; but they were conscious of
                  the disordered state of the country, and felt that they must be prudent. It would
                  not do to open the park gates and let all enter, and the first thought of a
                  general jubilee was abandoned, and only a few of the leading tenantry with their
                  families were invited to the afternoon dinner, which, instead of being given, as
                  contemplated, under gayly-decorated tents, in the open air, was to come off
                  quietly in the servants' hall.
               Neither was there in the immediate domestic circle a much brighter prospect for
                  enjoyment. Here, too, distrust and doubt had insinuated their presence. It seemed
                  as if, with Adele, had crept into our midst a new and strange element. We had
                  hardly defined it yet. We, who had been so free, frank, and unthinking, were now
                  becoming watchful, cynical, sensitively alive to our own dignity, resentful about
                  trifles.
               "Oh, dear! what is the matter with me, Olive?" Florence would say; "I hardly know
                  myself. I am half provoked all the time, without knowing what for, and I am so
                  meanly suspicious! oh, I am ashamed. I may be too exacting; do you think so,
                  Olive?"
               Dear girl, although she hardly knew herself, I could easily perceive the source of
                  this painful disquiet. There was a sense of neglect, so fine and subtle that even
                  her keenest perception could not detect its reality, but it was, nevertheless,
                  most keenly felt. Major Trenchard was still her devoted suitor in form, but not
                  soul; his words were for her, but his eyes and thoughts were on Adele.
               Adele had so absorbed his services during all these preparations; had made it such
                  a point to need his constant attendance; had been so charming in her delighted
                  expressions of gratitude for his assistance, that, for the moment, his head was
                  turned with vanity. Florence had never
                  flattered him; had never raised him to the third heaven in this delightful
                  contemplation of himself. She had simply loved him. It remained for this lovely
                  and gifted Adele to discover his rare worth! How could he help bearing the charmer
                  in his thoughts?
               But I, silent and apart, yet deeply interested, sometimes fancied I discovered the
                  motive of all this by-play. Adele was bent on winning Arthur, and the major was,
                  unconsciously, made subservient to her purposes. To have the latter hovering in
                  her train, echoing her praises and watchful for her smile, rendered her the
                  service of luring others, and of making Arthur jealous. Even Lady Grace had fallen
                  under Adele's witchery. She had never been quite resigned to her daughter's
                  devoted attachment for me, and now this feeling was but ill concealed. It revealed
                  itself at times, in half-angry expressions to Florence, in cold and averted looks
                  to me. We were, indeed, a very uncomfortable household on this festive day.
               The banquet in the servants' hall passed off jovially, however. There was plenty
                  of good cheer, and when the guests were seated, Arthur and Florence, accompanied
                  by Sir Robert and Lady Grace, entered, and were received amid hearty cheers. "Long
                  life to the young master!" and "blessings on the young lady!" and hearty wishes
                  for the father and mother, greeted them on all sides. Looking on their beaming
                  faces, one almost forgot that Ireland was not the centre of social and political
                  happiness, but was torn by contending factions, full of unrest and dire
                  dissatisfaction. Arthur made a neat speech, acknowledging the pleasure it gave him
                  to hear their good wishes, and expressing a hope that he might always deserve
                  their highest esteem.
               The speech was received with much applause and exclamations of hearty good-will.
                  "Never fear, master, we know you!" and "God bless you and all yours!" cried many a
                  cheerful voice.
               Arthur never appeared better than when on this day he responded to the good wishes
                  of his people. His face flashed and excited, his manner suave and kindly, his eyes
                  kindled to warmth, made him look the fit representative of their interests; a
                  brother, who, by his height above them, was more capable of understanding their
                  necessities and desires, and who would be warmed, not injured, by popularity.
               In the evening, when all the rooms were thrown open and brilliantly lighted, the
                  effect was very imposing. The Hall was an ancient structure, massive, roomy,
                  covering a large extent of ground. It had, however, been so often repaired and
                  modernized by its prosperous owners, that its antiquity was not suggestive of any
                  decay or gloom, as is sometimes the case.
               The wide hall of entrance, lined on either side with flowering plants and rare
                  exotics, led to the ball-room, where, seated upon a raised platform at the farther
                  end, a band of musicians were filling the air with inspiring music. The large
                  apartments on either side were devoted to promenaders, or those wishing to employ
                  themselves in any other way, and means of enjoyment were plentifully at hand. The
                  walls were hung with paintings by celebrated masters; rare statuary gleamed here
                  and there in many a niche; antique vases, gems of curious workmanship, and
                  cabinets of costly, quaint, and curious
                  relics, portfolios of exquisite engravings, and everywhere the picturesque
                  architecture of the mansion itself, combined to cheer and delight the eye.
               In the large apartment, as you crossed the hall, were extended rows of tables on
                  either side of the room; these were for the card-players. For gambling was the
                  vice and the passion of the age, extending to all ranks, but most extensively
                  practiced by the higher ranks, among whom, even in private circles, fortunes were
                  squandered; the winner not scrupling to take from his nearest friend.
               In the course of the evening this room became the centre of attraction among those
                  past the age for dancing. Statesmen, judges, commoners, even dignitaries of the
                  Church, with their elderly wives, and sometimes their sons and daughters, might be
                  seen around these tables; and few or none cared to play without the risk of at
                  least some small stake.
               Sir Robert, Lady Grace, Florence, and myself were early down to receive and
                  welcome the guests as they came; and, as the room filled, and the varied colors of
                  the ladies' satins and brocades and costly silks glowed under the innumerable
                  wax-lights that from chandelier and gilded sconce sent down a flood of radiance,
                  while the rich window-draperies of scarlet and gold lent depth and effect to the
                  scene, it all seemed like some dazzling dream, some magic scene evoked by an
                  enchanter's wand, to vanish when the spell was broken.
               Never had I seen Florence quite so lovely as on this evening. Her animation, her
                  desire to please, brought out that beautiful play of expression which constituted
                  her chief attraction; tall and slight, her every movement ment was girlishly
                  graceful, and her manner, if somewhat timid, was natural and unconstrained. No
                  high society, no conventional etiquette, could frost over that native warmth and
                  ingenuousness of character which made Florence always gently and beautifully
                     herself—to be made and unmade at the bidding of no fashion or
                  social arbitration.
               Her dress, compared with the gorgeous toilettes of the evening, was exquisitely
                  simple. Sir Robert had presented us each with a set of pearls as a birthday gift,
                  and we wore no other ornaments. But Florence needed no adornment other than
                  beautiful hair of rarest tint, which, waving around her fair face and ivory
                  throat, fell over her shoulders and blended with the pale blue of her long gauzy
                  dress, adding to the ethereal beauty of her aspect.
               That night, that gay scene, that innocent girlish face, are indelibly stamped on
                  my mind by the strange circumstances which followed.
               Neither Adele nor Arthur had yet made their appearance. It was getting late, and
                  Sir Robert grew impatient, as these two were to lead in the dance which opened the
                  ball.
               At length, a momentary hush, and an involuntary falling back of the crowd about
                  the doors, announced an entrée, and Adele appeared upon the scene, magnificently
                  attired, and supported on either side by Arthur and Major Trenchard, while Captain
                  Fortescue, in full military splendor, followed in her train.
               A low bending of the jeweled head, a queenly sweep of the glimmering satin,
                  acknowledged the general murmur of suppressed admiration which greeted her entrance. She certainly deserved this
                  compliment, for her appearance was strikingly elegant. Her dress was in admirable
                  keeping; the short waist, the fully-exposed neck,—which was the fashion of the
                  time,—the bare arms, the long, sweeping train, with its rich folds clinging to the
                  person, showed to advantage the fine proportions of her full, commanding form.
                  Brilliants and emeralds, in compliment to the occasion (as she informed us),
                  adorned her fair bust and encased her snowy arms, and in her taper gloved fingers
                  a jewelled fan flitted coquettishly.
               Graciously the lady approached us, radiant, triumphant. Perhaps the recent buzz of
                  admiration had overcome her prudence, or she certainly would have had too much
                  good taste to excuse to Florence before so many the remissness of Major Trenchard
                  in coming so late, on the ground that he had promised several days ago to wait for
                  her (Adele).
               I saw that Florence was annoyed, though she laughed lightly, and taking Arthur's
                  arm led the way to the ball-room; Adele followed with Major Trenchard, and I with
                  Captain Fortescue. Arthur showed no sign of recognition. If our hands touched in
                  the mazes of the dance, no lingering, electric thrill awoke at their meeting.
                  Surrounded by this glamour of light and warmth and splendor, we two were far
                  apart, icily courteous, more distant than the separation of acknowledged enmity. I
                  was almost glad of this; for had Arthur shown any returning tenderness, I could
                  scarcely so well have sustained my part. The captain was devoted to my service,
                  and I flattered myself I received his profuse compliments with considerable
                  spirit. The desire to show myself perfectly indifferent and quite unembarrassed by
                  his attentions, inspired unwonted ease and freedom, and a quickness of repartee I
                  scarcely knew I possessed. When the set was through Florence was much fatigued,
                  and Arthur led her away from the crowd to a quiet seat in an oriel, but at once
                  returned and joined the promenaders, among whom were Adele and Major
                  Trenchard.
               I certainly thought that now, at least, the major would return to his liege lady;
                  but he did not. Adele for this evening seemed to hold both gentlemen fast in
                  chains. Her consummate skill was shown in the easy way in which she played one off
                  against the other, while each in turn felt himself the favored one.
               In the course of the promenade we came to where Florence was seated. Of course a
                  group of flutterers and flatterers surrounded her, but the one who should have
                  been at her side was recreant, and I who could read that ingenuous countenance so
                  well, saw, through all her efforts to be gay and indifferent, that her heart was
                  full of pain and mortification.
               Major Trenchard remained beside her a few moments in conversation, but it was
                  evident his thoughts were elsewhere, and as we passed on he excused himself and
                  joined Adele.
               Florence, however, betrayed no want of spirit; she mingled among the guests,
                  introducing those who needed introduction, and seeking out those who seemed to be
                  neglected, promoting the friendly feeling among her guests, and drawing about her
                  a charmed circle of happy faces wherever she went.
               My friend, the captain, in the course of our extended promenade exerted himself to be agreeable, and
                  there was something in his manner that was certainly pleasing; a frankness that
                  inspired like frankness; an apparent independence and sincerity of thought that
                  won confidence. As he chatted on gayly, interspersing his speech with many
                  compliments, and bending over me with eyes that said all flattering things, a
                  strange mood came upon me—strange, at least, for the time and place. I turned upon
                  him abruptly:
               "Captain Fortescue," said I, "do you know to whom you are speaking?"
               "Well, I think I do," he answered somewhat confusedly.
               "Would you address me thus did you know that I was a peasant's daughter?"
               I saw that he knew it; his face flushed, but he answered promptly, "Nature
                  sometimes ennobles by her own perfectness."
               "Yes, nature has done much for me, in giving me a good sound constitution, but
                  good friends have done more. Had I been reared in my father's cabin, I would, no
                  doubt, have been a stout, hearty maiden; but the crude material needed the
                  education, association, and happy circumstances in which I have been placed, to
                  make me what you say I am."
               "True; I understand," he said; "we have the diamond in the rough, but the precious
                  material must be polished to produce the brilliant."
               "Oh, you misunderstand me!" I exclaimed; "I am no diamond. I do not
                  presume to any innate worth. I only wanted to express my gratitude to those who
                  have done so much for me, and to show my consciousness sciousness of what I am. I
                  wish to appear no other than myself, for anything like deception my very soul
                  abhors."
               "Well," he said, laughing, "there I see the diamond gleam; but let us leave these
                  abstruse and sober themes. I accept you—pardon my plainness—as one of the most
                  splendid, nay, the most splendid woman in the room, and I do not care
                  to analyze how the thing came about."
               Glad to turn the conversation, I expressed a wish to look at the card-players for
                  a few minutes.
               We found the room thronged, each player eagerly absorbed as if his or her life
                  depended on the game. Every table was occupied. The groups around some were
                  silent, but most were laughing or chatting in a careless way. On the green covers
                  of the tables in the centre were piles of small silver coin, and, as these passed
                  from loser to winner, sometimes a hearty laugh attested a light heart and a heavy
                  purse; but as often the looker-on detected a dark frown, an eye that betrayed
                  disappointment and gloom.
               "Do you see that elderly dowager?" said my companion, pointing to a stout,
                  highly-rouged, overdressed old lady, busily engaged at one of the tables on the
                  opposite side of the room, "that is the Honorable Mrs. May. She is said to be one
                  of the most accomplished gamblers in Europe. She won all his estates from my lord
                  the young Earl of Chichester, and a compromise was made by his marrying the worthy
                  lady's daughter; such, at least, is the scandal. But here they come;" and a
                  beautiful woman, leaning on the arm of a small, delicate, and slightly-deformed young man, approached the table at
                  which the old lady was seated.
               "I think her beauty might have justified her aspiration, without any compulsory
                  motive," I said. "She strikes me as quite the superior of the two."
               "She is," said the captain; "but the world has another standard, you know, and
                  rank outweighs every other advantage."
               Leaving the captain shortly after supper, I joined Florence, who was looking
                  weary, surrounded by her busy, talkative, happy friends. Her face lighted up at my
                  approach, and we sat down together to look at the gay groups coming and going,
                  some making their adieux, and others arriving to take their places.
               Presently we were joined by Miss Charlotte Neville; and her whispered remarks as
                  each party passed in review, silly as they were, served to amuse us—and what else
                  should one seek in a ball-room than amusement?
               "Here comes my Lord Bishop of Dublin and his dowdy lady; that velvet hat has seen
                  at least a score of winters. If I were he I would conceal my yawns until I got
                  under cover of the old carriage. We can imagine the glorious nap he will have as
                  they rumble home. I hope my lady has provided pillows and shawls; she must be used
                  to it. Papa says the bishop's life is one long, luxurious nap, as well as her
                  ladyship's.
               "And here, close behind, is my Lord Castlereagh, courtly and conscious, and the
                  delicate Lady Emily; she looks, indeed, as though she would wilt, but for the
                  gracious attention of her lord.
               "And my lord lieutenant and his lady, in that perpetual stiff brocade, like a
                  bean-pole with a defunct vine clinging to it! If I were her friend, I—but here
                  comes Lieutenant-General Lake, with a swarm of military men in his wake: captains,
                  colonels, generals, every one of them, but General Lake is the star of them
                  all."
               I shook my head with vehement dissent, for the reports I had heard of this man's
                  tyranny in his command had given me an abhorrence for him.
               Two others came, equally distasteful to me: my Lord Clare, and my Lord
                  Northampton.
               "My papa says," observed Miss Charlotte, "they are the jolliest fellows in
                  Ireland, and would rather any day sentence an Irishman to a whipping than follow
                  the hounds. But excuse me, do; of course he only meant these rebels, you know;
                  they deserve everything that's bad."
               There was no use in being angry with this rattle-brained girl; she only repeated
                  what she heard, and there was too much truth in her idle words. But I looked upon
                  these men with horror, and turned from their smiles and gallantries with a feeling
                  of the most profound contempt.
               Adele and Major Trenchard now came up; the major was obliged to leave immediately.
                  Arthur was not with them; he was engaged with other departing guests.
               I saw there was some embarrassment in Major Trenchard's manner, but Florence
                  seemed perfectly indifferent, and dismissed him with smiles, as she did the
                  others. With Adele, too, she bore herself with the same polite nonchalance;
                  replying with smiles to the anxious
                  inquiries of the latter as to whether she had not over-exerted herself, and why
                  she looked so pale.
               Adele looked at the serene face of Florence, puzzled and baffled. She could have
                  better understood her haughty scorn, and might perhaps have gloried in such
                  treatment, but this style was beyond her comprehension.
               Fatigued certainly the delicate girl was, but she did her part to the last. None
                  were neglected or slighted, and light hearts and happy faces gave evidence of this
                  as the guests bade us adieu.
               Finally, the last of the throng departed, the festal lights were extinguished, the
                  affectionate good-night kiss given to father and mother, and the mansion was
                  silent.
               "Olive," whispered Florence, as we retired to our room, "will you hurry Linda
                  away?"
               The girl had been nodding by the fire, awaiting our coming. I told her we would
                  dispense with her services for that night, and she accepted with alacrity the
                  permission to retire.
               As the door closed upon her, Florence rose from the low seat where she had thrown
                  herself, and, twining her arms around my neck, rested her weary head upon my
                  shoulder, while the pent-up agony of hours burst forth in bitter sobs.
               Not a word was spoken by either. I knew the depth of her feelings, and the utter
                  mortification they had suffered this evening. Not only love, but pride had been
                  outraged. She knew that the news of her engagement to the major had been whispered
                  abroad, as well as among his brother-officers. She felt that curious eyes were
                  upon her, that gossiping tongues were ready to take up the tale. And to be
                  slighted before all; this was more than her young heart could endure.
               I had no consolation to give. Incensed for her sake, I could only press her closer
                  to my heart, while I endeavored to suppress the angry words that rose to my lips.
                  Had this befallen myself, I might have framed an excuse for the desertion, but to
                  one so unoffending it was more than cruel, it was inhuman. I knew that Adele did
                  not care for Major Trenchard,—no, not one jot,—but his homage pleased her, and the
                  stimulus of a mischievous triumph gave zest to all her efforts to bring him to her
                  side. And then it helped to further her purpose; for a deep-laid purpose she had.
                  I felt this instinctively; I knew it. But she had gone too far, and even her
                  far-sightedness could hardly have foreseen the consequences.
               Thus we sat, long and silently, close in each other's arms, until the poor girl,
                  utterly exhausted by her emotion, lay quiet in my embrace. A faint shiver came
                  over her, which increased till it seemed to shatter her very frame, as though she
                  had been stricken by a sudden death-blow. I laid her on the bed, and, covering her
                  up warmly, sat by her side until it passed off. A hot fever followed, which,
                  burning out briefly and intensely, left her towards morning apparently more
                  composed. But the sun was shining through every crevice of the closed windows ere
                  we at length fell asleep, so profoundly that neither awoke until after midday.
               I endeavored to dissuade Florence from rising when I did, but she insisted upon so
                  doing.
               "Olive," said she, "you are so tender of me. In thinking over my past life, I find I have only
                  lived to be petted and made much of. I have grown to be a mere spoiled child,
                  expecting everything, and giving nothing."
               "Don't say so, Florence," I answered, hastily. "Your life has imparted joy and
                  comfort to every one. You shine, you know," I said, smiling, "as the sun shines;
                  we do not put the sunlight to the plow." I spoke lightly, for I wanted to rouse
                  her from her sadness.
               She looked at me thoughtfully.
               "Well, I mean—I mean, I have only given that which it was no trouble to give. But
                  I have made some resolves—yes, resolves," and she smiled. "You know I am now Miss
                  Greyton,—properly recognized as such,—and I must prepare myself for the work I
                  have to do. The sunshine, you see, is very busy this morning." She pointed to the
                  window, through which the light was streaming, making bars of gold upon the carpet
                  and a splendid shining and shadow in the room.
               As I looked upon the pale young face—now so very pale—where, even with all the
                  effort at smiling banter, traces of anguish were written, I could not but think
                  that perhaps out of the struggle of that long, sad night, my friend had been born
                  into a new and more matured existence.
               The family were just seating themselves to the late breakfast when we joined
                  them.
               Florence had entreated me not to speak of her illness, but her paleness was
                  noticed immediately by Lady Grace. It could, however, be easily accounted for. Sir
                  Robert said pleasantly that his pretty Florence was not used to these hours of
                  dissipation, and there must not be many more of them. But all anxiety was disarmed
                  by his daughter's cheerfulness and sprightly manner. She chatted gayly of the
                  people and events of the previous evening, and even when Major Trenchard came in,
                  while we were still seated, she continued entirely unembarrassed.
               I think he was touched by her paleness and the evidences of suffering in her face,
                  for he spoke to her with unwonted tenderness. But although she replied as though
                  she appreciated his kindness, I saw by the distance of her manner and its quiet
                  dignity, that her determination was to allow him no more nearness of approach than
                  she would have accorded the most ordinary friend.
               He came with invitations to attend a grand review of the regiments of the south
                  and southwest, to be held in Phoenix Park, Dublin, on the following day; after
                  which we were expected to attend the levee of the lord and lady of the castle. A
                  series of gayeties seemed crowding upon us, and if a shadow hung over them, a
                  deeper meaning freighted them than ordinary frivolities, these things were not
                  perceptible to the common eye.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               GAY SCENES IN DUBLIN.
               THE world of fashion, meteor-like, moved on its brilliant course self-absorbed,
                  all unmindful of the great pulsating popular heart that stood aloof looking on in
                  mute dissatisfied wonder. There were the innumerable private entertainments; the
                  grand public festivities, gala-days, bright shows, gayeties, and rejoicings
                  occurring in quick succession. And if a thought or whisper did reach the general
                  ear of lost hopes, despairing struggles, individual wrongs, they seemed so
                  distant, so very vague, that amid the buzz and whirl they were lost and altogether
                  forgotten.
               On this morning of the much-talked-of grand review that was to come off in Phoenix
                  Park at midday, the large open barouche, with its four spirited grays,
                  postillions, footmen and coachman in the rich Greyton livery of brown and gold,
                  stood ready on the broad graveled walk in front of the wide portico, to receive
                  the ladies of the Hall. Arthur and his father were to follow on horseback.
               The day was bright indeed; the clear sharp air of early March was cool and
                  invigorating; a clear sky shone over the wide expanse of rolling country, bounded
                  by the distant hills, just budding into verdure. It was truly an inspiring scene,
                  fresh and beautiful to the eye.
               Florence was still in her velvet and swan's-down.
               "Papa would have it so," she said; "and I did so want to put on my new purple
                  pelisse. He will always think I must take cold."
               "My dear," said Lady Grace, "this fault-finding is not becoming."
               "Fault-finding, mamma! I did not think of such a thing."
               But I never saw Florence look more lovely, even with the despised swan's-down,
                  than this morning. The white soft fur in contrast with the delicate bloom of the
                  young cheek, the sweet pure eyes with that peculiar expression, that indescribable
                  revelation of soul-depth in them, with the fascination of grace and motion which
                  distinguished her, formed as lovely a picture as ever the eye rested on.
               And Adele, sitting opposite, was all brilliance; dress was becoming to her, and
                  she knew how to use it. But she was ill at ease this morning. Even the lively talk
                  of Arthur, who rode up to say his adieux before starting, could not take her
                  attention from Florence. I saw her furtive gaze, and, practiced as she was in the
                  art of concealing her feelings, she could not altogether avoid showing something
                  of that which was passing in her mind. She could understand the blanched face of
                  yesterday, but not the tranquil, assured expression of today. She had looked upon
                  Florence as the spoiled child of impulse, whose every emotion was mirrored on the
                  innocent face, who could weep when disappointed, and laugh again when pleased. She
                  had not given her credit for the deep, strong feelings of her nature. Perhaps this
                  might be some excuse for her heartless
                  tampering with this young creature's most inward emotions. Adele would have been
                  prepared to meet the hardly-concealed expressions of mortified vanity, or perhaps
                  the flippant impertinences she could have indulged in herself, and could have
                  assumed the role of the martyr with great effect; but for this sudden transition
                  into tranquil, assured womanhood, she was not at all ready, and for the first time
                  in her life her easy self-confidence deserted her, and she almost quailed before
                  the serene face and clear eye of the young girl before her.
               But why dwell on Adele? Was it that a slight tinge of jealousy had so colored my
                  perceptions that I could see nothing right in her? I had often asked myself this
                  question. Others liked her; all who came in contact with her were charmed and
                  fascinated. Lady Grace was her slave; even Sir Robert was pleased by her
                  intelligence and constant effort to please. "Why need she trouble herself about an
                  old fellow like me?" he had said. But Florence and myself saw all this in a
                  different light. And might it not be that I was reading Adele's character untruly,
                  by the light of my own antipathies? I had so long retained those vindictive
                  feelings she had awakened in me in those early days, that in later times they
                  might have unjustly tinctured my judgment. I tried hard to set aside my
                  prejudices, to be just, but alas! that scene of years ago had branded itself on my
                  memory. This was the same Adele who had sneered at my poverty, spoken to me so
                  cruelly and cynically,—the same Adele, though clothed now in all the fascinations
                  of a charming and worldly woman.
               But I was sick and heart-sore this morning, notwithstanding standing the
                  brightness of earth and air. And Arthur's animated chat, as he lingered beside
                  Adele, called to my mind painfully the days when he was full of warmest interest
                  for his sister and her humble companion. Yet I could not but acknowledge that
                  Adele seemed well fitted to be his mate, and to uphold the dignity of the ancient
                  house. And Lady Grace sat in her corner quietly looking on, bearing in her aspect
                  the stamp of the lady of quality. Age had added much to the dignity of her
                  appearance; her tall and rather angular form had become rounded and full; her
                  smooth, full brow was unwrinkled by care, and her calm, untroubled eye betokened
                  one at ease and peace with the world. She was richly and appropriately arrayed,
                  she bore herself as one accustomed to recognition of her rank and station, and she
                  smiled benignly on Adele and Arthur as they conversed together.
               Yes, Lady Grace was content. Perhaps not one among the young hearts about her was
                  so free from care, so happily exempt from petty annoyances, as her ladyship. She
                  was not troubled with over-sensitiveness; she was thoroughly self-satisfied. Duty
                  had been her watchword, and in retrospect it gave her pleasure to think of her
                  long, prosperous life, in which she had certainly fulfilled that duty with
                  scrupulous exactness. To be sure, there was little of the glow of love, or
                  enthusiastic devotion, to reward her painstaking efforts, but she did not miss
                  these; the world—that world so prized by her—acknowledged her worth, and honored
                  her as one of its models. Her husband was easy and affectionate, never interfering
                  with her plans; her children were dutiful and tender, and certainly any mother might be excused a little pride and
                  exultation whose children were growing up as graceful and gracious as her
                  ladyship's. I do not say that Lady Grace was exalted on this account, but if she
                  had been it would have been excusable.
               Why should not Lady Grace be contented? There was no drain on her sensibilities;
                  her sympathies were limited; few made demands upon them, knowing by unerring
                  instinct that she had little sympathy to bestow. The sorrows she could not
                  assuage, the miseries she could not lighten, gave her no disquiet. The inner life
                  of those about her was a sealed book to Lady Grace; she could decipher the
                  title-page, the bold outline of the living "books" surrounding her, but further
                  than that she could not penetrate—they were written in a dead language for her.
                  Yet it must not be supposed that she was without feeling or sentiment, far from
                  it. Her conversation was graceful and dignified, displaying much acquaintance with
                  books as well as the world. Poetry for her had great charms, her ear was attuned
                  to its finest cadences. Her tastes were perfect; her appreciation of art
                  exquisite; but her understanding of all these was of the head rather than the
                  heart, and therefore lacked warmth and full proportion.
               But we must be off. Sir Robert rode up impatient at our delay. Arthur reined back;
                  and then through the park road, shortening our way a little, we drove on.
               With the fleetness of the wind our mettlesome steeds carried us over the twelve
                  miles that lay between us and the capital, so that we arrived at the park before
                  his excellency, with his generals and their brilliant staffs, appeared on the
                  ground.
               Occupying the immense area of the noble park devoted to such purposes, were drawn
                  in line a vast body of soldiery, ready to receive, with due honors, their
                  commanding officers. An imposing appearance they certainly presented, and one of
                  enlivening interest, as they stood firm as statues, their polished arms upraised
                  to the dazzling sun, and their scarlet coats flashing in its bright rays. Around
                  this open space, even out to the park railings, were ranged the elegant equipages
                  of the wealthy and fashionable, freighted with their merry groups of expectant
                  sight-seers.
               We had full time to look around, recognize some, and take in the extent of this
                  great gathering, before the report of cannon coming in quick succession announced
                  the approach of the heroes of the day. On they came with streaming banners and
                  fluttering plumes, a gallant array; riding briskly forward, they made the sweep of
                  the great circle, and turning sharply faced the long line before them.
               The commander-in-chief, General Lake, now drew rein in front of his excellency,
                  and, with courteous military salute, transferred the command for the hour to an
                  honored guest. Then all were in motion again; with his excellency at the head,
                  they dashed along the entire length of the line, receiving the military salute
                  from each officer in position as they passed, making a glitter of swords that was
                  almost blinding. Then burst forth the strains of martial music; triumphant,
                  inspiring, full of human passion, full of human exultation. I almost forgot that
                  these were men with bloody purpose in their hearts; men who only waited the
                  behests of those epauletted and plumed officers to make havoc and ruin of all the fair scene about them. So
                  lifted up does the imagination become under such circumstances! And when a halt
                  was ordered, and the reviewing officers again stood still, as each regiment now in
                  motion passed, dipping their colors, and marching from the ground with full bands
                  of music at their head, each playing some soul-stirring national air, I was, like
                  the rest, carried away by my enthusiasm; and responded in my heart to the loud
                  burst of applause that followed them.
               It was truly an imposing sight; and the stir, the hum, the buzz of many voices,
                  the elation of spirits as the grand review closed and friends came crowding up to
                  pay their respects, attested that enjoyment and exhilaration are by no means
                  matters of pure reason, and that every bodily sense can be charmed and cheered,
                  while the mind remains aloof, silent, irresponsive.
               As I said, Florence was looking lovely this morning; the bracing air had kindled a
                  rich color in her cheek, while the play of her beautiful features, as she naively
                  expressed the enjoyment she felt, drew suppressed expressions of admiration from
                  many.
               Major Trenchard, too, was among the enamored gazers; but a sort of inward
                  consciousness, apparently, made him slow of approach. He had left the
                  staff-officers, when off the field, and taken a horse his servant held in waiting;
                  and now as one who beholds a vision, he sat in the saddle, his hand absently
                  caressing the neck of his impatient steed, but he came no nearer.
               Looking at the major as he sat thus, apart, yet one of the gay crowd, it seemed to
                  me that I could see the film falling from his eyes, and that Florence again
                  appeared to them the beautiful, the pure embodiment of sweetest maidenhood that
                  she had been on that day when she so suddenly came upon his dazzled vision in the
                  lovely Glen of Downs.
               Lady Grace also looked and listened with astonishment as she saw and heard her
                  usually retiring daughter receive and converse so animatedly with all that came.
                  She knew not the secret of that touch of bitterness that had entered the young
                  soul, rousing to action forces hitherto slumbering. To us all she had been the
                  sweet child, caressed and cared for; to-day she was the woman, commanding
                  deference as well as love.
               Major Trenchard saw this, or more probably felt it, though he scarcely
                  comprehended its meaning. When at length he drew up to the carriage, Florence
                  treated him with the same cordiality of manner that she did others, but nothing
                  more. I ventured to look at him, and saw his face flush and his lips compress as
                  he turned away and rode off.
               He returned, however, before we left the ground, and rode home with us; but
                  keeping on Adele's side of the carriage. That young lady seemed restored by his
                  presence to something of her ordinary gayety,—for all the morning she had sat in
                  haughty, gloomy silence, as though deeply offended from we knew not what cause.
                  But if the triumph of Florence was unquestionable this morning, it was still
                  greater on the following day when we attended the levee or drawing-room at the
                  castle, for there even her fair compeers joined in the universal tribute of
                  admiration; her sweet unassuming manner inspiring neither envy nor ill-will—the
                  palm of beauty being naturally accorded
                  her, as one would accord it to a rare combination of tint and odor and exquisite
                  finish in a flower.
               She ought not to have encountered the fatigue of this second day's excitement in
                  her delicate state of health. Wiser heads than mine would have willed it so; but,
                  her spirit rose superior to her physical weakness, and she would not be
                  thwarted.
               "Only this once, Olive, only this once," she said, playfully; and so we went.
               The city of Dublin was at this time at the very zenith of its splendor, a very
                  London in miniature,—fine streets, noble buildings, open squares and parks, and
                  well-filled shops, displaying the richest goods. Statesmen and nobles, with a
                  wealthy class of citizens, had their residences there; the public buildings were
                  unrivaled for beauty of style and architecture; and, on this particular day, when
                  all the devotees of fashion were assembling to pay their respects to the
                  representatives of royalty, the streets presented a more than usually animated
                  appearance.
               The broad sweep of Sackville street, the great avenue of princely residences, was
                  literally alive with the mass of rolling vehicles. Young exquisites, with whip in
                  hand, were driving on their curricles; chariot, landau, and open barouche, crowded
                  together,—for the fashion of vehicles, in that day, was varied to suit every
                  fancy. Then there were the orderly close carriages designed to screen the full
                  dress of the ladies from general view, side by side with the gay equipages whose
                  owners did not care how many looked at them. A motley assemblage,—gay, eager,
                  brilliant,—converging toward the same point.
               Arriving at the narrow street in front of the castle, we found many there before
                  us. A double line of carriages blocked the way, and we had to wait our turn with
                  what patience we might. At length it came, and we drew up to alight. The entrance
                  to the castle struck me as rather low; but the broad stairways and halls were
                  spacious and imposing, and the state apartments magnificent. They were softly
                  illumined by the afternoon sun, in whose mellow light the brilliance of the
                  court-dresses showed to full advantage.
               The gentlemen, in their many-colored, narrow-tailed, velvet coats, covered with
                  embroidery, their small-clothes fastened at the ankle with the brightest of
                  ribbons, their gold and silver buckled high-heeled shoes, their powdered heads,
                  small swords and lace ruffles, vied in the fantastic gayety of their costumes with
                  the highly-rouged dames they gallantly escorted.
               When our party were presented,—the eldest first, and Florence and I together,—I
                  wondered to find myself so entirely free from embarrassment. The crowd surrounding
                  the sacred precincts of the raised dais, I was well aware, had all their batteries
                  of eye and eye-glass ranged upon us, but I did not shrink. Had I known Arthur was
                  among them, perhaps I might have been less composed.
               Many pleasant things were said to us by their excellencies, and we could hear the
                  whispered words of compliment: "Twin sisters, so unlike, yet so like in perfection
                  of style and beauty;" "What grace; what dignity of bearing," etc. When we drew
                  back among the crowd, we found ourselves still pursued by compliments pliments; many, even among the young
                  ladies, sought an introduction.
               "Bless your pretty faces!" said a kind old dowager. "But you must keep out of the
                  wear and tear of such places as this, if you wish to preserve your bright bloom.
                  It fades, my dears, it fades!" And her own well-rouged cheeks attested that she
                  probably spoke from experience.
               Captain Fortescue and Major Trenchard now came up, and extricated us from the
                  crowd that hemmed us in, leading us to a small anteroom, where we could obtain
                  seats. I was very weary, and, leaning back in the high-cushioned chair, too tired
                  to speak, watched the actors and the scene about me in musing mood.
               Adele was standing outside the door; I had her in full view. She was conversing
                  with a gentleman, who eagerly described something he held in his hand. I said she
                  was conversing; rather, perhaps, should I have chosen another word for the
                  occasional reply that seemed to urge on her companion, as she scrutinized his
                  countenance, bending her eyes upon his, and scanning even his dress and person as
                  they talked. Adele was a sharp observer, but her penetration seldom extended
                  deeply beneath the surface of things. No keen sympathies, no subtle emotion,
                  suggested to her depths beneath outward ken.
               There was no Spring in this young girl, either mental or physical; there had been
                  in her nature no greenness and fragrance of opening and tender bud and bloom.
                  Sentiment or passion were unknown to her. Self-possessed, observant, she could lay
                  her plans wisely, watch their progress coolly, but, should they fail, she could
                  bear the disappointment with philosophic imperturbability.
               She was young, but a few years older than I was, yet she never seemed a fitting
                  companion for either Florence or myself; beside her worldly wisdom, her knowledge
                  of matters and things, we felt ourselves still mere children. And Adele was very
                  wise in her way. The world was her study; in it she was determined to succeed. If
                  her penetration was baffled by its deepest mysteries, its topmost strata was all
                  before her, mapped out as clearly as though she had a hundred eyes. She was,
                  therefore, perfectly consistent; setting her brain with vigor to the attainment of
                  her purposes by means that she understood most thoroughly, and aspiring no
                  higher.
               Captain Fortescue was presently called away, and Arthur came to take his place. He
                  offered me his arm, and we made our way through the throng. A gay woof and warp of
                  many voices, of passing compliment and witty rejoinder, of greeting, parting,
                  laughing salutation, and gathering up of costly robes, that rustled under
                  foot—through this musical din, I caught the low, whispered words of my companion:
                  "Olive, I can scarcely believe, as I look in your clear eyes and open face, that
                  deceit lurks there. It is hard—"
               "And do not believe it!" I said, almost piteously. "Oh, do not think this of
                  me!"
               At this moment Lady Grace approached.
               "Arthur," said she, in a chiding tone, "how is this? Adele and I have been waiting
                  for you."
               Then Captain Fortescue appeared, and claimed his place by my side. The opportunity
                  was gone which had seemed just swept
                  within my grasp; the wave which had brought it, carried it waif-like away. Perhaps
                  never again would occur the fortuitous moment in which I might hope to clear
                  myself in Arthur's eyes.
               It was almost dark as we approached the Hall. Arthur, who, with other gentlemen,
                  was riding in advance, caught sight of a small boy loitering in the grounds, and
                  asked him what he wanted.
               "I have something for Miss Olive," said the lad; "but I am to put it in her own
                  hand."
               "Well, there she is, just coming up. Give it to me; I will hand it to her before
                  your eyes, my boy. Will not that answer?"
               I saw him take the note and look at the superscription. He knew the handwriting,
                  apparently; even in the dusk I could see his face darken as he approached.
               "Here is a note from Walter," he said, curtly; and I could have cried in the
                  bitterness of my heart.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               FLORENCE.
               BUT all thought of self was soon lost in anxiety for Florence. The severe tension
                  of nerve which she had undergone, in her determination to carry out her part
                  during the last two days, had been too much for her delicate frame; weakness and
                  utter prostration followed, and she was very ill. Still she entreated me not to
                  alarm any one in regard to her.
               "It was my own obstinacy, Olive; I would go. Now, with rest and quiet, I shall be
                  quite well again in a day or two. You must stay by me, and if mamma comes, tell
                  her I am terribly fatigued—and—and—" she shuddered—"do not let Adele come near
                  me."
               Of course it excited no surprise that Florence did not appear the next day. "I
                  thought she was doing too much," said Sir Robert. "She must rest now from all this
                  excitement."
               Alas! he did not know the secret excitement, from which no rest, no soothing
                  anodyne, could ever restore his beautiful child. And even when Lady Grace visited
                  the darkened room, and saw the delicate girl apparently asleep, at least very
                  quiet, and with eyelids closed, she felt no apprehension that anything was amiss.
                  How blind we all were! how sadly ignorant of what this peace and silence
                  foretokened!
               The following day Florence was much better,—able to sit up. Her father sent to ask if she was able
                  to see him for a few minutes, and presently presented himself, bluff, hearty, and
                  sympathetic, at her door.
               He was evidently a little startled at her attitude of feebleness; but she greeted
                  him with a smile so bright that he forgot his fears.
               "But we must have Dr. Fitzley here, my darling. I see that you are not rid of that
                  cough yet."
               "No, papa, it is only a little additional cold—and all my own fault—going out in
                  fall dress, bare neck and short sleeves. I do not need the doctor."
               "Confound these balls and dresses," said the irate Sir Robert. "But, Florence
                  darling, I have something to say to you about—about business, or something that
                  concerns you, concerns us all—your happiness. Shall I speak now, or will it weary
                  you too much? I can wait."
               "No, indeed, papa, it will do me good to hear whatever it is you have to say," was
                  her answer, cheerily.
               "You recollect, Florence, that some months ago, when Major Trenchard asked your
                  hand, I objected to a final engagement, on account of your youth, and because you
                  had not yet appeared in society."
               "I remember, papa."
               "Well, my darling, he has now come forward handsomely, and renewed his proposals.
                  Handsomely, I say, because that which was before a possibility has now become a
                  certainty. His uncle having died childless, Major Trenchard is now Earl Jocelyn,
                  and hastens to lay his honors at your feet. You know how it would please your
                  mother to see you the wife of an English nobleman; but that is neither here nor
                  there,—that is as you please. My girl may make her choice, and it is
                     she will honor the one whom she selects."
               "Thank you for that, papa."
               "But I have forgotten one thing which I know will gratify you. He wishes me to
                  assure you that as soon as honor will permit, he will retire from the army, so
                  that you will not have the unpleasant thought that the one nearest to you is in
                  arms against your own people, and the country you love. That is gallant, Florence,
                  more almost than I should expect of a soldierly fellow like Trenchard. Now, what
                  shall I say to him, my daughter?—but of course you want time, there is no
                  hurry."
               "No, papa, I do not want time;" yet still she hesitated, and a look of deep
                  distress clouded her sweet face. At length she said, laying her hand caressingly
                  on his: "Papa, I have ever spoken to you frankly every thought of my heart."
               "You have, my dear."
               "But now, papa, I am a little afraid to speak."
               "Afraid! that is a strange word! Why afraid?"
               "Because I cannot meet your wishes,—I cannot marry Major Trenchard."
               "Bless me, child, you can't mean this!" exclaimed her father in the utmost
                  astonishment. "This will kill your mother. He is a gentleman—you have known him
                  long enough. What on earth is the matter, Florence?"
               "Papa, don't be hard on me. You remember you said yourself then I was but a child,
                  that, like a child, I was pleased with a new toy; that I must wait till I knew a
                  little more of my own mind. And I have
                  waited, and now, papa, I know my own mind. Surely, you would not ask me to marry
                  one whom I do not love?"
               "No, no, sweet child, there will be no urging on my part. But it is a tempting
                  offer, and for your own sake I hate to give it up. But do as you please; you girls
                  are all a mystery to me. I might better have let your mother talk to you about
                  it."
               "Now, papa, let me ask you to break this matter to him gently. I appreciate the
                  honor he has done me, and am grieved to give him pain."
               "Well, well, I will do my best; but it is like cutting a man's throat gently,—you
                  cannot by that lessen the pain."
               But Lady Grace was not so easily disposed of. She was severe and determined. She
                  could not comprehend any reason for the change.
               "Not love him?" she said, almost sharply. "You will learn to love,—and young
                  ladies do not marry for that alone. They have social duty to regard, wealth and
                  position to consider. And look how happy the majority of married women are.
                  Florence, Florence, my heart is set on this thing, and you have grievously
                  disappointed me."
               At this the poor girl utterly broke down. She sobbed bitterly, but said: "I cannot
                  do it, mamma, oh, I cannot!"
               When Lady Grace was gone, I drew my chair beside Florence and soothed her as best
                  I could; but she would not be comforted.
               "Oh, what—what shall I do!" she cried.
               "Now, Florence dear," said I, coaxingly, "you are not well to-day. Everything will
                  seem different to you when you are strong and bright again. Perhaps, darling, you
                  have felt piqued a little by Major Trenchard's apparent carelessness of your
                  feelings. Appearances were against him, I know, but you should not let that
                  influence an important decision like this. I am sure he loves you sincerely; I
                  have watched him closely the past two days, and I feel assured it is so." She made
                  no answer.
               "Now, do not, dear, on the first blush of a mortified sensibility, throw away your
                  happiness, and what will make your family so happy. I might do it; but it is not
                  like you, Florence. You do not, I am sure, love any one else?"
               "No."
               "Then I know your nature so well that I am sure you could not but love one who
                  depended on you for comfort and happiness. Do, I entreat you, think it all over
                  again, before you make your refusal final."
               She listened with her usual sweetness and patience until I was through, and then
                  sat as if musing. Presently she said, "Well, Olive, I have become an enigma to
                  myself. Until lately I scarcely knew that I had a self. I lived without thought,
                  like the birds in the summer sunshine,—but to flutter and enjoy; and you all
                  helped to spoil me. You petted and fondled me, and, until these new circumstances
                  came up, I did not know there was anything but happiness for me,—anything but
                  tenderness and worship. I made a flowery shrine for myself, and imagined that I
                  was something better than earthly,—to be treated with delicious care and
                  reverence, to be fed on incense, to be sung to and prayed to, I suppose; but never to feel the
                  ordinary sufferings and trials of life. But the lamps have gone out on my shrine,"
                  she said, with a smile; "they forgot to trim them, and in the chill and darkness I
                  awoke and found I was not a goddess.
               "But it is better so, Olive," she added, after a pause. "If I have lost, I have
                  also gained. I am disenchanted, like one whom a sudden and powerful blow has, for
                  the moment, stunned, but who has been aroused after the first deadness of
                  sensation. Aroused to quicker life, to unwonted alertness of every faculty. I can
                  think now; I can reflect now; and this decision, which to you may seem hasty, is
                  far from it, Olive. I have weighed it well; considered it on every side. Did Major
                  Trenchard love me, as I can imagine some might love, I would hesitate to give him
                  up even were he a man of many faults. Yes, I would sacrifice myself, and spend my
                  life for his happiness; even though I could never resuscitate the dead love he has
                  lost. But he cannot love so. He has not depth, nor strength, nor fervor enough. I
                  now read his character clearly. Neither will he suffer as others might. He has
                  sensibility; but let others forget, and he will soon do likewise."
               I knew that what she said was true, and in my heart of hearts honored her for her
                  truth and courage.
               "And, Olive dear," she continued, "I do not think I deceive myself, when I say
                  that it was not jealousy which first altered my feelings. I knew the major did not
                  really care for Adele, nor Adele for him. She had other aims in view. She used him
                  but to further her purpose, while he was pleased and flattered by her
                  attentions."
               "She knows how to use her weapons," I said; "and even shrewder and better men
                  might have been lured by her wiles."
               "Yes," said Florence, "that is true; but I am getting very weary, Olive. This long
                  excitement has been so wearing. Oh, how tiresome have been, day after day, these
                  trivial annoyances! Too trifling to speak of as they came one by one, but together
                  in one sad aggregate a mighty sum. But when the final blow came, and I realized
                  deliberate slight and open insult, it was a deadly blow, Olive. My heart is as
                  stone,—I could not love—I could not associate with Major Trenchard again, if my
                  very life depended on it."
               "Well, love, we will talk no more of it. Rest now, and try to recover your
                  strength."
               "Recover!" she repeated, with a strange smile. "Olive, this has grieved poor papa
                  and mamma, has it not? And I am afraid—I am afraid there is a greater trial in
                  store for them. But, as you say, Olive, I must try to recover, for their
                  sakes."
               This was the first allusion Florence had ever made to any fears regarding her
                  state of health, and it frightened me. I could scarcely command my feelings.
                  Doubtless this was perceived by the invalid, for she said gayly, "One is always so
                  childish when one is sick; especially if one is spoiled by too good nursing. You
                  must spur me up with a round scolding, Olive."
               And again I wrapped myself in fancied security, deceived by her playful voice and
                  brilliant eye. I had seen her just as feeble as now, with a slight cold or other
                  ailment. She always loved to have me nurse and pet her under these circumstances,
                  and seemed to enjoy our seclusion from
                  the rest of the household, our quiet reading, our friendly chat, the careful and
                  pleasant process of becoming "convalescent." I thought, "After all, this illness
                  will pass away as others have."
               But Major Trenchard was not going to resign his bride so easily. He saw the value
                  of the prize as he was likely to lose it. The idea of a refusal had been so far
                  from his thought, the fact so unexpected! Ah, this was his great mistake; he had
                  felt too secure. He had not comprehended the firmness as well as the fineness of
                  character which Florence possessed.
               Sir Robert was a little disposed to be vexed at the surprise, the almost
                  incredulity, with which his daughter's decision was received by Major Trenchard.
                  But after the first burst of disappointment and indignation was passed, the good
                  baronet was really moved to pity; the undisguised distress of the young man
                  rendered his violence pardonable, and the father listened to his entreaties for a
                  personal interview, that he might learn his fate from the lips of Florence
                  herself.
               "Not to-day, however," said Sir Robert; "she is really very ill, and has been too
                  much excited already."
               "Then to-morrow, or to-morrow again," said the excited man; "for again and again I
                  will return till I see her."
               "Then let it be to-morrow, papa," said Florence, when she heard it, "for I want to
                  have it over."
               I helped her to rise and dress that morning, and she sat fragile and pale in the
                  chair by the sunny window of our sitting-room.
               I dreaded this interview for her. I had spoken no word on the subject, and I could
                  not determine whether her resolution was still unchanged. Her face beamed with a
                  peculiar expression as he entered,—an expression allied to pity. He had once been
                  very dear to her; and her gentle nature, I knew, shrank from giving him pain. But
                  there was a dignity, a composure in her manner, as of one removed by an impalpable
                  barrier from the immediate fret and vexation that chafed the world about her. I
                  could not tell how it would end.
               As he entered our modest apartment, there was considerable haughtiness in his air:
                  he was not used to the role of a humble suitor. This, I think, helped Florence. It
                  roused her pride and spirit.
               "Florence," said he, taking a chair and seating himself beside her, "how is this?
                  am I to believe it? have you really determined thus lightly to throw aside my
                  love, my devotion? I cannot believe it! Say it was but a fancy; a passing whim to
                  try my love. Yes, we will let it pass. I will never, never name it again. Oh, say
                  this, Florence; say it was but a fancy!"
               She did not answer.
               "Then where," he added, as if her silence had uttered the "no" he dreaded, "where
                  are all those promises, those professions, I have listened to? Were they all meant
                  to lure me on; to add something to your triumph?"
               Poor girl! she trembled. I saw her lips open, as if to speak, but no sound issued
                  from them.
               Then a gentler mood came over the disappointed lover, and he plead with her
                  tenderly; oh, how tenderly! But it was the eloquence of one who deems that he
                  alone is the injured party. He could forgive,—he would forgive,—he could ennoble himself in the act
                  of forgiveness; but he could not demean himself to admit that he himself was the
                  wrong-doer.
               Yet I felt a keen pity for him. It must be a struggle, a bitter struggle, to give
                  up forever one so lovely and lovable. And I waited with breathless interest the
                  answer from her lips. Could she repeat that fatal word? could she, so weak and
                  helpless, firmly say "No," and cut herself adrift from this old, dear love?
               A deadly pallor overspread her face. I thought that she would faint, and hastened
                  to her assistance, applying restoratives, and fanning her back to a semblance of
                  life.
               "Florence," said the major, "I pray you, for God's sake, to speak! Relieve this
                  suspense. Say you accept or reject; it is all I ask. Speak!" he cried, earnestly,
                  almost fiercely. "I have a right to ask it."
               "I will speak," she answered, in a low, but distinct voice; "and I
                  repeat, Major Trenchard, that, although much obliged for your renewed offer, I
                  cannot accept it."
               He threw her hand from him as he sprang angrily to his feet, and, fixing his eyes
                  full on me, said, furiously,—
               "There is some devilish plotting, some influence here. This is not your own work,
                  Florence; and, by heaven, I will get to the bottom of it!"
               He turned as if to rush from the room.
               "Stop, Major Trenchard!" cried Florence, with a decision that commanded attention.
                  The deadly pallor that had overspread her face was displaced by a flush that
                  brightened with the words she spoke. "You force me to say that which I desired to
                  leave unspoken. I will not have others censured for that in which they have borne
                  no part whatever. Those to whom you have dared to make reference have entreated
                  me, for your sake, to reconsider, to hesitate, to be slow in pronouncing that word
                  of separation which can never be unsaid. But I have decided unchangeably; oh, not
                  eternity itself could alter my decision! My friend, it was your own hand, no
                  other, inflicted this fatal wound that will not heal again at soothing words and
                  chiding voice. Your own conscience must admit that I speak the truth. You may find
                  many still to love you; I trust you will. I pray you not to sport with their
                  affections as you have with mine."
               She turned her face away. The action, full of significance and farewell, was
                  understood by the listener. There was nothing more to be said; it was all at an
                  end.
               Perhaps he left the room a wiser and more thoughtful man than he had entered it.
                  Perhaps a train of reflection had been started which might arrest the subtle
                  selfishness of a character that saw all things as they bore upon himself only;
                  that could understand no rights save his own.
               Though I could not understand why any blame should attach to me in this affair,
                  yet I felt that such was the case; a certain chill and dissatisfaction made itself
                  felt in my mental atmosphere. Innocent of all blame, and knowing that I had used
                  my influence to heal the difference between my friend and her suitor, I yet
                  suffered keenly from this misapprehension. I was a plebeian, I was a dependent,
                  yet I had dared to interpose my
                  stronger will against a weaker, and disturb the existing serenity, the calm
                  certainty of events, in "high society." So said Adele's not inscrutable
                  countenance, so said Lady Grace's calm, stern face. But Florence turned on me her
                  eyes of trust and faith, and I was satisfied.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               AN UNEXPECTED INVITATION.
               IN the exciting circumstances following each other in quick succession during the
                  last few days, I had forgotten Walter's note; indeed, Florence was the first to
                  remind me of it.
               "Poor fellow!" she said. "Did you not tell me something about his wanting to see
                  you very soon?"
               "True," I replied, and began to search for the missing note. I had felt so vexed
                  on the evening when Arthur handed it me, so annoyed at this seeming confirmation
                  of all the doubts I knew were in his mind, that I had thrust the scrap of paper
                  into my pocket, scarcely glancing at its contents, and never wanting to look at it
                  again.
               But better thoughts came to me at last. Walter wanted to see me; no doubt there
                  was some good reason for it. At any rate, the request was a very simple one.
                  Walter was my old friend, at least. I owed him, as such, some courtesy. And,
                  judging from the cool indifference with which he had repeatedly met me since that
                  one painful interview, I knew that he would distress me with no further allusions
                  to his personal feelings. Perhaps he had something to communicate in regard to my
                  father, the time appointed for whose return was long past, and no tidings had been
                  received.
               The possibility of this having suggested itself made me very anxious to meet the
                  appointment, and Florence, as usual, entered eagerly into my feelings. I must go,
                  and at once.
               When I urged the impossibility of leaving her (it was the evening after her
                  painful interview with Major Trenchard), she looked up at me with a brighter
                  sparkle in her eye than I had seen there for some time. "Why, Olive," said she,
                  "where is your good sense and clear judgment now? Don't you see that I am really
                  better? I feel as light and free as a bird. Don't think that I am wandering,
                  Olive, but truly, since I have thrown off this crushing weight of indecision,—all
                  this past, with everything belonging to it, all the wounded vanities and
                  mortifications that beset me,—I feel like one suddenly relieved from an immense
                  weight that was dragging them over a measureless abyss. I am out of the depths. I
                  feel the air of heaven,—I see its blue above me,—I am weary, I am panting, but I
                  am safe. Now, Olive, you'd better be off before my mood changes. I want to hear
                  the news, you know. Letty will stay with me, and you will be back before mamma
                  comes to say good-night."
               Wrapping my cloak about me, I went my way without further delay, passing out
                  through one of the side passages little
                  used by the family, and let myself out without being observed.
               As I walked in the shadow of the shrubbery through the lane leading toward the
                  lodge, a horseman passed me, riding briskly toward the house. I saw at once that
                  it was Arthur; he did not notice me, or if he did, no doubt thought the muffled
                  figure one of the maids from the Hall.
               He and I, so near each other once, were now far apart, strangers, enemies almost,
                  it seemed. He had not been to see Florence in her illness, and I felt in my heart
                  that I was the cause of his estrangement. No doubt he thoroughly despised me, and
                  was averse to coming where I was. He had given himself over to pleasure, I heard,
                  and was seldom at home; boating, riding, hunting, or at the club with the officers
                  of the garrison at Arklow, so the heir of the Hall passed his time, and the old
                  days of quiet pleasure which his sister and I used to pass with him seemed far
                  away as a dim dream.
               I sighed as I heard the tales of his dissipation; no doubt they were exaggerated,
                  but I knew that there must be some foundation for them. And what a lost life it
                  seemed for one so endowed, so full of energy and vitality! To spend the vigor and
                  fullness of his youth in frivolity, when his country was in direct need of strong
                  arm and manly heart to lift her from her peril!
               And Arthur used to love his country,—in those old times I had seen his eye dilate
                  and his cheek flush as he talked of its ancient splendor. He had been my warrior
                  then, had Arthur, and we had held high talk together of how this sweet little isle
                  should renew its glory and hold its place again among the honored of the earth.
                  Alas! where were all these boastings now? Sadly I remembered the words of Mr.
                  Massarene: that he hoped Arthur was all I thought him, but that he was yet
                  untried. The time of trial had come now, and—but I turned my thoughts away from
                  the painful topic, for just beyond me shone through the tiny diamond-shaped panes
                  the cheerful light in the lodge window. A peaceful, quiet place it seemed, hidden
                  in the shadow of its trees; and a feeling of regret, as for something lost
                  forever, stole over me as, rousing myself from my distracting thoughts, I stepped
                  upon the porch.
               Quietly unfastening the door, I found myself in the presence of Walter and my
                  grandmother.
               Both were startled at my unannounced approach,—it was so late that they were not
                  at all looking for me. But the warm welcome I received soon dispelled my gloomy
                  thoughts, and the old ease and gayety that used to possess me whenever I entered
                  the shining little parlor again wove its spell about my spirit.
               Walter had shaken my hand with something of his wonted warmth, and my grandmother
                  (a very unusual thing with her) had kissed me twice. I felt soothed and cheered
                  and warmed. And then I had to detail all the news from the Hall. Every individual
                  soul there was of special interest to her. "My dear, how is Master Arthur? He used
                  to come and sit with me often in old times; but since his return from his travels
                  he has not been at all. Is it true," she continued, "what they say, that he is so
                  taken up with that English girl he has no thought for anything else?"
               
               This was rather an embarrassing question, especially as I saw that Walter was
                  watching me closely. But I answered with assumed indifference that I did not
                  really know; I had seen so little of Arthur lately I could not tell anything of
                  his movements, or what influenced his actions.
               Walter's gray eye wandered from the book in which he had been reading to the old
                  lady, and rested, as I have said, intently upon my face as I spoke. I think I bore
                  the inspection bravely, however, and kindly also, for that dim old volume reminded
                  me how strangely kind and considerate Walter was to my grandmother, how devoted
                  and attentive he was to one with whom he had few opinions in common. She was
                  utterly conservative in everything, and their political opinions were widely
                  different; but controversial subjects were avoided between them; he kept her
                  apprised of all general matters of interest, talked with her of the weather, the
                  crops, and like topics, and in the long winter evenings read to her from the old
                  books she still remembered and loved.
               Though now beginning to feel the weight of her eighty-three years, the strong and
                  stately woman would not own to any failure yet. She still sat upright in her
                  stiff-backed chair, and gave her orders with the precision of former days.
               I was anxious to ask Walter about my father; his name rose to my lips, but I
                  checked myself; it would not do to speak of his affairs before my grandmother,
                  who, perhaps, was in happy ignorance of what had happened to him and his, and who
                  had no sympathy with rebels and rebellion. Besides, I reflected that if there were
                  anything to communicate Walter would undoubtedly find a way to do so.
               After some general conversation, the latter said, pleasantly, yet with something
                  slightly forced in his tone, "You will perhaps be surprised, Olive, when you hear
                  what I wanted to see you for, and maybe you will be vexed, but I have your
                  grandmother's sanction. She must protect me from your indignation, if I have
                  presumed too far."
               My grandmother nodded and smiled.
               "After all, it is an odd request. I hesitate—"
               "And why hesitate?" I interrupted, with some impatience; "haven't you a right to
                  ask anything of me, Walter? Have I forgotten your kindness to me when I was a
                  troublesome little girl, to say nothing of your goodness to my grandmother?"
               "Oh, that is neither here nor there. I have some scores to pay off on my own
                  account. But, the fact is, Olive,—now do not hesitate to say nay, if you dislike
                  the proposition,—the more I think of it the less likely I think it will be to meet
                  your approbation."
               "What is it?" I said, with some curiosity.
               "Well, it is this: the boys insist on giving me a dance on the evening of my
                  twenty-first birthday. It is to be at the widow Flanagan's. Olive, I wanted to ask
                  you to accompany me. Is it too much to ask?"
               I will own I was taken by surprise. The blood rushed to my face and neck; for a
                  moment I did not reply.
               "They're poor, but decent boys," said Walter, apologetically. "You'll meet there
                  neither boys nor girls of your own
                  kind, I know, Olive; but they want to do me a bit of honor, and I can't refuse
                  it."
               "And why should they seek to honor you, and I not do so also?" I said, hastily,
                  now thoroughly ashamed of myself. "I will go with you, certainly; and with
                  pleasure, too."
               He seemed much surprised, and almost transported out of his usual calmness by my
                  unexpected acceptance. Shaking my hand cordially, he thanked me again and again;
                  his eye grew bright, his face beamed. Tonight he was again the old Walter of my
                  childhood. The hour that followed is one of the brightest spots in my memory.
               I would not let Walter accompany me up the avenue, preferring to return quietly as
                  I came. I had no fears; indeed, there was nothing to fear. As I left, I asked in a
                  whisper if he had heard anything of my father.
               Nothing had been heard directly. But I was assured that he was safe and all was
                  right; so, with a lightened heart, I kissed my grandmother, and, shaking hands
                  with Walter, set out for home.
               I found Florence sitting up before the grate, in which a cheerful fire burned. The
                  little table, with its lighted candles, was drawn up before her; there were books
                  and papers upon it. She had been enjoying herself reading, she said.
               "But let me have the news," she added, as I threw off my cloak and sat down beside
                  her near the fire. "What did Walter want to see you about?"
               It had been a strange experience with us lately, that we could not speak our
                  thoughts freely as they came uppermost; so many things had become painful and
                  complicated, so many things had grown too delicate to touch upon, that without the
                  slightest difference of feeling or diminution of friendship, we had tacitly agreed
                  to leave them unspoken. But to-night my lips were unsealed; I could tell
                  everything that had occurred. I expatiated on Walter, on his manliness, his
                  wisdom, his conversational powers.
               Florence kindled to enthusiasm at my words. "Yes, I always liked Walter,—what a
                  nice, good fellow he is! And how handsome! What a pity he was not born a
                  gentleman!"
               "But he is a gentleman," she added, earnestly, as if in reply to her
                  own remark. "Yes, a gentleman, just as you are a lady. Why, there are the Misses
                  Neville, young Mr. Fortescue, and a number of others I could name,—silly, mean,
                  and vulgar people,—and yet they are called ladies and gentlemen. Well, I could
                  never get the thing straight in my mind."
               "Neither would I try," said I, laughing, amused at the puzzled look on my friend's
                  sweet face. "What I now want to know is, what you think about my going to this
                  primitive ball."
               Florence had been at first as much startled as I was at the oddity of the
                  proposition, but freely said she was glad I had promised to go.
               "There has been so much dissatisfaction among the people, they say, Olive, and
                  everybody knows you are from the Hall, perhaps it may do some little good; who
                  knows? Am I not something of a politician?" she said, smiling.
               
               "But how will it do to leave you so long? and what will Lady Grace say?"
               "As to leaving me for one evening, I will fix all that. And mamma—I would not be
                  afraid to tell her, but Adele is so—Well, I must not bear malice. But, Olive, we
                  had better not say anything to mamma about it. I will shield you from blame; only
                  leave it to me."
               And so it was settled, and we passed to the all-important subject of what I should
                  wear.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               MRS. FLANAGAN'S BALL.
               PUNCTUALLY at seven o'clock on the evening appointed I was at my grandmother's,
                  dressed for the dance.
               Florence and I had exhausted all our ingenuity in the matter of dress. It was
                  thought that, as a compliment to Walter, I should be well-dressed, and yet we felt
                  that it would be a breach of taste to appear overdressed. At last we decided on a
                  plain white muslin, with blush-colored sash, and a knot of rosebuds on my breast.
                  Florence, in her fond partiality, saying, "Your own glorious hair banded round
                  that proud, upright head of yours, is all the ornament you need there, Olive."
               I found my own pony, with side-saddle on, waiting for me at the gate of the lodge.
                  I would rather have walked, but Walter would not hear of it. "It was two miles and
                  more to Enniskery," he said, "and he should be expecting me to dance, and we
                  should have to walk home; for he had arranged to have the pony brought back by the
                  boy Teddy."
               As we paced leisurely along, Walter walking by my side, the early twilight was
                  scarcely yet pale on the hills, and the purple heather tinged with a lingering
                  gold, the soft and misty atmosphere, the shadows betokening coming night, made
                  beautiful the distance and the nearness.
               The silence, the loneliness, the freedom of such an hour out in the bracing air,
                  suited me well. I felt its exhilaration, and as we rode forward, ascending the
                  hedge-bound, slightly-rising road; I felt almost as if we were getting nearer
                  those twinkling lights, those stars, now struggling dimly to assert themselves,
                  but soon to claim the night for their own.
               We did not talk, however; such a scene disposed us both to silence.
               Reaching the top of the ascent, we entered the singular defile known as "The
                  Scalp," a narrow pass, cut, as it were with one sweep, through a huge granite
                  block. The legend tells that his Satanic Majesty, wishing to carry his herd to
                  market,—his stout boars for shearing, probably,—found this tremendous mass of rock
                  in his way. The Prince of Darkness never allowed himself to be impeded by slight
                  obstacles, and had kicked his way through with his cloven hoof. And so the strange
                  passage remains to the present day.
               Passing through this wild gorge, the little village lay before us, among its high surrounding hills. The
                  white cottages perched along the slope, each with its twinkling light, gave an
                  amphitheatre-like aspect to the little town, seeming to ennoble it out of the
                  commonplaceness of mere every-day life, as if one were entitled to expect better
                  and gayer things of its inhabitants.
               The house of the widow Flanagan, whither we were bound, was one of a group that
                  stood on the outskirts of the village, by the roadside as we entered it.
                  Approaching, we heard the sound of music and merry voices,—the evening was already
                  begun. Walter assisted me to dismount, and pushing open the low half-door, we
                  found ourselves in a roomy kitchen, with a bright turf-fire burning on the
                  hearth.
               There were plenty of warm greetings for us. "Ye'r late, Master Walter, but we're
                  proud to see you any time." "And this is Richard Lacey's daughter, God bless her!
                  an' come to the fire, acushla, and warm ye a bit. There's some little of the
                  sea-mist in the air the night." From all I had an approving word. One aged dame
                  sitting on the cruppy-stool in the chimney-corner, and sending up a cloud of
                  tobacco smoke from a little old clay pipe, told me between each whiff that she
                  knew my grandmother well in days gone by, "And a braw girl she was; and yer own
                  mother, too, for the matter of that, mavourneen. A doucy, wee thing she was—but ye
                  most favor the old lady," said she, looking at me approvingly.
               Thus one and all had something to say in my praise, or for my pleasure; but there
                  was nothing officious or obtrusive in all this; it was a kindly hospitality,
                  wishing to make me feel at home, and was all done with a delicacy and tact that we
                  only expect to meet with in more polished circles.
               This outer room or kitchen seemed to be occupied by the more elderly guests, both
                  men and women. When we first entered a dense cloud of tobacco smoke filled the
                  apartment, but most of them had whipped the pipes out of their mouths on our
                  appearance, only a few privileged old ladies still retaining them, looking both
                  picturesque and cozy in their chintz gowns and wide-ruffled caps, as the odorous
                  vapor curled about their heads.
               Some cups of tea were being passed round, and among the sterner sex, too, for I
                  heard one good old gentleman say, "I thank ye, Mrs. Flanagan; this is the finest
                  cup of tay that ever crossed me mouth. Indeed, and troth it is. It would almost
                  make a cat spake, Mrs. Flanagan!"
               There was quite a bustle now. Some of the girls ran in, followed by their lads, to
                  have their cups read by the old women, who were reputed, some of them, great
                  proficients in the art of reading thus the secrets of destiny. But they beat a
                  hasty retreat at the sight of strangers, casting laughing glances backward as they
                  went, blithe, rosy-cheeked, and bashful, a cluster of as gay and pretty maidens as
                  need be.
               The next room, a large apartment also, was devoted to the younger revelers. The
                  floor was nicely sanded, and the white walls were festooned with wreaths of
                  evergreen, forming on the centre of the wall the name of "Walter Maury." It was a
                  pretty compliment. There were plenty of lights,—candles burning in sconces hanging
                  closely together about the room.
               
               As we entered, the music struck up, fife, fiddle, and flute joining gayly in "See
                  the Conquering Hero Comes," and then I was formally escorted round the circle, in
                  some places two and three deep, and presented as Richard Lacey's daughter. The
                  girls made their little bob-courtesies, their faces and necks suffused with
                  scarlet as Walter spoke to them, while the boys pulled their forelocks, scraping
                  their feet on the floor with a great flourish, and bowing their heads very
                  low.
               As we neared the musicians I could not avoid a start and exclamation. Did my eyes
                  deceive me? No, there sat Tim, our own identical Tim, not a whit altered, either;
                  the same shock head, rough and huge, the same diminutive, twisted body, though now
                  well clothed, and gentlemanly in appearance, and displaying, instead of the old
                  black fife, a handsome flute. It was Tim to the life, and no other.
               As he caught my eye he rose upright, straightening himself as he raised the
                  instrument in the old fashion I remembered so well, and sending forth a weird and
                  thrilling stream of harmony.
               His associates did not attempt to follow him; such flights were far beyond their
                  reach. The very soul of music seemed to dwell in Tim, and sometimes it must have
                  its way.
               We stood still, while all listened entranced. This was Tim's welcome, and I
                  thanked him for the compliment with words and looks. Such music as this I had not
                  often heard in the social gatherings of which I had been a participant, not even
                  among the noblest and most aristocratic. It charmed and touched my very heart. Tim
                  seemed delighted with my appreciation; his eye sparkled; pride and triumph seemed
                  to transport him out of himself. This was not vanity, neither was it any feeling
                  of superiority, but the real, artistic joy of recognition. For the man was a
                  genius, I doubt not, and those who came under the witching spell of his music
                  forgot his deformity, and treated him no longer as the poor and pitiable Tim, but
                  as one to be duly honored and respected.
               The centre of the room was now cleared for dancing, and the hostess entering, the
                  musicians struck up the popular air of "Charming Mrs. Flanagan." One of the young
                  men sprang up, and "cutting a pigeon-wing" in the air, approached the lady with
                  insinuating smiles and both hands extended, humming as he did so,—
               
                  
                     "Only say you'll have Barney Blanagan,
                     Don't say nay, charming Mrs. Flanagan."
                  
               
               The lady bowed and floated round a few steps in acceptance of this trial of skill,
                  but before she entered fully into the spirit of the dance, carefully tucked up her
                  bright calico, showing to advantage the scarlet petticoat beneath, as well as a
                  pair of very neat ankles.
               I looked on much amused; though stout, our hostess was light in movement, keeping
                  time to the music as it dashed along, yet still preserving such an equanimity that
                  there was no flurry or exhaustion. But her youthful partner was of another
                  calibre; he went at his performance with vigor and gusto, working every limb,
                  never sparing himself; sometimes springing into the air, then alighting in the
                  graceful "shuffle," going through the steps with conscientious exactness,
                     flourishing ing around his partner
                  with whoop and crack of fingers, and spending himself so generously, that it soon
                  became evident what with the heat and exhaustion he must presently give out.
               "Barney, give up! own ye're beaten!" cried his friends. But Barney worked on
                  heroically, though almost breathless. At length the widow herself came to the
                  rescue.
               "Now I'll own up," said she, "rather than you kill yerself, poor boy. Come, then,
                  into the other room, and let's have a cup of tay."
               Ah, this was the unkindest cut of all! Such a shower of raillery followed as would
                  have seriously ruffled a temper less happy than Barney's."
               Take it weak, my lad, or it'll be too much for ye. Let the widow have a care of
                  ye, Barney!" And amid these flying shot, the pair retired to the next room.
               Reels and jigs followed in quick succession, and then the country-dance, in which
                  I could join. And glad I was to do so, for the spirit and life about me, the
                  stirring music, inspired me, and Walter and myself went down the first set with
                  much enjoyment. Going through the various figures, we reached the last of the
                  couples, and then it was our turn to rest for awhile. As I looked around, my eyes
                  rested upon a familiar face, and I recognized the broad, beaming, self-satisfied
                  smile of our old friend Dolly Jamieson. Justly self-satisfied, for Mrs. Jamieson's
                  goodly person was arrayed in its very best, and the red ribbons in her cap were of
                  the newest and brightest.
               "How do you do? And how is your husband?" I asked.
               "Matthew's well, miss."
               "And is he here?"
               "Indade is he, good man, and sore against his will."
               And there, sure enough, was Matthew, meekly gliding along the walls, or lurking in
                  the corners, to await the bidding of his rather imperious lady.
               "And your brother?" I asked, remembering the little episode in his life of which I
                  had been a witness. "Where is he?"
               "Just forenent ye, miss." Yes, there he was, though in the crowd I had overlooked
                  him,—a pretty, modest little maiden by his side.
               "And is that Mary?" I inquired, in an undertone.
               "Lord bless ye, no; that's the greatest fortin' in the country-side,—Peggy Moran.
                  Her sister was married last week, and she had forty goold guineas put down on a
                  mahogany table for her portion. And Peggy will have as much, besides the cow and
                  feather bed, with a power of other things."
               "But where is Mary?"
               Before I could receive an answer to my question, however, I was whirled off in the
                  mazes of the dance.
               Our revel was about at its height,—every eye beaming brightly, every foot beating
                  time to the merry music, when a scarcely-perceptible whisper went round, followed
                  by a sudden hush, as an aged man entered the apartment. There was a sudden pause
                  in the music, while all fell back to allow him free passage. His appearance was
                  most venerable, as he bent forward on the stout stick that supported his trembling
                  hands; but his eye was bright and clear as he returned the cordial greetings of
                  those around.
               
               "Save your reverence, and may the heavens be about ye!" was among the ejaculations
                  that met him on all sides, as he approached the chair some thoughtful hand had
                  procured for him.
               This venerable priest was no other than old Father Keane, "the good priest of
                  Barran," as he was called, who had been Walter's early instructor, and was still
                  his constant friend.
               When he was somewhat rested, the old man said, "I am sorry to disturb you, my
                  young friends."
               "Oh, no disturbance, your reverence!" they all exclaimed.
               "But I have a little business with you to-night, and while I am thinking it over,
                  let the boys give us a little music."
               That enthusiastic leader, Tim, waited for no second suggestion,—a deep, pathetic
                  prelude, a sad, wild wail, as from the unseen spirit that seemed to obey his
                  behests, rose from his flute; fiddlers and fifers followed in some of Ireland's
                  old national melodies, blending in with their leader in one weird and tuneful
                  wail. There was no turbulent clashing of sound, no rush of battle, scarce a touch
                  of hopefulness even, in these strange melodies; all was sad as the sighing of the
                  wind, stern as the suppressed agony of the martyr. They were the songs of
                  Ireland's anguish, not of her days of peace or prosperity.
               A solemn silence followed. Tim seemed to hold a magic power over these impulsive
                  natures. A few moments since they were bounding with life and gayety, keeping time
                  to the intoxicating measures of a witching waltz; they stood now with folded arms
                  and heaving breasts, as those who wait the fiat of destiny.
               "Come, boys," said the old man, when a lull occurred in the solemn music, "this
                  will not do; there is work for you, my lads. I have heard something this day, ay,
                  have seen something this day, that has quickened my pulses with the spirit of
                  vengeance. But, God forgive me!" he added, lowering his voice, "it is not my place
                  to preach vengeance,—vengeance to those children dearer to me than the children of
                  flesh and blood. But, lads, I have been sore tried this day, and if I dared,"—he
                  ground his teeth, and his trembling hands struck the oak stick against the floor
                  with a blow that shook the rafters, as he repeated,—"yes, if I dared, I would
                  exterminate, I would drive from the land every red-coat, every sordid hireling who
                  is bringing ruin and misery on our beautiful island. I would do it in the name of
                  God; but, alas! I forget myself, vengeance is not for me."
               "But vengeance is ours, father."
               "No, boys, no; God forgive me for stirring up this spirit! You must have patience.
                  Wait,—bide your time. And this brings me to my object in coming here. I want to
                  introduce you to your captain, to one who will be cautious to preserve you from
                  danger, but who will never flinch when danger comes. Step forward, my lad." And to
                  my astonishment, out stepped Walter from the crowd pressing in.
               "Will you accept him for your leader?" cried the old priest, his eye glancing at
                  the tall, lithe figure, his strongly-marked yet benignant face beaming with pride
                  in his old pupil.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               THE UNDER-CURRENT.
               WALTER was in some sort a hero among his own class, than whom there are none more
                  keen to discover and appreciate heroic qualities. Vigor, endurance,
                  self-denial,—the qualities of leadership,—apart from any mere social
                  good-fellowship, command a respect among them amounting almost to reverence. There
                  was not one dissenting voice in the cheer that rose to greet him in token of
                  acceptance as their leader and representative.
               The musicians tuned their instruments to the martial strains of "Brian Borohme,"
                  and every voice joined in the chorus,— 
                     
                        "Strike the harp, raise the voice,
                        Sing the wrongs of old Ireland."
                     
                   During this burst of enthusiasm, the good father slipped quietly away.
                  Scarcely had the echo of the song died, when an officer in British uniform made
                  his appearance in the low doorway of the apartment. Unceremoniously approaching
                  toward the centre of the room, in a loud, commanding tone he ordered the instant
                  dispersion of the company. The girls and women turned pale: some of them screamed;
                  the men stood as if petrified.
               The officer was Captain Fortescue; and, recognizing him, I at once made up my mind
                  what to do.
               "You here, Miss Olive?" he said, with a start, as I approached him.
               "Let me speak with you one moment," I entreated; "one moment before any mischief
                  is done." For hearing the hum of fierce voices, recovering from the momentary
                  stupor, I knew there was not an instant to be lost, and I actually laid my hand on
                  the captain's arm to lead him away. Walter came forward at this juncture, a fierce
                  light burning in his eye.
               "Walter," said I, "you must not stop me; I must speak with this gentleman alone. I
                  will explain at another time; now let us pass."
               Not another word was said; but, passing quietly through the throng, the captain
                  and myself stood presently in the open space fronting the cottage.
               A number of soldiers were grouped a little way beyond, and in the shadow of the
                  doorway stood a silent figure, which I recognized as that of the strange monk, of
                  whose treachery I had feared.
               He touched Captain Fortescue's arm lightly as we passed, whispering something in
                  his ear, then glided away as we went toward the road. I scarcely noticed this
                  interruption, however, so eager was I to have these soldiers called off.
               "There will be fearful work, Captain Fortescue," I said, "should they and those
                  inside come in collision at this moment when their fiery blood is up. I pray you
                  withdraw them, even for a little space."
               He instantly acquiesced, almost to my surprise, ordering the men to march up the
                  road a short distance.
               
               I then, in as few words as possible, explained the object of the gathering, and
                  why I was there. My companion listened attentively, and replied that he was happy
                  to say he would not, under these circumstances, be obliged to interfere with their
                  merry-making. He had just been informed that the man they were in search of was
                  not there, "And," he added, "we must be off at once in pursuit. It is an
                  unpleasant business for me, Miss Olive, I assure you," said the captain, frankly;
                  "I have learned to quite like your countrymen, belligerent though they be, but I
                  must obey orders. We are hunting down an arch-rebel, one Richard Lacel, just
                  arrived from France. He has brought some valuable papers from that government to
                  certain parties here, and there is a price set on his head. These are the men that
                  make all your troubles, Miss Olive."
               I stood aghast to hear the name. This must be my father, though there was a slight
                  mistake in spelling the name. The monk was, as I had feared, betraying him. I
                  wondered that the captain did not connect my name with this, so nearly like; and
                  read my terrible secret; but he did not. Adding that he was glad it was consistent
                  with his duty to gratify me by a peaceful withdrawal, and wishing me a very
                  good-night, he departed.
               Great was the astonishment in the cottage when I returned alone. They had all been
                  preparing for a desperate resistance. I explained to them through Walter that it
                  was a mistake,—there was no intention of breaking up their social gathering; they
                  were in search of some one whom they had supposed might be there. They did not
                  know that that "some one" was my own father.
               But the spirit and life of the occasion was over, and all were preparing to
                  depart. Many words of congratulation, many a hearty hand-shake, were given to
                  their new captain; and for myself, the good words that I heard, whether for my
                  father's sake or my own, brought unwonted tears to my eyes.
               Before Walter and myself started on our long walk, Tim had contrived to give me
                  information that my father was near; that he wanted to see me; and that if I would
                  be at the lower gate of the park on the next night, about eleven o'clock, he (Tim)
                  would conduct me to my father's hiding-place.
               Not having heard of my father's return, Walter was much surprised when I told him
                  of Tim's communication, and he advised me to accept his offer of guidance without
                  fear.
               "He is a noble little fellow, this Tim," said Walter; "as trusty and true as
                  steel."
               As we walked on we talked over many matters. I expressed my gratification at the
                  distinction which had been conferred upon him by these warm-hearted people; but
                  added that I feared it was a distinction fraught with danger.
               "Like most other distinctions," said the young man, with a smile; "but I intend to
                  be very cautious, and may possibly do some good, in being able to restrain these
                  impetuous spirits, so that they may not be driven too soon into the rebellion that
                  must come some day. For I think, with Mr. Massarene, who has laid the whole matter
                  before me, that the policy of the government ment is to drive us, by multiplied wrongs and
                  cruelties, to sudden and immature revolt. That would be our ruin. Not a stir must
                  be made, if we wish for success, until the plans now in progress are completed,
                  and we can count upon the united action of the whole island,—north, south, east,
                  and west. But we are sore pressed, though where you are (and I am glad of it, for
                  your sake, Olive), you know little of the horrors attending the present state of
                  things. This thirst for revenge and retaliation seems as natural as the breath we
                  draw. "But," he added, "I trust for better things, though sometimes I have almost
                  given up hope, for I see that something else than justice and right on our side is
                  needed for victory."
               We walked some way in silence, each absorbed in thought too deep for words.
               Presently Walter spoke, in a manner so different from his usual collected and
                  quiet bearing, that my heart gave a great leap. What I dreaded was coming, I knew,
                  and I could not escape it.
               "There is another matter, Olive, that I would like to speak with you about, if you
                  will have a little patience with me."
               I answered as composedly as possible, signifying my assent.
               "My story may not interest you, Olive; it is not a sprightly one; I own to a
                  painful despondency myself. But I have come to think that anything is better than
                  this heart-wearing suspense."
               Why need I repeat his words? The words of a passionate and manly love are never to
                  be lightly heard by any woman. That which had dawned upon me in our interview in
                  the conservatory was no fancy of mine; and it was with pain I listened to the
                  avowal of a regard which I could not return.
               "It has been all along a most desponding love, Olive," he said; "but at times some
                  little gleam of hope would cheer me, and I would resolve to make myself more
                  worthy of you. I would spur up my ambition, rouse my energy, that I might attain
                  something nearer you; for you were ever my ideal, Olive, of all that is excellent
                  and grand. More often, however, I have felt the pangs of bitter jealousy and
                  despair. I know that I have been ungenerous to those to whom I owe much, and that
                  I have been fitful and uncertain in my moods to you. Then, when I endeavored to
                  overcome this feeling, to shun you, Olive, to shut myself out from your smile and
                  your friendly eyes, I remembered that I had never told you of my love, and that I
                  had given you the right to despise me for my whimsical and ungracious conduct. For
                  this reason I have asked you to accompany me to-night, that I might find
                  opportunity to speak with you alone, and know at last my fate. I accept it,
                  whatever it may be."
               But no answer was ready; sobs choked my utterance.
               "Speak, Olive, my dearly loved. Let it be as it will, I can bear it."
               "Ah, I perceive," he said, with some hauteur, as I still continued to weep: "you
                  feel such pity for me."
               "Yes; and for myself, too," I burst forth. "Oh, Walter, would that I could love
                  you as you deserve to be loved!"
               "But you cannot," he said, in a hard, almost harsh voice. "Oh, I understand!
                  Still, you regard me with
                  commiseration, a touch of tender regard; that is natural in you as a woman toward
                  all who are in sorrow; I understand; but your love, that which is all you can give
                  me that I could accept, this you withhold; this you reserve for another. I thank
                  you, Olive, but I do not need compassion; I can stand alone, I think, even without
                  your pity."
               I gathered up my spirits at these bitter words. "This is unkind! this is cruel!" I
                  said, hotly.
               "Cruel?" he repeated, his temper now getting the mastery. "Who talks of cruelty?
                  who is cruel? Do you know the death and torments I suffer? the hopeless life of
                  misery to which you have doomed me? Do you know all this, and yet talk of
                  cruelty?"
               "I—I cannot—" the words died on my lips.
               "Olive," said Walter, softening as he saw my agitation, "forgive me; you are not
                  to blame in this. I must bear it all, and I will. I thought I was prepared for all
                  this, but I find I was mistaken. Were this love," he added, in a low voice,—"this
                  love I would so much have prized,—were it given to another than it is, I think I
                  could bear it better; but I do not know—"
               "Walter," I interrupted, now myself a little roused, "you have no right to place
                  my affections anywhere until you know that they have been sought."
               "True, my friend; but the eyes of love are sharpened strangely, and I have seen
                  many things that needed no words to explain them." He spoke with some restraint
                  and coldness, as if the words so spoken placed guard over further outbreak of
                  passion.
               By this time we had reached the avenue gate, and Walter bade me good-night, adding
                  that he must go back to Father Keane's to meet some of the boys. "We have business
                  yet to do to-night," he said.
               I was heart-sick and sore; here from my sight was vanishing, with a cold touch of
                  the hand, my early friend, my friend who offered me a real love, a real devotion,
                  such as I might never know again; I was turning from his side toward a mere
                  ideality, a shadowy, unhappy ideal, a love which could render me in this world
                  neither happiness nor peace.
               "Walter!" I said, stretching out my hands. "Can we not at least part as dear
                  friends, as old friends, Walter?"
               "Yes," he answered, in his old, generous way; "I will always be your friend—after
                  this is passed; for I could die for you, Olive. If it were not for the struggle
                  that I see preparing for Ireland, if it were not that I must help her in her need,
                  I would go away, never to return until I had trained myself to show the
                  indifference I shall never feel in your presence; but I will try; I will be
                  strong."
               "And do you remember, Olive," he said, after a pause, "how many, many long years
                  since, when you used to come down to the lodge of an evening, how you used to
                  spring into my arms, clasp your little hands about my neck, and 'kiss me for joy,'
                  as you said, 'Walter, I do love you'? And, Olive, once more, for the last time,
                  darling; for you were my darling then, as, God knows, you are now—" His voice was
                  broken; he caught me to his breast, gathering me to him with a frantic strain,
                  then suddenly released his grasp, and was gone without another word or look, and I
                  saw him disappear among the windings of the road beyond.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               AFTER-THOUGHTS—FLORENCE—PATRICIAN AND PLEBEIAN.
               OVERCOME by my feelings, I stood for some time on the spot where Walter left me,
                  absorbed in thought. Why must he suffer for my sake? I asked myself.
                  Can I not consent to sacrifice myself for one so truly noble, so far above me in
                  everything that is really generous and disinterested? Why could I not? The answer
                  that came to my own consciousness made my blood tingle with very shame. Where was
                  my pride,—my boasted independence? I was the slave of an infatuation,—an
                  infatuation lightly regarded by its object, and coolly turned aside; an
                  infatuation that my own judgment had never sanctioned.
               Slowly and mechanically I turned to walk through the lonely avenue. Even the light
                  of the stars was at this point shut out by the thick branches, but I felt no
                  fears; the way was familiar,—these grand old trees had overarched my head on many
                  an evening stroll; sturdy and full of years and dignity, they seemed to guard the
                  patrician estate from the unseemly and unquiet outer world, yet they sheltered me,
                  without one surly reminder that I was too plebeian to walk in their shadow. I felt
                  grateful to the old trees, and as I looked about and thought of the luxury and
                  refinement to which I had become accustomed, I wondered how I should feel to
                  withdraw from all this and take my rightful place again. Walter and I had been
                  born in the same sphere; I had been lifted out of mine to one of luxury and
                  refinement, every want had been supplied, every taste gratified, till I had almost
                  grown to think that wealth and ease and attendance were mine of right; he still
                  remained in his, aided only by his own ambition, his own intelligent determination
                  to raise himself from the obscurity in which he was born. Even to ourselves we had
                  grown to seem as widely different as if separated by actual circumstances of
                  birth.
               This had been called my good fortune, this almost adoption into the family of kind
                  Sir Robert; but I began to question whether it were so. I was unfitted for
                  companionship with my own class, while this taint of plebeian blood that flowed
                  through my veins prevented my being recognized as the equal of those with whom I
                  associated, though training and culture had placed me on their level.
               Lady Grace, who had given me every advantage with her own child, was unyielding in
                  her prejudices of birth. She was supported in them by the dean and rector of the
                  parish, who often favored the Hall with their presence. Their opinions on the
                  matter were kept no secret from me; they could quote revered words and all the
                  learned authorities in favor of the established order of things, proving with
                  pious accuracy of quotation that "some were made to honor and some to dishonor."
                  Did not our own poet say,—
               
                  
                     "Order is Heaven's first law, and, that confessed,
                     Some are and must be greater than the rest"?
                  
               
               Thinking of all these things, I pursued my way, my heart goaded to bitterness, my
                  mind tossed and distracted tracted by
                  the anxiety and misery that seemed gathering around me; and I felt so sore about
                  Walter, I suppose it was that made me so unthankful. As I reached the open lawn in
                  front of the Hall, Helpo, the watchdog, came bounding toward me, licking my face
                  and hands, and showing every mark of delight. Love is very humanizing; the great,
                  shaggy fellow seemed like a friend come out to meet and call me back to myself. I
                  caressed him, stroked his burly head, and called him the pet names he liked so
                  well; and, soothed by the creature's demonstrations of affection, felt like myself
                  once more as I entered the little side-door left unfastened for me by the
                  housekeeper.
               Poor Helpo whined and scratched at the door as he heard the bolt drawn. "Poor
                  fellow!" I thought, "you have your troubles, too; and I suppose mine seem quite as
                  unimportant to others as yours do to me."
               I found Florence asleep, and would not disturb her; but knowing well that I could
                  not rest, wrapped my shawl about me, and, throwing myself in the easy-chair by the
                  bedside, continued my painful reflections.
               But gradually they grew less painful. Was it being in such close proximity to that
                  sweet spirit that had always had an influence on my harder nature, or was it that
                  I had exhausted all the bitterness in me? Be it as it may, I soon fell into
                  gentler musings. I saw the brighter side of life, I recognized the abundant gifts
                  that had been bestowed upon me; could I not bear some inconvenience, some
                  mortification even, for the benefits I had experienced,—the growth of mind, the
                  expansion of my whole nature? Would I be willing to return whence I was taken for
                  the sake of ridding myself of these keener sensibilities, these sometimes painful
                  accompaniments of my elevation? No! rather let me suffer untold misery than pass
                  through life unawakened, with darkened vision, with intelligence slumbering. Life
                  and love were very beautiful,—more beautiful seen by the light of my changing mood
                  than I had ever recognized them before. And as I gazed on the sleeping girl near
                  me, I remembered with gratitude the love she had always shown me, and I thanked
                  God that my ruder nature had been moulded by the silent teachings, the purity, the
                  natural earnestness and truthfulness, of such a soul as hers.
               Soothed and quieted, I must have fallen asleep, for I knew no more till I heard
                  Florence saying,—
               "You here, Olive? When did you get home?"
               The sun was shining brightly in the room; I started up and hastened to remove all
                  traces of the previous night's arrangement, and to dress for the morning. A bath
                  soon restored me to freshness and vigor, and I was ready for breakfast,
                  entertaining Florence, as we sipped our tea and toast, with an account of all that
                  had transpired the previous evening.
               She was delighted to hear about Tim. She always knew he was something wonderful,
                  she said, with the eager interest which characterized her. And she asked about
                  Mrs. Jamieson and her brother, and almost dropped a tear for the forsaken Mary,
                  while she smiled at the description of the potent charms of Peggy.
               At length I related what had passed between Walter and myself. She expressed much
                  sympathy for him, for he was quite a favorite with her.
               
               "Of course you could not marry him, Olive; but still I feel keenly for his
                  disappointment."
               "And why could I not?" I replied, almost disposed to laugh at the gravity with
                  which she made this decision. "What better am I than he?"
               "Oh, Olive, do not talk in that way! It would be so strange, you know; like
                  putting a thistle and a rose in a bouquet together,—like anything you can conceive
                  of misplaced and extravagant. But you are only joking, I know. So let me hear the
                  rest of your adventures."
               Then retracing my story, I told her of Captain Fortescue's sudden entrance into
                  the midst of the revelers, and how I had learned that he had a warrant for my
                  father's arrest.
               Florence was fired with indignation. "What!" she exclaimed, "are my countrymen to
                  be hunted by these strangers like wild beasts? I would be a rebel myself; I would
                  turn on them, the hirelings, and drive them from the land! Yes, I would. And were
                  I Arthur—"
               I saw that she was becoming too much excited, but at that moment Lady Grace came
                  in.
               "You look heated, my love; are you feverish?" she said.
               "No, mamma; Olive and I have had such a pleasant talk. I suppose I had become
                  unusually interested."
               "You must be more prudent," said Lady Grace, looking at me, as I fancied, rather
                  sternly; at least, I was exceedingly hurt altogether with her manner and words.
                  "You have a very great responsibility in the present state of Florence's
                  health."
               And I felt that I had. Sometimes I would look at the frail girl with a sort of
                  terror, as though she might pass from my sight like a snow-wreath; and again,
                  perhaps in a few minutes, her glad smile and pleasant words would restore me to
                  confidence, so that I would wonder what had made me afraid.
               Ah, how little I knew of the working of slow, insidious disease! I had never had
                  experience; and I was so strong and well myself, and every one around made so
                  light of her illness. And certainly I thought she must be better; she did not have
                  those distressing chills so often, and she was so cheerful and happy. Oh, she
                  would soon be well again!
               Then I had not the benefit of any judgment by those older and wiser than myself.
                  Her father and mother saw her at her best, and she was so glad to see them, and so
                  rejoiced while they remained, that they could not think of serious alarm. It was
                  only one of those passing indispositions to which she had been subject from
                  childhood, and the recent trial of her sensibilities, in the unfortunate affair
                  with Major Trenchard, accounted for her unusual prostration. No physician made
                  daily visits to the sick-room: Florence would not hear of it. She plead off from
                  day to day. "I will soon be better; please wait a little while," was her plea.
               But Lady Grace, this morning, was either unusually alarmed or unusually displeased
                  with me.
               "You must, Florence," she said, "have other care than Olive's about you,—one of
                  more mature judgment. There is Adele; she has not much the advantage in years,
                  certainly, but she has had more experience;" and, noticing a slight shade of
                  uneasiness on the countenance of
                  Florence, she added, "I do not, my dear, at all mean to supersede Olive, but only
                  that you might have the pleasure of having both with you."
               "Oh, mamma," said Florence, almost passionately, "it must not be so! I cannot have
                  it so!"
               "My dear, what does this mean? Do you object to having Adele with you?"
               "I do,—I must, mamma."
               "I hope, then, my child, that this is only one of those strange antipathies that
                  sometimes come with illness, and will pass off. I trust, indeed, that it is so,
                  and not the result"—looking severely at me—"not the result of mischievous
                  misrepresentations."
               Florence did not notice her mother's look; she said, brightly, "Oh, no, mamma; not
                  at all. I am a little spoiled, you know, and just a little sick, and Olive is all
                  I want."
               "But Adele takes the deepest interest in you, my dear. She has long noticed the
                  estrangement on your part, and it has almost broken her heart. Poor girl! she
                  almost begged that you would see her; and she reminded me how you used to be
                  playmates together."
               "Why, yes, mamma; certainly Adele must come and see me. But—" And she stopped.
               "But what, my dear?"
               "She will not stay very long?" said the invalid, almost pleadingly.
               "This is most strange,—unaccountable," muttered Lady Grace, as she turned
                  away.
               Poor Florence had another fit of sobbing, followed by utter prostration, after her
                  mother left. I knew that these bitter tears were not for the trivial grief of
                  to-day; but her mother's stern and unsympathizing manner had reopened the recently
                  closed heart-sore. The nerves so lately shaken quivered at the lightest touch. I
                  had not seen her weep in this way for a long time. I soothed her as best I could,
                  endeavoring to woo her back to quiet and rest; but we never spoke of the real
                  heart-grief which lay at the foundation of all this,—for the subject of Major
                  Trenchard and his connection with herself was one on which Florence never entered;
                  it was tacitly ignored between us after that final interview and parting. At
                  length she lay back quiet and exhausted. A sudden fear seized me as I looked on
                  her pale face. I could scarcely restrain myself. Must she die? I thought; she so
                  young, so guileless, a victim to the foolish, hard-hearted vanity of a worldly and
                  selfish woman? And in my heart of hearts I fear I cursed Adele as the cause of all
                  this woe.
               But an hour's perfect rest restored her. She smiled again, would rise and take her
                  accustomed seat in the great arm-chair, and all went on pleasantly as of old, and
                  I forgot my fears.
               Early in the afternoon I was surprised by a message from Sir Robert, desiring my
                  immediate presence in the library. Both Florence and myself made endless
                  conjectures as to the meaning of this unusual summons, and it was with some
                  trepidation that I proceeded to obey.
               Entering the library, I found Arthur there, as well as his father. He was seated
                  in the recess of a window reading, but, as I entered, arose, as though to leave
                  the room.
               
               "Sit still, Arthur," said Sir Robert; "this is a matter concerning Olive that all
                  of us are interested in. We all desire her happiness, and anything conducive to it
                  cannot but give us pleasure. Take a chair, my dear. Sit still, Arthur."
               I tried to speak, but could not; a trembling, a sickening agitation, overcame me.
                  I must have betrayed my discomposure, for Arthur came to my side with a glass of
                  water. Had he not been present, I should have felt calmer; but connecting the
                  interview with my recent conversation with Walter, I supposed of course it was
                  something in regard to him, and so I sat trembling.
               "Ah, my girl," said Sir Robert, no doubt noticing my agitation, "I think you must
                  have an inkling of what is coming! But to the point at once. Olive, I have this
                  morning received for you a pressing offer of marriage."
               "For me?" I faltered, while Arthur, apparently equally amazed, half started from
                  his chair, but covered the action instantly by reaching forward to the bookshelves
                  and taking down a volume.
               "Yes, for you," said Sir Robert, amused at my consternation. "And what is there so
                  wonderful in that? I, as your guardian, would be proud to have you accept. The
                  gentleman making the offer"—it seemed to me the name never would
                  come—"is Captain Fortescue."
               The blood rushed to my face, and a strange sense of relief lightened my heart, as
                  I repeated, "Captain Fortescue! It cannot be!"
               "But it is. He has come honorably to me before he makes any attempt to gain your
                  affections. He tells me he has loved you from the first moment he saw you—that is
                  romance enough, even for you, is it not, Olive?—that he feels you are fitted to
                  adorn any station, and that in consideration of your high merits, he is willing to
                  overlook—to overlook—the—the—"
               "The disadvantages of my humble birth," I suggested, with, I fear, somewhat too
                  haughty a spirit, for I was weak enough at that moment to recall some of Adele's
                  taunts, the smart of which had never been allayed.
               "Well, Olive, we cannot but admit that the young man is generous and in
                  earnest."
               "For which I am truly obliged to him," I said, in softer tones, and much ashamed
                  of my recent sharpness. "I feel it a great compliment, and Captain Fortescue has
                  my profoundest gratitude."
               "But I fear that will hardly satisfy him. What else have you to say? Speak freely,
                  my child. You know one listens who has only your interest at heart."
               "I know it! I know it!" I exclaimed, "dear, good guardian and friend!" The
                  recollection of all his care and kindness rushed upon me at that moment and drove
                  me from my moral stoicism. There was a long pause.
               It was broken at length by Sir Robert, whose voice showed traces of deep feeling
                  as he said,—
               "I could wish that you might regard this matter favorably, Olive. He is a fine
                  young man, this Captain Fortescue, of good character and rising fortune. His
                  family are among the best."
               "Yes, Sir Robert, so exclusive," I replied, "they would hardly overlook the
                  contamination such a union would bring
                  on its fair name. And, Sir Robert, you have all spoiled me; you have so long made
                  me your equal in everything, that I now find myself questioning the right of any
                  to consider me an inferior."
               "Bravo, my girl!" exclaimed the impetuous Sir Robert, clapping his hands with
                  right good-will. "You have the real old Celtic blood,—no one shall trample on your
                  rights. But this does not forward the suit of your friend. I'm pledged to do all I
                  can for him. What say you: are you ready to become the Honorable Mrs. Fortescue?"
                  Sir Robert could not easily forego his jest, even under the gravest
                  circumstances.
               "If Arthur would only take his eyes off me," I thought, "I could speak out
                  freely;" but I felt their deep, penetrating power, though my own were studiously
                  turned in another direction.
               "I understand this maidenly diffidence," said Sir Robert, kindly; "but to me you
                  can surely speak without hesitation. Shall it be yes, Olive?"
               "No, I cannot say that," I answered, now with prompt decision. "No, Sir Robert, I
                  can never marry Captain Fortescue. You will thank him, please, for this high
                  compliment he has paid me. I feel it as such, and appreciate its worth; but he can
                  never be other to me than a stranger."
               "Why, Olive, this is high talk. Do not let your pride exaggerate this difficulty
                  about family,—that will all pass off in time."
               "But I have other reasons, Sir Robert."
               "Ah, is that so?" said the baronet, smiling. "You are sure they are not fancies,
                  Olive?"
               "Yes," I said, excitedly; "the others may be fancies, these are
                  reasons. He is the enemy of my country; he is here professedly to shed the blood
                  of my countrymen; and more than that,"—I rose from my seat and approached the
                  table,—"more than that, Sir Robert, he is even now pursuing my own father to the
                  death."
               "Your father!" repeated my listener, starting up from his chair.
               "Yes, sir, my father; he has a warrant for his apprehension, and we all know, Sir
                  Robert, what that means in these days."
               "By heavens, this is too much! To what are they driving our unfortunate country!
                  Will nothing but blood, blood, satisfy these infernal tyrants? But what can I do?
                  I am tied hand and foot." (At least I knew that he thought so, and that the words
                  of regret and sympathy were sincerely felt.)
               He rose and paced the room with an air of deep perturbation.
               "Do not fear, sir," I said, endeavoring to allay the storm I had roused; "my
                  father is not taken yet, and they will have more trouble than they anticipate to
                  do so."
               This view of things seemed to relieve him. "True, Olive," he said, "very true; and
                  we may be able to get him out of the country before these hounds get on the track.
                  Now, Arthur, you can act in this; you know the country. But be careful, very
                  careful, not to get yourself in any broils, or run in the teeth of established
                  laws. We must manage these things as best we may."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               THE HIDING-PLACE.—THE FLIGHT FOR LIFE.
               THIS was indeed a day to be remembered. At the appointed hour I was at the lower
                  gate of the park, where Tim had promised to meet me. At first, in the darkness, I
                  did not perceive him.
               "Are you here, Tim?" I said, in some excitement; for if Tim had failed me, I knew
                  no other means of reaching my father.
               But his voice speedily reassured me. "We must lose no time, Miss Olive," he said.
                  "We have far to go. Can you follow my quickstep without trouble?"
               "To be sure I can, Tim; I am as nimble-footed as any. You need not ask a maiden
                  who has traveled over the mountains of Wicklow, as I have, whether she can take
                  the quickstep or not."
               And off we started, on a kind of half-run, through many devious ways I had never
                  seen before. Tim led and I followed. Sometimes the way grew so narrow that even
                  one could scarcely pass, then it would widen to a broad plain, the wind making a
                  clear sweep over it. But little was said: we were in too much haste. Sometimes Tim
                  would give me a word of caution.
               "Be careful there, Miss Olive; there is a steep precipice alongside this path."
                  Sometimes there was a little stream to ford, and he would turn back to guide me
                  over it.
               "By gorry, Miss Olive, this is a hard road," was his sole comment;
                  or, perhaps, a word of encouragement to me after this fashion:
               "By jabers, ye're a brave young lady, Miss Olive!"
               And on we struggled again, through scrub and brush, or toiling up some steep,
                  precipitous path.—I certainly walking by faith, for in the dense shadow of rock
                  and overhanging wood sight was of very little avail. Even when we reached the high
                  levels, uncertain starlight, intercepted often by flying clouds, was all we had to
                  guide our steps.
               But I had full confidence in Tim; and on I went fearlessly, only careful not to
                  delay our journey by an unwary stumble or fall. At last I began to feel the
                  bracing air of the sea, to inhale the faint odor of seaweed and shell-fish, and
                  soon I heard the roar of the incoming tide as it surged against the rocks girding
                  the coast. Presently emerging through the cleft, we stood on the brow of a
                  promontory stretching far out into ocean.
               Tim gave a long, low whistle, which was instantly returned, and sliding rather
                  than walking down the steep, sandy path, we reached the level beach below. A boat
                  waited at the shore, hidden in a little cove overshadowed by the precipice we had
                  just descended.
               "Help the lady, my lads," said Tim, with quite the air of a master; and in a
                  twinkling I found myself seated safely in the boat, which swiftly shot out from
                  the shore. Nothing was said during this time; the men worked hard at the oars, and
                  though the sea was rough, and the tide against us, we made considerable
                  headway.
               
               We had proceeded thus about an hour, when, rounding a prominent headland, we
                  entered a quiet little harbor, with what seemed to me a huge rock rising in its
                  centre; a few strokes of the oar, however, revealed it to be a small island
                  covered with ruins, which seemed the mouldering remains of some old monastery.
                  This island was connected by a narrow causeway to the mainland. A sentinel was
                  pacing the shore, his figure just distinguishable in the darkness; and as the boat
                  neared we were challenged. Tim had the pass-word, and with a hearty response we
                  were at once invited to land.
               "Come on, my lads, and bring the young lady; it's a cold place to stand here. Tim,
                  my boy, you know the way to the cave; take her there."
               Scrambling through the loose, disjointed stones which lay scattered on every
                  side,—passing through dismantled archways and long passages, open from above,—I
                  followed my guide silently. At length we came to a halt, and, stooping down among
                  what seemed to me a pile of rubbish, Tim said some words in Irish which I could
                  not understand; but presently a trap-door opened, and I saw below a long flight of
                  steps winding down in the darkness to what appeared a measureless depth. Tim
                  descended, beckoning me to follow. With some trepidation, but with an unfaltering
                  step, I obeyed. Only a coward would have yielded to misgiving after coming so
                  far.
               Before many minutes a sudden turn in the descent ushered us into a large cave,
                  lighted by torches, where a number of men were busily at work putting handles to
                  pikes, rubbing up old fire-arms, sharpening knives and swords. Lit by the flare of
                  the torches, it seemed a scene in Pandemonium.
               A feeling of terror came over me for a moment,—the flickering torches, the faces
                  blackened with smoke, the busy, silent figures, presented so strange and wild a
                  scene.
               "Never fear, Miss Olive," said Tim, perceiving, as by instinct, my state of
                  feeling; "they're all friends to ye. Any of them would die for ye this minute,
                  miss."
               A figure advanced from among the gnome-like band, a familiar voice greeted my ear,
                  and my father clasped me in his arms.
               Leading me toward his comrades, he said, "Boys, this is my daughter. Her heart
                  beats as warm for us as though she had always been with us; it's in the blood, my
                  boys. She's true as steel."
               A cry of welcome arose: by no means a rough outburst such as might be supposed,
                  but a cordial, almost tender greeting. There is a remarkable vein of sensibility
                  even among the most untutored of these people, a rich warmth of human sympathy
                  that almost allies them to genius. Had they but patience; the caution which avoids
                  overt action; could they silently bear and forbear, success would be the result.
                  But these qualities are lacking.
               When the excitement of our first greeting was over, I saw that the countenance of
                  my father was overshadowed by a deep melancholy.
               "Are you not well?" I asked.
               "Quite well, my child," was the brief answer, "but sick at heart. The anguish I
                  have endured the past few days is
                  almost more than I can bear; and but for the hope of revenge, the hope that I
                  shall wipe out some of my wrongs in the blood of these dastardly villains, I could
                  not endure it."
               A wild, strange fire shone in his eye; an expression of malignity, fierce as that
                  of some hunted tiger, changed his whole countenance.
               "Oh, father!" I cried, and covered my eyes with my hand.
               We sat upon a stone seat a little apart from the rest. The shadows lay all about
                  us; the torchlight reddened the air. A lonely, solemn scene, down in the very
                  heart of the earth, as it seemed; and this man, who sat beside me with a face of
                  despair, was my father; frenzied, perhaps, driven out of his manhood by
                  persecution.
               "You will not wonder, Olive," he said, as if in reply to my thoughts,—"you will
                  not wonder when you have heard it."
               "Heard what, father?"
               "It's a sad story, my girl, hardly fit for your ears; but I will tell it, so that
                  if you ever hear some things that you may about your father, you will say that he
                  could not help it; that everything that was left of him called for vengeance."
               "Oh, father," I cried, "you used to be so wise and moderate."
               "But I will be so no longer. What has it done for me, my girl?" he exclaimed,
                  fiercely. "Did I not tell you they had taken my all,—my only subsistence,—hardly
                  won by the toil of many years? I said it was my all; but I had my wife and child,
                  my poor, little, sickly boy, that was to us like the tender veins of our hearts;
                  but they grudged me even these. They are gone,—gone, Olive!"
               And then he began a harrowing tale; telling it at first with a hardened stoicism,
                  as of one who had exhausted grief; but, as he proceeded, the deep feelings of
                  nature overcame him, sobs choked his utterance, and his frame shook with
                  emotion.
               "Say no more, father," I whispered. "I can guess the rest."
               "Right, my girl. You might guess it from what you know of the disasters and
                  degradation of us all. But this," he repeated, clinching his
                     hand,—"this I doubt if you could conjecture, Olive. And you must
                  know it; I want you to know it. Ask Tim to tell you, since I cannot; he knows the
                  tale full well."
               While this was passing between my father and myself, the men proceeded busily with
                  their employment; but when his sobs broke forth, and for a moment he gave way to
                  uncontrollable emotion, they all ceased working, and sat in silence, as though in
                  respect for his grief.
               "Father," I said, as he became somewhat composed, and I rose to take my departure,
                  "of course you know that there is a body of soldiers out in search of you,—are you
                  safe here?"
               He smiled. "If not, there are other places in old Ireland that will shelter me
                  yet," he said; "and as to being hunted, that is a game that two can play at. God
                  does not always give the prey into the hands of the hunters."
               "But, father, do you know that the priest, the monk who accompanied you to France,
                  is a traitor,—is guiding them to your hiding-place?"
               
               "No, by heaven!" he exclaimed, with a start, "it cannot be. He is our friend; he
                  was with us this very morning."
               Then I told him all that I had noticed; and my father, much excited, communicated
                  my suspicions to his comrades.
               Some doubted; it could not be he would play them false with all his warm
                  professions,—and he a priest, a holy father; surely it could not be. But others
                  more penetrating had seen things they did not like about him; they prepared
                  themselves with few words to escape his treachery, if possible, and to be ready
                  for the worst.
               I left with many forebodings.
               Tim told me that we would return on horseback. He had a swift and strong little
                  nag at the end of the causeway,—could I mount behind him? Would I trust myself
                  with him? He would take me safely to the Hall in a much shorter time than by
                  boat.
               Of course I gladly accepted; and mounting without delay, we passed swiftly over
                  the soft sand of the broad plain before us. The air was bracing and fresh from the
                  sea; indeed, Tim told me that in times of violent storm this vast plain seemed
                  itself a part of the ocean. It was now but a waste, covered as far as the eye
                  could reach with the white sand of the beach, with here and there a stunted twig,
                  or a heap of sea-weed left by the retreating tide. The night was clear and calm,
                  the wind had fallen, and the solitary scene lay solemn in the starlight.
               We were perhaps two-thirds of the way across this level when I heard a regular
                  tramp, tramp, as of many feet.
               "What is that?" I said, under my breath. "Tim, what is that?"
               Tim listened.
               "By gorry," he cried, "it's the red cut-throats!"
               "After my father!" I exclaimed, my very heart standing still with terror.
               Tim, quick-witted, and with all his faculties awake, prepared for the
                  situation.
               "They are full a mile off," he said, as he listened again. "I will drop you, Miss
                  Olive, when we reach yonder clump of trees, and gallop back to the water-edge and
                  give the alarm. They know my whistle,—the sentinel is always there,—and they will
                  take to the boats in an instant. So don't be frightened, miss, they're all
                  safe."
               I insisted on dismounting at once. I could make for the trees myself, and would
                  wait there till it was safe for him to return. All this was thought of and acted
                  upon in an instant, Tim galloping off, while I hurried to the shelter of the
                  trees.
               The grove was a small one, ill-grown and scant of foliage. The high winds and
                  sandy soil had left the trees stunted and starved, but they served an excellent
                  purpose to-night; crouching down under their scrubby and twisted boughs, I could
                  in my dark dress defy detection.
               From my covert I could plainly hear Tim's shrill whistle, thrice repeated. This
                  was a great relief; for he had told me that from the cave there was an opening to
                  the sea where boats were always moored, so that with a few minutes' warning they
                  could not fail of escape.
               
               Still I heard the tramp of men approaching nearer. The stillness of the night made
                  every sound distinct. Had they not been so sure of their prey probably greater
                  caution would have been observed; but I heard them descending the road along the
                  hill, coming nearer and nearer; my heart beat high with excitement. Would my
                  father get warning in time? Would the prey elude the hunter?
               Nearer came the marching feet, nearer, nearer; they approached the low clump of
                  trees where I was hidden; part going one side and part the other, they almost
                  surrounded my little citadel; they passed on, the gown of the traitorous monk
                  almost sweeping my face, and they were gone. I was safe, but how was it with my
                  father? If by discovering myself I could at that instant have obtained a few
                  moments' delay, I should almost have been tempted from my concealment. As it was,
                  I could only wait in breathless anxiety the arrival of Tim. What if he should not
                  come? What if they should get hold of him?
               But this fear was of short duration. Very soon I heard his cautious whisper,—he
                  had led the horse back. Mounting speedily, we were off fleet as the wind.
               The spirit of adventure had quite inspired me, and now that I felt assured of my
                  father's safety, I enjoyed our wild flight as if I were by natural inheritance an
                  outlaw myself.
               But I remembered my father's desire that Tim should relate his sad story to me,
                  and as soon as we were safe from possible discovery, I asked my companion to tell
                  me the tale.
               It seemed that about a week or ten days before my father's return an order had
                  been given to search his cabin for arms. Such orders were common; the whole
                  neighborhood of the poor knew what they meant, for on merest suspicion a body of
                  soldiery would be sent, their commander oftentimes a mere lad, who, in the
                  self-importance of a little brief authority, would destroy property, insult and
                  punish, often apparently from mere wantonness. And for these things there was no
                  redress.
               Such an order had been given in regard to my father's poor home, and one of these
                  reckless bands held it for execution. In the cabin they found only my step-mother
                  lying ill, and my almost helpless young brother. The wife knew nothing of
                  fire-arms, but the lad did, and with the characteristic truthfulness of his nature
                  he would neither deny his knowledge nor tell them where they were concealed. He
                  was faithful to the trust his father had reposed in him. Enraged by being baffled
                  by a mere child, these inhuman wretches had seized the poor cripple and beaten him
                  until he was nearly dead, his helpless mother witnessing the whole scene.
               The men left, vowing vengeance on the lad should they ever meet him again. On my
                  father's return from France there was another search by the same squad.
                  Fortunately, he was away from his cabin. It was known that he had been there but
                  recently, and they endeavored to obtain information from his son as to his place
                  of concealment. Finding threats of no avail they repeated their former cruelty,
                  and on the poor, weak body, scarcely yet recovered from their late brutal treatment, they laid the heavy lash again,
                  until the half-murdered child lay in violent convulsions.
               The poor mother was saved from this last sight; her weak spirit, so long trembling
                  in its frail tenement, had mercifully taken flight when she beheld the agony of
                  her child.
               When night closed in, and my father ventured from his hiding-place and sought his
                  home, he found his dead wife and dying child.
               The boy smiled as he lifted him in his arms. "Oh, father!" he said, and his spirit
                  passed away.
               A terrible tale this; one that even now I shudder to repeat; but it is sadly true.
                  My poor father! You did right to have me told all this, for now I can feel no
                  surprise at the cry for vengeance, the bitterness of soul with which you looked
                  upon the oppressors of your country, the murderers who despoiled your
                  hearthstone.
               The day was just breaking as we reached the park-gates, and with many tears over
                  that dark tale, I thanked Tim for the opportunity he had given me of seeing my
                  father.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               ARTHUR'S DEPARTURE.
               MY first impulse on the next morning was to tell Florence all about my wild
                  adventure; but on reflection I hesitated. Even my limited experience in such
                  matters suggested that the excitement might harm her,—she was so thoroughly
                  sympathetic, she would so enter into all my anxiety and alarm, that it would
                  completely disturb the rest and quiet so needful to her recovery. So I refrained
                  from speaking; and, although my heart was at times overwhelmed with sadness,
                  endeavored to keep a cheerful countenance for her sake.
               The damp and chill of winter was now disappearing under the bright influence of a
                  warm April sun; tree and shrub and lawn grew freshly verdant; everywhere the stir
                  and activity of spring made itself felt. Florence would have me place her chair by
                  the window on the side of our sitting-room,—a large oriel-window reaching to the
                  floor,—where a wide landscape of hill and dale was spread before us, bounded only
                  by the heavy mists overhanging the ocean beyond.
               A leading feature in the landscape of this portion of Ireland, our beautiful
                  Wicklow, is its gracefully-undulating surface, every rise and depression being
                  covered closely with the smooth emerald turf. It seemed to me that I had never
                  seen the country so beautiful as now, so fresh and sparkling.
               
               "I feel so strong and well this morning," said Florence, "might we not have the
                  window open a little while? And then will you bring the table, Olive, and all
                  those things,—the paints and brushes and cardboard,—and let us finish the boxes
                  and cases we have been so long about."
               "Isn't it nice?" she added, with childish delight, as we settled ourselves to our
                  work. And when I threw open the window, and the perfume of the violets, the soft
                  scent from daisy and hawthorn-hedge filled the room, it seemed as though she could
                  hardly contain her ecstasy.
               "Oh, dear, how grateful I feel! Don't you, Olive? Such a wealth of sweetness and
                  beauty everywhere; how good we ought to be for all this!"
               We were quite silent for a few minutes, and then came a gentle tap at the door.
                  "Come in," I said, and to our astonishment Arthur entered.
               The pleasure which Florence exhibited on seeing him was unbounded. There were no
                  reproofs that he had not come before, no upbraidings for his neglect. She thought
                  wisely that she would enjoy the present to the utmost.
               "And to have you with us, all to ourselves!" she exclaimed. "Now, come, bring a
                  chair and sit close, and we will give you work. You can cut this card-board into
                  all the shapes I show you. Oh, isn't it pleasant! It seems like old times again,
                  doesn't it, Arthur?"
               "It does," he answered, catching the spirit of the occasion; "and now let us
                  forget that long time between, and let us be children once more. Come, where are
                  the scissors? Let us go to work; I will spoil plenty of your card-board."
               Florence now began to expostulate; with her usual earnestness, she took his
                  remarks quite literally,—"But he must not." But he would. "She could not allow
                  such wastefulness." Then she would take it from him, to be recaptured again by a
                  high-handed manœuvre; and so without any seeming effort the jangle of the boy and
                  girl began, and they laughed at themselves that it was so.
               When order was somewhat restored Arthur began, under proper instructions, to shape
                  something as best he could. "A humble attempt at art," he suggested. There were
                  squares and ovals, with various-shaped leaves to be made; but he was very awkward,
                  quite untrainable, and there had to be explanation and expostulation, and for an
                  hour we had as lively a time as could be imagined. We had indeed, as it were,
                  forgotten "the long time between," and transported ourselves back to the days of
                  childhood, where the present was all-important and vivid, and no thought of coming
                  troubles clouded the light moment.
               At first Arthur and I acted under a certain restraint; but Florence was so
                  entirely abandoned to the joy of the moment, that unconsciously we became
                  infected, and forgetting ourselves and personal feelings, we glided back together
                  into the spirit of the old happy times.
               "Arthur," said Florence, "do you remember how we used to sit round this table in
                  the long winter evenings,—Olive and you and I,—studying our lessons for the next
                  day, and how you would tease us when we were the busiest, by throwing all sorts of
                  things on the page before us, and how
                  vexed I would be, and poor Miss Lucas, too, and we would threaten to tell papa,
                  and then you would laugh and beg to be allowed to escort us to his room? Do you
                  remember all this, Arthur?"
               "Yes, I do indeed remember it all, and much more," he answered, with studied
                  emphasis.
               "Well," she added, "I did not know but you might have forgotten it, as you never
                  speak of those times."
               "Forgotten!" he repeated, with a bitter laugh not pleasant to hear,—"forgotten!
                  You do not know how I have tried to forget; but my memory is painfully tenacious,
                  I can't do it, Florry."
               This, I knew, was intended for me. "And why should you try to forget?" queried the
                  unconscious Florence; "it is one of my greatest pleasures to remember;" and
                  without waiting his answer, she added, "I do think it's your going away from home,
                  Arthur, that has changed you so much."
               "But I do not think I am changed," he replied; "others have changed,—I see that, I
                  know that,—but I am the same as ever."
               "Oh, no, you are greatly mistaken. Olive and I have often talked it over, haven't
                  we, Olive?"
               This unexpected appeal covered me with confusion, which was not at all abated when
                  Arthur turned quickly, and, looking at me with some severity, said, "And you too,
                  Olive, have been dwelling upon my short-comings."
               Seeing the altered and severe expression of his countenance, Florence supposed she
                  had committed some great blunder, and, hastening to remedy the evil, interrupted
                  him before I could reply.
               "Oh," she said, "you need not be vexed with us, Arthur; we love you all the same,
                  don't we, Olive? Oh, how often we have wished you had never gone away! You can't
                  imagine how much we talk about you, and what a nice, dear, good fellow we think
                  you are, you naughty, dear old brother."
               "I suppose so," he said, somewhat mollified; "but what will you think of it when I
                  tell you I am going away again? And it was to tell you this I came this
                  morning."
               "No, no!" cried Florence, "do not say so. You would not go away while I am ill,
                  Arthur, and leave papa and mamma so lonely!"
               He laughed. "Why, you make out quite a pitiful story. I cannot see that you are
                  very sick, and I am sure Sir Robert and Lady Grace will be very far from lonely
                  with all you here, and plenty of company beside; every day visitors are coming and
                  going. I see you only want to persuade me into staying home."
               A shade of thoughtfulness and perplexity, mingled with sadness, passed over the
                  face of Florence. It was evident she wished to urge him to remain, but could urge
                  no special reason why he should do so. She was silent.
               He continued: "I suppose I ought to state my reasons to both you and Olive for
                  going away at this particular time, when the country is in such an unsettled
                  condition. I think when you have heard them you will agree with me that I am right
                  in leaving. In the first place, it makes a fellow completely miserable to be doomed to inaction when
                  everything urges him to action. I know that you girls are ardent patriots. I do
                  not forget our many bursts of young enthusiasm,—how we vindicated Ireland from all
                  wrong, how we vowed vengeance on her foes. Persecution always makes what we love
                  doubly dear. I believe we were then heroic enough to enlist under any banner in
                  her defense. We felt that she was wronged, though heaven knows we had little
                  understanding of how or why."
               "We understand it now," I said.
               "Yes," he repeated, "we do understand it now only too well. I am no longer a boy,
                  and could I act for myself solely, it would be less matter; but, unfortunately, I
                  cannot. I involve the interest and reputation of an ancient and honored name,
                  beside the distress of my own immediate family.
               "My father knows to which side my sympathies lean, and he fears them more, I
                  think, because his own naturally take the same course. He is afraid of himself and
                  he is afraid of me. I see he is uneasy if I am out of his sight, and he dreads to
                  have me speak, fearing I may give offense, or commit myself in some way.
               "You know, Florence, our family have always been on the side of the government. It
                  has always been a matter of pride with Sir Robert that this should be so, and yet
                  we should retain the affection of those around us. If by any overt act (a thing
                  which might occur, for one cannot always control their impetuosity),—but, if I
                     should be so unfortunate as to compromise this established example
                  and precedent which he has always delighted to follow, I verily believe it would
                  break my father's heart. And so, as I cannot do anything to help, I had better get
                  out of the way."
               I was glad to hear Arthur speak thus. It accounted for much that in him had seemed
                  weak and vacillating. Still, I could not but think it strange that so young a man
                  should restrain himself so prudently. Walter was risking everything,—but then
                  perhaps I ought to consider that Walter's actions involved no one but himself.
               There was a pause. Florence, much agitated, watched her brother with earnest,
                  loving eyes, but made no reply.
               "I have talked with Mr. Massarene," he said, presently, "my old adviser. He says
                  go. It is his opinion that a struggle is inevitable, and if it comes, as he fears,
                  it will be ruinous. The policy of the government is to stimulate to a quick and
                  sudden revolt. They are aware how wide-spread the dissatisfaction is, even among
                  the most influential and law-abiding portions of the country; if they can provoke
                  an uprising before any plans are matured they will do so. It is the poor peasantry
                  that are most outraged by the present cruel exactions. They have little patience,
                  less wisdom; if the government can drive them to open revolt, there will be an
                  opportunity to crush rebellion at once and forever."
               Florence wept bitterly. "Our poor, poor people!" she cried.
               "But," said Arthur, speaking more cheerfully, "you need not accept this as a
                  certainty because we wise-heads think it will be so. There is such a thing as
                  being mistaken. Now tell me what you think of my taking a little trip somewhere,—say to Italy—or
                  Jerusalem, or somewhere."
               His sister laughed amid her tears.
               "What shall I do, Florence?" he asked, pleasantly.
               "You had better go," said Florence, slowly. "I do not think it is right to keep
                  papa and mamma uneasy. But you will not go far?" she added, pitifully.
               Why?"
               "I might grow worse, you know."
               "Nonsense! You have a fit of the blues this morning. I am not in the least afraid
                  of your getting worse with that bright color on your cheek; and now that I have
                  your royal permission, I beg to inform your majesty that I may be off to-morrow.
                  Captain Fortescue talks of taking a run down to London, and I may accompany
                  him."
               "And what do you think of all this, Olive?" he asked, turning suddenly to me.
               The words were so gently spoken, in the old familiar way, that for a moment I felt
                  choked for utterance; at length I answered that I agreed with Florence, that he
                  had better go.
               "Well, you are very complimentary young ladies, to send me off in this way."
               "Indeed, we shall feel very badly after you are gone, Arthur," said Florence; "but
                  you will write often to Olive and me, won't you,—just as you used to? I do not
                  know how we could have lived without those letters."
               "I will write to you," he answered, dryly, "and you can show the
                  invaluable epistles to Olive, should she care to see them."
               "How strange you are! To be sure she would."
               At that moment Lady Grace entered the room, followed by Adele. They had been out
                  for a drive. Her ladyship looked annoyed, perhaps at finding us together, and
                  Adele was quite stately in her salutations. Lady Grace spoke first to Arthur.
               "I understood you were to be in Dublin this morning," she said, with some
                  asperity.
               "I changed my mind, as you see," he answered, coolly.
               "Oh, mamma," exclaimed Florence, "we have had such a pleasant morning! I suppose
                  it was that kept him."
               The cloud on her mother's face became still darker as, turning to me, she said, "I
                  am surprised, Olive, that you should be so imprudent as to have this window open,
                  and Florence sitting so near."
               I started and colored with confusion; I had not really considered till that moment
                  how imprudent it was.
               "But, mamma, it was my doing,—I would have her raise it," Florence said, promptly,
                  sympathizing with my distress.
               Her mother did not seem to heed what was said, so resolved was she to find fault,
                  and seemingly altogether with me.
               Arthur now stepped forward, shutting down the window as he said, "Now it's all
                  right."
               "No, it is not all right," said her ladyship, in the same sharp tone; "the
                  mischief is done, and if there is not more care taken in this sick-room, I will
                  see what I can do to have it otherwise."
               
               "Oh, mamma!" said Florence.
               I was utterly shocked and confounded. Had it been to save my life, I could not
                  have spoken. Never had I heard anything like this from Lady Grace before; she
                  seemed determined to mortify and humiliate me, and it was with difficulty I kept
                  back my tears.
               Arthur appeared to be much excited; he paced the room impatiently while her
                  ladyship was speaking.
               "Mother," he said, at length, "I cannot see why Olive should receive all the
                  blame. Florence and myself are quite as much in fault." He strode out of the room,
                  shutting the door after him with considerable violence.
               His departure caused a lull in the storm; perhaps Lady Grace thought she had said
                  quite enough. She now directed her attention to Florence, making many inquiries,
                  admiring her work, and telling her whom she had called upon. There were the Misses
                  Neville and many more who had begged to be permitted to see the invalid, "but I
                  told them all they must wait a little longer, as I cannot have you disturbed, my
                  dear."
               "You are right, mamma; I am very well when Olive and I are alone,—but too many
                  coming in make me feel very tired. I mean strangers, mamma."
               "But you must not allow yourself to get morbid, Florence," was the mother's
                  parting advice as she and Adele left the room. They had not much time to spend in
                  the company of an invalid, for there was to be a large dinner-party at the Hall
                  to-day. A number of friends were coming to say farewell to Arthur previous to his
                  departure.
               When we were alone I gave way to my feelings, and had a "good crying spell."
                  Florence coaxed and soothed me.
               "It's all Adele," she said.
               "Oh, now be fair, Florence," I answered. "Adele could not have had anything to do
                  with this."
               "Yes, she has. I have no doubt of it,—she had been talking to mamma before they
                  came in. It isn't like mamma to act in this way."
               That evening we had a note from Arthur, saying he would be with us in the morning
                  to bid good-by. The tiny missive closed with love to the little girls, just as he
                  used to write in old times.
               "Isn't he a dear, good fellow?" said Florence, kissing the note.
               We were early prepared for Arthur's coming. He entered with a light step and
                  pleasant smile. "Now," said he, "the first sorrowful sound I hear, I will go right
                  out of the room."
               This was intended for Florence, whose eyes betrayed that she had been weeping.
               "I do not know," she had said to me, "why I should be troubled, but I have such a
                  feeling of clinging to him, as if I might never see him again if I let him go; I
                  am so fanciful now, Olive."
               "Mother and Adele," he said, "have gone in the carriage to morning service—I
                  suppose to pray me through all imminent perils," he added, laughing. "They are to
                  call for me on their return, to take me part of the way on my journey, at least to
                  the post-station."
               By this time Florence had recovered her smiles, and was busy arranging a basket of flowers from the
                  conservatory. She was putting together a pretty bouquet for Arthur to take with
                  him. He seated himself beside me, and began to assist in putting the rest in the
                  vases waiting to receive them.
               It was cordial and cozy, and for the moment it seemed as if nothing were wanting
                  to our happiness.
               "Oh," said Florence, suddenly, as she busied herself with her bouquet, "I forgot
                  to tell you about Tim, Arthur. You remember that droll Tim, all tatters, we used
                  to meet every now and then?"
               "To be sure I do, and cannot soon forget the morning of the 'batin',' as he called
                  it, when he rolled across the road, and I after him, thinking he must surely be
                  dying, and then with a comical wink he said, 'It's only sport, young master!'"
               "Well, you ought to see him now, Arthur. He is considered quite a genius. Mr.
                  Massarene had him well instructed,—he can play on several instruments, and
                  performs at musical entertainments in the city, and dresses like a gentleman."
               "And I can answer for his music," I said, inadvertently; "he brings the sweetest
                  notes from the flute, I ever heard."
               I had scarcely uttered the words, however, when, with trembling, I thought of to
                  what they might lead.
               "And where did you learn all this, Florence?"
               "Olive told me all about it. She saw him."
               "Where?" said Arthur, turning to me.
               The question was asked carelessly, but my miserable confusion gave it a meaning. I
                  knew that my face was flushed with scarlet as he looked at me, but I was going to
                  answer boldly, for why should I permit myself to be misunderstood so
                  strangely?
               But Florence hastily interrupted, "It is a secret, Arthur. Olive went with Walter
                  to a party, and Tim was there." And noticing the dark look that came over the
                  listener's face, she added, naively, "You need not be angry, Arthur, it is all
                  right. It was only just for this once, on poor Walter's birthnight. He begged so
                  hard, you know. He is such a good fellow!"
               "Do not trouble yourself to give me any reasons. I care for none of your secrets!"
                  was the angry reply, as, flinging the flowers from him, Arthur sprang to his feet,
                  saying he must be off.
               Of course all pleasure was at an end; Florence was heart-broken at this sudden
                  leave-taking, but with her usual generosity she tried to console me. "He has grown
                  so odd lately, Olive, but I know he loves you dearly for all, and he will get over
                  this abrupt fashion after awhile and be like he used to be."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               TRIED AND CONVICTED.
               LATE in the afternoon the carriage returned with the ladies. They had left Arthur
                  at the post-station. Lady Grace observed to Florence in a whisper which I could
                  not but think was intended for my ear also, that the parting between Arthur and
                  Adele was quite trying. He had been
                  moody all the way, and spoke but little, but when the moment of separation came,
                  his fortitude forsook him.
               "Poor Adele!" said her ladyship, aloud; "she wept all the way back."
               "It would break my heart," said Florence, after her mother withdrew, "if Arthur
                  should marry Adele. Oh, it would be dreadful! I cannot think, Olive, that papa
                  likes her; indeed, I am persuaded he feels a little as I do. I do not think one
                  need be ashamed of what seems almost like an instinct; there must be some good
                  reason for it; and I cannot, I cannot endure her, Olive!"
               I could have responded with all my heart to this feeling, but not wishing to
                  excite her further, I said, gently, "We had better drop the unpleasant subject.
                  The thing you speak of may never happen; and, at any rate, our fretting about it
                  will not help the matter."
               "True, Olive, I will try and forget it; only I want you to say, just once, it
                  would be dreadful."
               "Yes, I will say it would be dreadful; I will say it once, I will say it a hundred
                  times."
               "That's right. Now I will do as you tell me, lie down and rest."
               Holding my hand in hers she soon fell asleep, and I was left to my own
                  thoughts.
               How desolate I felt just then! There was no one to whom I could turn for a
                  cheering word of support, no one to whisper in my ear that I might be wrong in
                  these impatient repinings. I seemed left utterly to myself. I dared not speak to
                  Florence, it would be wrong,—dangerously injudicious; and yet she was the only one
                  who really knew me. Alas for these lonely wanderings, these inner desolations of
                  the heart, that dare not ask for sympathy! to what depths of despair do they
                  sometimes lead!
               It seemed as if everything was conspiring to mortify, humiliate, and utterly crush
                  me; and had it not been for the presence of Florence, whose love for me was my
                  salvation, I almost felt at times as if I should have gone mad. This increasing
                  severity of Lady Grace, those whispered words to Florence, stung me to the very
                  soul.
               Her ladyship had never made any demonstrations of attachment to me, neither did
                  she to any, not even to her daughter. Still, through many years of uniform
                  kindness I had learned to prize her esteem, and I had endeavored to make myself
                  worthy of it. Perhaps I had rated myself too high, and in my ignorance had
                  presumed and sometimes forgotten I was but Olive Lacey, a granddaughter of a
                  servitor of the great house, a menial by birth. Then in my bitterness arose the
                  question, Why was I lured to forget this? I had not sought it, I had not aspired
                  beyond the lowly position in which I was born. Why was I forced to look upon an
                  honest heritage as a disgrace? Why these educated tastes, these feelings made
                  morbidly sensitive, if through them I was to be only wounded and trampled upon? I
                  may have needed reproof, but to be reproved in this way and before others, and
                  above all others before Adele and Arthur!
               Thus I sat with my heart full of anger and anguish. I felt that I was unfair, knew
                  that the exaggerated light in which I saw all things was the effect of my sore vexation; but I could not banish the
                  feeling of disgrace and humiliation, I was so hurt, so utterly sore, with the
                  recollection of what I had been made to suffer.
               Very gradually had the change in Lady Grace's conduct toward me taken place. Yet
                  for some time past I had felt, instinctively almost, that change. A something more
                  imperative in the tone, a watchful glance of suspicion in the eye, an irritating
                  manner to be felt but not put into words. It seemed as if some other mind than her
                  own were secretly influencing her against me. Still, the indications were so
                  slight they might after all originate in my own fancy; I had endeavored at least
                  to persuade myself so.
               But now there could be no mistake. As I thought the matter over, a new light
                  dawned on my mind. Anger sometimes acts beneficially, like a physical storm
                  clearing away dust, and dispelling the fogs that make mysteries of commonplace
                  things. Lady Grace had, I felt certain, been brought to believe that I was
                  aspiring to the honor of a closer relationship, that I was seeking to entangle the
                  affections of her son. The distinction of being Lady Greyton was a thing not to be
                  despised,—it would not be surprising if such a flattering fancy might dimly
                  possess the soul of her dependent.
               Bah! I sickened at the thought. In the intensity of my anger I could have gone to
                  the proud lady and told her that I scorned such an alliance; that no high-sounding
                  name nor lengthened lineage could atone for poorness of spirit and an inheritance
                  of weakness. Yes, I could have done this, for at that moment my anger was as great
                  against Arthur as against any one. Why did he treat me thus? make me the sport of
                  his caprice, smile on me one moment, and cast me off as if I were the dust at his
                  feet the next? Did he not know me well enough to throw off these miserable
                  suspicions which I knew were rankling in his mind? Did he ever in those early
                  days, when our intercourse was as free as air, know me to have a thought of
                  untruthfulness or deception? Now I was misjudged, frowned at, watched as though I
                  were some criminal. No, I would not bear it. I would speak out and let them all
                  know I would not bear it.
               At that moment Florence stirred and opened her eyes full on my face; still, I
                  doubt not, impressed with my angry and unhappy mood.
               "Why, Olive," she said, "what can be the matter? I never saw you look so excited
                  before."
               "Well, Florence, I never felt so—so angry, before. Perhaps that is the reason. I
                  don't think I ever was so angry in my life. I have been abusing people and things
                  in the most violent manner as I sat here."
               "Dear me!" said Florence, sympathetically; and added, with much simplicity, "Has
                  Adele been here?"
               "Adele?" I repeated, astonished. "No; why do you ask?"
               "Because I always feel in that way when she has been here."
               Then we both laughed.
               "Why," I said, "you make her out to be a most fearful ogre."
               "Dear, dear, I hope not! I am always sorry when I feel in this hateful way, but I
                  cannot help it. She seems to me to take
                  the place of the evil fairy in our old fairy-tales,—something to keep my
                  imagination astir with shivering and horror."
               "But I must not allow this," she added, after a pause. "When I am strong I must
                  reason myself out of all these whims. She is mamma's friend, and a great comfort
                  to her. She may be Arthur's—" A deep sigh finished the sentence.
               I often heard these sighs,—too often; they made me sad and heavy at heart. Then
                  she would smile, seeing my sadness, something pleasant would be said, and the
                  cloud, the foreboding, would pass away.
               "But here is a note for you, Olive," she said, taking one from Letty, who had just
                  entered with it. "It is from Walter," she added, glancing at the superscription as
                  she handed it to me.
               "From Walter!" I exclaimed, remembering the close of our last interview. "What can
                  it mean?"
               "Perhaps it is about your father," suggested Florence.
               A sudden terror came over me. I took the note and went hastily to the window,—it
                  was getting dusk. Within I read these words:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Your father is arrested. Come to me on the instant. You will find me
                              alone on the conservatory-grounds.
                           
                              "WALTER."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Stunned, scarce gathering the import of the words, I mechanically repeated them
                  aloud to Florence. Her clear voice restored me to common sense.
               "Go at once," she said; "there must have been something very pressing to cause
                  Walter to write in that way."
               Without delay I obeyed. The night was gathering in shadow under tree and shrubbery
                  as I hastened through the grounds, though a few faint, golden streaks still
                  lingered on the spur of the mountain beyond. I found Walter at the place
                  indicated; he met me frankly and cordially, as if nothing personal had ever passed
                  between us. Even in my excitement and anxiety my heart thanked him for that
                  highest courtesy. But there was nothing of the egotist in Walter; generous,
                  unselfish, his was one of those rare natures which could forget itself in the
                  desire to benefit others.
               "I am sorry to have bad news for you, Olive," he said.
               "I know," I replied.
               "But I fear it is worse than you imagine—"
               "Then let me know the worst," I interrupted.
               "I would like to spare you if it were possible," he said, with kindly hesitation;
                  "but there is no time to lose. I must come to the point at once."
               "You need not fear for me; I am strong."
               "Well, then, I have been in Dublin to-day, at the trial."
               "The trial! Already?"
               "Yes; and the conviction."
               "Oh, Walter!" I gasped.
               The terrible words rolled on me like a stone over a sepulchre; there was no air,
                  there was no life; a faintness as of death overcame me.
               "Olive," said Walter, softly; "I know you are a brave girl, Olive, but I have been too sudden. I
                  feared to lose a moment."
               He brought me a cup of water from a spring, seated me on a rustic seat under a
                  tree near at hand, and presently, struggling against my weakness, I revived.
               "Tell me all, quickly," I said, impatiently. "I can hear it all now. This was only
                  a passing illness. Do not dally with words, or spare me one iota of the truth,
                  Walter."
               "A man's life is not worth much in these times," he said; "that is, if he is
                  styled a rebel. A brief show of trial—perhaps a few hours—is followed by sure
                  conviction, and the thing is over. Your father has been convicted of treason, on
                  the testimony of that foreign priest we both disliked so much; sentence has been
                  pronounced, and to-morrow he dies."
               "Dies?" I repeated, wildly, scarce knowing what I said.
               "Yes; that is justice, you know; justice swift and sure, such as we have meted out
                  to us in these days. But I think we can save him,—myself and another. We will need
                  your assistance, however."
               "Tell me,—only tell me what to do."
               "It is this: you shall go to Lord Castlereagh and plead for your father's life.
                  Through him we can get a pardon."
               "They say he is a hard man."
               "Well, if you fail there, we have another hope."
               The plan of operations as detailed briefly was this: In the first place, I was to
                  request a line from Sir Robert, desiring Lord Castlereagh to admit me to an
                  immediate audience on the following morning. If, being in Dublin and at the castle
                  at the proper time, I failed in my intercession for my father's life, then I was
                  to beg permission to see him for a few minutes in company with his confessor, who
                  would be in attendance at the prison to which Walter would lead me, it being
                  arranged that we should meet at a certain place not far from it.
               Walter had made every arrangement for me. A horse and car were to be at the lower
                  gate of the Hall at five o'clock on the following morning. I had only to obtain my
                  credentials and trust in God for a happy result. "It will come out all right,"
                  said Walter, cheerfully; "only do not lose courage or temper if the boon you ask
                  is refused, Olive. But earnestly, persistently, as only a daughter may, urge as a
                  last request to have a few words with your father."
               I readily obtained a note from Sir Robert, who was inexpressibly shocked when told
                  of my father's misfortune.
               "They are indeed a pack of bloodhounds up there," he said. "I think this will get
                  you a hearing, Olive; and I hope, poor girl, that you may be successful." He
                  handed me the letter with a pitying face, the kind expression of which touched me
                  even to tears; yet I should not have expected further help from him because of
                  that kindness. Action, decision, prompt assistance in time of need, were things
                  that could not be demanded of Sir Robert.
               "I have not mentioned that you are Richard Lacey's daughter," he added. "About
                  that you may do as you please."
               By daybreak I was on my way, and reached the capital before any of the public offices were open.
                  But I had learned that his lordship gave private audience from eight o'clock in
                  the morning until nine. Walter had enjoined it upon me to stop and rest for a few
                  minutes and take some refreshment before seeking admittance, in order that I might
                  be better able to accomplish all that I might be called upon to do. To be strong
                  to pass the ordeal awaiting me I knew that I must attend to his suggestions, and I
                  obeyed.
               I found no difficulty in gaining admittance to the castle, and was at once shown
                  to the apartments occupied as offices by Lord Castlereagh in his public
                  capacity.
               I was conducted to a small antechamber, where a number of others were, even at
                  that early hour, waiting their turn for an interview.
               A servant in livery carried in my note, and returned with the information that his
                  lordship would see me in a few minutes.
               Long, long minutes they were, dragging on slowly as hours. And how was it with
                  those poor, waiting hearts around me? Their eager looks betrayed their anxiety at
                  every sound,—the moving of a chair, a cough, a stir of foot, in that inner
                  mysterious room.
               My own heart beat as though its throbbing must be audible, and every nerve in my
                  body vibrated as if shaken by an ague-fit.
               Presently the door opened; every eye was strained, every ear attent. I felt a
                  strange pity even in that supreme moment for their disappointment; their suspense
                  would not be over as soon as mine. The servant came directly to me. I was the last
                  arrival, but Sir Robert's wishes were of too much weight to be lightly thrown
                  aside, and I was ushered into the presence of the great man.
               As I entered and the door closed behind me, he rose from his chair in front of a
                  table piled with documents, and said, with much cordiality, "My dear young lady,
                  to what fortunate circumstance do I owe the pleasure of this visit?"
               "My lord," I said, "I am in great distress. Will you help me? They say you have
                  the power of life and death—"
               I paused suddenly, overwhelmed with a terrible thought. I had been waiting so
                  long,—hours, it seemed to me, had gone by,—perhaps at that very moment my father
                  was being led to execution. I heard the click of a time-piece, but I dared not
                  look.
               "Oh, save him, my lord! save him!" I cried.
               "Compose yourself, Miss Olive. Certainly I will do all that I can to help you. Who
                  is it? Save whom?"
               "Excuse me," I said, ashamed of my precipitation, "I did not intend to act in this
                  way. My poor father—"
               "Your father! Sir Robert! Is anything the matter? Ah! I remember; you are his
                  ward. Your father?" He looked at me interrogatively.
               "Richard Lacey," I replied; "he is condemned to death. Even now the time is
                  drawing near."
               "Richard Lacey your father!" repeated his lordship, with slow emphasis, as he drew
                  himself up with stately dignity. I perceived with sudden anguish that I had
                  thoroughly chilled the sympathies of this man by such an announcement. What trust in, what pity could he
                  entertain for the daughter of such a person?
               "I am deeply grieved, Miss Olive," he said, with a formality and precision
                  contrasting painfully with his recent friendly manner; "but, but—ahem!—I cannot
                  interfere. Higher duty than mere personal feeling must influence my action in
                  affairs of this kind. Your father, pardon me, is a bad, a dangerous man,—an enemy
                  to the true interests of his country. And as such, and all such, taking an
                  extended view of the matter, must be removed for the benefit of the whole, the
                  course of justice cannot be set aside, even when we most might desire it. In other
                  words, we public men, bound to the interests of humanity, have public duties to
                  perform to which we are obliged to sacrifice personal wishes. Therefore, painful
                  though it is to me, I must decline all interference."
               "But, my lord," I pleaded, endeavoring to retain my calmness, "my father is
                     not a bad man; he has high and noble instincts. He has been driven
                  from his peaceful, industrious life by oppression and poverty. Have pity on him!
                  spare him, my lord, and he will leave the country if you will. Gratitude to you,
                  my lord, will soften the bitterness of his resentment. He will not trouble you
                  more. Oh, my lord, can you not, will you not, save this one poor, insignificant
                  life? It is little to you; to me it is all things. Oh, God, have pity on my poor,
                  poor father!"
               Yet I felt that he to whom I spoke was steeled in his armor of cold official
                  indifference. I could not reach him: my words fell idly; to him they had no
                  meaning. As the daughter, or the well-born ward, of Sir Robert Greyton, they might
                  have touched a cord of sympathy. But as the child of Richard Lacey, a rebel, a man
                  who disturbed the established order of things, I had no power over the cool
                  aristocrat.
               "Then, my lord," I said, rising, and choking back my tears, "let me ask, as a last
                  request, that you will allow me to see him. Give me a few minutes' private
                  interview with him in company with his confessor, who has come for the
                  purpose."
               He considered a moment. "Certainly," he replied, at length, "you can see him. They
                  will not deny you admittance at the jail. We do not intend to be unnecessarily
                  severe; we only wish to be just."
               "But let me have your direct permission; there may be delay; a line from you will
                  carry me there at once; and oh, my lord, think," I cried, looking desperately at
                  the time-piece, "there is but one hour and a half—" I shuddered; I could not
                  finish the words.
               He took pen and paper and wrote the permission, handing it to me, as, with his
                  usual exactness and courtesy, he walked with me to the door of exit.
               It may be supposed I did not linger long. Hastening from the castle, I followed
                  the windings of some narrow streets and lanes, as Walter had directed, until I
                  found myself on the borders of the Liffey.
               Walter was awaiting me, with the priest of whom he had spoken.
               "Have you good news?" asked Walter, as he hastened toward me.
               I shook my head; I could not speak.
               "Do not be disheartened, Olive; I expected this. But have you the permit?"
               
               I showed it him. "Then let us lose no time," he said, hastening on.
               "Here is Newgate." He pointed to a large, gloomy pile, overshadowing the quarter
                  as with the presence of crime and death.
               I shuddered as I looked.
               "Have courage," said Walter; "so much depends on your firmness, Olive." He
                  whispered in my ear, "The turnkey is with us; he gave me the grip.* You know where to
                  find me," and he left us.
               Accompanied by the priest we entered the court-yard of the building, passing the
                  sentinels,—the signature of "Castlereagh" to the permit giving us instant
                  admission.
               I had as yet taken little notice of the good father moving silently by my side. In
                  truth, there was little to notice, his cloak or gown covering him completely, and
                  the cowl being closely drawn over his face. Probably he was absorbed in devotion;
                  but this assumption of sanctity was rather repulsive than attractive to me. I
                  remembered that the treachery of one like him had betrayed my father. I sickened
                  of the gloomy, winding passages, the stifling atmosphere of the old prison, and
                  thought I could imagine the relief with which the doomed must walk forth, and
                  breathe, though but for one short moment, the pure, fresh, outer air.
               A low door in the wall opened to admit us, closing as we entered, and we were in
                  my father's cell. In the dim light, my eyes, half-blinded by tears, could not for
                  a moment discern anything. Something sat or kneeled in the farther corner, and
                  before I could speak my father held me in his arms. "Olive, my girl," he
                  exclaimed, "it is good of you to come and see the last of your poor father."
               
                  *A form of recognition between United Irishmen.
               
               "Not a bit of it!" said the priest, abruptly, throwing off sundry wrappings and
                  garments,—"not a bit of it! There's many a long day to come yet for Dick Lacey.
                  Hurrah, my boy!"
               My father and myself stood speechless, with hands uplifted, staring at the sudden
                  apparition. There stood Tim, the identical old Tim, in all his original
                  tatters.
               I drew a long breath, I almost screamed, but a warning "whist!" silenced me. My
                  father seemed utterly confounded, speaking not a word.
               "Now, Miss Olive, we must act for him; there's not a minute to be lost," said Tim,
                  picking up the cloak and cowl as preparing to put them on. "The good father must
                  see you home, you know," he added, winking at me.
               I woke to sudden comprehension. It was not upon himself, but upon the prisoner,
                  that he adjusted the sacred garments.
               "No, no!" said my father, endeavoring to throw them off. "No, no, Tim, I will not
                  have it! No man must suffer for me."
               "Lord bless ye, who'll suffer?" was the reply. "A few kicks, as they drive me out,
                  will be all I'll get; and haven't I put on my old clothes for the occasion? Be
                  off, man, I must to my prayers."
               "May heaven forever bless you, Tim!" said I, fervently, as taking his hand in both
                  mine, I raised it to my lips. At that moment the misshapen body, clothed in tatters, seemed to enclose an angel
                  whom I could have knelt to and worshiped.
               My father still hesitated. "Tim," he said, "I cannot do it. It is unmanly to leave
                  you here."
               "Now be off," returned the other, "and I'll meet ye at the Three Points to-morrow,
                  you know."
               Tim's priestly disguise had been cunningly arranged, a false face under the
                  enshrouding cowl rendering the pretended priest apparently about the height of my
                  father, and the cloak entirely covering his crippled limbs and limping gait. When
                  the prisoner was at length arrayed in this drapery, I should not have known him
                  from the good father who entered with me.
               It may be supposed that after we had walked from the prison with the slow step and
                  downcast air befitting those absorbed in grief, we were not very tardy in our
                  motions. Once or twice my father gave a sigh as we hastened on, but we did not
                  stop to exchange a word.
               I remembered distinctly all Walter's directions, and, we were soon on the
                  outskirts of the city, when hastening along an unfrequented road, we found Walter
                  behind a little hillock, waiting with the car.
               "So anxious I have been," was all he said, as, helping me in, my father and
                  himself quickly following, he bade the driver whip up the horses.
               Not a word was spoken for some time as we galloped along; we could hardly breathe
                  in our anxiety to be safe beyond the precincts of the city.
               The distant bells rang the noonday. "Oh, my God!" exclaimed my father, covering
                  his face with his hands, "and I still live!" His strong frame shook with
                  emotion.
               "What shall I do for all this, Walter? You have saved me from a fearful doom; may
                  Heaven bless you, my friend!" And he laid his head upon the young man's shoulder,
                  shedding tears of love and joy and thankfulness; in truth, we wept together.
               Walter's cheerful voice was the first to be heard.
               "Why," said he, "this is nothing but what we all are ready to do for each other.
                  Tim was the first to make the suggestion. Isn't he a noble lad?"
               To this we all assented.
               "I am glad I did not know it was Tim," I said, "when I asked permission for him to
                  accompany me to the jail, and as I walked along with him; I should have felt
                  nervous and anxious, and could not have done it so well."
               "We thought it likely," said Walter, "and so kept it to ourselves."
               "I hope no harm will come to him," said my father. "Life is a good thing,
                  but—"
               "But what, father?"
               "But," he added, "I hope no harm will come to Tim."
               "Never fear," said Walter, laughing, "he'll come out all right; he knows well how
                  to play his part."
               It was necessary, in order to avoid the main road, to put me down about two miles
                  from the Hall, which distance I was obliged to walk. Utterly weary, yet with light
                  heart, I at length reached home, and found Florence delighted to see me.
               "I am so glad you are back," she said; "I have been miserable all day
                  without you. Mamma is very kind, but it frets me to feel myself an invalid; and Adele has been here, but I did not say
                  a word of where you had gone. So you must reward my patience by telling me
                  all."
               And I did tell her all, even while trembling lest the excitement of the narrative
                  might injure her. But I think it rather did her good, giving her great, warm heart
                  a joy that for a time invigorated and strengthened even her frail body.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               AFTERWARD.
               I HAD not given a thought to the consequences that might follow my active
                  participation in my father's escape. Had I done so, it would have made no
                  difference in my action, my absorbing thought being to save him from a terrible
                  death, and I should have taken any risk to accomplish that end.
               My poor father, from his humble condition unknown, uncared for, outside of his own
                  limited circle, might have walked to the gallows and laid down his life (a life
                  imbued with the purest patriotism, and dear to him as life is to any), and in an
                  hour it would have been forgotten that he ever existed. But now a widespread
                  notoriety was likely to attend him. By this act of defiance to the government he
                  had risen to supreme consequence; such audacity must be punished in the severest
                  and most public manner. What right had he to live when a powerful government had
                  bidden him die? To plan an escape in the very face of jealous and watchful
                  authorities, to set an example of defiance of government officials, were things
                  not to be tolerated or dealt with lightly. Large rewards were therefore offered
                  for his apprehension, either dead or alive, and bands of military were ordered out
                  to scour the country in every direction to hunt down the rebel, while those who
                  had aided in his escape were threatened with the severest penalties.
               Of course Florence and I, in our quiet little apartment, knew nothing as yet of
                  what awaited. On the evening of my return we had retired early, slept soundly,
                  with a serene unconsciousness of coming trouble. The next day, however, I felt the
                  effect of my recent excitement. I rose feeling weary and almost ill. Florence,
                  noticing my extreme paleness, urged me to go out and get the air, while she turned
                  over for another nap. That, she said, brightly, would give me an appetite for my
                  breakfast.
               I was glad enough to obey. The fresh morning air, the breeze that swept through
                  the silent paths, was reviving. The garden breathed only sweets; its atmosphere
                  was laden with the delicious scent of early flowers and hedgerows. My spirits
                  rose; an inspiration, a youthful lightness of heart, such as I had not known in a
                  long time, took possession of me. Vexation, jealousy, all mental malady, seemed to
                  drop with my bodily illness. I seemed to have risen to a new life, so loving, so
                  forgiving, so at peace did I feel. My father was free, and I had helped to free
                  him. I had done something. I was no longer a mere drone. I had participated in
                  those stirring events, those exciting scenes of danger, which kept the times athrill. That which had moved
                  my heart ever since childhood to love for race and country was now not a thing
                  merely to dream over, it was a part of my actual knowledge and experience.
               Thus in a pleasant reverie I wandered on amid the blooming flower-beds and through
                  the fanciful maze of winding paths which threaded them, until I came to that
                  well-known door in the old wall, through which, in the dear old times, Florence
                  and Arthur and myself had so often passed in childish glee to our favorite range
                  in the wild, deep gorge below. I hardly stopped to account for my unusual
                  exhilaration of spirit. Youth does not often spend itself in reflection on the
                  causes of its changing moods. Enough for me that I had been miserable, and that I
                  was again in joyous good spirits. In this state of mind I was ill prepared for
                  what followed.
               Lingering in the ravine longer than I had intended, I suddenly bethought myself
                  that breakfast might be waiting, and turned to take the short path through the
                  kitchen-garden, which led to the back of the house. I had not gone far when I was
                  startled to observe a number of persons grouped behind a clump of tall bushes, as
                  if in secret conclave. As I came nearer I recognized some of the servants from the
                  Hall, and one or two of the laborers about the grounds. Conspicuous among them in
                  his plush small-clothes and scarlet vest was Jenks, the butler. They were so busy
                  talking in a half-whisper that I was almost on them before they noticed my
                  approach.
               "Oh, Miss Olive!" they all broke forth as they saw me.
               "What can be the matter?" I asked in some alarm.
               "Oh, Lord help ye, dear!" "Oh, musha!" "Oh, that I should ever see this day!" was
                  all the reply I could get, in various tones of distress, as the maids and matrons
                  of the household closed around me, until Jenks, assuming his proper authority,
                  commanded silence while he explained to the young lady.
               The explanation was this: There was a body of soldiers on the place with a
                  search-warrant.
               "And to take ye to jail too, Miss Olive!" cried an irrepressible voice from among
                  the women.
               "And my lady is in fits," said another, impatient at the slow process of
                  explanation.
               I did not know but Jenks would lay violent hands on these unruly spirits.
               "Silly, lying jades, will ye hould yer pace? Take yese to jail!" he exclaimed;
                  "there's nothing in it, my young lady. But, Miss Olive," he added, in a whisper,
                  "if there's any trouble, send them to me. I'll swear ye through. Were ye not at
                  home all the day? I saw ye here in the morning and in the afternoon, and sure ye
                  couldn't be in Dublin and do all they say you did between them times. But I fear
                  it'll go hard with Mr. Walter."
               "To be sure it will," cried one of the men, an under-gardener leaning on his spade
                  at the outskirts of the group, who caught the last words; "they'll hang him if
                  they catch him; but, bedad, they'll find it hard to do that."
               Here some of the tender-hearted girls broke into sobs, which changed to a
                  frightened general scream, and huddling together, as through the wire gates of the garden wall a body of soldiery were
                  seen marching, preceded by an officer in full uniform.
               A few minutes more and the butler's bell rang loudly; the servants quickly
                  dispersed, leaving me alone. I was about to follow when Jenks returned, saying Sir
                  Robert wished to see me in the library. "Keep a good heart, miss," were his last
                  words, as I hastened to obey the summons; "I'll swear ye through."
               Of course there was great indignation on one side, and great excitement on the
                  other, as the news got abroad of the escape of a state prisoner, one convicted and
                  about to be executed. The wildest stories were circulated. Some had it that the
                  prisoner was a foreign prince in disguise, and that a daughter of one of the
                  noblest houses had planned his escape and eloped with him; others intimated that
                  he had been secretly made away with to avoid the indignation of the people. These
                  tales I heard afterward. But now, with all my attempts to fortify myself with the
                  martyr-spirit, I could not help a certain flutter of dread when I considered that
                  I was about being brought to account for what I had done.
               With Sir Robert I found two gentlemen, one the military officer whom I had seen,
                  the other, from his dress, I judged to be a civil official. Neither of them looked
                  very formidable. As I entered they rose courteously, while Sir Robert, wearing his
                  old pleasant expression, said, "Ah, my girl, you have got me into a nice scrape;
                  brought rebellion into my very family, eh?"
               "I am very sorry, Sir Robert," I said, earnestly; for it now came to me in full
                  force that I had probably greatly compromised this good friend by my acts. "Sorry,
                  indeed, that I should have given you any trouble in this matter; and if there is
                  anything I can do, even to laying down my life, I will do it,—I will do it," I
                  repeated; but I could not get any further: tears choked my utterance. This kind
                  reception by one whom I had deceived, and perhaps injured, filled me with emotion,
                  for I had always loved Sir Robert as a father.
               "Well, well," he said, using his handkerchief with some energy, "never mind,
                  Olive; you're a good girl,—you did not mean any harm; and, after all, there's not
                  much harm done. These gentlemen do not doubt my loyalty."
               "Certainly not, Sir Robert; neither is it doubted anywhere," was the response.
               "And all that will be required, my little rebel," he continued, "is that you keep
                  under my surveillance for a time, as I am your bondsman, so that I can produce you
                  whenever needed. And, gentlemen," he added, "after all, we cannot be very hard on
                  a young girl, when we consider it was her own father she helped to rescue."
               The strangers raised their eyes in polite astonishment. "The young lady is not
                  your daughter, Sir Robert?"
               "No, not my own,—my adopted daughter,—but just as dear to me."
               I was about to leave the room, when the gentleman in citizen's dress asked
                  courteously if he might put a few questions to me.
               
               To this there could, of course, be no objection; and immediately addressing me, he
                  inquired when and where I had last seen this escaped criminal, Richard Lacey.
               "You need not answer unless you are perfectly willing, my child," said Sir
                  Robert.
               There was a peculiar tenderness of tone in his voice all through this interview
                  that touched my feelings most acutely.
               I thought a moment. My father was now, no doubt, far away; my reply could make no
                  difference. I answered, steadily, that I had last seen my father on the afternoon
                  of the day previous, and had left him on the high-road, about two miles from the
                  Hall.
               "Which way was he going?"
               "That I decline to answer."
               "Was he alone?"
               "No."
               "And who was with him?"
               "That I also decline to say."
               "Have you no idea as to whither they were bound?"
               "None, sir," I replied, promptly and truly, for not one word on the subject had
                  been uttered while I was with my father. Excitement and joy at the release had
                  occupied my mind to the exclusion of any thoughts on the subject of his
                  future.
               My interlocutors seemed satisfied, and Sir Robert intimated that I might withdraw,
                  adding a caution against exciting Florence by recounting what had taken place.
               This was a most pleasant termination to an unpleasant affair, and I began to think
                  my troubles were all over. But, alas! I soon found my mistake, and that there were
                  other and graver difficulties to surmount.
               Lady Grace was a very different person from Sir Robert, and, beside,—how could I
                  doubt it?—she had one at her elbow to fan her displeasure to a hotter flame. She
                  had conceived an idea that the family were deeply disgraced by my proceeding. The
                  exaggerated reports afloat had reached her ears, and the idea that the family name
                  should be bandied in every common mouth was intolerable to her aristocratic
                  nature. And that any whom she had fostered should place themselves in defiance of
                  constituted authority, was, in her eyes, to be irredeemably degraded, be their
                  cause right or wrong, and as such they were the recipients of her unalterable
                  displeasure.
               A few minutes after I had seated myself beside Florence, I was summoned to her
                  ladyship's chamber.
               "I hope mamma is not going to scold you," said Florence, "for being away
                  yesterday. I knew she was vexed; but you must tell her I wanted you to go."
               I laughed, and answered, "I am not frightened."
               I have sometimes thought that, in adopting an opinion or considering a wrong,
                  women are less flexible, less open to conviction, less forgiving than men, at
                  least I found it so with Lady Grace. She had judged me, and any attempt to justify
                  myself was not to be heard.
               I was to leave the house I had disgraced.
               "But, Lady Grace—"
               "I wish to hear nothing more," said the autocrat, who lay extended on her silken
                  sofa; "you see the state to which I am reduced."
               
               "Which makes me venture to entreat, Miss Olive," interposed the ready Adele, as
                  she hastened to sprinkle some reviving perfume on her ladyship's forehead and
                  hands, "that you will not press this subject any further. You see how prostrated
                  our dear friend is. Dear Lady Grace, be calm," she continued in a transport of
                  renewed tenderness, clasping the listless hands. "Olive will not distress you any
                  more; I know she could not be so cruel!"
               Cruel! I was bewildered. I cruel to my benefactress! Even then I
                  could have gone down on my knees, wrong though I felt she was, and asked her
                  forgiveness, and begged to be restored to love and kindness again; but I could not
                  speak before that girl. She had the power always to excite the worst that was in
                  me: my pride rose unconquerable, my heart felt as a stone. I left the room filled
                  with bitter resolves.
               Yes, I would leave the house—and on that very instant. But then I must also part
                  with Florence, my heart's treasure, my love, my darling. The pang that came with
                  this thought was so sharp, so severe, that I could not restrain a cry of anguish
                  as I pressed my hand upon my heart.
               Mrs. O'Neil, the housekeeper, heard the sharp sound of anguish, I suppose. She
                  opened the door of her little room and said, in her kind, motherly way,—
               "Come in, my dear."
               She comprehended all my misery, and, with quick womanly sympathy, endeavored to
                  ease my heart. "You had better do as her ladyship says for awhile, dear; it'll not
                  be for long; it's all because of Miss Adele. I've seen it coming for some time,
                  but it will all end right, never fear. The bad cannot always prosper, blessed be
                  God; so, dear, don't take on so, it will soon come straight."
               These kind words did comfort me, even though they could not reach the
                  heart-sickening wound that I had received. She said no more, letting me weep in
                  silence till the passion of grief was over.
               When I returned to Florence, although I had made every effort to obliterate any
                  sign of tears or emotion from my countenance, she at once perceived that something
                  was the matter.
               "Is it Adele?" she said. "Has she been telling mamma some stories again? Oh, poor
                  mamma is so sadly deceived! Did she know Adele as we do, Olive, how different it
                  would all be! But who can make her understand it? She would think it all
                  unreasonable dislike if we attempted to do so."
               "Yes," said I, recalling the rigid and unforgiving aspect with which Lady Grace
                  had last received me; "silence is all that is expected of us."
               "Do you think it wrong to feel an instinctive shuddering dislike like this,—an
                  antipathy, Olive?"
               "No more than I would to dislike a noxious reptile," I answered, briefly, and with
                  bitterness.
               "And mamma,—Adele seems to have made herself so necessary to mamma's comfort,—and
                  she has so many projects in the future for Arthur and Adele."
               These words were torture to me; I knew it all to be true, but I could not bear to
                  hear it spoken. "Now, dear," I said in my misery, "you know we resolved that we
                  would not talk about Adele. Let me read to you; I am sick and weary."
               
               "And I am sick, too," said Florence; "I had such a weary day yesterday. You must
                  not leave me again, Olive. Yes, read; do read me something pleasant."
               I reached for my book and sat down by the bedside, turning my face away from her,
                  for it required all my efforts to hide my tears. The thought would keep uppermost,
                  "I must presently leave her forever."
               As I turned the pages the door opened and Sir Robert entered. It was an unusual
                  thing for him to pay us a morning visit.
               "What!" said he, "not up yet?"
               "Well, papa, I am a little tired, and maybe lazy, this morning. I ought to be up,
                  I know; but I am so glad to see you, dear, sweet papa! And they say poor old
                  Sappho is dead at last. Won't you sit down and tell me all about it?"
               I gave my chair to Sir Robert, and he sat down and began to talk to Florence in
                  his gay, pleasant way. Gradually, however, he approached the real object of his
                  visit, which was to insist that she should see the family physician. An animated
                  debate followed, for Florence had always manifested an unconquerable aversion to
                  being considered a bona fide invalid. She submitted at last to her father's wishes
                  with a smile and a sigh.
               I seized this opportunity to slip away. I could not bear the thought of a formal
                  departure, and of saying good-by to Florence,—that would break my heart. While she
                  was busy and happy I would go, and hide my mortification and misery in my
                  grandmother's little cottage.
               My garden-hat lay upon the chair by the door, and, picking it up, I glided
                  outside. In the passage-way I met Letty. I threw my arms about her in a transport
                  of grief which astonished the girl beyond measure.
               "Take good care of your mistress, Letty," was all I could say.
               Reaching the lodge, I found everything silent. The place looked deserted. Opening
                  the door into the little parlor, I entered. There was no one there. I proceeded up
                  to my grandmother's room, where I found her fast asleep on the bed. She did not
                  waken on my entrance, and I softly retreated and went to seek Betty, the maid of
                  all work, who, busy in the kitchen, had not heard my entrance.
               From her I learned that my grandmother had been very poorly the day before, that
                  she sometimes heard her moaning, as if in distress; that she had wanted to go up
                  to the Hall for me, but the old lady would not let her, saying she should be
                  better soon. And this morning she had not stirred, but kept on sleeping so
                  sweetly.
               I returned to the bedroom, and sat down quietly, to await my grandmother's waking.
                  I was glad of a little respite, for I did not know how to tell her what had
                  happened. I knew that her inquiries would be very sharp if I remained over the
                  usual time, and how should I acknowledge "I have left the Hall forever?" Indeed, I
                  had turned it over in my mind if it were possible for me to seek some other place
                  of refuge rather than tell her all. To her now my father was doubtless a name
                  forbidden,—she had no pity for or sympathy with rebels,—and whatever befell him
                  hereafter would be looked upon in the light of a just punishment. I felt that
                     she might be as severe as Lady
                  Grace, perhaps she would even refuse me shelter, if I so lowered myself in her
                  eyes as to relate all that had transpired of late. Yes, I was glad of a little
                  rest, a little time to think, for I seemed as yet to have been acting in a
                  dream.
               Still she slept; it was now past midday. Betty crept in softly.
               "And does the mistress still sleep, an' the sun glarin' in this way! It isn't like
                  her; musha, dear, hadn't we better waken her up?"
               This was the first I thought of alarm. It had not occurred to me that this sleep,
                  so prolonged, so undisturbed, was other than natural. I bent over the bed and
                  looked into the face of the sleeper. There was a little color there, and the hands
                  as I touched them felt soft and warm . The sleep seemed to me like the sleep of an
                  infant.
               "Oh, Betty, why did you frighten me?" I said; "grandmother couldn't be sick and
                  sleep so sweetly."
               "Sorra me, an' bad luck, dear, to any would harm ye; but old people are like
                  babies, they may sleep their life away."
               At that moment, perhaps roused by our whispering or the motion of my hand, my
                  grandmother suddenly opened her eyes and looked keenly at me.
               "You here, child!" she said; "you have been long away."
               "Me, grandmother? Oh, no!"
               "What! it's you, Olive? I thought it was—Yes, poor child! but where's your color
                  gone? You look white as she did when I last saw her,—very white—very white."
               And again she slept.
               Hours went by in a strange, hushed quiet. Occasionally the old lady would waken.
                  She always knew me and would have a word to say,—
               "Don't stay too long, dear. Walter will see you to the Hall," or something of the
                  sort.
               I offered her drink, but she refused it. She seemed to have some difficulty in
                  swallowing; once or twice I persuaded her to take a few drops of wine, and I
                  moistened her lips with water occasionally; still, sleep seemed to be all she
                  desired.
               Thus the afternoon wore away. Late in the evening my grandmother rested so calmly,
                  and breathed so sweetly, that I could not think she was seriously ill. We fastened
                  the doors and windows, and I bade Betty go to her room. Before she left, however,
                  she came close to me and whispered, "Miss Olive, can ye tell me where Mr. Walter's
                  gone? It's not like him to be away so long. If the ould mistress was herself, she
                  wouldn't like it."
               I assured her he was not far away, he would soon return, and she left contented. I
                  sat up some time longer, but at length, weary with watching and thinking, threw
                  myself across the foot of the bed.
               I must have fallen into a deep sleep, for I had no recollection of anything more
                  until something—a peculiar sound, as of heavy breathing—startled me, and I woke to
                  find it broad daylight.
               Being so suddenly awakened, I was stupefied for a moment, but again I heard that
                  ominous sound. Springing from the bed, I called aloud for Betty. She came in a
                  moment; we rubbed the stiffening hands, we bathed the cold face, but, alas! in vain. The grim
                  messenger was there, the gathering shadows closed about the vanishing spirit; a
                  sigh, and she was gone.
               I could not restrain a wild outcry. "Dead! my grandmother dead, and I asleep! Oh,
                  perhaps she had some last words to say! perhaps she may have called and I did not
                  hear!"
               Betty, more used to death than I, wasted no time in regrets. She attended to all
                  the proper decencies, straightened the limbs, closed the eyes, and the calm face
                  of the dead looked as though again composed to quiet slumber.
               What now was I to do? Where should I get help? I thought of Lady Betty, but, alas!
                  she was as dead to me. All those whom I had leaned upon were gone. Should I send
                  for Mrs. O'Neil? She was always good, but perhaps now she felt as the others did.
                  I looked up from the bed where I had leaned my head in sobbing despair, and there
                  stood Mrs. O'Neil.
               She had come on another errand, although willing to stay and do all she could in
                  the strange emergency which had befallen. Miss Florence was very bad,—I must go to
                  her at once.
               And then I learned that Florence had been put off with many excuses for my
                  absence, but when I failed to return at night her suspicions were roused, and they
                  were obliged to tell her all. She refused to be comforted, she was utterly
                  distracted, and Sir Robert, who then for the first time heard the particulars of
                  my departure, was indignant beyond measure. Florence had passed a fearful night,
                  and Lady Grace had herself called Mrs. O'Neil thus early to carry a note to me, in
                  which she asked, even entreated, that I would return to her suffering child.
               I did not linger,—scarcely did I finish reading her ladyship's note. And in a few
                  minutes Florence, with her arms tightly wound about my neck, as if to keep me from
                  ever again leaving her, was sobbing upon my breast.
               "My God! to part these two!" said Sir Robert, turning away and wiping his
                  eyes.
               Even Lady Grace was visibly affected, though she was silent.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               THE DEATH OF FLORENCE.
               MY dear grandmother's remains were consigned to their last resting-place with
                  every mark of respect. Sir Robert and Lady Grace, with the numerous retainers of
                  the house, accompanied them to the parish church, where funeral services were
                  read, and thence to their consignment in the family vault of the Greytons.
               The dead would have asked no more than to be permitted to mingle her dust with
                  that of these revered ones. She had few personal friends; her nature was too stern
                  and concentrated to admit of many social ties, and so her departure made very
                  little stir.
               Her little all, the savings of many years, was left to myself: the last of her race. A few hundred pounds;
                  yet, though, a trifle, wealth to me, inasmuch as it gave me, if need be, the means
                  of independence for a time. For my late bitter experience at the Hall had left me
                  with some chill misgivings. I shed tears of real sorrow over that grave, but they
                  were more of sadness than affection, and then I returned to my post at the bedside
                  of Florence.
               There was no allusion made to any former difficulty. Once more together in our
                  pleasant, home-like rooms, we lived only in the present; forgetting, as far as
                  possible, the cloud that had recently overshadowed us,—and Florence, at least, was
                  happy as a bird.
               But she did not gain strength; the soft spring air in which she rejoiced, the
                  sunshine in which she reveled, brought no returning tint to this pale flower.
               Lady Grace was very kind to me, and Sir Robert all affection and tenderness. Of
                  Adele we saw little; she had wisely concluded to absent herself, only appearing a
                  few minutes each day to inquire after "her dear Florence."
               In these visits she always contrived to leave the impression that she was in some
                  way injured. I think Lady Grace looked upon her as a martyr. "Affectionate
                  creature," she would say in an undertone, and sigh, as she witnessed Adele's
                  coldly received demonstrations. Probably she pitied her for not having some object
                  on which to expend those abundant affections. Had it not been for me, perhaps they
                  might have been lavished on her own sweet child.
               But, apparently, the young lady found means of enjoying herself in spite of our
                  coldness. She did not lack companions; there was driving and horseback-riding, and
                  there were spirited games on the lawn. Even to our remote little den often rose
                  the echoes of their mirth. "But I have to force her from me to these enjoyments,
                  dear, devoted girl!" the infatuated Lady Grace would remark.
               Florence had at last consented to see a physician other than the good old family
                  doctor; and the celebrated Sir Michael Donan was now hourly expected.
               Sir Robert was in a fever of anxiety, walking in and out of the room. "It is for
                  your sake, to please you and mamma, that I see him," said Florence.
                     "I do not feel at all uneasy, papa!"
               "Nor I, my love; only it will be a satisfaction to have his opinion. And you know
                  I am waiting to see if you cannot travel with me this summer."
               Dr. Finckley accompanied Sir Michael. Florence, at the time of their entrance, was
                  sitting up in the large easy-chair. It was signified that the family should leave
                  the room; I alone, as being necessary to her attendance, was allowed to remain. I
                  stood beside the invalid with my heart beating strangely. What was to be the
                  outcome of this solemn sitting? I did not know. I trembled with an unspoken
                  fear.
               Florence, however, was calm; whatever might come, she was better prepared than I
                  was.
               Sir Michael's countenance pleased me; he had a kind, tender manner. But my heart
                  sank within me as I watched the varying expression of his face. There was in it a
                  mingling of alarm and pity, not to be concealed even by professional
                  cautiousness.
               "Then he questioned me in regard to the patient, whose own answers had, however, been far more
                  intelligent than mine. I could not frame a clear reply. Sick and faint, I saw the
                  doom that was written in his face.
               But with much tact he drew attention from my choked voice and incoherent utterance
                  by cheerily rising to admire some little matters of adornment about the room; he
                  smelled the flowers, he looked out of the windows at the lovely prospect.
               "By Jove, Finckley!" he said, "this would make a sick man well." Then, smoothing
                  Florence's shining hair tenderly, he said she was a brave girl, and he would come
                  to see her again.
               When they had left, Florence sat for a few moments thoughtful and silent.
                  Presently she said, "Come, Olive dear, sit beside me; I want to talk to you."
               I sank down upon the low seat she indicated.
               "Do you know I am not going to get well, Olive?" she said.
               "Oh, Florence, my darling, I cannot bear it!" I cried; shocked to hear my own
                  thoughts put into words.
               She put her hand in mine quietly. "I have been for some time thinking of this, but
                  did not dare to mention it; poor papa and mamma, it will grieve them so! But I see
                  the doctor thinks as I do, Olive."
               "He did not say anything like it!" I exclaimed, abruptly. "True; but it is all the
                  same, dear. I understood it well. My Olive, we must bear the truth: my days are
                  numbered."
               "You will kill me!" I cried, unable to control my distress. "You will kill me if
                  you talk in this way. Why mind what the doctors say. Can they not be
                  mistaken?"
               "To be sure they can?" she answered, smiling. "But their judgment in this matter
                  has only strengthened my own opinion. I have long felt that I could not recover.
                  Do you remember that night of the ball, Olive,—our birthnight ball, when I had
                  that fearful chill in our room? I felt a shock then that seemed almost to part
                  soul and body."
               "Yes," I answered, with indignant remembrance, "I remember it as well as if it had
                  been yesterday, all of it."
               "Well, since that night death has been ever present to me. I have become used to
                  the thought. I know I am careless many a time, Olive, speaking out my thoughts in
                  a childish way; but this I have kept to myself. My greatest suffering has been for
                  you; I dreaded to alarm you and the rest. I do not want to leave you! No, oh, no!"
                  And she laid her young head on my breast, while the tears trickled down her sweet,
                  pale face.
               We mingled our tears together. I could not be as unselfish as she; I must have
                  sympathy, and it was Florence who pitied and comforted and tried to inspire me
                  with strength.
               After this I grew calmer; I promised to be brave, to imitate her heroism,—to bear
                  whatever might come.
               "Papa will need all your support," she said, as a suppressed cry of anguish
                  reached us from the outer room, where the doctor was conversing with her parents.
                  "Poor papa!" she said. "They know it now."
               Sir Michael was quite unaware that the family were so little prepared for anything serious in this
                  illness. Dr. Finckley had hinted at it; but Dr. Finckley was the old family
                  physician, as tender of the feelings of those who employed him as of their bodies.
                  He did not wish to alarm any one, and presumed they could not be wholly ignorant
                  of what to him was so painfully evident,—the gradual sinking of their favorite
                  child.
               Sir Michael met the anxious, inquiring looks of the parents with a doubtful shake
                  of the head.
               "But you do not consider her very ill?" was the alarmed question.
               "She is a very sick girl," he answered, sadly.
               "But not dangerously so? Surely, doctor, you do not mean to say this? Oh, no, it
                  cannot be—our darling, our delight,—it cannot be! She has always been
                  delicate; she needs some strengthening medicine, does she not,—some change, you
                  mean?"
               He was much distressed. Used to painful scenes as he was, he was hardly prepared
                  for this, and the sweet girl had interested him deeply.
               "Would that I could give you hope!" he exclaimed.
               "Hope!" repeated Lady Grace. "You cannot mean there is no hope?"
               "I fear there is not."
               The stern self-repression of the mother gave way at this unexpected blow. She fell
                  back in her chair unconscious.
               "I cannot bear it!" said Sir Robert, pacing the floor in anguish. It was his cry
                  of despair that penetrated to us in our chamber.
               "God will help you to bear it," said the sympathizing physician; "he is
                  merciful."
               "He will not be merciful if he takes my angel-child from me," was the father's
                  reply.
               Poor Sir Robert!—he was not impious,—for his blessings he had a heart full of
                  gratitude,—but he could not reconcile this terrible visitation with any of his
                  ideas of mercy.
               The household was stricken as with a sudden blight. All that had been sunny and
                  joyous crept away in the shadow. For Florence had been the pride and the delight
                  of all. Love and peace had reigned in her presence; they were her attributes.
                  There was nothing unpleasant to remember; her life had been one long ray of
                  sunshine. Yet every one felt that she must not be disturbed with their grief. It
                  was their place to show cheerful faces and speak pleasant words; but, oh, the
                  bitter trial of doing this!
               Sir Robert was still rebellious; still he could not submit; Florence must get
                  well. She would get well if she but did as he wished; if she would go about in the
                  fresh air every day, ride or walk, take exercise as of old.
               "Oh, when she gets strong enough, Olive," he said, with reckless attempt at
                  pleasantry, "we will be off, you and I, with our invalid to the South of France,
                  and have a glorious time."
               Florence would smile at this. "I will try my very best to get well, papa," she
                  said; and added, with a sigh, when he was gone, "Poor papa!"
               And she made the effort heroically; taking the daily drive when it had become a
                  pain and trial to her, and she was too feeble to be benefited by it longer.
               In one of these drives we met Major Trenchard. He had been very ill, and his face bore evidence
                  still of suffering, both mental and physical. The separation from Florence had
                  sunk deeper in his heart than his pride would admit; and the more he had reflected
                  since their last interview, the more he was disposed to exonerate her for the
                  decision she had made, and to regard himself as a despicable trifler, very far
                  from the high standard of a man of honor, such as he had once regarded himself. He
                  remembered that he had sought by every means to gain the affection of an innocent
                  young heart, and when secure of his prize had trifled with and wounded that heart
                  in its finest sensibilities, its most delicate sensitiveness, and for what? To
                  minister to the vanity of a vain and ambitious woman, who made use of him only to
                  stir up rivalry in another, whom she sought to win by every scheme and wile at her
                  command. "I have been a fool," he said, "and truly I have had my reward."
               On the day we met he was riding slowly along, thoughtful and absorbed; seeing the
                  Greyton carriage approach, he lifted his hat. At first I think he did not see
                  Florence; but, as I leaned forward to return his bow, he caught a glimpse of her
                  reclining on the cushions, exhausted and with eyes closed. He must have been
                  painfully startled, for she did at that moment look death-like. He asked the
                  coachman to stop a moment; and, coming to the side of the carriage, inquired with
                  much anxiety if she were very ill.
               The voice roused Florence completely. She sat up, the color rising to her face,
                  but without the slightest confusion replied, smiling her old, bright smile, "Oh,
                  no, I am not very ill, only very tired."
               "But you have been ill," he said, and seemed prompted to wonder why he had not
                  been informed of it. Some bitter reflections, however, reminded him probably that
                  he had no right now to be thought of in connection with this pure, pale young
                  creature; he had forfeited all right of recognition even as her friend. There was
                  a certain humility in his tone as he asked if he might see her again,—might have
                  the privilege of calling on her.
               The request was granted in the frank and kindly manner usual with Florence, and we
                  parted.
               But every day now brought added weakness; the drives had to be abandoned; even Sir
                  Robert admitted they were doing her no service.
               "And now, papa," she would say, "only let me be quiet in our own sweet little room
                  with Olive, and you and mamma coming in every little while, and even though a sick
                  girl, I may live with you a long, long time."
               "Well, my love, you shall have it just your own way," said the father, with forced
                  gayety.
               When told that Major Trenchard was coming to call upon his daughter, Sir Robert
                  was at first displeased. He had somehow connected the gentleman with this
                  illness,—in what way he hardly knew himself. However, he laughed off his thoughts,
                  saying, good-humoredly, that he had never altogether liked this major, but it
                  might have been his red coat.
               And so Major Trenchard came. And thereafter, nearly every afternoon an hour before
                  sunset he would be with us. He seemed altogether saddened and crushed, sitting
                  beside Florence the brief time allowed
                  him, scarcely uttering a word. At parting she would speak and smile brightly,
                  giving him her hand. The major's only answer was to raise the thin fingers to his
                  lips and sigh.
               Yet she grew to long for his coming. She had loved him once as she had never loved
                  any one before, as she never now would love any one again. He had been her idol,
                  her ideal, calling forth all the enthusiasm of her nature. The idol was dethroned
                  now utterly; she had learned to look upon her god as a very ordinary mortal,
                  perhaps, but she pitied and loved him still. She felt for his pangs, his
                  disappointment, his weakness, and she would have saved him with her life if she
                  could.
               Arthur had not been heard from since the sad news of his sister's danger had been
                  communicated to him. Of course there were letters coming from him, but none since
                  then. He was moving from place to place; he seemed possessed by a wonderful
                  restlessness, and probably the information had not yet reached him.
               His absence was about the only thing that fretted the invalid. "Oh, if he should
                  not come, Olive! if I should not see him!" was her cry.
               "But you will see him, dear," I would answer, confidently. "I know you will."
               One morning she surprised her father and myself—we were the only persons in the
                  room—by saying, "Papa, I have a strong desire to see Mr. Massarene."
               "Mr. Massarene!" ejaculated Sir Robert, with astonishment.
               "Well, papa, if you have any objections, I will not think of it again. I know you
                  were hardly good friends, but that was so long ago. And he has always been so kind
                  to me. I do want to see him!"
               "And you shall, sweet love. I will go myself and ask him to come. It may be
                  humiliating, but—"
               "But, papa, I will not have you humiliated for my sake."
               "Perhaps, my dear, that is not exactly the word. Rather say I will ennoble myself
                  by admitting my wrong. But this is all a mystery to you, children. Come, I will
                  begin by making a confession."
               "Not a confession!" we said, in a breath.
               Pained at the word, I looked at Sir Robert, struck by a certain change in him,
                  which had not impressed me before. This burly, pleasure-seeking man was becoming
                  strangely humanized and lovable; he was growing every day more like Florence. It
                  seemed as if something of her parting spirit was being breathed into him.
               "Well, girls," he said, laughing, with something like the hearty pleasantry of
                  old, "if you will not listen to a confession perhaps you will to a story, eh? An
                  episode of my young, foolish days.
               "In my young days Massarene and myself were closest friends. We went through
                  college together. We were also near neighbors, which brought us into more intimate
                  association. He was always ahead of me in everything we undertook, and I foolishly
                  fancied that he sometimes assumed a sort of mastery over me; this idea
                  occasionally gave rise to unpleasant feeling between us; too brief at first to mar
                  our friendship perceptibly. However, circumstances at last deepened and darkened
                  this shadow between us. A pretty lass
                  came in our way, with whom we both fell in love,—or imagined we did,—that is, what
                  such youngsters call love.
               "I, of course, the more impetuous of the two, went at the matter in hot haste. She
                  was a true and noble girl, but not in my position in life, and so my young friend
                  Massarene thought fit to bring me to an account, demanding what my intentions
                  were. A quarrel, of course, followed. In my heat and excitement I said many
                  unjustifiable things, and a duel was the result."
               "Oh, papa!"
               "Both were wounded. My wound was, however, very slight; but Massarene bears to-day
                  the marks of that quarrel. You have noticed that he is slightly lame?"
               "Yes, we had both noted that."
               "It was the result of the wound then received. The encounter was an inexcusable
                  one on my side, but it saved your mother, Olive."
               "My mother!" I exclaimed, in astonishment.
               "Yes, your mother; for her sake you owe him much."
               I remembered my grandmother had once said the same thing.
               "And is that the whole story?" we asked.
               "I am not good, I find, at story-telling," said Sir Robert, smiling. "But now you
                  know the true cause of our quarrel. Is not that enough? You can guess the rest,
                  for I have to be in Dublin with Lady Grace a few hours this morning. I shall call
                  at Massarene's on my way, and if he is the noble fellow of old, perhaps he will be
                  up this very morning to visit this spoiled child, this little lady who will play
                  the invalid instead of riding out with her old father."
               We laughed, and Sir Robert went off gayly, as if some secret hope of his child's
                  recovery still animated him.
               He was right about his old friend. Not long after his departure Mr. Massarene
                  himself appeared on the threshold.
               How my heart bounded to meet him as he entered! There was the same noble aspect,
                  the same frank charm of manner that had as children won our love and trust. He
                  leaned heavily on his gold-headed cane, as he walked in with that peculiar halt,
                  which now to me was full of meaning, an added charm and interest.
               "I am so glad to see you, dear Mr. Massarene," said Florence, her eyes beaming as
                  she saw him. "You are so very kind to come."
               "I wanted to see my little girl," he answered, kissing the hand she held out. "You
                  know you are one of my pets."
               "Ah, Mr. Massarene," she replied, while the tears gathered in her beautiful eyes,
                  "I do love you very dearly! But I am so changed,—you did not expect to see me so
                  altered?" she asked, with her usual direct simplicity.
               "Well, no, perhaps not," he answered, with hesitation; "but you know it is a long
                  time since I last saw you. Let me see—how many years—then you were a little
                  romping girl with rosy cheeks and frolicsome spirit; now you are a young lady. We
                  would not expect such boisterous animation and health. I dare say Olive does not
                  think you much changed."
               
               Florence smiled. "Ah, you cannot deceive me," was her quiet comment.
               I saw that with all Mr. Massarene's tact he could ill conceal the shock he had
                  experienced on first seeing her. He had been told she was ill, but had not
                  expected to find so great an alteration. He drew a chair beside her, still
                  continuing to caress her soft hand.
               "Dear child," he repeated, "you are very dear to me. What can I do for you?"
               "Come here, Olive; bring your chair close; let us all be near together. You love
                  Olive, too, don't you, Mr. Massarene?"
               I thought he started. Perhaps he misunderstood the simple frankness which dictated
                  the question. A feeling of pride rose within me; he should not be obliged in
                  deference to my feelings to assert a sentiment he did not feel. I was about to
                  speak, when he laid his hand upon mine, and said, promptly, "I do love her with
                  all my heart. You know this, Olive, do you not?" his eyes beamed on me kindly and
                  tenderly as he spoke, and made me ashamed of my misgivings.
               "Then, Mr. Massarene, you will see to Olive,—you will cherish her, will you not?
                  This is what I want to see you about. Papa would always care for Olive, I know,
                  and so would mamma; but in time to come,—when I am gone,—there will be some one in
                  this house whom Olive would not wish to be with. I want you to tell me, dear
                  friend, that she will have a home with you, and then I will be content."
               None of us now could refrain from tears, even Florence shed some. Dear,
                  disinterested girl! even I, who knew her so well, had not fathomed the depth of
                  her love and solicitude.
               It was some minutes before Mr. Massarene could reply. Presently he said, with the
                  utmost solemnity, "Florence, I accept this sacred charge you give me, and thank
                  you for honoring me with such a trust;" and turning to me, he added, "Will you,
                  Olive, accept my fostering care?"
               I could only sob out my gratitude, and hastened from the room to try and master my
                  emotion.
               Florence was much fatigued after this interview. I begged her to lie down and
                  rest, and she submitted quietly, as usual. She lay long, and apparently rested
                  sweetly. Sir Robert and Lady Grace returning, were cheered and hopeful to find her
                  in so tranquil a sleep, and left to dine.
               On awaking, she asked to be placed in her favorite chair at the window. The air
                  was tranquil and pleasant; it was twilight,—the long twilight evening of the early
                  days of May, when in our climate the light is serenely clear as though the sun yet
                  lingered above the horizon.
               "This is the hour I love, Olive," said the invalid. "In such an hour I would like
                  to depart—if I could but see Arthur before I go."
               I could never altogether command myself when she talked of death, and now she
                  chided my tears.
               "Let me, Olive sweet, speak of it. It is not so fearful as you think, and I feel
                  more composed and better when I talk about it. When the good Dean visits me,—and I
                  have no doubt he talks very right and proper,—I have such a shivering dread; but
                     with you, Olive, it is just as I am
                  every day when I am awake and when I sleep—as if some dear, loving Something was
                  coaxing, caressing, urging me not to fear. What can it be, Olive?"
               "Maybe, dear, it comes from the good angels."
               "So I think, Olive. You know I was always weak about these things, believing
                  easily."
               "Not that, Florence. You were ever such an angel yourself, you may have had such
                  influences about you, and felt them as others would not. You know, dear," I added,
                  as she remained silent, "this is not flattery. I was never given to that."
               "I understand, sweet sister; this is not the hour for such mockery. You have ever
                  been true and faithful to me. I have never been tempted as others are. I have
                  loved every one, and every one has loved me. 
                     I
                     It
                   is only lately I have learned some of life's darker phases, and I do not
                  regret the experience, for life to me has now a much broader meaning, and I
                  sometimes am sad that, when its many duties and needs are opening before me, I
                  must go away. There is so much to do, and I have done so little, Olive, so
                  little."
               I saw that she was much excited; her eyes sparkled with unusual brilliancy, her
                  cheeks were tinged with color. She was evidently feverish, and I urged her gently
                  to rest, not to fatigue herself with further conversation.
               "Oh, let me talk a little," she pleaded,—"there is no time to lose! I want to
                  speak of Arthur. I wish I could say all I feel. And were I leaving him with you,
                  Olive, as I used sometimes to dream might be, I should be happy, happy indeed. You
                  would have done him so much good, have brought forth all his noble qualities—are
                  you listening, Olive darling? I did not mean to grieve you,—but that other who has
                  chosen Arthur, but whom he would never have chosen—dearest, I cannot help it—I
                  wish so much it had been otherwise, and I pity Arthur so much."
               "It is all for the best, Florence," I said. "Arthur needs a wife in his own
                  position. But now let me tell you what I have never told another, scarcely
                  whispered to myself. I have loved Arthur, Florence. Why should I not
                  own it? Long and deeply, with sorrow and bitterness of spirit, I have loved him;
                  but it is over now."
               She threw her arms around me and kissed me. That sweet, silent sympathy was a balm
                  to my heart. I felt stronger, more courageous. "Yes," I said, inwardly, "it
                     is over. I will henceforth throw the infatuation from me."
               We sat silently for some time, Florence leaning back in her cushioned chair, her
                  eyes closed, her countenance peaceful. How lovely and child-like that face
                  appeared now when it was about to pass from my sight forever! Framed in its mass
                  of golden hair, subdued, spirituelle, with its infantile purity of expression
                  unmarred by contact with the world and worldly things, it seemed already beaming
                  with light from another world.
               I sighed as I gazed. She opened her eyes and smiled.
               "Now, Olive," she said, "traitorous Olive, I will have you smile and be happy,
                  and, behold, you disobey as soon as I take my eyes away. Why, I am so favored, I suffer so little. It is only this
                  cough that teases me at times." She raised her handkerchief to her lips. I saw
                  that there was blood upon it. Terribly alarmed, I rang the bell vehemently.
               "Be calm, Olive," she said, as I ran to support her, while the life-stream seemed
                  oozing slowly from her lips. "You must not be frightened now, if I am going away.
                  Sister, I hear wheels," she said. How keen her senses were! I heard
                  nothing.
               In a few moments the family were all gathered in the room, and, to my
                  astonishment, Arthur entered with the rest. She saw him, a glance of infinite love
                  shone from her eyes upon him as, rushing forward, he clasped his sister in his
                  arms. She clung to him a moment, then lay back exhausted upon her pillows.
                  "Olive!" I heard her murmur, "Olive!"
               "Love, dearest love, what shall I do?" I cried, laying my head near
                  hers. She threw her arms about my neck, and in the effort the tide of life ebbed
                  forever.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               THE UPRISING.
               OF the desolation at the Hall, the gloom which enshrouded the household, no words
                  can give an idea. Its light, its hope, its pride was gone, desolation and complete
                  abandonment to grief followed. The blow so long expected had fallen at last, but
                  with such final suddenness that none could say they were prepared for it.
               But so it ever is. No one, perhaps, is ever quite prepared for that last shock of
                  separation. We fancy that if a little more time were given us, if it were
                  permitted to come more gently upon us, we should more gracefully accept the fact,
                  but in this undoubtedly we deceive ourselves. We are never ready for Death.
               As for myself, I was utterly prostrated. Lifeless and helpless I lay on the bed
                  where they carried, me when the arms of the dying girl relaxed their clasp about
                  my neck. I could bear no word of comfort, I could listen to no consolation,
                  closing my heart against it as with impenetrable bars. I could only cry in my
                  anguish, "Florence! Florence!"
               I remember trying to reason with myself, to shame myself. Why should I add to the
                  misery of those so sorely stricken? Why should I not help rather to strengthen and
                  comfort them? I did try. I endeavored to rise and do something, but it was only to
                  fall back helpless on the couch.
               Indeed, I was really ill. The doctor was sent for. He ordered strengthening food;
                  I must be compelled to eat something. Then Sir Robert came; his stricken face, his
                  bowed frame, renewed my grief. "Oh, it is selfish of me to distress you thus!" I
                  cried. "But I cannot help it! I cannot help it!"
               He kissed my forehead and stroked my aching head. "Poor child!" he said.
               They took me to have a last look at Florence, as she lay enshrouded in her white
                  robe and covered with fragrant white lilies. I fell back in the arms of those who bore me. Ah, surely to none was the
                  loss so great as to me! She was my all. Never separated, thinking alike, loving
                  alike, with kindred tastes and feelings, we had grown together as one.
               How long I lay I know not; it might have been days, it might have been weeks. A
                  dim unconsciousness hung over my faculties, a deathly weakness prostrated my
                  nerves, a strange paralysis of will not to be shaken off. At times I heard vaguely
                  the voice of Lady Grace; I caught with an intolerable shudder the voice of
                  Adele.
               While I lay there helpless, a care and a trial, the one whom I despised, the one
                  whom in my fevered imagination I blamed as the cause of all this, had made herself
                     invaluable,—she had been the prop and support of the
                  whole-household. I had been only an added burden. Energetic, clear-headed, she
                  thought of everything, attended to everything. She comforted Lady Grace, she wept
                  with Sir Robert. "How could we live without her?" Lady Grace would say to her son.
                  "Oh, Arthur, in this fearful loneliness, what a blessing it would be to have her
                  always near us!"
               "And you shall have it so," he answered, with a broken voice. "Mother, I will do
                  all that man can do to help and comfort you."
               I heard these whispered words as I lay stupid, unthinking, conscious of but one
                  thought, of one fearful, crushing weight. A slow, burning fever was consuming
                  me.
               One day I was startled from my deadly stupor by a wild sound of lamentation. Letty
                  stood at my bedside weeping and wringing her hands.
               "Oh, Miss Olive! Miss Olive, won't ye listen?" she cried. "Oh, they're killing
                  them all, the Lord save us! Poor Master Walter and your own father, Miss
                  Olive!"
               All this went through my head like some distant, confused murmur. I heard it all,
                  I comprehended its meaning, but it did not seem to belong to me.
               At last hearing it repeated again and again with various changes, my weary senses
                  began to rouse to its import. I listened, painfully and with effort.
               "Oh, Miss Olive! It's worse and worse! They're murdering every one!" Another loud
                  outbreak of lamentation.
               I remember giving a deep, quivering sigh. I remember a sharp, short spasm of pain
                  that seemed to reach my very heart; then with struggle, with powerful effort, as
                  though lifting myself through some dead, dark solidity, I sat up suddenly in the
                  bed, looking with wild, uncertain gaze at Letty's tear-stained face and terrified
                  aspect.
               For a few brief moments I was confused and bewildered, but only for a few moments.
                  Memory returned with its heavy burden, and, as when we awaken from some fearful
                  nightmare the heart still trembles and the terror remains, so I recalled all that
                  had passed, and shuddered to take up again the burden of life.
               "Oh, Letty," I cried, "I know it all now!—she's gone! she's gone!"
               "In heaven's rest be her soul," said Letty, devoutly crossing herself. "My sainted
                  young mistress! But it is not of her, Miss Olive, this trouble is in my heart."
                  And then by degrees I heard Letty's story, and, making allowance for all the
                  rumors that were afloat, I gathered for
                  a certainty that the rebellion had actually broken out.
               My head whirled with the excitement this news wrought in me. I felt as if I must
                  shake off this benumbing weakness, get out into the fresh air and the great world,
                  and take part in the stirring events transpiring. But the good housekeeper, Mrs.
                  O'Neil, laid her motherly hand upon my hot forehead, and wisely gave me a
                  composing draught, assuring me that if I would be quiet I should know
                  everything.
               Strange as it may seem, there were no serious consequences from this rough
                  awakening, rather the reverse. My thoughts were directed from their morbid
                  melancholy to a more active distress. The new and painful anxiety, the dread
                  anticipations, were of a nature less wearing than the intense, self-concentrated
                  woe that was destroying me.
               I had not heard from either my father or Walter since I parted from them on the
                  road on the morning of his escape. The times were full of peril, of excitement, of
                  portentous meaning. For many nights there had been fires burning on the mountains
                  of Wicklow; by many it was feared these indicated some belligerent purpose, but
                  others scouted the thought. Were not the government troops numerous and vigilant
                  in the neighborhood? were not the poor, unarmed people utterly cowed? Still, the
                  rumor went whispering round that stealthy steps wandered over these mountains in
                  the dead of night, that men were searching in these fastnesses for their concealed
                  weapons. Suspicion, danger, keen interest, were all astir while I had been
                  sleeping.
               True, these were poor men, these uneasy, disaffected spirits,—they were men who
                  had never seen battle; their arms were only old blunderbusses and pikes, or rusty
                  bayonets,—anything they could gather in the shape of weapons; but the government
                  feared them, the government watched them. They were strong of arm and firm of
                  purpose, for oppression and wrong had made them desperate, and in some almost
                  stifled their natural kindliness, their very humanity.
               A wide-spread plot had been discovered, which was to have been the signal of a
                  general uprising. The city of Dublin was to have been attacked, and a general
                  warfare was to have been inaugurated. This plot had been discovered in time to
                  defeat all the plans of the rebel leaders; but true to their pledge, in more
                  distant places the gathering had commenced. They could not retreat: their blood
                  was up; and the green flag of their country floated over many a wild hill-top and
                  lonely gorge where they held secret rendezvous.
               In some of the counties there had been skirmishing between the people and the
                  troops; still, there was as yet little real alarm. It was thought to be but a
                  question of a few hours; it would soon be over. But each day brought accounts of
                  fresh outbreaks. Towns had been attacked and barracks burned, some fearful acts of
                  retribution had been committed. So far the rebels had been successful. It was
                  admitted there must be some excellent leaders among them.
               Consternation spread everywhere; the apparent defeat of the plot against Dublin
                  grew less and less matter of congratulation; it seemed to have imbittered the
                  rural districts to frenzy; everywhere the insurgents gathered strength daily. The quiet agricultural
                  district of Wexford, to which we were in close proximity, was now in arms. Farmers
                  had left their plows, and laborers their seed-sowing, to join the
                  insurrectionists. People reasoned that if the prosperous and orderly men of
                  Wexford had risen, there must be good cause for it, and the rebellion must be
                  gathering numbers, and in prospect of successful issue.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXX.
               WAR AND RUMORS OF WAR.
               AT the Hall there was much consternation. Lady Grace, though a woman of strong
                  nerve, had been so shaken by her recent affliction, that her usual immobility was
                  giving way. She grew ill and exacting, excited and fretful. She was constantly
                  urging Sir Robert to fly to England, and was in terror of her own servants and all
                  about the place. It was said she never left her room, save when accompanied by
                  Adele and Arthur.
               Sir Robert, however, could not be induced to leave the Hall. "They may burn the
                  place over my head," he remarked, "but they will never touch me."
               This confidence, however, did not ease his wife. She talked of dismissing all the
                  servants and sending to England for others. "They will poison us, they will betray
                  us," said her ladyship; "my life, all our lives, will be sacrificed."
               Hearing of these suspicions somehow gave me pain. Perhaps Lady Grace included me
                  also in this general condemnation. She had not visited my room in some time,—not
                  at all since I had returned to consciousness. I felt hurt; I felt that I had
                  better leave. Now that this thought had taken hold of me, it pursued me still—Lady
                  Grace is afraid of me.
               There was no one at the Hall now who needed me. Of Arthur I saw and heard nothing,
                  save that he and Miss Adele were always together. Sometimes, as I sat at my
                  window, I had seen the two walking slowly in the bordering paths of the park, she
                  leaning on his arm.
               How completely deserted I felt! The love of my lost Florence had seemed to fill
                  all the world for me; it had been father, mother, sister, friend. And now I was
                  alone; such a loneliness that life almost stood still in its calm.
               Every day, until I showed signs of recovery, Sir Robert, I was told, had come in
                  and sat by my bedside for an hour or more; but the past few days of accumulated
                  anxiety and trouble had overwhelmed him; he sat moody and silent in his chair.
               The fears and lamentations of Lady Grace seemed to fret him; he sometimes replied
                  impatiently; otherwise, since the death of Florence, the hale and genial Sir
                  Robert had grown subdued and strangely quiet.
               The growing feeling that I was not wanted haunted me continually, and a wild
                  desire to go somewhere, anywhere away from the Hall, possessed me beyond control.
                  I was still so weak that I could hardly walk, but I exerted myself to get down to
                  the lodge. I found everything there still as my grandmother had left it, no one having been appointed to
                  fill her place; the boy and girl as usual attending the gate.
               Another strange infatuation had also possessed me during my illness; and from this
                  infatuation I desired by every effort of will, by every possible chance of change,
                  to free myself. I had a nervous dread of seeing Adele, or rather of having her
                  come to see me. I felt that if she did so, I could take no refuge in subterfuge, I
                  must tell her all that was on my mind.
               Harassed and wretched, I listened to every footstep, and glanced up with fear and
                  trembling every time the door was opened. I did not want to tell her the thought
                  that burdened me beyond endurance. I did not want to avow that I knew her for what
                  she was,—the murderess of Florence; but I might not be able to control myself.
                  Doubtless my mind was diseased, weak and sick as was my body—but I felt that my
                  only escape from this dire necessity was to leave the house. I must get away from
                  her at once and forever. I did not stop to reflect that in her own breast was a
                  monitor which might some time prove as faithful as I dreaded to find myself.
               So, gathering up a few things, I announced to Letty that I was going to the lodge,
                  and that I should not be back very soon.
               "When are you going, Miss Olive?"
               "Now, this very evening."
               "This evening!" she exclaimed. "Why, you are scarcely able to walk across the
                  floor!"
               But I went. So urgent had become the feeling to get away from my old home, that it
                  admitted of no longer delay.
               I left a note for Sir Robert and his lady, expressing my deep gratitude for the
                  kindness and care they had extended to me all my life, but stating that I now felt
                  I must depend upon myself, though I would not take any step without their
                  concurrence. Then directing Letty how to arrange my little matters, and what to
                  bring me at the lodge, I set forth alone, much to Letty's disturbance, who begged
                  that she might accompany me. "You will surely fall, Miss Olive," she said, "if you
                  have no one to lean on."
               But I did not want to lean on any one; I desired to test my strength, to rouse
                  myself to exertion.
               I took the back road leading to the lodge. Passing out of the garden-gate, and
                  through a shaded path overhung with vines and bordered by sweet shrubs, I reached
                  the lane. Everything was silent about the place; every laborer on the grounds, the
                  moment he was released, was off to some rendezvous to hear the news and what had
                  been going on during the day. For although this was reputed a loyalist family, and
                  as a matter of course those in their employ were supposed to be of the same
                  tendency, yet the servitors of Greyton Hall sympathized secretly, heart and soul,
                  with the rebellion. Indeed, it was a trial for any Irishman to do otherwise, and
                  even to Sir Robert it was no easy task to maintain his long-held position of
                  fealty to a government so strangely ill-advised in its management, so cruelly and
                  grossly ignorant of the needs and distress of his native land.
               So I encountered no one on my way, and in the calm of this secluded walk I gained
                  strength with every step. I reached the lodge glad as a child who had come home after long absence, yet weeping as
                  I entered the familiar little parlor and sat down in my grandmother's
                  leather-backed chair. Renewed courage, renewed hopefulness, came to me as I wept;
                  I had made a great effort: had shaken off a terrible incubus. It seemed as if the
                  quaint little apartment was peopled with those I loved, as if Florence were near
                  me, and in the blessed illusion I held out my arms as if to clasp her to me.
               Betty came in, and was overjoyed to see me. "An' will ye stay here, miss, and
                  forever?" she cried, with real welcome.
               I had her throw open all the doors and windows. The vines drooped through the open
                  casement, and the high bushes laden with roses scattered their bloom over the
                  floor as the sash was raised.
               Such an exuberant spring and early summer this had been! The climate of Ireland is
                  always balmy and delicious, yet this season was remarked by all as having
                  surpassed itself; the skies were cloudless, and leaf and flower had put forth
                  their richest abundance. Nature had worked here her perfect work, as if to soften
                  man's spirit, to touch him to kindlier emotions, to better sympathies. Alas, she
                  expended her sweets in vain!
               The fierce fight was still going on. Proclamations were being issued from the
                  capital which even made the more thoughtful of the loyalist party shudder with
                  horror. It was to be a war of extermination. No quarter was to be given, and those
                  taken alive were to be executed on the spot.
               Still, the insurgents were unyielding. In most instances they were successful in
                  the skirmishes which took place, and great numbers of the government officers cers
                  and men were wounded or killed. The matter was growing serious; it was evident
                  that a great decisive battle must soon be fought.
               Repeated engagements, the troops driving the rebels from one point to another,
                  gradually brought the terrible scene of warfare close upon us. The troops at
                  Arklow, with their numerous garrison, were threatened; large reinforcements had
                  been sent to this quarter, and the troops were ordered at all risks to meet the
                  insurgents and arrest their progress.
               The whole county of Wexford was in the hands of the people, and in their repeated
                  victories the rebels had gained large stores of ammunition and fire-arms; yet,
                  after all, it was doubtful whether they would be able to cope with the skilled and
                  disciplined regular troops. More than courage, more even than indignant sense of
                  outrage and burning desire for revenge, is needed to supply the sinews of war.
               Some days passed, and I heard nothing from the Hall. I was not surprised at this.
                  The consternation of the household, the illness of Lady Grace, the disconsolate
                  quiescence of its master, left little room for outer interest. I would have gone
                  up to the house myself, knowing the excitement and terror that must reign there.
                  But what could I do? No one wanted me; no one inquired for me; only Sir Robert, I
                  thought, would care to see me, and my presence would only add to the
                  confusion.
               From Betty I was hearing all that was going on. The success of the insurgents was
                  bringing them nearer and nearer. I could see their watch-fires through the night
                  among the hills. The government troops had been defeated at Arklow, were ordered back,
                  reinforced, and were to make another decided stand against the enemy.
               Day after day, at this time, troops from the capital came marching by with their
                  heavy pieces of artillery; whose rumbling, unwieldy strength shook the earth.
               But nothing daunted, the insurgents prepared for the issue; their leaders would
                  not allow their enthusiasm to cool, and on the eve of the expected conflict there
                  was busy stir of preparation. Entrenchments were being hastily thrown up around
                  the encampment; sentinels were stationed, and advanced guards were constantly on
                  the watch. Over twenty thousand men were ready on that night to march forward at a
                  moment's notice.
               But, alas! how inadequate the means to the end! These men were poorly equipped;
                  perhaps not one-quarter of them were provided with fire-arms. They had but few
                  cannon, and, compared with the resources of their enemies, were pitifully scant of
                  ammunition. Many had only pikes wherewith to defend themselves, but their
                  patriotic ardor was unquenchable. They shouted for victory and the Republic of
                  Ireland, and, inspired with the new-born sense of liberty, thousands of voices
                  joined in the chorus of "Erin mavourneen, Erin go bragh!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               THE BATTLE.
               THE final battle had yet to be fought which was to decide the fate of the nation.
                  The insurgent forces had been in active operation some weeks, and during that time
                  had been singularly successful; daily recruits were strengthening their numbers,
                  while that wild enthusiasm which had marked their early efforts was fast giving
                  way to calmer, more deliberate judgments. There were cool, strong heads among them
                  as their leaders—strong in the power of their own resources; and this was
                  beginning to be felt and understood in high places; it was not a mere rabble they
                  had to deal with, ready for change or excitement, or to fight for the love of
                  fighting, but men sacrificing all, suffering all, in their daily pains and
                  privations, and willing still to suffer in the strength and intensity of a high
                  and noble resolve.
               At the first outbreak of hostilities the authorities had looked upon this uprising
                  as a mere mob-fight that could be quelled by one sanguinary stroke. It had
                  commenced in an obscure place, and among an obscure people. Apparently the great
                  body of the influential masses, whom they had most feared, were either indifferent
                  about this movement, or else overawed by the immense preparations that had been
                  making to suppress it, for they made no motion that could be perceived. But time revealed to the government its
                  grave mistake. This was no insignificant matter. There had been several encounters
                  between the military and insurgents, and the latter, most unexpectedly, had come
                  off victorious. It was but a few days previous that a numerous detachment of
                  troops, headed by their colonel, had been surprised and totally routed, their
                  commander slain, cannon, arms, and ammunition captured, and the whole body obliged
                  to fly for safety to the town they had just left.
               And now the rebels, elated by their victory, and strengthened by the ammunition
                  and arms they had captured, were in full force on the heights, near Gorey, in
                  sight of their recent triumph. Something must be done, and that at once, to stop
                  their further progress, and also to recover the lost prestige of British
                  invincibility. And, indeed, there was danger of the whole country being laid open
                  to the rebels, so unbounded was the joy—but ill-concealed—at their success
                  beginning to be manifested in every direction.
               The government made no delay; a hasty council of war was held, when it was
                  determined to immediately concentrate all available forces within reach, and by
                  one grand stroke give the final blow.
               In fulfillment of this determination, over thirteen thousand of their best
                  troops,—men of endurance, men inured to war, well disciplined, who made fighting
                  their trade, their glory,—with plenty of ammunition, cannon, arms, and all the
                  machinery of destruction in complete order, marched on the eve of this fatal
                  twenty-first of June, 1798, to take position on the plains beneath the heights on
                  which were stationed these scores of hardy, undisciplined men, ready in the
                  impatience of their glowing enthusiasm to meet any foe, any number of foes, not
                  stopping to reflect on the vast odds, the fearful, damaging odds, that existed
                  between themselves and their enemies.
               Where were their skilled marksmen, their men of endurance, of discipline, well
                  used to all the sights and horrors of their bloody work? Where were their
                  materials to work with, even though they had been thus skilled? Arms and
                  ammunition were wanting; their meagre supplies were only obtainable with
                  difficulty and secrecy; every outward circumstance was against them. But they had
                  a united purpose. This stood them for much,—they were striving for a principle,
                  for freedom—for their very manhood—to prove themselves, to throw off that incubus
                  that was crushing them below themselves. For this they would fight. If they could
                  not win it, they could die.
               Thus sanguine and determined in their resolutions, the great body could look down
                  on the gathering masses below them without fear. Their position was invaluable,—it
                  commanded the approaches of the advancing enemy; and on they worked with great
                  spirit, strengthening their defenses until far on in the night, when from absolute
                  exhaustion all that might threw themselves on the ground to seek a few hours'
                  rest.
               But there were those there, who, while partaking of this enthusiasm, these hopes,
                  these unbounded desires, yet comprehended the difficulties, the full
                  responsibility of that which was before them; and sitting by the watch-fires
                  through the still hours of that eventful night their thoughts were filled with
                  anxious, sad forebodings.
               
               What though they did overcome this tremendous opposing foe,—how much was yet to be
                  done, even were there a Washington of the old world, as there was a Washington of
                  the new, to lead them on their march of triumph with all the serene grandeur of an
                  unselfish patriotism!
               As they looked round on that mighty mass of restless, intrepid, determined men,
                  they knew that but one desire, one ardent longing, pulsated in every heart; but
                  that desire accomplished, how might it be? How were all these ambitions, these
                  aspirations, to be satisfied? Simple patriotism animated all now, but how complex
                  the problems following upon success!
               So were there also those on that dark plain beneath who had their doubts and
                  misgivings. They had watched carefully the activity of those who held the height;
                  they had seen by the flickering glare of the watch-fires, and through the
                  gathering shades of night, the indefatigable leaders riding through their ranks
                  amid approving shouts and loud hurrahs. Such foes, so full of life and fire and
                  energy, might prove truly invincible—a rush, a dash, and legions might be
                  overcome; watchful and wary they must be, and even then they knew not what would
                  be the end of all this.
               But the morning rose brightly, fair, soft and summer-like; a busy hum pervaded the
                  atmosphere; all were alive, gloomy forebodings had vanished with the night, and
                  hope and expectation rose high with the advancing sun. The insurgents had resolved
                  to await the attack.
               And now the long lines of British soldiery, mounted and on foot, began to move
                  forward, their bright scarlet uniforms and well-polished weapons glittering in the
                  sun. On they came, silent and firm, these men of iron muscle. The loud command of
                  the mounted leaders, or the rattle of the artillery over the uneven ground, the
                  tramp of men and horse, broke the stillness as onward and upward still they moved.
                  They could now see the hard, resolute faces of those who stood ready to receive
                  them (but who dare not yet waste their fire), with the green flag of their country
                  floating high above. But no more they saw. On came the rush, with the cries of the
                  fallen, the sharp crack of the musketry, the roar of the cannon, the shouts of the
                  commanders, "On to the front! more to the front!" their answering legions only to
                  be hewn down like the rest.
               Oh! unholy war! thou stifler of all that is generous and merciful within us! thou
                  promoter and instigator of all that is evil,—merging the man in the brute, till
                  that which began in a high resolve ends in the fury of maddening hate! The pain,
                  the torture, the hot blood urges on the animal instincts of cruelty and vengeance.
                  No quarter was asked, none was given,—to the death they fought.
               And still over the heaps of their dead comrades these trained veterans moved on;
                  but now no powder flashed across their faces, no whizzing ball flew by their ears;
                  even the cannon's roar had ceased, but the pike, the bludgeon, the strong arm,
                  were there to meet them as they ascended. Yet what were these against the fresh
                  relays of troops pouring in? Ammunition exhausted, ranks decimated, they were at
                  last compelled to retreat, so that when the victors finally reached the heights
                  there remained to meet them only the heaps of slain. All who survived the fight
                  had fled to the mountains. Still in hot
                  pursuit, the troops followed; but once in their fastnesses those that knew them
                  well were able to make good their escape.
               Fearful, sickening was the suspense on that dreadful day. I could hear the sullen
                  boom of the cannon, hour after hour, and every sound brought with it the horror of
                  death and suffering. Oh! my poor father and Walter! I knew they were there. Oh!
                  this agonizing suspense; at one moment hope, the next despair!
               I went out into the grounds, through the outhouses, the fields; not a living
                  creature was to be seen,—all were gone. I returned to the cottage, and straining
                  my eyes up and down the road kept incessant watch, and if a chance wanderer came
                  near I rushed to him to beg for some word, some news of the contest; but none knew
                  aught, like me they were stunned and bewildered.
               The day which, in its early rising, had been clear and sunny, closed dark and
                  cloudy. A heavy mist was falling. I suppose this added to my despair; a terrible
                  longing came over me. I would go to the battle-field; I must search for them; I
                  might save them yet. Would not Walter do this for me? Yes, and a thousand times
                  more for me and for my poor father.
               No sooner had I resolved on this than I told Betty. "Oh Lord, miss, go among the
                  dead people?" was her cry.
               "And you will go with me?"
               "No, no, it would kill me; I would die first."
               "Then I will go alone," I said.
               But Betty's tender heart could not bear that; she would accompany me. "And we may
                  be of use—and how strong it will make us feel," I urged, "if we can, even with a
                  drop of water, relieve some poor sufferer; and you will not be frightened,—I know
                  you will not,—when you are doing such a good work, Betty."
               Quickly we traversed the lonely road. I felt no fatigue or terror as we hurried
                  on, urged by an impelling force which made us forget ourselves.
               The terrible details of that night, the weary search among the dead and dying, are
                  too painful to dwell upon. Many besides ourselves were there on a similar errand,
                  silently, or with suppressed sighs, searching for their loved ones. Little was
                  there upon that battle-field to tempt cupidity; many of those who had fallen were
                  in their peasant dress, poor men, who had left their cottages, or their
                  field-work, that very morning to swell the ranks of the insurgents.
               Those whom we were seeking were not there, but one we had not looked for was. As
                  we were about relinquishing our hopeless task, and turning wearily from the
                  search, I saw a body lying somewhat in advance of a heap of slain who had
                  evidently fallen in defending the flag which still fluttered above them, its
                  standard erect. I thought I knew the great shock head, as, holding my lantern low
                  to the ground, I approached. The face was downward. We gently turned the body, and
                  there lay poor Tim. Alas, poor Tim!
               He was still alive. We bathed the face and hands, all clotted with blood; we gave
                  him a little wine. He revived, he opened his eyes. I bent over him and whispered,
                  "Do you know me, Tim?" There was no reply. I repeated the question, whispering it
                  as I smoothed away the hair from his forehead. A gleam of intelligence passed over the white face: he
                  recognized the voice. "Miss Olive!" he said feebly, "God forever bless you."
               "What can I do for you, Tim, anything on earth?" I said, much affected. "Tell me,
                  Tim."
               He shook his head, pressing his hand upon his breast; a torrent of blood flowed
                  from his lips. I thought for a moment that he was gone; but, lifting him up, we
                  moistened his lips with wine, and he rallied.
               The short night was now passing into day, and the dawn lit up gently the face of
                  poor Tim. He looked directly at me, a wild gleam in his eye.
               "Miss Olive, by jabers, the boys done well! Now at them!" he cried, exultantly.
                  "Where is it?" groping about him as if for the old fife. There, sure enough, it
                  lay on the blood-wet grass beneath him. "Now, boys, to the charge!" and putting
                  the fife to his lips, he sent forth a shrill and wailing peal. It was the last;
                  the well-worn instrument fell from his lips, his head sunk back on Betty's
                  shoulder. "Master Walter!" he muttered.
               "Oh, Tim," I cried, "tell me of him. Where is he? Where is my father?"
               He strove to speak, but could not; a gurgling sound came from his lips, he pointed
                  as if afar off, a spasm passed over his face, and a strange silence followed. Tim
                  had passed away. With all his wild, untutored enthusiasm, his native genius, his
                  good heart, Tim had served his country to his very best ability, and I wept as we
                  laid him carefully down, straightened the limbs and smoothed the wan face. He
                  looked placid, almost smiling; for him the battle was over.
               I had overtaxed my strength, and the next day lay, through many weary hours, in
                  the stupor which follows intense exhaustion. Towards night, Betty insisted that I
                  should have some tea. It was a lonely meal, and when it was removed I sat in the
                  window looking out through the shadowy twilight across the open lawn towards the
                  old Hall; from here the grand portico, with its great granite pillars, was
                  distinctly seen, unobstructed by leafy avenue and branching shade-tree. The dream
                  of my childhood came back to me as I looked; the day-dream, when its distant
                  grandeur had loomed through my grandmother's lattice, unapproachable, splendid as
                  a vision. I had looked in the face of my dream since then, and its glory had
                  vanished in sadness and tears.
               In these months, as I have stated, twilight with us almost merges into night, and
                  I sat absorbed, watching the changing light, and growing soothed and calm in the
                  serene atmosphere about us. Presently I saw a form approaching; it came nearer; I
                  recognized it now with a beating heart, the tall, slight figure, the graceful
                  motions were not unfamiliar to my eyes. Could it be that Arthur was coming to the
                  lodge?
               In a few moments he had opened the door and stood before me unannounced.
               "I have come to say good-by, Olive," he said, holding out his hand, "and to tell
                  you something more. You know you have been so long my sister, that I owe you this
                  much—this much of confidence."
               He spoke all this hurriedly, as if it had been a lesson conned over before he
                  entered. The manner wounded me, but it also gave me unusual self-possession. I pointed to a chair, saying, as he
                  seated himself, "Ah, you are going to leave, then?"
               "Yes, we are leaving for London; my poor mother's nerves are so perfectly unstrung
                  by all that has happened, and by the present excitement, that she fears her mind
                  will become utterly unhinged if she remains. My father will not accompany her, so
                  I must do so. Adele will be with us."
               "Of course," I said coolly, and added, "it is the best thing you can do, Arthur;
                  you ought to go. Shall I not see Lady Grace before she leaves?"
               "I fear not; we start at midnight."
               "Then give her my dearest, kindest love, Arthur. And pray, what is that other
                  something you were to tell me?" I said, after a long pause, dreading, yet knowing
                  what was coming.
               "Adele and myself are—engaged to be married."
               He uttered the words with apparent difficulty, wiping the perspiration from his
                  forehead as he continued, in a low voice, "I have told my mother, I have told
                  Adele, that I must inform you of this myself."
               I was glad that the shadows closed so darkly around us. A clearer light might have
                  revealed the blanched face, the falling tears, with which I listened. I had looked
                  for it, but the realization was sore. It seemed to be another severing from home,
                  and Florence, and all that was left me of youth and happiness.
               I said, however, with apparent calmness, "I had expected this."
               "Had you? Still I do not hear a word of congratulation." Then speaking in a quick,
                  hard tone, he added, "It is hard, when one has done a thing which will affect
                  their whole life, very hard when those we love hear of it coldly, and have not a
                  word of cheer."
               Almost forgetting my imposed restraint, I cried, impulsively, "Oh, Arthur, you
                  must know how much I would rejoice in your happiness."
               He drew a little closer to me as he said, "Yes, Olive, we have been very dear
                  friends; I know well your many fine qualities, and if you had not so—so"—he
                  stopped.
               "So what?" I asked.
               "So deceived me."
               Should I now tell him all I knew? Vindicate myself in his eyes at once and
                  forever, and chill, at one blow, the hopes of the expectant bride? It was a strong
                  temptation, but I resisted it. I knew that I would be destroying the hopes of his
                  mother, the expectations of his father, whom I loved as my own, and whose ancient
                  name would be sullied by an alliance between his only son and a peasant girl; an
                  alliance whose effect that son would not, in all his life, have manliness or
                  strength to overcome. My sense of right triumphed; I refrained my lips from
                  speaking; but it was a struggle. Henceforth he would live on with a mistaken, a
                  miserably mistaken conception of my character. I should be remembered only as a
                  deceiver, while the real criminal sat by his side triumphant. I only answered, "I
                  never purposely deceived you, my dear friend."
               He saw that I was deeply affected; he urged no more that I should congratulate
                  him, but said, in a low, agitated voice,—
               "Would Florence have liked what I have done?"
               
               I could not even answer this question. My lips were sealed. Perhaps he was
                  satisfied that it should be so, or feared the result of any communicativeness on
                  my part. He rose to depart, but lingered still a moment.
               "You will be lonely here," he said.
               His feelings, for the moment, seemed getting the mastery of him; but I answered
                  cheerfully,—
               "Not at all. When you are all away, I shall be a great part of the time with Sir
                  Robert at the Hall."
               "That's a good girl." He had still something more to say, it appeared. He took my
                  hand in his. "Do you know that Walter has made himself quite famous in these
                  disastrous skirmishes we have had? He is a noble fellow. There is none other in
                  the world to whom I would resign you, Olive. Would to God it were not so hard—so
                  hard."
               His voice quivered. He grasped my hand, in a long, lingering clasp, till it
                  thrilled with the pressure, then suddenly dropping it, he was gone.
               And I was alone. In all the world, where could I look for protection? Oh, it is
                  hard to feel like some stray, forgotten thing, with no one to love, no one to care
                  for! For a moment a feeling like despair overwhelmed me. But I felt ashamed of my
                  selfish ingratitude, when another voice sounded on the threshhold, and another
                  familiar step entered the room.
               "Oh, Mr. Massarene; dear Mr. Massarene! You come like an angel to save me! I am so
                  lonely, so lost!"
               He smiled upon me with a beaming, kindly glance; he cheered me with comforting and
                  manly words; there was strength in his very presence.
               I did not know until then that he, with a few others of the suspected gentry, had
                  been arrested, but had been released on the eve of the battle; it being hoped that
                  their influence, which had always been opposed to the premature use of arms, might
                  prevail to bring about a surrender on favorable terms. Neither did I know that his
                  sister Annastene was dead. She had died quite suddenly at last, seated in her
                  chair, and on the same day that had witnessed the death of our sweet Florence.
               "And we are both alone," he said; adding, with a deep sigh, yes, my poor child, I
                  have sad news for you."
               "Tell me!" was my cry. "Do not spare me, my friend. Is it my father,—is it
                  Walter?"
               "Not Walter. Your father—"
               "Is he wounded? Oh, can I not go to him?"
               "Now let me say it all, poor child. It is best that you should know the whole
                  truth at once. Your father was taken with arms upon him; a court-martial was
                  called without delay; he was sentenced, and—"
               "Shot!" I cried, rising in my excitement and horror. "I know it, I feel it! You
                  need not spare me any dreadful tidings. Long, long have I dreaded the worst."
               I wrung my hands as I said it; it seemed to me that the world itself was passing
                  from under my feet.
               "He is dead," was the low response. "I used my utmost endeavors to save him; but I
                  only gained the poor favor of a few words with him. He was calm, heroic, Olive, as
                  I expect you to be. His only solicitude was for his daughter. I promised that no
                  harm should come to you, and he was satisfied."
               
               A burst of uncontrollable grief overwhelmed me at this certainty of all that I had
                  dimly feared.
               This good friend allowed me to wail out my grief; with kindest patience he
                  listened to my lamentations until they had exhausted themselves; and when a calm
                  succeeded this outcry of anguish, he took my weak hand in his strong protecting
                  one, as he said,—
               "Now listen, dear child,—for you have long been dear to me, dear as my own life,—I
                  have something to say to you that concerns us both. I am, no doubt, what you will
                  call old, and perhaps I am so," he added, with a smile; "but, as I said, we are
                  both alone; and, even at my age, I can protect you in but one way. And now, Olive,
                  will you give me the right to protect and cherish you? Will you—dare I ask it—will
                  you be an old man's bride?"
               I was so utterly taken by surprise that I could not utter a word. It was not of
                  his age I was thinking. I was overwhelmed that Mr. Massarene, so immeasurably
                  above me, so superior in my eyes to all others, should use such words to me.
               So long I pondered in my amazement, that he at length said, rather sadly, "I
                  understand, Olive. It is natural that such an idea should be repugnant to
                  you."
               "No, no, my friend," I said, still clinging to the hand he was withdrawing from
                  me, "it is not that—it is—it is—." After many attempts and many failures, I at
                  length made him understand the thought that was in my mind.
               "And is this all? Perhaps I ask too much—but would my good child deal frankly with
                  me—open her mind to me? Has she any secret hopes, longing desires, loves or
                  ambitions? Tell me all; begin at the very beginning. You will find me neither an
                  exacting nor a severe listener. If I cannot have your love myself, I will try to
                  make happy him whom you prefer, Olive; for my love is not a selfish one."
               And I did tell him all, even from the very beginning to the last words of my
                  interview with Arthur. "I have loved him," I said, with downcast
                  eyes, "but that is over now. Everything that I love, everything that I respect in
                  myself, calls upon me to be done with the infatuation. It has been an infatuation.
                  The feeling I had for Arthur was not founded on anything I could respect or
                  honor."
               "Bravely said, Olive. I would not fear to trust my future peace of mind with such
                  a spirit. Now, Olive," and he raised my hand to his lips, "may I ratify this
                  treaty? Speak, dearest, best beloved."
               My head rested upon his shoulder in blessed peace and trust. I was no longer
                  alone. The tears which I shed for my dead were wiped by a friendly hand. Love was
                  around me; love that would one day bring my life back to its old happy ways.
                  Florence seemed near me, with her violet eyes; my father's spirit seemed to smile
                  upon me blessed and at peace.
               We talked long of our plans, or rather Mr. Massarene's plans; and, as we talked,
                  we heard the rattle of the carriage wheels which bore the Greytons out of the
                  lodge gate. It was midnight; Arthur had passed out of my life forever; in that
                  moment I forgave him his misconception, his selfishness; all that he had been to
                  me of woe or joy was at an end.
               The rebellion Mr. Massarene regarded as now virtually tually at a close—though its final results could
                  not as be yet foreseen; but some weeks must elapse before his affairs could be
                  arranged. Then we would be quietly married; after which we would spend a year
                  abroad, or perhaps longer. The gossip and wonder over the marriage would by that
                  time be over, and we should return to live on the estate. In the mean time there
                  was to be nothing said about it. He would drop in every day to see me, "and make
                  sure," he added, smiling, "that my bird has not flown."
               The hours now passed as minutes. For after the first shock of my father's death, I
                  could not allow myself to feel despondency for him. He had died a hero's death,
                  the death he would have chosen beyond all others; his name was enrolled among
                  those who had served their country with their best blood—who should say whether
                  wisely or unwisely?
               Every day I was with Sir Robert; I read to him; I talked to him; we walked
                  together through the park and grounds. Sometimes we sat in Florence's room and
                  talked of her. She almost seemed to be present with us at such times; but the
                  sweet illusion vanished in deeper gloom and silence after these hours of
                  remembrance. Her father seemed to dwell upon her memory; to revert to her pretty,
                  childlike ways, her innocent, angel-like purity of thought, with a tenderness
                  deeper perhaps than he had felt for her in life. The coming daughter who was to
                  fill her place was never alluded to.
               Poor Sir Robert, he seemed so utterly crushed and broken down! Would he ever be
                  again as he had been?
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               CONCLUSION.
               THE war was over; the fearful outbreak so long dreaded, so fatal in its course,
                  was crushed forever. Twenty thousand of the king's troops, and fifty thousand of
                  the people, had perished during the period covered by this most disastrous
                  rebellion.
               Describing this time of desolation, a writer says: "The blast of the bugle now
                  called home the pursuing legions. Peace was again in the land. Seven weeks had
                  passed, and what a change! A hurricane had swept across the land. Now the air was
                  still, but everywhere the eye saw marks of that desolating track. Many a village
                  was in ashes; fighting was ended, but weeping remained. Sobs were heard from many
                  a lowly cot. Sons and daughters were gone; the spring saw them full of lusty life,
                  the midsummer saw them scattered like autumn leaves. Now their cabins were more
                  desolate than ever. Many a father came not back from the war. The peasant wife,
                  whose true, loving heart led her at night to the field of the unburied slain,
                  recognized, with his face upturned to the moon, the cold clay of him whom she had
                  followed through scenes of poverty and woe. But melancholy as were many scenes of
                  this disastrous war, sad as was its issue, none can deny to those who took up arms
                  that they had many wrongs, and that
                  they fought with a bravery worthy of men struggling for their freedom."
               The government, now seemingly satisfied with its victory, was disposed to mercy. A
                  proclamation of universal amnesty was published to those who would at once lay
                  down their arms; the only exceptions to the general pardon were those who had been
                  the prominent abettors and leaders of the insurrection.
               Of course Walter came under this head. He, with those that were left on that fatal
                  day, had fled to the mountains, and was holding out successfully against the
                  pursuing foe; but it was understood to be a desperate game. Their total subjection
                  was but a question of time. Mr. Massarene and others were anxious to save the
                  brave fellows, and used every means to induce them to accept the amnesty. "And be
                  banished our country forever!" they cried, "no, rather let us die and moisten with
                  our blood the dear old soil."
               But at last the persuasions of those they could not but admit were their wisest
                  friends induced them to submit, though not without many a tear and bitter sigh
                  wrung from their hardy hearts.
               Through Mr. Massarene's persistent influence, Walter was enabled to choose his
                  place of exile. He chose America, the new world, that had always been his
                  ambition, the great centre of his ideas of true liberty.
               As a great act of clemency also, he was permitted to visit the old home before he
                  left. He came to the lodge under guard of two officers of the law. I had desired
                  to see him, and Mr. Massarene, with his usual trustfulness, left us together in
                  the brief half-hour allotted to us. Walter knew I was to be Mr. Massarene's rene's
                  wife, and I think he was quite relieved by the announcement. "Arthur is not worthy
                  of you, Olive," he said, his face flushed with emotion, "and—and this other
                  is."
               "You are still hard on Arthur, Walter; do not speak in this way."
               "I cannot help it. You know I never admired him; and now that he has proved a
                  dastard, a recreant to his country, leaving it in its utmost need, I cannot,—I
                  cannot but despise him."
               Something of my old spirit now rose; I could not bear these hard words. "Do not
                  say dastard," I urged. "He loves his country, I know he does; but he has not your
                  free spirit, Walter, your clear, determined will; he is swayed by circumstances,
                  influenced by those immediately around him. His heart is good, his instincts are
                  right. I think we might rather pity than blame him."
               "Pity!" he repeated, with something of a dash of scorn, but added quickly, with
                  almost a smile, "At our old subject of quarrel; and I think now," looking at the
                  two men pacing up and down in front of the door, "we have hardly time to waste on
                  this disputed question. I wish I could see him as you do,—I owe the family
                  much,—but I cannot. And now, before we part, yes, part forever, tell me—tell me of
                  yourself, Olive."
               "Oh, not forever, Walter!" I cried, feeling sick at heart. Walter was very dear to
                  me. His uniform tenderness and affection, ever since my earliest recollections,
                  his many and continued benefits to myself and those that I loved, crowded on my
                  memory, and I felt sore indeed.
               
               We sat down in that little home room, so teeming with recollections, while I told
                  him all about my grandmother, her sickness and death, and how glad I was that she
                  was saved the knowledge of his going away, and joining in what would have seemed
                  to her a most unrighteous conspiracy against established authority. Her strong
                  heart was spared this pang, at least. "Walter will soon be here," had been her
                  hopeful and confident assertion to the last.
               And Walter wept bitterly to have disappointed the faith of one who had always been
                  as a mother to him. Then we talked of Florence, and my heart poured out its
                  incurable sorrow; her beauty, her sweetness came up for remembrance in this hour
                  of parting, and Walter sympathized with me in that loss which could never be
                  replaced in this world. So long we talked that the men without gave symptoms of
                  impatience; the allotted time was passed. Walter rose and offered me his hand for
                  the last farewell. "I thank you, Olive, I shall never cease to thank you," he
                  said, with emotion.
               "Thank me?" I repeated. "What have I done worthy of thanks, Walter?"
               "If there be anything in me worthy your regard or regret, Olive, I owe it to you.
                  You have been the angel to lure me on to a higher and better life. I know what you
                  would say, Olive; do not fear me now, my hopes and dreams are over. But you will
                  still be my stimulus, and the secret spring of my ambition. I will strive to
                  render myself worthy of your friendship, and to do honor to your partial
                  judgment."
               "I know you will," I said, with a sob I could not suppress. "I never expect to
                  hear of you but as one of whom we may all be proud."
               In a few weeks Mr. Massarene and myself were quietly married. He, so disinterested
                  in his love for me, did not, after all, have to receive a dowerless bride. Lady
                  Betty was dead, and in a will executed about a year before her death left me all
                  she possessed, with the exception of a few legacies to old servants and
                  dependents.
               How strange it seemed that I should have been chosen for her heir! There were
                  Arthur and Florence,—and Florence she loved so much more; but the dear old lady,
                  ever eccentric, acting from her own convictions, no doubt thought of their
                  abundance and my dependence, and acted from these ideas of fitness. And from the
                  kind words in which her last desires were expressed, I learned she had loved me
                  more than I thought.
               I tried to think what I could have done to so gain her esteem. I remembered that I
                  alone of the three had applied myself studiously to master her native language, so
                  inexpressibly dear to her. She had taught me all I knew of it, and together we had
                  read much of its wild romance, the legends of its cherished greatness, its now
                  departed glory, and with a kindling enthusiasm almost equal to her own, I had been
                  carried away to imaginations even more visionary and wild than those her beloved
                  ancient bards and chroniclers indulged in. This had, no doubt, endeared me to her;
                  I had seemed as the child of her intellect, and in her last will she had
                  acknowledged me as such.
               After our marriage we left Ireland for a year's travel abroad. That year was among the most blessed and
                  beautiful of my life. Daily I learned to honor and love and reverence my husband
                  more and more. I forgot the disparity in our years. He was to me all that my heart
                  had craved. I was proud to be his wife, and my great strife was to attain in
                  reality the height upon which his affections had placed me. He must not learn to
                  blush for his young and thoughtless bride.
               During our absence, Dark Cliff—or rather the Cliff Manor, its proper name—was
                  carefully and thoroughly renovated. It was to be our future home. The close,
                  stunted trees on the lawn were cleared away, only a few less exposed to the
                  sea-air being retained. The high wall inclosing the grounds was taken down, and
                  light and sunshine once more danced on turret and tower, casting their shadows
                  over the rich greensward, down the terraced banks, even to the rocks and sands of
                  the broad, open beach below.
               The ancient mansion, stained by centuries of sea-blasts, also underwent strange
                  transformation; its walls were rubbed and scraped until the rough white stone
                  beneath revealed itself in its original purity. A new wing was added, and a tower;
                  and our home, the old Dark Cliff, shone out again in its original attractiveness,
                  a tasteful and elegant pile, visible afar off as you approached from sea, and to
                  those who dwelt within it a home of joy and comfort.
               We found many changes on our return. Sir Robert had passed away, and Sir Arthur
                  and Lady Adele presided at the Hall. Lady Grace resided with them; she was
                  painfully changed. She met me with unwonted demonstrations of affection; it was
                  evident she was not happy at the Hall. Things were sadly changed there. It had now
                  a mistress who lived and ruled for herself alone. "My poor Arthur," Lady Grace
                  would say, "is all that a son can be, but—but—" She would shake her head, while a
                  tear trembled in her eye, "but—but—how changed that home!" Before long she became
                  an inmate of our household, withdrawing gratefully from that where the daughter of
                  her choice resided.
               We were now, my husband and myself, recognized as the Earl and Countess of ——. In
                  his early youth, discouraged by the political state of the country, and
                  unambitious of the distinctions of rank, Mr. Massarene had laid aside his title.
                  Now, he said, smiling, he would bestow on me all honor which the world regarded as
                  such, and he resumed the discarded bauble of an earldom with as little affectation
                  as he had resigned it.
               We often met Sir Arthur and Lady Adele in public; and if taking precedence by
                  right of rank was any satisfaction for early taunts and jeers, I had that
                  satisfaction. Once, doubtless, this would have gratified a certain pride of
                  spirit, a certain desire for "justice," inherent in my nature; but I have higher
                  aspirations now, or perhaps in my husband's love I have forgotten some early
                  griefs.
               Yet I never go to the old Hall; I do not care to renew its old associations, or to
                  see the haunts, held sacred in my memory, changed and adapted to new uses. I keep
                  the memory of Florence fragrant and holy. I have no need to renew it by visiting
                  the scene of our youthful friendship; I will not pain myself nor wrong her by attempting polite amenities,
                  social courtesies, with one who had no place in her esteem.
               In time my husband once more began to take interest in the affairs of his country.
                  This he declared was rather to please his wife (whom he often rallies on her
                  political tendencies), than from any hope that individual effort could avail much
                  against the vast combination of political machinery, the league of political
                  leaders whose interests and energies were devoted to the establishment of the
                  "Union," as it was termed—the union of Ireland and England under one common
                  government. In time this union was accomplished, as such unions are wont to be
                  accomplished, by the complete paralysis of the weaker party. The labors of
                  Ireland's patriots to give their country its own laws, its own rights of commerce,
                  were ranked among the futile efforts that sadden the pages of history. The stream
                  of wealth and influence was diverted from our capital to swell the pride of
                  England and the coffers of London. The butterflies of fashion, the innumerable
                  crowd that ever flutter in the sunshine wherever it be, the followers of the
                  court, the minions of the government, all drifted away with the vanishing
                  prosperity. Costly mansions were deserted, whole streets were left unoccupied,
                  ranges of brilliant shops filled with rare goods stood deserted. No crowds of
                  customers, no gay concourse of wealth and fashion, enlivened their dreary
                  inactivity. Worse still than all this, the country gentlemen and the landed
                  proprietors left their estates to be managed by agents, or by any one who would
                  undertake to drain from them the money necessary to support them splendidly in
                  their new homes.
               But still we hope on; we know that where there is vitality there must be ultimate
                  recovery; the national character is strong in recuperative power; centuries may
                  elapse with perhaps little apparent change, and with often much seeming
                  retrogression, but hope still points triumphantly to the future, when political,
                  religious, and traditional thraldom shall be done away, when governments shall be
                  ordained for the best interests of those who sustain them, when individual rights
                  shall no longer clash with the rights of communities, and justice and mercy shall
                  prevail, freedom and toleration exist in reality as well as in name.
            
            THE END.

                  "The Quaker character, though its quaintness and simplicity may seem easy
                     enough to catch, requires a delicate workman to do it justice. Such an artist
                     is the author of 'Dorothy Fox,' and we must thank her for a charming novel. The
                     story is dramatically interesting, and the characters are drawn with a firm and
                     graceful hand. The style is fresh and natural, vigorous without vulgarity,
                     simple without mawkishness. Dorothy herself is represented as charming all
