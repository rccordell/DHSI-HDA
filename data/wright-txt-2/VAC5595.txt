               THE OVERTURE.
               CHRISTMAS! What worldly care could ever lessen the joy of that eventful day? At
                  your first waking in the morning, when you lie gazing in drowsy listlessness at
                  the brass ornament on your bed-tester, when the ring of the milkman is like a
                  dream, and the cries of the bread-man and newspaper-boy sound far off in the
                  distance, it peals at you in the laughter and gay greetings of the servants in the
                  yard. Your senses are aroused by a promiscuous discharging of pistols, and you are
                  filled with a vague thought that the whole city has been formed into a line of
                  skirmishers. You are startled by a noise on the front pavement, which sounds like
                  an energetic drummer beating the long roll on a barrel-head; and you have an
                  indistinct idea that some improvident urchin (up since the dawn) has just expended
                  his last fire-cracker.
               At length there is a stir in the room near you. You hear the patter of little feet on the stairs, and
                  the sound of childish voices in the drawing-room. What transports of admiration,
                  what peals of joyous clamor, fall on your sleepy ears! The patter on the stairs
                  sounds louder and louder, the ringing voices come nearer and nearer; you hear the
                  little hands on your door-knob, and you hurry on your dressing-gown; for it is
                  Christmas morning.
               What a wonderful time you have at breakfast! There are a half-dozen silver forks
                  for ma, a new napkin-ring for you, and what astonishing hay-wagons and crying
                  dolls for the children! Jane, the house-maid, is beaming with happiness in a new
                  collar and black silk apron; and Bridget will persist in wearing her silver
                  thimble and carrying her new work-basket, though they threaten utter destruction
                  to the beef-steak-plate.
               You sit an unusually long time over your coffee that morning, and say an unusual
                  number of facetious things to everybody. You cover Jane with confusion, and throw
                  Bridget into an explosion of mirth, by slyly alluding to a blue-eyed young
                  dray-man you one evening noticed seated on the kitchen steps. Perhaps you venture
                  a prediction on the miserable existence he is some day destined to
                  experience,—when a look from the little lady in the merino morning-wrapper checks
                  you, and you confess to yourself that you are feeling uncommonly happy.
               At last the breakfast ends, and the children go out for a romp. Perhaps you are a
                  little taken aback when you are informed your easy-chair has been removed to the
                  library; but you see Bridget, still in secure possession of her thimble and
                  work-basket, with a huge china bowl in one hand and an egg-beater in the other,
                  looking very warm and very much confused, and you take your departure to your own
                  domain, to con over the morning papers.
               You hear an indistinct sound of the drawing of corks and beating of eggs; of a
                  great many dishes being taken out of the china-closet, and a good many orders
                  being given in an undertone,—why is it women always will speak in a whisper when
                  there is a man about the house?—and you lose yourself in the "leader," or the
                  prices current.
               The skirmishers have evidently suffered disaster; for the firing becomes more and
                  more distant, and at length dies from your hearing. You are favored with a call
                  from the improvident little boy, who requests you to grant him the privilege of
                  collecting such of his unexploded fire-crackers as may be in your front yard,
                  giving you, at the same time, the interesting information that they are to be made
                  into "spit-devils." You are overwhelmed by a profound bow from the grocer's lad as
                  he passes your window, and you invite him in and beg that he will honor you by
                  accepting half a dollar and a handful of doughnuts nuts:—the lady in the merino morning-wrapper has
                  provided a cake-basket full for the occasion. You are also waited on by the
                  milkman, who, you are glad to see, is really flesh and blood, and not, as you have
                  sometimes supposed, an unearthly bell-ringer who visited this sublunary sphere
                  only at five A.M., and then for the sole purpose of disturbing your morning nap.
                  You are also complimented by the wood-man and wood-sawyer, and English sailor with
                  a wooden leg, who once nearly swamped you in a tornado of nautical interjections,
                  on your presenting him a new pea-jacket. And then comes the German fruit-woman,
                  whose first customer you have the distinguished honor to be, and who, in
                  consequence, has taken breakfast in your kitchen for the last ten years. You
                  remember that on one occasion she spoke of her little boy, named Heinderich, who
                  was suffering with his teeth; and when you hope that Heinderich is better, you are
                  surprised to learn that he is quite a large boy, going to the public school, and
                  that the lady in the merino morning-wrapper has just sent him a new cap.
               The heaping pile of doughnuts gradually lessens, until finally there is not one
                  left. The last dish is evidently taken from the china-closet, and the whole house
                  is filled with that portentous stillness which causes the mothers of mischievous
                  offspring so much trepidation.
               You expect to see the merino morning-wrapper reconnoitering the movements of your
                  own sweet pledges of affection; but she doesn't: you can only hear the ticking of
                  the little French clock on the mantle-piece, and the spluttering of the coal as it
                  bursts into a gassy flame between the bars of the grate, and you almost imagine
                  Christmas has passed. You are deceived; for by-and-by you hear your children's
                  footsteps as they skip over the garden-walk, and the sound of their ringing
                  laughter as they rush in out of the cold, and their clamor rises louder and
                  gladder and more jubilant than ever. Grandpa! Who does not know him, with his
                  joyous face and hearty morning greeting? How resplendent he looks in his
                  broadcloth suit, his gold-headed cane and great blue overcoat! What quantities of
                  almonds and raisins, of oranges and sweetmeats, those overcoat-pockets contain!
                  What child ever lived who did not believe grandpa's pocket a cornucopia for all
                  juvenile desires? The day passes on. The turkey never looked browner or juicier,
                  and the blaze on the pudding-sauce never burned bluer; the kissing under the
                  mistletoe was never more delightful, nor the blindman's-buff ever played with a
                  greater zest: but the merriest Christmas must end. Your little girl, tired and
                  sleepy, kneels at your feet, and you pass your fingers through her soft curls,
                  while she repeats her simple prayer: "God bless pa, God bless ma, God bless grandpa, God bless little brother, and
                  God bless Santa Claus;" and you hope that God will bless Santa Claus.
                  You thank your Creator you are the master of that quiet home and the
                  father of those dear children, and go to your rest with a heart full of gratitude.
                  You hope that all the newspaper-boys, and all the milkmen and bread-men's
                  children, and all the little boys and girls who have no fathers or mothers or
                  grandpas, and all the poor, and all the sick, and all the blind, and all the
                  distressed, have had a merry Christmas.
               At a time like this, when the security of your own reward relaxes scrutiny for the
                  shortcomings of others, I would have you take up these "Trifles."
            
            
               A CHRISTMAS MELODY.
               
                  The Prelude.
                  "TWENTY-NINE dollars! Very well, Mr. John Redfield: I think you
                        have cut your allowance a little low. With
                     bracelets, bonbons, and other gewgaws for your interesting friends, I must say
                     your enjoyment of this prospective Twenty-fifth of December is somewhat
                     reduced. When a man has skated over the frozen surface of society a little
                     matter of one-and-thirty years, it is just reasonable to hope he has reached
                     that desideratum known as years of discretion. There is a little adage relating
                     to the immeasurably short time the feeble-minded enjoy pecuniary advantages,
                     which I think decidedly applicable to you.
                  "A rather severe epigram, occurring in the Holy Scriptures, goes to show the
                     impossibility—even though the somewhat unsatisfactory argument of the pestle
                     and mortar be resorted to—of separating the same class of people from their
                     rather confused ideas of the fitness of things. However, when the Mussulman,
                     careering over Sahara, finds himself, by a stumble of his horse, rolling in the sand, with his
                     yataghan, pistols, and turban scattered around him, he rises quietly, and
                     exclaims, 'Allah is great!' I know a Christian would have expended his wrath in
                     a variety of anathemas highly edifying, and close by wishing his unfortunate
                     steed in a much warmer climate than the Mohammedan has any idea of. I am a poor
                     churchman: let me emulate the philosophy of the simple child of the desert, and
                     when I fall into trouble bear it patiently.
                  "I wonder what the grim savage would do were he short of money in a land
                     thronging with beggars and other blissful adjuncts of civilization? Woe unto
                     every blind or club-foot man, and every one-armed or scalded woman,
                        I meet to-day! They shall work out their own salvation with
                     fear and trembling, or I'm an idiot.
                  "Why, bless my soul, the fortunes bequeathed to all the novel-heroes created
                     this century, would not begin to supply them!"
                  Redfield shook his head decidedly when he came to this part of his monologue,
                     and put the gold and silver coins back into his pocket.
                  "I hate poor people—I positively do! I despise their pale faces and cadaverous
                     expression. I detest straggling little girls who come up to you and say their
                     mothers have been bedridden for three months, and all their little brothers and
                     sisters are down with the fever. I know it's a lie. I can detect at once the
                     professional whine, and am certain the story has been repeated by rote a
                     hundred times that day; but for the life of me I cannot put out from my mind
                     the imaginary picture of the half-furnished room in some filthy back street,
                     with a forlorn woman with red hair stretched on a bed of straw, and half a
                     dozen or more red-haired children piled about promiscuously.
                  "There is a wretched little German girl, always managing to have a boil either
                     on her forehead or the back of her neck,—I believe in my soul it's from
                     overfeeding,—who follows my footsteps like a misanthropic vampire. By what
                     ingenuity she manages to cajole me out of my money I know not, but I positively
                     assert that in the last fortnight, according to her account, her unhappy mother
                     has suffered from eleven different incurable diseases. My God! what a
                     complication of misfortune! Why not let them starve? When a man is not capable
                     of maintaining a family, why in Heaven's name does he ever have one?
                  "I think I will follow the maxims of political economists and all respectable
                     members of society, and vote beggars a nuisance. I wonder how many people
                     to-day, praying for deliverance by Christ's 'agony and bloody sweat,' by his
                     'cross and passion,' his 'precious death and burial,' his 'glorious
                     resurrection and ascension,' and the 'coming of the Holy Ghost,' don't?
                  
                  "This is a charitable frame of mind to precede a Christmas
                     morning. When did I contract the habit of talking to myself?
                  "I must be impressed with the two grand reasons of the man we all know of:
                     first, I like to talk to a sensible man, and second, I like to hear a sensible
                     man talk.
                  "I wonder if there is not something under the surface in Sol Smith's charity
                     sermon? I rather like its pithy style:
                  "'He that giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord. Now, brethren, if you are
                     satisfied with the security, down with the dust.'
                  "I once repeated it to a gaunt little parson, and his look of unmitigated
                     horror caused me to hide my diminished head. I knew from his manner—he did not
                     condescend a reply—what chamber in the Inferno was being heated up for my
                     especial benefit. Well, well! the sentiment is doubtless creditable to his head
                     and heart.
                  "What a pity it is I am not one of the 'good' people! What an agonizingly
                     cerulean expression I would wear, to be sure!
                  "I wonder why young mothers don't write for their children's first copy Dante's
                     inscription, and teach their baby lips to lisp of the world what he says of
                     hell. It's surprising to me that that parson is not crazed at his sense of the
                     certain perdition into which everybody body except himself is hurrying.
                     Perhaps, after all, there is something in the question of La Rochefoucauld, 'Is
                     it not astonishing that we are not altogether overpowered at the misfortunes of
                     our friends?' Well, man learns something every day. When I first saw a chicken
                     take a billful of water and hold up its head, in my childish simplicity I
                     imagined it thanking God: I afterward discovered it was only letting the water
                     run down its throat. My mind, like good wine or bad butter, must be
                     strengthening by age.
                  "Why can't we take things quietly, as we did when we were boys? I expect I had
                     a rather comfortable time of it then, though I did get whipped for tearing my
                     clothes, and killing flies, which I used to do worse than any bald hornet.
                  "Now, that youngster walking before me is whistling like a lark, and, by the
                     Lord Harry, he has scarcely a shoe to his foot!"
                  He was a poor boy, perhaps seven or eight years old. His face was pale and
                     careworn, and though he whistled, it was a solemn kind of whistle, that sounded
                     more like a lamentation than the outburst of childish gladness. His clothes
                     were too thin and worn for his slight frame, for the morning, though clear and
                     bright, was frosty, and his little bare toes peeping out of his shoes were blue
                     with the cold. He hurried through the streets with a bundle of papers, but,
                     even while intent on their sale, he had the walk of an old man, and his small shoulders stooped as though they
                     bent under the weight of years.
                  Redfield eyed him narrowly.
                  "Paper, sir?"
                  "So, in this frenzied struggle after bread, you are an itinerant vendor of
                     periodical literature?"
                  "You mean I sell papers, sir? Yes. I've only been at it three weeks. I'm
                     'stuck' this morning. Haven't got a good beat yet. Paper, sir?"
                  "Have you no fears of risking your commercial character by appearing on the
                     streets in that unheard-of dress?"
                  The boy reddened.
                  "I've been sick," said he, at length, "for a very long time."
                  "My Lord!" groaned the philosopher; "here's another conspiracy against my
                     unfortunate pocket-book! Why don't your mother take care of you?"
                  "She did, sir; but she sews for slop-shops, and has worked so much at night
                     that she's almost blind."
                  "Worse and worse! and here's an outfitting establishment just across the
                     street. When will I acquire anything like habits of prudence? Boy," said he,
                     fiercely, "you are a young vagabond, and deserve to starve. Your mother should
                     be put in the pillory for ever marrying. That's what the world says—and what I
                     would think, if I wasn't a consummate ass. Were you ever blessed with a view of
                     the most unmitigated mitigated simpleton the sun ever shone upon? Look at me!
                     Look good: I am worthy of a close inspection. Now come along, and see to what
                     extent my folly sometimes carries me."
                  He caught the boy roughly by the arm, jerked rather than led him across the
                     street, and thrust him bodily among a crowd of astonished clerks who stood at
                     the door of a clothing-house.
                  "Take this young vagrant and put him into new boots, with woolen socks, some
                     kind of a gray jacket and trowsers, and a hat that's fit for a civilized
                     age."
                  Seeing that Redfield was really in earnest, the proprietor obeyed the order
                     promptly, and in half an hour the boy reappeared, rather red, a little
                     uncertain, but decidedly altered for the better.
                  "Now go," cried the cynic, with a smile, and a shake of his hand, "and thank
                     your stars the fool-killer did not come along before you."
                  "Nineteen dollars and a half! Bless me! what am I coming to? It may be laying
                     up treasures in heaven; but, by Jove, I had rather see it than hear tell of
                     it."
               
               
                  The Refrain.
                  It certainly was the dreariest 24th of December an unhappy boy had ever had the
                     misery of witnessing. In a vain endeavor to get up an excitement, I expended my
                     last fire-cracker; but the continuous drizzle drowned out every one. It was only four o'clock, and yet
                     the fog hung like a pall over the windows, and the gas-men were lighting the
                     lamps in the street. My mother, and an old schoolmate, Mrs. Mary Morton,
                     adjourned to the privacy of her bedroom; and, a pet navigation enterprise,
                     conducted in the gutter, having resulted in shipwreck and a severe sore throat,
                     I also was permitted to enjoy its cosey quiet. John Redfield came in as the
                     evening advanced. He had been sick; and my mother, wheeling the lounge near the
                     fire, made him lie down and have something warm to drink. He and Mrs. Morton
                     were intimate with the family from my earliest recollection.
                  The four, in their childhood, lived near each other, among the picturesque
                     hills of Western Pennsylvania. They went to the same school, played in the same
                     woods, and now, in mature life, retained the warm regard of the days gone by. I
                     say four; for Mr. Redfield had a sister,—Mrs. Hague, a pale, lovely little
                     lady, who at one time visited my mother very often. There had been some
                     estrangement between her and her brother, the particulars of which I never
                     knew. She had married, years before, a worthless kind of a man, who kept a
                     shoestore; but he became involved, the store was sold out by the sheriff, and
                     since then both were in a manner lost.
                  John Redfield, though an abrupt man, and rather eccentric, had as kind a heart
                     as any one I ever knew. He was connected with a newspaper in the city, and
                     wrote wonderful articles about police courts, that, somehow, sounded more like
                     sermons than stories. In my early days, before Gutenberg and his movable types
                     came within the scope of my knowledge, I believe he printed out the whole
                     edition with a lead-pencil, and entertained most exalted ideas of his capacity.
                     He had a passion for giving boys painted boats. I must have received twenty—all
                     exactly alike—at various outbreaks of his generosity. He had the queerest way
                     of bestowing favors I almost ever saw. When he wished to make a boy a present,
                     he shoved it roughly into his pocket, and then started off as if the house was
                     on fire. What brought up the subject I do not now remember, but that evening
                     Mrs. Morton persisted in talking about Clara Hague. She spoke of their
                     childhood, of the old homestead, of the nutting, the apple-picking, the
                     cider-making, and the hundred other occupations and amusements of their young
                     life.
                  She had a vivid power of description, and a charming simplicity in her choice
                     of words, that entertained even me; but I could see Mr. Redfield was troubled.
                     He moved restlessly on the lounge, and once drew a shawl over his face. At last
                     she touched on the shoestore, its doleful decay and downfall, and the years the
                     unhappy woman had struggled on. At this he started to go; but there was
                     something in her manner that detained
                     him. Her tone had been light and chatty before; and, though she spoke with
                     proper gravity, it was sprightly rather than earnest. I did not notice any
                     striking change; and yet it seemed suddenly to assume the gentle impressiveness
                     one sometimes fancies we should hear from the pulpit.
                  "Whatever be her troubles, Clara has been a good sister to you. You were the
                     youngest; and a puny little fellow you were then, with all your greatness. Many
                     and many a time, in your quarrels with other boys, have I seen her get into no
                     end of disgrace for defending you. Do you remember that old log
                     school-house, John? and our dinners under the trees? What baskets of berries
                     and bags of nuts we gathered in those woods! Do you remember the little run we
                     used to cross, and the fish you caught in the pool?
                  "And oh, John! do you remember that day we started home when it rained? You had
                     been sick, and commenced to cry. We got under a big tree; but it was November;
                     the leaves had all blown down, and the rain beat through the branches. What
                     disconsolate little people we were! And when you sat down on a flat stone, and
                     declared you'd stay there and die, don't you remember how Clara went out in the
                     bushes, and, taking off her little flannel petticoat, put it around your
                     shoulders for a cloak?"
                  The strong man quivered; his face convulsed, and the hot tears started into his
                     eyes.
                  "YES! I'll be hanged if I don't!"
                  He clutched up his hat, and was gone in an instant, and the two women,
                     woman-like, stood sobbing in each other's arms.
               
               
                  The Air.
                  The thousand-and-one young gentlemen in blue neck-ties, who for a twelvemonth,
                     in frantic strains, varying from basso
                        profundo to piping tenor, had proclaimed their entire willingness
                     to "mourir pour la patrie," were engrossed at
                     their shops; innumerable fascinating trimmers of bonnets, who, like poor little
                     "Dora," religiously believed the chief end of man consisted in "dancing
                     continually ta la ra, ta la ra," sat busily plying the needle, elbow-deep in
                     ribbons; the consumptive-looking flute-player before the foot-lights trilled
                     out his spasmodic trickle of melody, and contemplated with melancholy pleasure
                     the excited audience; the lank danseuse ogled and smirked at it behind them,
                     and, with passionate gestures of her thin legs, implored its applause; men,
                     women, and children, of all grades and degrees, crowded into the murky night;
                     for a day was coming when the youths of the neck-ties would not agree to
                        mourir on any account; when the
                     flute-player would cease to be contemplative; when the danseuse would forget
                     her attenuated extremities; when the whole world, where the grace of the
                     Redeemer is known, would believe that the chief end of the hour, at least,
                     consisted in "dancing continually ta la ra, ta la ra."
                  Shall "The Air" ring with the joyous notes of the carols, or breathe low and
                     soft with the sighs of the suffering?
                  Shall it burst into mad hilarity at the revelry, or wail with the sharp cries
                     of the poor?
                  It was a painted house, but the paint had worn off; it had a garden, but the
                     garden was choked with weeds; its two rooms were once handsomely furnished, but
                     the furniture was now common and old. It was once a fashionable street; but
                     fashion had fled before the victorious eagles of trade. The tenants of that
                     house were once happy and prosperous. What are they now?
                  The occupant of the back room was a man, and the occupants of the front room a
                     woman and her children.
                  He was sitting at a rude deal table; before him were scattered some dirty
                     sheets of music, and around him the place was dreary and bare. By the light of
                     a tallow dip he was playing, in screeching tones, the commonest of ditties and
                     polkas by note. His coat was once of the richest; but now it was old and
                     threadbare. His hands were once white and elegantly shaped; now they were
                     dirty, and blue with cold. He face once beamed with contentment; now it was
                     worn with care and marked by the hard lines of penury.
                  The other room was darker, and, if possible, more dreary. There were two
                     trundle-beds in a corner, and four bright beings, oblivious to the discomfort,
                     in the happy sleep of childhood. There was a mattress in another corner, with a
                     pile of bedquilts and a sheet.
                  The fire had burned down to a coal. It shone on the mantle with a sickly glare;
                     and this was the only light there was.
                  To the mantle-piece were pinned four little stockings, each waiting
                     open-mouthed for a gift from Santa Claus.
                  Below them crouched a woman, weeping bitterly.
                  The woman was Clara Hague; and she was weeping because the Christmas dawn would
                     find those little mouths unsatisfied.
                  Our "Air" is getting mournful,—too mournful for this hour of great joy. The
                        Te Deum Laudamus, not the Miserere, is for outbursts of gladness like
                     these.
                  Let it sing of the carriage that surprised the man from his fiddle and the
                     woman from her tears by its thunder in the quiet street.
                  Let it sing of the warm-hearted brother, forgetting the bitterness of the past,
                     his pockets replenished from a well-saved hoard, who rushed in, startling the
                     little sleepers with his joyous greeting. Let it chant the praises of the
                     hampers of wine, and fowls, and
                     dainties, and the bundles of toys, that same lumbering carriage contained. And
                     last, but not least, let it thrill with the glad shout of a little newsboy,
                     who, frantic with delight, hurried on a new gray suit and a pair of bran-new
                     boots, a present received that very day from his then unknown uncle, John
                     Redfield.
               
            
            
               STORY OF A BEAST.
               IT was a dirty, grasping little office, vile enough to have been built by the Evil
                  One; and the occupant was a dirty, grasping little man, cruel enough to have been
                  made out of its scraps. It was a hard, remorseless little door, that took in a
                  visitor at a gulp and closed after him with a bite. If the luckless caller
                  happened to be a debtor, the fantastic barbarity of his reception was positively
                  infernal. The jerk of grotesque ferocity that greeted him was like the "hoop la!"
                  of a demonized gymnast. The straight-backed chair looked like a part of the stiff,
                  angular man. The yellow-wash on the wall seemed to have caught its reflex from the
                  faded face, and stared grimly at deep lines of avarice ironed into it. Even the
                  mud on the floor, the dust on the table, and the cobwebs on the ceiling
                  maliciously conspired against him, and asserted themselves in every seam of his
                  threadbare clothes. But the face—stern, stony, relentless, an uncertain compromise
                  between the ghastly severity of a German etching and the constipated austerity of
                  old pictures of the saints,—in that, one fixed idea had blotted out every other
                  vestige of humanity. Each starting vein,
                  bone, and muscle on the hungry visage had "stand and deliver" scarred all over it.
                  The eager metallic glitter of his eyes, the rigid harshness of his mouth, and the
                  nameless craving that seemed to speak from his lean, attenuated cheeks, united to
                  make the name of Hardy Gripstone and Beast synonymous. He looked like a beast, he
                  ate like a beast, he lived like a beast.
               Beast started out of every bristle on his unkempt head; it shone in the unhealthy
                  gloss of his battered hat; it wallowed on the stock that clung around his dirty
                  neck; it glistened in the grease on his dingy clothes; it starved on his thin,
                  claw-like hands; it flourished in the grime imbedded under his nails; it creaked
                  in his worn-out, down-trodden shoes. Men, as he shambled by on the streets,
                  unconsciously muttered, "Beast!" women, shrinking from him, whispered, "Beast!"
                  between the heart-throbs the terror of his presence created; children, hushing
                  their cries in silent horror at his grimace, stared "Beast!" out of their
                  wonder-stricken eyes. You might bray him in a mortar and boil the powder in a
                  caldron, yet amid all the envy, hatred, and malice that made up the ingredients,
                  Beast would have triumphantly floated on the top. Beast! Beast! Beast! Beast! The
                  universal verdict clutched him like the shirt of Nessus. He actually grew proud of
                  the title, and received the stigma with a cluck of beastly joy, as though inspired
                  with a certain beastly ambition to deserve it. The laugh with which he hailed any
                  appeal to his charity was monstrous. It commenced with a leathery wheeze like the
                  puff of asthmatic bellows; it croaked with a grating chuckle, as if his throat
                  opened on rusty hinges; and then it broke out in a shrill vocal shudder, that
                  sounded like the shriek of a hyena.
               It is an idiosyncrasy of mine to foster just such pet abominations; and I
                  cultivated Hardy Gripstone. My advances were not encouraged by that overweening
                  tenderness that indicates the possible victim of misplaced confidence. Far from
                  "wearing his heart upon his sleeve for daws to peck at," it seemed to have been
                  weaned years agone, and my milk of human kindness fell flat as any whipped
                  syllabub.
               Felicitous as were the suggestions of his suspicious brain, it took me fully three
                  months to descend in his bearish estimation from a highwayman to a ninny. There
                  was an incredibility in my apparent lack of motive that puzzled him. His dubious
                  cordiality was doled out under protest. As an exhibitor would clutch a vicious
                  ape, he grabbed at every show of feeling, and almost throttled the most pitiful
                  courtesy, in his nervous dread of its doing him some bodily harm. There was a low
                  cunning in his very acceptance of any little kindness. The sly way in which he
                  insinuated his withered face into my morning papers, and the smirk of satisfaction with which he gloated
                  on the triumph of having gratuitously gleaned their entire contents, was in
                  keeping with every other ludicrous phase of his distorted nature. He looked upon
                  me as a paragon of stupidity; and I fear I considered him a piece of personal
                  property, and felt as much pride in the possession as did Barnum in his Aztec
                  children.
               I do not think the acquaintance tended in any way to exaggerate my ideas of human
                  purity. Though it extended through several years, no guilty act I ever heard of
                  detracted from his deserved reputation for beastliness. My surmises never ventured
                  to the hazardous period of infancy, or risked the doubtful thought that kith or
                  kin could have loved him; but I have often wondered if there ever
                     was a time when his rapacity found employment in the robbing of a
                  hen's nest, or his grasping ambition culminated in the swop of a jack-knife. I
                  wondered if in all the grotesque concomitants that congregated to make up the
                  hideous whole, there existed a redeeming trait. Yes, there was
                  one,—one I discovered in the tears that sprung from his unrelenting
                  eyes and rained on his cadaverous cheeks. What was the anguish that shook his
                  beastly frame? what the agony that tore his grasping nature? who was the Moses
                  that smote water from this rock?
               Dear hearers, it is here we find the text of the sermon, and here commenceth the
                  preaching.
               Early one summer, the grasping little door bit to for good, and I missed its mangy
                  proprietor for probably four months. Had he planted himself in the earth and
                  regerminated, he could not have been more freshened. His emaciated carcass fairly
                  blossomed with magnificence; and gaudy ornament sprouted all over him. It peeped
                  through his shirt-front in flashy studs, it twined on his fingers in glittering
                  rings, it trailed around his waist in glowing velvet, and expanded over his thin
                  legs and arms in a forest of broadcloth. 'Tis true, the shiny collar
                     would get over his ears, the coat-sleeves darkened every sparkle
                  on his hands, and the hems of his trowsers persisted in being trodden under heel;
                  but what were petty annoyances like these, in a renovation so complete? His face
                  had been shaved and polished until it approached in glistening amiability the
                  ivory head on a walking-stick; but there was an uncertainty in its ripples of
                  merriment impressive of the belief that if once a genuine ha! ha! was ventured,
                  the galvanized look of joy would instantly vanish. It was at a very uncertain gait
                  he sidled into my office. He did not seem at all sure I would know him, or, in
                  fact, very intimately acquainted with himself. The mingled gruffness
                  and cordiality of his greeting suggested
                  a dancing-master suffering with corns. It was a minute or two before his wonted
                  calmness returned; but finally, with a piteous look of blended tenderness and
                  brutal exultation, he handed me a card. It contained the handsomely engraved
                  compliments of Miss Florence Gripstone, and a hope for the pleasure of my company
                  at a soirée. This was the magic wand that turned penury to wealth and made the
                  sterile rock blossom with gorgeous flowers. The beast had a daughter, and with all
                  the ardor of a distorted nature he loved her.
               If, a week before, Gripstone's soirée had been hinted, I think I would have
                  laughed; but if the assertion had been ventured that it would be given in a
                  stately house, with spacious grounds, on a fashionable street, and with
                  "Gripstone" on the door-plate, I know I would have shouted outright.
                  Yet the house was stately, and the entertainment superb. Carpets
                  glowing with the gorgeous coloring of the Orient, pictures that had caught their
                  delicate tinge in sacred Rome, furniture carved from the solid heart of rosewood,
                  plate vying in richness with the state service of a scion of nobility, abounded.
                  Fluttering in the light of many tinted lamps, rare flowers breathed daintiest
                  odors; and floating through the high arches, soft music whispered plaintive
                  ecstasy. In the center of a throng of recently arrived guests, and positively
                  cropping with broadcloth and Marseilles, beamed the host. Close at his side,
                  radiant in her beauty, faultless in its adornment, stood the daughter. In one, a
                  magnificent swallow-tail, fleecy shirt-frill, and snowy gloves had stamped their
                  wearer with a look of hopeless absurdity; in the other, exquisite taste, gentle
                  dignity, and true courtesy bore the impress of glorious womanhood. I was
                  positively bewildered. Could the father of that lovely girl be the wretch the
                  world hooted at? Could the owner of all this grandeur be the Beast I fancied my
                  private property?
               Carriage-loads of elegantly attired women crowded each other in the vestibule;
                  dancing beaux congregated in the smoking-room; eminent merchants, with their wives
                  and daughters, wits of both sexes, women of the most exclusive ton, thronged the spacious salons. Each in their turn was greeted with a smirk of ecstatic
                  glee. To Gripstone the courtesy seemed invested with a proprietary interest. A nod
                  was receipted with a simper, a grasp of the hand with a scrape, the most distant
                  recognition by the most obsequious acknowledgment. There appeared to be no doubt
                  in his mind it was all bought and paid for, but it did no harm to be polite for
                     once; and comically polite he was.
               I will not say he did not gradually begin to wear the look of a man who had
                  purchased an elephant; for he did. I found him late in the evening posted behind a
                  column and peering through the window at
                  the assembled merry-makers. It was evident he owned the whole party, and that
                  every ringing laugh went with the property; but to him it was a novel investment,
                  and perhaps more difficult to manage than any other article he possessed. Partly
                  from a dim consciousness that he had wandered beyond his depth, and probably from
                  the loneliness consequent to so uncongenial a spectacle, a companion had become
                  necessary; and, when I approached, his jump of cordiality was as uncouth as it was
                  unexpected. So stunned were my senses by the extraordinary events, that, had he
                  cried out, "Come to my arms, my long-lost brother!" or were a strawberry-mark
                  actually found, I could not have been surprised. As it was, his frenzied tugs at
                  the lapel of my coat threatened its immediate destruction, and my spinal column
                  ached under his demoniac slaps on the back, before I gasped out my
                  congratulations.
               Wine, excitement, or the society of one who at least had treated him with common
                  decency, warmed the little geniality that remained in him.
               With a jerk he thrust me into his study, and, while thrilling music swept through
                  the echoing halls, and the solid flooring swayed under the feet of the dancers,
                  the Beast opened his heart. Shrinking, as though 'twere felony, from the penury of
                  early life, flying from a brief hour of married happiness, in wild triumph he
                  plunged into the dreariness of the upward ward struggle. Maddened with success,
                  spurning all thought of concealment, with shocking exactness he entered into every
                  detail of the contest, every incident in the appalling history. The low cunning
                  and miserable privation that accumulated the first paltry hundreds, the trickery
                  that made them thousands, the heartless sacrifice of self-respect that doubled and
                  trebled the swelling store, were gloated over with a grin of delight. Transactions
                  imbued with a depravity that made me shudder, were narrated with a chuckle;
                  chicaneries of a depth and maliciousness positively devilish, were touched with a
                  smirk. Forthis he had lied and cheated; for this his
                  wretched body grew lean for want of food; for this all the world
                  loathed him. In his youth poverty crushed him; but his
                  little girl, away at school, never knew the meaning of the word. Widows went
                  portionless, but she did not want; orphans starved, her
                  platter was always full. He had been spattered by the coaches of the
                  rich; but now his chariot, and her chariot, would take a drive. They
                  had called him Beast; but now they called him
                  gentleman.
               The hundreds who drank his wine and trifled with his sweets called him gentleman,
                  and hundreds more were ready to go down on their knees to his own flesh and blood.
                  Now was the time to enjoy, now the day of happiness. Money was a drug; in his
                  abundance, he could never want. He had love, grandeur deur, troops of friends; now he would
                  live a monarch. Flushed with victory, his eyes blazed, his voice rang clear and
                  loud in its exultation, and his lank form swelled with defiance. Springing to his
                  feet, and clutching up a decanter, he waved it wildly around his head, and,
                  challenging God or man to mar such peace, shivered it on the floor.
               Wonder-stricken at the intensity of his vulgarity, and shocked at the sacrilege, I
                  left; and from that moment Hardy Gripstone became a study. Every step in his
                  tortuous course, every phase of his ostentation, every enormity on good taste, was
                  followed with ceaseless vigilance. Excesses that would have startled the most
                  thoughtless were pursued with restless activity; absurdities that drew forth a
                  shout of ridicule were committed with provoking good humor. No freak seemed
                  exuberant, no folly preposterous, no extremity extravagance. The joy of paternity,
                  sinking deep into his nature, made every peculiarity more glaringly apparent.
                  Money had been his idol, its accumulation the summit of his ambition; its reckless
                  sacrifice in his daughter's honor appeared the only adequate expression of his
                  love. The intervals of his devotion were passed in idle boasting, and to me he
                  detailed every incident. There was something really touching in the abject way in
                  which he mentioned each trifle concerning her. Little circumstances connected with
                  her daily life were described as one would describe the traits of some rare
                  animal. His career of degradation seemed to have blunted every idea of
                  responsibility. He looked upon her as a superior being, and her adornment as a
                  sacred duty. The richness of her toilet, the magnificence of her equipage, the
                  glory of her beauty, became an inexhaustible surprise and delight. The utter lack
                  of congeniality, the barrier of caste that divided them, was indescribably sad.
                  Rapturous admiration, gentle amazement, blind idolatry, meek bewilderment, the one
                  twisted by brutality to a living distortion, the other lifted by refinement to the
                  embodiment of womanly grace; and yet they were father and daughter. To do her
                  justice, she strove in every way to testify her love and gratitude for her strange
                  parent; the ties of blood asserted themselves in her words and caresses, but they
                  looked doubtfully out of her eyes. Educated far away from him, and amid other
                  associations, she could not be blind to his faults and shortcomings. The social
                  gulf that divided them, though bridged by her sense of duty, was ever present in
                  her thoughts. I mourned over the remorseless avarice that made him what he was; I
                  almost regretted the culture that placed her so far above him; but, knowing the
                  rude shocks to her sensitive nature, the ruthless trampling on every womanly
                  instinct, I mourned for her the most.
               Alas for the schemes of prosy men and women! when tender Loveliness goes airing herself through
                  shady lanes, frank young Valor is seldom far off. The Eurydice may be only a
                  school-girl, and Orpheus a brave, manly boy in a blue coat; but there is a world
                  of heart-fluttering, for all that. The flush of conscious beauty blooming on the
                  cheek of one, is generally a shadow of the warm red that mantles the face of the
                  other. While Eurydice Gripstone mused in quiet nooks, it was no fabled youth of
                  magic lyre who sent the rhetoric and botany waltzing through her brain; and when
                  the fierce cry of "Lights out!" hurried Jane Eyre under the pillow,
                  it was no dream of impossible mustaches that made her hear the clocks chime
                  dismally and the cocks crow for midnight.
               When the long-looked-forward-to Commencement-day was at length looked
                     on, and our heroine tripped up to the platform to read her Essay
                  on Filial Affection, alas for its consistency! it was not the grin of Pluto
                  Gripstone staring stupidly at the show, but the smile of Orpheus, now blessed with
                  a strong beard, that set the recipient of undying fame a trembling. And now, when
                  the farewell had been said, and Orpheus left to break his lyre and mourn,—when
                  Pluto had carried home his prize and the dreary occupation of being as extravagant
                  as possible had commenced,—they were no notes of weird pathos, but billets
                  containing many brave promises, that made strong coffee the most delectable of
                  drinks. Of course all these changes from dreamy reverie to tremulous joy could not
                  escape the searching eye of Pluto; and of course, when questioned, no Eurydice of
                  spirit would think of denying the mate for whom she pined.
               Oh, the consternation of the discovery! Oh, the thunders of remonstrance with
                  which Hades resounded! The wheel of Ixion might whirl, and the pitchy depths blaze
                  with the fires of indignation, but all this did not dry the tears of the nymph,
                  nor soothe her bitterness of woe. Every tenderness that could reconcile, every
                  enjoyment that could wean, was vainly essayed; mourning for her Orpheus, she would
                  not be comforted.
               At last the Plutonian shadows opened to receive the matchless man. It was with no
                  impossible burst of harmony he charmed away the terrors of this prison-house of
                  injured innocence. Whatever might have been the Orpheus of the fabled "long ago,"
                  our modern hero was a plain, business-like man. He thought a great deal of the
                  daughter, but for her worn-out old hulk of a father he didn't care a button.
                  Married he was determined to be, nolens volens;
                  and that was the long and the short of it. To a piteous plea to remain and enjoy
                  the old man's wealth, he turned the deafest of ears. Business required his
                  presence at home; where business commanded, he obeyed; and that was the long and
                  the short of that.
                  He didn't propose to set up a museum of deformities, if the daughter
                  did; or stay to witness a burlesque on the society he was brought up in, were she
                  never so dutiful.
               Oh, the misery of this reality! When shall I forget the anguish on that cadaverous
                  face, when the terror of the narration? For nineteen years he had patiently
                  plodded on, despised by the rich, hated by the poor, spurned by both. He had
                  driven hard bargains that she might drive her carriage; he had turned his wretched
                  debtors houseless into the streets that she might be covered. With every spark of
                  love in his heart, with every instinct of tenderness in his soul, he had bowed
                  down and worshiped her. She had him all: he would set to work anew, were it
                  needful, for her sake; he would go in rages for her; he would starve for her; and
                  this was his reward!—his happiness filched from him by a whipster of a day's
                  acquaintance!
               When two people, like the frogs of Æsop, conclude to plunge down a well for the
                  waters of happiness, it is generally the "weaker vessel" who dallies. Let no one
                  suppose our Eurydice quitted the blissful innocence of nymphhood without a
                  struggle, or coolly deserted her battered old father without a regret.
               With all the golden halo that hung about the future, there were walks taken in
                  those gardens in which the claw-like hands and tapering fingers clutched each
                  other very tightly, and there were sudden bursts of emotion when the cadaverous
                  cheeks were well-nigh smothered with kisses. If you or I had an interview with the
                  pillow that adorned her chamber, it would have told us of many a scalding tear
                  that damped its purity and many a smothered sob that fell on its feathery ears. If
                  there were red eyes and pallid cheeks at the breakfast-table on one side, there
                  was a very dismal face on the other. Step by step the hard fact sunk into it, and
                  furrow after furrow marked the progress. It was very glorious for Orpheus; but it
                  was very gloomy for the Beast, and he knew it. Bravely did the old man hold out,
                  and grim and silent was the surrender. Perhaps a dawning light of their
                  ill-assorted association, and a fear for its influence on her happiness, might
                  have opened the sally-port to the conqueror; but he never admitted it. He laid
                  down his arms as coldly and quietly as ever any old Spanish knight gave up his
                  citadel.
               Once more the stately house opened wide its doors to a stately gathering, and
                  again there was music and dancing and feasting. There were scores of
                  richly-dressed women to kiss the bride, and there were scores of brave men to
                  congratulate the groom; but there was not one in all that fair company had a
                  kindly word for Hardy Gripstone, and of all the throng who feasted that night
                  there was not one saw his broken heart.
               
               From the hour the creaking steamer bore the happy pair to their Northern home, he
                  slunk out of society. The great house was closed, and the little office, dirtier
                  and more grasping than ever, opened. Every witness to his outburst, myself
                  included, was studiously avoided. I met him often; but no sign of recognition
                  escaped him.
               Some months afterward, in passing his filthy little street, I found the
                  remorseless little door had gulped a policeman. Pulling apart its ferocious jaws,
                  and peering in, I saw the straight-backed chair; but the body which seemed a part
                  of it was much stiffer and more angular. The yellow-wash on the wall was a paltry
                  reflex of the ghastly yellow of his faded visage; for the iron face was the face
                  of a corpse.
               Men who stood vacantly staring in muttered, "Beast!" women, shrinking from the
                  unsightly spectacle, whispered, "Beast!" and children, gazing in silent horror
                  with the rest, stared "Beast!" out of their wonder-stricken eyes. So hard did they
                  stare, so loud did they mutter, and so many instances did they rehearse of the
                  foul wrongs he had committed, that I am doubtful about the matter myself, and ask
                  you, reader, Was he a Beast?

                     most unimpressible, of beings, suddenly turns white as a ghost and shivers with
                     a nervous spasm, it is safe to suppose he is frightened. But when terror,
                     turning into rage, changes one of the most attentive and respectful of servants
                     into a madman, it is scarcely safe to suppose anything. As it was, I stared in
                     mute amazement, and he glared at me as though I had struck him. While waiting
                     for a light, I carelessly put my hand into a basket of hot-house vegetables.
                     The small egg-plant I took up certainly did weigh twenty pounds,
                     and when I attempted to lift the basket the handle bent double; but why this
                     should frighten a man like Marcel, or provoke him to anger, is as inexplicable
                     as it is surprising.
                  He is pacing up and down the hall in a state of the wildest excitement; and I,
                     with man's truest comfort,—tobacco,—am left to my meditations.
                  What combination of circumstances reduced him to a porter, I cannot for the life of me imagine.
                     His hand is as soft as a woman's; and his brow has a breadth of brain that
                     would dignify a Senator. Notwithstanding the scrupulous deference in his tone,
                     his manner possesses the quiet ease of a gentleman, to as great a degree as any
                     I ever saw.
                  The utter incongruity of his appearance and position struck me the moment I
                     laid eyes on him. He flourished his napkin with the dainty grace of a courtier;
                     and when he lifted my luggage to his shoulder, I was on the point of
                     apologizing. He makes my bed, polishes my shoes, performs with fidelity the
                     most menial offices; and yet I cannot but look upon him as an
                     equal. Poor devil! His cheek may burn with the bluest blood in France. What a
                     pity the world is not moral!
                  There is something enchanting to me in smoking. It is like a rich
                     cordial,—nerving every faculty to action. A draught from your Cabanas, the pulse quickens, the mind clears, and thought awakes, like a fine
                     instrument under the magic touch of a master. The wind moans drearily without,
                     the rain beats dismally against the windows, the fagots flicker blue-flamed and
                     weird in the dark recesses of the chimney-place; but what care I? The white
                     walls are lurid in the flare, the great bed stands out in the darkness like a
                     grotesque engine of the Inquisition; but who suffers? Au troisième, No. 30, Rue
                     Lepelletier, was never noted for its
                     comforts; but who would ask a repose more secure, a peace more perfect, than
                     are enjoyed by the occupant of this rambling old house? Blessed be the earth
                     that bears this solace for weary brains! Its very odor is pregnant with dreams
                     of the Vuelta Abajo. You see the luxuriant
                     foliage of the tropics, the dark-green waves curling on the coral beach, and
                     the scarlet flamingoes that gather shell-fish in the marshes away off in the
                     golden sunset. You hear the wild song of the Spanish fruit-man as he sculls his
                     boat along the broken wharves, and are soothed into utter listlessness by the
                     thousand perfumes that come off with the land-breeze. A taste of the fragrant
                     vapor, you recline in the odorous orange darkness of a dream-land, languidly
                     breathing the smoke from your hookah, and the lustrous leaves moving over you
                     are bathed in the soft and melting sunshine. The day lingers luminously over
                     far mountain-ranges, paling in brilliancy on the hill-side, where the blushing
                     vine, bending with the clusters, is still enlivened by the song of the
                     vintagers; and in the valley, where the grain sheds its gold under the sickle.
                     You are lost in voluptuous reverie. You breathe the sunlight; intellect is
                     thawed and mellowed; emotions take the place of thought; "your senses,
                     sun-tranced, rise into the sphere of soul." You feel the heart of humanity
                     throbbing through all nature, and your own warms into quivering life.
                  
                  "It is not good for man to live alone;" and you dream of another to share the
                     rapture your wild fancy has created.
                  
                     Your Haidee is pure. Her form has rather the statuesque roundness
                     of Psyche than the luxurious excess of Venus. Timid, yet not tremulous,
                     graceful even to delicacy, coquettish in outline, her beauty is
                     formed for smiles. She is a still-eyed Xenobi, but knows nothing of Passion
                     with disheveled locks, divine frenzy, and fiery grasp. She is your friend and
                     comforter; and you are the strong rock her helplessness clings to. Your uncouth
                     manner softens as you behold her troubled look. You become kind and
                     considerate. You watch with pity the pinched faces of anxiety that pass before
                     you. You cheer the little beggar, and give him of your abundance. Unhappy
                     wanderer! he has started early on his wretched pilgrimage for bread. "Your
                     heart, enlarged by its new sympathy with one, grows bountiful to all." The
                     fragrant smoke curls in heavier clouds, and is wafted imperceptibly into the
                     darkness. Ah, Arthur Granger! Arthur Granger! you are dreaming impossibilities,
                     as the man athirst dreams of flowing waters.
                  "Love has lost its wings of heavenly azure with which it soared light as a lark
                     into the empyrean, and now grovels on the earth, weighed down by the burden of
                     red gold."
                  How well I recollect that warm, balmy March morning! My mother had sent me to
                     Paris about six months before, to read law with an old relative. Of course I
                     was delighted; but that day I felt tired of the dull routine of my life, and
                     longed for the green fields, waving trees, and wild mountain-torrents of my
                     home. I was walking slowly down the street, thinking gloomily of the labors of
                     another day, and she was standing near a school-house door, intently occupied
                     in giving some directions to an old soldier. In my whole life I do not think I
                     ever saw a more beautiful creature. The airiness of the lithe little figure,
                     the playfulness in the nod of the graceful head, the look of joyous innocence
                     on that perfect face, flitted through my mind like a bright ray of sunshine
                     during the entire day. Every morning, for years after, I met that child; and
                     every morning her beaming smile cheered my young life like a glimpse of heaven.
                     I never spoke to her; it was a long time before she even knew of my existence;
                     but by-and-by I noticed a quizzical expression come over the old man's face,
                     and I saw her features warm with a faint flush of recognition. How many dreams
                     I based on that slight fabric! Of course I discovered her name; and of course I
                     learned that her father was very rich; but what was that to me? With what pride
                     did I gaze at his name in huge gilt letters on a great warehouse near us, and
                     what wonderful little gothic cottages did I build on the strength of the "and
                     Son" that would shortly be added to
                     it! The long nights with my cousin became less wearisome. I could hear the dull
                     creaking of the letter-press, and see him sit poring over his writing, quite
                     patiently. When the organ-grinder stopped on the corner and played "Make me no
                     gaudy chaplet," I did not long to rush into the streets, for I had
                        her to think about. When the clock struck eleven, and my
                     cousin, with his peculiar "phew!" commenced another letter, I looked on quite
                     calmly, and began the construction of another cottage. Of course there were
                     rainy days, and Thursdays that were ages to me; and there were Christmas
                     holidays, and long, hot vacations, that she did not come; but September brought
                     back the radiant face, and I worshiped on.
                  Gradually I noticed a change in her dress. She wore little lace collars, and
                     bright ribbons I had not seen before; and sometimes she carried a little
                     bouquet of violets, with a white rosebud in the center. As she grew older, I
                     had many rivals. Gallant youths, brave in broadcloth and beavers, followed by
                     dozens the Picciola I had watched so
                     tenderly. How proudly I passed them by! and how I sneered at the thought of
                     their understanding her!
                  I saw her form grow fuller and expand into a more queenly beauty. I saw her
                     eyes sparkle with a diviner light, and her bosom swell with new and strange
                     emotions. I watched her until she became a woman, and gloried in her matchless
                     loveliness.
                  At last the end came. One morning, the brown calico frock was changed for an
                     India silk, and the little school bonnet, with its blue veil, for a new one,
                     covered with artificials. She was accompanied by an elderly lady, and looked
                     nervous and excited. I was troubled at the tremulous, uncertain expression of
                     her face. The next day I read her name in the list of graduates.
                  It does generally rain at picnics; but this time it didn't. When shall I ever
                     forget that picnic? I stole a holiday to attend it. It was late when I arrived:
                     the dinner was over, and I had one prepared expressly for me. Would you believe
                     it? my fair attendant was the little Blue Veil. She was so kind and so gentle,
                     and treated me in such a confiding, sisterly way. There was a tenderness in the
                     soft depths of her eyes, a purity in the dazzling loveliness of her face, that
                     my heart yielded to with the blind fervor of a devotee. When shall I ever
                     forget that evening walk under the trees? Oh! those buttercups and daisies, and
                     little Quaker ladies! what recollections they bring back to me! The pressure of
                     that soft little hand on my arm, the timid grace of her manner, the sound of
                     her clear, girlish voice, with what emotions have they stirred my soul! Heaven
                     bless her! Thank God for that one glorious picture! It was years ago; she is
                     married now, and the mother of children; yet even now I sometimes catch myself
                     standing on the corners and gazing
                     wistfully down the street for the bright image that stole into the morning of
                     my young life like a soothing dream in a long, troubled sleep.
               
               
                  Leaf the Second.
                  Gardening in midwinter!—what new freak has taken possession of that eccentric
                     man? The morning broke dank and drear, for the December air had chilled the
                     moisture into a fog. The wide verandas that opened on the court-yard in rear
                     were dripping with the rain, and the broad flag-stones covered with a greasy
                     slime. The diminutive grass-plot was brown and soggy, but the withered blades
                     rapidly disappeared under the sturdy plunges of Marcel's spade. I had gone out
                     on the gallery to fill a ewer with water—in his excitement of the previous
                     evening, Marcel had forgotten my morning bath—and saw him distinctly through
                     the jalousies. He must have commenced at
                     daylight; for, though it was then early, the ground was almost entirely dug up.
                     Near him, on the pavement, was the basket over which he had displayed so much
                     agitation. He prepared six holes, each of which was carefully lined with straw,
                     and then deliberately commenced planting the egg-plants whole.
                  An hour or two later, he came up with the coffee. I thought he turned a shade
                     or two paler at seeing me up and dressed; but no vestige of petulance remained
                     mained. Having really taken no offense at the outburst, I rallied him
                     concerning it.
                  "I was wrong," said he, gravely; "but nature has left me destitute of tact. An
                     artist was once ordered to paint a one-eyed princess: the artful man made the
                     picture a profile. Devoid of his discernment, I saw only my ruined
                     treasures."
                  "And, after acting like a wild man, you sneer at my curiosity."
                  "One so secure in his position as M. Granger can lose nothing by
                     forbearance."
                  "In other words, I am to endure patiently the taunts of an apron, because its
                     wearer is worthy of a surtout?"
                  "The prompt nature of hunger is well known. Fifty years ago, I might have
                     shrieked in the Place de la Concorde. France
                     has degenerated; I polish your shoes."
                  The assumption of inferiority was so defiant that I said, bluntly, "This can
                     never excuse the neglect of faculties bestowed by Heaven."
                  He shrugged his shoulders, and answered, "There was a time when power succumbed
                     to intellect. 'Stand out of my sunlight,' said Diogenes to Alexander; and
                     Alexander did so. This is Paris, M. Granger, and we are living on the Rue Lepelletier."
                  "And, frightened at its splendor, M. Marcel has prudently determined to put his
                     brains under regimen."
                  
                  "M. Marcel has prudently determined to avoid in future a tête-à-tête with his superiors."
                  He started abruptly to the door, and I called him back; determined distance
                     even in a servant is far from flattering, and I asked him frankly if his visits
                     to my apartments were as distasteful as his manner would lead me to infer.
                  He answered, politely, "Were fickle Fortune waiting to conduct me to the summit
                     of my ambition, I would detain her a few hours to enjoy society so charming;
                     but M. Granger forgets he is addressing a domestic."
                  "Stubborn in your pride to the last! What am I to think of one who holds all
                     sympathy in contempt?"
                  "Basta!" he fiercely exclaimed. "I am like a
                     vagrant cur: flying from the sticks and stones of a vile rabble, I fawn with
                     cringing servility on the first hand that throws me a crust."
                  "Wrong, Marcel; wrong," I earnestly answered. "You are trying to warp your
                     nature, as you tried to force the fruits of summer to bloom and ripen in
                     midwinter. You will be human, and your egg-plants will rot in the
                     earth."
                  My words seemed to have taken away every particle of color there was in him.
                     His eyes contracted until they resembled those of a wild animal, and for a
                     moment I thought he was going to spring at my throat. His voice—when finally he
                     regained it—sounded like that of another person.
                  "M. Granger," said he, "a man visiting the Jardin des
                        Plantes once undertook to stroke a leopard. Strange as it may
                     appear, the animal was more pleased with petting than the inquiring mind
                     imagined. The instant our naturalist attempted to desist, the creature raised
                     his paw to strike. There monsieur stood, for a whole night, gazing into his
                     glaring eyes and smoothing his soft neck. Can you imagine his feelings?"
                  With a bow that would have graced the Duc de Beaumont, he left. I heard him
                     hastily packing his modest wardrobe; and in fifteen minutes a tilbury had
                     whirled him away—whither, Heaven only knows.
               
               
                  Leaf the Third.
                  I do not think his own mother would call him handsome; he is certainly not
                     young, nor particularly brilliant; and yet there is a fascination about the
                     proprietor of this rambling old house that gave me an unaccountable desire to
                     become his tenant. He is a wine-merchant, and occupies, as his counting-room,
                     the entire second floor. The place is desolate-looking and dusty, and the
                     furniture old with service; but, I am told, no man in Paris controls more of
                     the grand vintages than M. Pontalba. With a Frenchman, the
                        legality of a transaction depends on its being negotiated in a
                        café; and it was in one of these I first
                     saw him. He was seated at a table near me, absorbed with the contents of a box of baby-clothes,
                     while a rather pretty and exceedingly voluble modiste harangued him on their beauty. The tenderness of his
                     expression struck me. He took out the articles one by one, examining each with
                     the interest of a woman. He ran his fingers through the tiny sleeves, and
                     smoothed out the ruffles and lace, with a care that was almost loving.
                     Diminutive cambric shirts, snowy dresses, and silky flannels,—all in their turn
                     were inspected and replaced with a sigh of satisfaction.
                  An ardent young friend and I had been discussing the merits of Comte's
                     philosophy; but so attracted were we by the singular trait that both stopped
                     involuntarily, and watched him, until the woman was paid and a messenger
                     carried the fairy wardrobe away.
                  My friend was an enthusiastic metaphysician; and, resuming the subject with a
                     zest, was soon plunged into the phenomena of thought, the action of the brain,
                     and the vitality of the blood that sustained it. As all conversant with the
                     subject can readily believe, not many minutes elapsed before his artful
                     sophistries proved the non-existence of heaven, hell, and even God himself.
                  M. Pontalba turned suddenly, and, drawing his chair close beside us, with an
                     apology for the seeming intrusion, addressed the incipient skeptic:
                  "Behind the iron bars of that dreariest of studies, a prison, a little weed
                     once received the concentrated thought of a savant. The covering of its stem,
                     the first tender leaves, the development of the bud, the expansion of the
                     flower—each bewildering in its consummate propriety—unfolded, in their turn, a
                     system of laws in simplicity transcendent. By the aid of a microscope, a
                     'gillyflower' was seen protecting a chrysalis. Warm leaves cherished it, dainty
                     juices aided its digestion, wholesome offshoots nourished it to maturity. Eking
                     out a scant existence between two granite flags, this insignificant waif reared
                     a caterpillar. What man are you, who can say there is no God?"
                  There was a pathos in his voice, and a tone of simple fervor, which gave that
                     quiet old man the air of a priest.
                  It was more than a year afterward I took these rooms; but my establishment was
                     of short duration ere I learned the history of an eventful morning which
                     followed that incident:—of how the placid face of the master peered among his
                     people, beaming with a great joy; how a sumptuous feast was fitted up in the
                     private office for all in the employ; of the two hundred francs, and a suit of
                     clothes, presented to each; and how every one, from the little messenger to the
                     gray cashier, with the rarest wine in the cellar, drank prosperity to the
                     new-born son and heir, and much happiness to the mother,—"God bless her!"
                  Once I saw a pony-carriage, with an aged, semi military driver, pull up at the
                     door, and the flutter of a veil as the
                     vehicle passed through the entrance; and this was the only glimpse I ever
                     caught of the little lady that dingy office called mistress. There was,
                     however, a certain briskness in the movement of the clerks, and a glow of
                     pleasure on their faces, that always denoted a visit; and very frequent those
                     visits were. Without in any way obstructing it, her pretty interest seemed to
                     throw a halo around the dull routine of trade; and, if there was any
                     unpleasantness, the arrival of Jean Palliot, coachman and ex-grenadier, with
                     Madame Althie Pontalba, was sure to drive it away.
                  Why will my heart, like a hungry thing, gloat on the happiness of
                     others? He has gone away—in the midst of the holidays—no one knows whither; and
                     his sweet wife and pleasant home are as dreary as I. There is a mystery about
                     this house which I have not yet unraveled. Marcel left in the morning, and M.
                     Pontalba in the evening. That has been two weeks ago. I thought he would have
                     fainted when I told him of the garçon's
                     exodus. I attempted a history of the gardening; but he would not listen to a
                     word, and remained locked up in his private room during the entire day. Late in
                     the evening a stranger called, and insisted on an interview. It resulted in a
                     hasty consultation with the cashier, and an order for a coach. The two went off
                     together,—whither, or for how long, no one knows.
               
               
                  Leaf the Fourth.
                  To-day finds a man in the full glow of health, and strength, and happiness;
                     to-morrow comes death, cold, pitiless, irresistible; mocking all hope, freezing
                     desire, crushing all effort with the eternal law of time and human destiny, it
                     strikes him down with the icy fury of a fiend. Poetry, passion, humanity, are
                     shivered at the touch. The glorious creature who, an instant before, quivered
                     with life and love and energy, lies a shapeless mass, disgusting to the sight,
                     loathsome to the touch, revolting to every instinct of our nature. So, in its
                     ceaseless routine, forever and forever, wheels on the world. The play-ground
                     bully, the swindler of the corn exchange, who is more virtuous? dolls with
                     life, babies with genius, which the more sensible? Even baby has its
                     "pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake," and is lulled to sleep with visions of a coach and
                     six little ponies. Dreams, dreams of self, that man wraps himself in like the
                     swathing of a mummy. Who ever saw a cake marked with "T," who ever a "Valley of
                     Tranquil Delight"?
                  The sun rises and sets on the weary diamond-digger of the South, the crazed
                     perfume-hunter in the East, the stifled hemp-curer in the fetid swamps of
                     Russia, the shriveled iron-worker in the scorching furnaces of England. Here,
                     in Paris, amid that motley herd who
                     feed on virtue, the moon shines down calmly on purblind embroiderers and
                     peerless beauties, on worn-out roués and
                     squalid beggars. The breeze that wafts to heaven the pure prayer of the maiden
                     witnesses the fierce ribaldry of the courtesan; it flutters the curls of a
                     sleeping infant, and bears on its wings the whispered exchange of
                        chastity for bread. And man goes on, devouring his three poor
                     meals a day, and babbling the meaningless nothings he has learned by rote. Oh,
                     land of enlightenment! Oh, age of Christianity! Oh, zenith of civilization!
                  The smoke-wreaths curl into thicker clouds. I have painted bright pictures, and
                     they have faded. I have cherished fond dreams, and they are vanished. "It is
                     not good for man to live alone;" and I am most solitary. I can make another
                     picture,—without the roses; but it will be true.
                  It's a merry Christmas, this Twenty-fifth of December, eighteen hundred and
                     eighty-seven,—a very merry Christmas; times have scarcely changed at all in the
                     last thirty years. The sun shines down brightly, and the frosty air is full of
                     gladness; for Santa Claus, with his untold wonders, has come and gone.
                     Ecstasies over dolls and transports over tea-sets, screams of delight at
                     hobby-horses and enthusiastic exclamations at humming-tops, have passed.
                     Paint-boxes and writing-desks, leaden soldiers and tin trumpets, at last, are
                     reduced to blissful matters of course. The streets, which all the morning have
                     been thronged with laughing groups of happy children, are now almost deserted.
                     Senators and cabmen, ministers of state and town constables, romping
                     school-girls and worn-out actresses, Lady Dedlock and her
                     washer-woman, men, women, and children of all degrees, have quietly seated
                     themselves to roasted turkey and plum-pudding. Even the little boys who
                        will play marbles under the library windows, who are constantly
                     being "fat" and wanting "ups" and "roundings," and who are invariably ordered
                     to "knuckle down and bore it hard," are now intently occupied with the
                     succulent delights of "drum-sticks" and gizzards. And yet the man whose fingers
                     now form these letters then sits alone. Time has not passed
                     lightly over his head. The few hairs that straggle from beneath
                     his skull-cap are gray, and the faintest breath makes him wrap closer in his
                     thickly-wadded dressing-gown. His face is worn and pale, and the wrinkled hand,
                     though it only holds a little cigarette, will sometimes tremble as it moves.
                     The Christmas dinner is pushed away untasted. Château-Margaux has lost its flavor, and silver and crystal do
                     not bring appetite now. Even the glowing sunshine, which plate-glass and silk
                     damask cannot keep out, is unheeded. He gazes wearily at the magnificent
                     furniture, and smokes. He has talked much to the world, and it has heard him.
                     Flung into life without a friend, governed only by the will of a race born to command, he has struggled
                     through sneers and sarcasm to eminence. Men fear him now, women flatter, nearly
                     all envy; yet he is alone. He knows this; he knows that in all the laughing
                     groups who enjoy this wine-drinking and turkey-eating day his name has not been
                     mentioned once. Nature allows no trifling with her laws; flowers do not bloom
                     in deserts. He has crushed sentiment; he has stifled affection. With a heart by
                     nature kindly, he sits now an image cut in steel. He gazes calmly at his
                     desolate hearth, at his joyless age, and smokes. Man has no power to move him;
                     fate condemned him to be a statue.
                  Ah! the strongest, after all, are but weak, erring, human beings. The last of a
                     race stands weary and old, trembling on the brink of eternity. Who will close
                     the fading eye? Who will smooth the dying pillow? With all his great wealth,
                     with all his wondrous knowledge, what one deed of charity will that infirm old
                     man take into the presence of his Creator? He looks dreamingly out at the
                     window. The plate-glass and damask are not there now; the sunshine is warm and
                     the air balmy. A mild, breezy March morning, and he is standing on a corner,
                     looking far down the street. "She is coming, coming;" the dark eyes beam on
                     him, and the radiant face flushes the pallor of his cheek;—"come." He gives one
                     lingering, beseeching look at the passing figure, the cigarette drops to the
                     carpet, the withered hands clasp convulsively the arms of the chair, the gray
                     head slowly falls on his breast, and one more frail human being, exhausted with
                     the anxieties of a long and bitter life, is at rest forever. It's a merry
                     Christmas, this Twenty-fifth of December, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven,—a
                     very merry Christmas. Times have scarcely changed at all in the last thirty
                     years.
                  How he ever got there, or when, I do not now, nor will I ever, know, but when I
                     looked up Marcel was standing before me.
                  "M. Granger," said he, abruptly, "it will be necessary for you to seek another
                     lodging."
                  "Why?"
                  "I would do you a service. The proof lies in the future. This house is
                     doomed."
                  "Poor Marcel," said I, with genuine pity, "some recent trouble has turned your
                     brain!"
                  "Mad!" he replied, laughing bitterly. "The wonder is that I am not. For years I
                     have been hunted,—hunted like a dog. Prisons have been my dwelling-place,
                     disguises my only clothing. My pillow is a spy; the very atmosphere I breathe
                     is analyzed."
                  "And what is your offense?"
                  "A desire to live as the great God intended an Italian should. A desire to lift
                     to his place among the free-born the corrupt descendant of Coriolanus, now
                     nourishing his miserable body on the scudi
                        extorted from a stranger's
                     patience. The vile crew whom our ancestors drove howling and naked across the
                     Danube, in undisturbed apathy gloat over our dearest treasures. Our people are
                     ground into the dust; our women, stripped in the market-place, shriek under the
                     pitiless lash of the oppressor. One man, sworn to protect Italy with his life,
                     can save her, and has refused. That man dies."
                  "And you are pledged to kill him?"
                  "I am pledged to see you safely without these walls by this day fortnight."
                  "And you?"
                  "I remain."
                  "Marcel, you are crazy."
                  "M. Granger, you are polite."
                  That night fortnight I was away; and this was the message that sent me:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "TO M. ARTHUR GRANGER:
                              
                              "Your fatal discovery on the morning of my departure makes you the
                                 only man to whom I can appeal. Let me pray the appeal be not in
                                 vain. In the folly of my youth, while sojourning in Italy, I joined
                                 a powerful secret order, whose demands cease only with death, and
                                 whose penalty for denial is a sudden and bloody end. You can judge,
                                 then, my anxiety on being compelled to admit to my establishment,
                                 disguised as a servant, one of its highest officers, and my horror
                                 at hearing of his abrupt departure. Since then I have learned the
                                 unhappy cause. My life is in another's hands. It is for him to
                                 command, and for me blindly to obey. There are two beings in this
                                 world dearer to me than my soul's salvation. To you, M. Granger, as
                                 a Christian gentleman, I commend them. The sealed note inclosed
                                 (the contents of which are a matter of life and death) I beg you
                                 will at once deliver to my wife; and let me conjure you, until the
                                 crisis is over, to make my house at Romainville your home.

                  Leaf the Last.
                  This is the 15th of January, 1858. France is in a blaze of excitement. Last
                     evening, in the Rue Lepelletier, an attempt
                     was made to assassinate the Emperor, by throwing grenades filled with
                     fulminating mercury under the coach that bore the Imperial family to the
                     Italian Opera. Count Felice Orsini, the murderer, himself desperately wounded,
                     has been arrested, and Paris is crying for his blood.
                  For several days I have been the honored guest of Madame Althie Pontalba. It is
                     a golden evening; the sky, an hour ago so clear and blue, is piled with golden
                     clouds, and stretches out into golden rivers, with golden banks, flowing calmly
                     down into a golden sea. The purple slates on the church-steeple, the red tiles on the house-tops, the gardens
                     with their ever-greens and jonquils and little blue violets shrinking out of
                     the frosty air, are wrapped in a golden mist. The light streams through the
                     windows in rays of pure gold, and trickles down the walls in little golden
                     currents. It is an enchanting little villa. The steep gables covered with
                     variegated slate, the thin fluted columns of the verandas, the diminutive
                     marble steps, the broad bow-windows with their transparent plate-glass, look
                     more like a fairy picture than a reality. The trim shrubbery, the airy little
                     statues, and even the white palings, so frail and fanciful in their
                     construction, are charmingly appropriate.
                  It is an enchanting little room. The icy air is warmed by the bright carpet and
                     glowing curtains, and the trickling currents of golden light on the walls are
                     mellowed by the blazing sea-coals. It is a merry little fire, an ardent,
                     earnest, home fire, that shoots out its whimsical little flames as
                     if it meant to burn one to a cinder, and flutters and murmurs to itself and
                     scatters down the white feathery ashes in a very ecstasy of impetuous glee. The
                     green porcelain tiles on the hearth, the oval-shaped chairs, the wonderful
                     tables, and the little easy-chair, are all flushed up, and seem quite enlivened
                     at its sportive tricks. The silver sewing-bird, with its glittering little
                     garnet eyes, is peering curiously down at the painted fish-geranium on the
                     teapot; and the geranium, sweltering by the fire, seems almost wilted with the
                     heat. The teapot pants and struggles under its steaming contents, and looks
                     appealingly at the great china cup on the table; and now a lump of sparkling
                     sugar is dropped into its shiny recesses, and the fragrant odor of that
                     gentlest soother of troubled thoughts pervades the room.
                  How shall I describe the mistress of this fairy resting-place, as she sits in
                     the softened light of this golden winter evening, with the trickling golden
                     currents and the quivering firelight playing on her dress, and the last rays of
                     the sunshine melting into golden threads in her hair? How can I picture the
                     look of girlish innocence on her face, the artless grace of her manner, her
                     delicate feminine ways, and the dainty arrangement of her toilet? How can I
                     tell of the irresistible charm that pervades every article about her, from the
                     little French boot resting on the rug, to the ruffle that circles her white
                     throat? The balmy morning of her young life has passed. The brown calico frock,
                     and the little school bonnet, with its blue veil, have been put away forever.
                     The lithe figure has grown matronly, the childish timidity is gone; the
                     softened face tells of changes,—changes made by much happiness; changes also,
                     alas! by trouble.
                  The dark eyes beam with a deeper tenderness, with a wealth of maternal
                     devotion, with a world of maternal anxiety. The aurora, with its hazy glow, has
                     disappeared, and now the sun shines brightly on the early day; yet through all the love, and all the
                     care, and all the joy of her pure life, remains that radiant smile, the
                     glorious creation of a glorious God, that awakens in man one
                     sensation,—tranquility. O man, with the joy of your own young
                     love, O woman blessed with a remembrance of earlier days, is it needful I
                     should say, Madame Althie Pontalba is the Little Blue Veil?
                  There were two visitors here an hour ago,—a lady and a gentleman. Whatever
                     their lack of ostentation, there was an air of distinction about both that
                     would strike the most casual observer.
                  The cabriolet was plain, but the horses showed the purest blood, and the
                     harness and equipments a neatness one would not see in a day's ride. The
                     gentleman was tall and stately, with a well-shaped aquiline nose, and a
                     mustache and imperial pointed à la militaire;
                     and the lady was petite and graceful, with a face of rare loveliness. The
                     features of both told plainly of a great trial bravely endured. The lady
                     entered alone. Her carriage and demeanor possessed all that quiet elegance
                     which is only met with in the society of the great; but it was with no courtly
                     speech she addressed the mistress of this quiet home. To twine her arms
                     lovingly around that dear form, to draw it close to her bosom, to pour out, in
                     a voice broken with tears, a burst of gratitude, was the mission. In moments
                     when hearts are wrung, we do not practice our grand politeness. A noble life
                     had been saved, a terrible calamity averted. The polished manner of the
                        salon was dropped. A wife
                     spoke, a woman listened. The visit was already a long one when
                     Jean Palliot took charge of the equipage, and, on leaving, it was into
                        his hand the gentleman thrust a roulette of Napoleons.
                  "Sir," cried the indignant coachman, "a soldier of the Grand Army is not a
                     beggar."
                  "It is not the gold, but the portraits of his commander I give the soldier of
                     the Grand Army."
                  "Mon Dieu!" exclaimed the now affrighted
                     veteran, "it is Napoleon!—Vive
                     l'Empereur!"
                  Of the history of that attempt on the life of Napoleon, the world is fully
                     informed. That, thanks to a fortunate warning, the Imperial coach was lined
                     with boiler-iron, is well known. That warning, by direction of her husband, was
                     written by Madame Althie Pontalba, and delivered by me.
                  That the destructive missiles were manufactured in Birmingham, England, our
                     Minister Plenipotentiary has good cause to remember; but that they were
                     smuggled into Paris in the guise of egg-plants, and deposited in the grass-plot
                     in rear of house No. 30 of that now memorable street, I believe is still a
                     mystery.
                  
                  That Count Felice Orsini (the man executed) was concealed for weeks, is on
                     record at the Prefecture; but that he assumed the position of a servant, and
                     the name of Marcel, is not.
                  As for me, I think a great deal, and say nothing; but if the young Pontalba,
                     who now studies type-setting with the Prince Imperial, was not the baby whose
                     clothes I once saw examined at a café, there
                     is no truth in these "Leaves of an Idler."
               
            
            
               MR. BUTTERBY RECORDS HIS CASE.*
               
               J. MOSES BUTTERBY, aged 40 years; a licensed broker; nativity, American;
                  temperament, sanguine; habit, slightly obese; constitution, robust. History of the
                  case as related by himself.
               I don't see how I ever came to be married. It was certainly the last
                  thing my friends expected of me, and it was the last thing I ever expected of
                  myself; but that I am married, Mrs. J. Moses Butterby, and Master
                  Alphonso Moses Butterby, are both here to testify.
               What so aristocratic a family found in me to admire is as much a secret now as
                  then. I don't think it was intellect; for I am afraid that when Nature designed me
                  the "shining" element was left out. Somehow, at school, the composition sent to
                  the village journal was never mine; the declamation repeated at every fresh
                  arrival of directors was always another's; and if, by any chance, a visitor asked
                  to hear a recitation, under no circumstances was I ever invited to show off. My
                  
                     *For many useful hints in this diagnosis, Mr. Butterby is indebted to Mr. E.
                        C. Hancock, of New Orleans.
                  
                   modest part in society was not crowned
                  with greater success. Ma (dear heart!) objected to dancing, and I never learned; I
                  didn't go to picnics, for I don't know how to drive; I tried smoking, and it made
                  me sick; if I drank wine, I was sure to go to sleep: in fact, none of the
                  amusements of other young men ever amused me; and the result was, the money they
                  spent, I saved.
               Envious people have hinted at this as the attraction which first caught the
                  respected mother of my Malinda Jane and the respected mother-in-law of myself; but
                  ideas so unbecoming I repel with proper scorn.
               I do not think myself more stupid than the average of mankind; but, somehow, while
                  they walked through the middle of the streets, I sought the narrow alleys; and
                  while others aspired to noise and distinction, I found retirement and Malinda
                  Jane. (It was in an alley I first met Mrs. J. Moses Butterby—though
                  this in no way concerns the present narrative.)
               Malinda Jane (I trust I am not violating any matrimonial law in thus familiarly
                  speaking of my respected helpmeet)—Malinda Jane, from the first time I beheld her,
                  up to the present period of a long, and I may say intimate, acquaintance, appears
                  to me a paragon of all the modest and retiring virtues. If among her many
                  attractions she is possessed of a distinguishing trait, it lies in the power of
                  her eyes. So much language do their depths contain, that to me, at least, any
                  other is in a great measure a superfluity. I should be afraid to count up the
                  consecutive hours we have spent in this silent converse, reading each other's
                  hearts, as some pleasant poet has styled it, "through the windows of the soul." I
                  would not have you suppose them almond-shaped or piercing. No! Malinda Jane's eyes
                  are round. It was their gentle blue that enchanted me; and there I found the
                  congeniality that cheered my drooping spirit.
               Looking back now upon our courtship, I am inclined to think it must have been
                  uninteresting to a third party; but there is no denying the fact that to us it was
                  most soothing, and well calculated to develop our mutual affection.
               I have no accurate recollection of the event vulgarly called "popping."
                  Fortunately, I congratulate myself on escaping that breach of decorum. If you join
                  my friends in asking "how it came about," I reply, "Naturally." The morning
                  Malinda Jane's mother asked me if I had decided upon October the 24th or November
                  the 24th, I unhesitatingly answered, "November the 24th, if you please;" and the
                  whole affair was accomplished.
               I have said before, Malinda Jane is not of a demonstrative disposition, but thinks
                  (if I may strain a point) ponderously. I have never known her to manifest any will
                  in opposition to my own; and, since I come to think of it, I do not remember her
                     ever manifesting a will in opposition
                  to any one else. In this general term I of course include Master Moses Alphonso
                  Butterby and my most highly respected mother-in-law. Such a family, according to
                  all rule precedent, should be superlatively happy; but there seems to be a
                  disturbing element in all families, and mine, alas! proved no exception. It came
                  about thus.
               Among the few parting words of my deceased ma were, "Mosie" (she always called me
                  Mosie), "never live with your mother-in-law." Treasuring the command, as I may say
                  I treasured everything the dear old lady left, including the property, when
                  finally the day was fixed, I set about obeying it. On an occasion
                  when Mrs. Mountchessington Lawk—the name of my respected mother-in-law—had
                  described our imaginary bower, and her imaginary apartment adjoining, until she
                  had worked herself into a fever of imaginary happiness, I mildly communicated the
                  behest of my departed parent.
               The scene which followed I can only characterize as indescribably touching. The
                  look of blank despair on the face of Malinda Jane, and the tears of rage and
                  mortification that suffused the aristocratic nose of her ma, I frankly confess,
                  went to the bottom of my heart. It was many months before I ceased to regret this
                  rude banishment of their hopes; but, looking upon it from my present stand-point,
                  I am compelled to admit my dear dead ma was right.
               The only accident worthy of remark that happened to Malinda Jane on our
                  wedding-day was a fright. I have reason to congratulate myself at its occurring
                     on that day, instead of a few weeks subsequent. The consequences
                  in the latter event, it is needless to say to married people, might have been
                  serious.
               Passing out of the church-door, we were confronted by a drunken cobbler, who, in a
                  wild and insane manner, proposed "three cheers for Jinny." The assembled crowd of
                  dilapidated urchins hanging around the steps proceeded to give them with a vim
                  faintly suggestive of ridicule. The single glance I obtained of the discourteous
                  offender gave me an idea of chimneys. His face was smoky, his clothes were fleecy,
                  and his general appearance was decidedly sooty throughout. A shock head, and more
                  shocky eyebrows, bore a strange resemblance to the patent chimney-sweep; while his
                  clothes seemed rich in past memories of the profession. I had before caught sight
                  of this individual, in a tumble-down, rickety shop near the residence of Mrs.
                  Mountchessington Lawk. I had, in fact, seen her on more than one occasion
                  bestowing charity upon him in the form of broken victuals; but the recollection
                  failed entirely to account for the effect of his cheers for "Jinny" upon the too
                  tender nerves of my dear wife and her distinguished mother. I attributed the
                  emotion to the trying nature of the ceremony we had just passed through.
                  Reflecting that people do not get married
                  every day, and appalled at the terrible conclusions with which the mind would
                  distract itself by pondering so alarming a topic, I shudderingly abandoned it, and
                  assisted Malinda Jane and her ma, in a fainting condition, to the carriage.
               It is needless to say that the cobbler was at once given in charge to a policeman.
                  The next morning, in consideration of a handsome fee, he moved away. I
                  accomplished this out of regard to the feelings of Mrs. Lawk; but, I must confess,
                  I never regretted anything more.
               The commencement of married life (as many married men will bear me out) is even
                  more consoling than the happiest days of courtship. The smell of varnish on new
                  furniture is as delightfully novel as the odor of the orange-blossoms; the
                  brightness of the new carpets and the crispness of the new curtains both mark an
                  era,—even if the stove is obstinate about drawing or a man
                     is called out of bed to put up the coffee-mill. There was Malinda
                  Jane's night-robe hanging on one side of the bed, and there was my night-robe on
                  the other. My clothes were in the upper drawer of the bureau, hers were in the
                  lower—in such delightful and loving proximity that I own to feeling a new man; I
                  gloried in having some one dependent on me: in short, I was happy.
               I will not deny that there was some trouble about servants (I think Malinda Jane
                  had seven the first ten days). True, the meals were not models of regularity; the
                  chicken sometimes came on in too natural a state,—blue and pulpy,—and the
                  beefsteak betrayed a volcanic appearance, as though reduced to lava by an
                  irruption of gravy. I remember one woman stole a keg of butter, and another went
                  off with half a dozen silver spoons. The former, Malinda Jane ascribed to the cat;
                  the latter, to a defective memory; but, then, Malinda Jane never learned
                  housekeeping (I don't see why she should, poor dear!), and trifles like these
                  failed to mar our household peace.
               I would mention the conduct of Mrs. Mountchessington Lawk as being, for nearly a
                  year, really saintly. Even the rare intervals at which she visited were marked by
                  a manner the reverse of familiar. Almost every evening she would stand on the
                  opposite side of the street, gazing wistfully at us as we sat in the window; but
                  no persuasion induced her to pay a formal visit more than once a fortnight.
               With this striking evidence of my wisdom before me, I grew worldly. I think that
                  during that short year I possessed a better opinion of myself and my capacity than
                  ever before or since.
               Worse than this, I grew pharisaical. I ventured to pity my less fortunate
                  neighbors, bound hand and foot to the slavery of mothers-in-law. I attempted to
                  joke them, and poke them severely in the ribs with my knuckles, when the magic
                  name was mentioned. So often did I
                  congratulate myself on the shrewd stroke of genius displayed, that I fear even her
                  respectability became sadly impaired in my mind, and depreciated to such an extent
                  that I was gradually led to think of her irreverently as an "old gal."
               "Too much for you, old gal," got to be an exclamation so wonderfully consoling
                  that it crept into my sleep, and in those halcyon days I often waked up by the
                  side of Malinda Jane, muttering the words, "Too much for you, old gal." Waked up,
                  I think I said. Ah! would I had never waked up, particularly on the dismal clouds
                  which for a season darkened my domestic sunshine!
               Scarce half a twelvemonth elapsed, ere the retiring disposition of Malinda Jane
                  seemed to shrink into even greater seclusion. I frequently found her powerful mind
                  wandering, and her eyes fixed on vacancy. In our evening walks, which invariably
                  preceded retiring for the night, she leaned heavily on my arm.
               Although the appearance of our daily repasts did not seem to justify it, the cash
                  demands for market-bills suddenly became enormous; and, when I expostulated, my
                  reasonable objections only produced tears. An apparently needless grief had crept
                  into our quiet home, and a lack of confidence that pained me. For many weeks I
                  helplessly pondered the unaccountable mystery.
               At last (oh that it had taken any shape but that!) the enigma developed itself.
                  Returning home one day, I had straightened my collar and smoothed my hair before
                  opening the door (feeling a proper pride in my personal appearance, these
                  preparations are usually a preliminary step), when suddenly, just as the portal
                  moved on its hinges, my sense of smell was saluted with the odorous fumes of gin.
                  From the first suffocating whiff of this aromatic cordial do I date the
                  commencement of my grief. Malinda Jane, I knew, never indulged in as much as a sip
                  of Cologne: so, convinced that the breach of discipline was the guilty act of a
                  servant, with all the offended dignity I could embody in my deportment, I went
                  straight to the chamber of my wife.
               Without being deficient in moral courage, I am not a boisterous man. I do not
                  boast of an eye like Mars, to threaten and command, or glory in producing a
                  shudder with the creaking of my shoes. I mention this to show that my manner,
                  though rebuking, was not intended to be severe. To awe by my authority, and soothe
                  by my condescension, was the design; but even in this limited effort I am
                  conscious of a lamentable failure.
               Seated upon the floor, within an airy castle of dry-goods, whose battlements of
                  flannel and linen cambric frowningly encircled her, was Malinda Jane. Before it,
                  like an investing army, with colors flying, and a face radiant with defiant
                  triumph, was Mrs. Mountchessington
                  chessington Lawk. She had completely opened the siege with the mixture of a hot
                  gin-toddy. My appearance upon this warlike scene was the signal for a salute both
                  loud and watery (in short, tearful), entered into with a mutual heartiness by
                  besieger and besieged. It was, moreover, rendered impressive by a waving spoon,
                  which Mrs. Mountchessington Lawk moved solemnly backward and forward in a warning,
                  funeral manner, as though protesting against some appalling fate. That she was in
                  possession of my apartment, if not my house, I instinctively realized. She sat
                  bolt upright, firm and strong as a Hindoo idol on its altar; a nebulous glare
                  invested her head with a halo, through which bristling hair-pins stuck out in all
                  directions, like lightning-rods with fitfully luminous points. The crystal wall of
                  spectacles that bridged her nose seemed graven with the cabalistic words, "I've
                  got you." A feeling of conscious guilt, of what an enfeebled mind failed to grasp,
                  succumbed to the shock.
               From amid the joint chorus of sobs and tears which burst forth with the wail of a
                  Scottish slogan or an Indian death-song, I heard—
               "Oh, my poor darling! Oh, my poor dear angel! Oh, Mr. Butterby, how
                     could you?"
               "Madam," I inquired, in amazement, "how could I what?"
               It may be well to state the endearing epithet was applied to Malinda Jane.
               "Oh, dear! dear! and all this time she has been scrimping and saving, I was
                  unconscious as a child unborn. Cruel, cruel man!"
               Mrs. Lawk, burying her hand in the depths of her pocket, drew forth an attenuated
                  handkerchief, and carefully wiped her eyes.
               "Please, ma—-" interrupted Malinda Jane.
               "Never, never again shall you leave my protecting wing. Oh, inhuman
                  monster, how could you be so heartless?"
               "Monster" was given with a decidedly unpleasant bite, and recalled my
                  calmness.
               "Mrs. Mountchessington Lawk," I placidly observed, "I have not the remotest idea
                  what you are talking about."
               "Moses Butterby, you're a brute."
               She rose to her feet. A bundle, which, during the excitement, lay on her lap,
                  broke open; and my mother-in-law, like Cleopatra in her roses, stood knee-deep in
                  baby-clothes. In a moment the truth burst upon me. I was unmanned, limp, and
                  disjointed. The shock was too much! A baby Butterby!
               It is needless for me to remark to married men that the era of prospective
                  paternity is an era of sacrifice. Why, in this time-honored custom, so much
                  depends on one's mother-in-law, is a mystery I never could unravel. I look upon it
                  as one of the unaccountable fatalities of man, to be placed in the category of
                     grievances ances with prickly heat.
                  Let it not be understood that my conduct was absolutely lamb-like. It was not
                  until solemnly assured the visit would not be prolonged an unnecessary hour that I
                  finally yielded. I think during that time I had a meaner opinion of my own
                  importance than at any other period of my life. My domestic career resembled that
                  of a child guilty of an irreparable wrong and tolerated only through dire
                  necessity. Indeed, had Mrs. Mountchessington Lawk been a modern Rachel, and I the
                  ruthless destroyer of her household, her conduct toward me could not have
                  exhibited more injured resignation. I somehow grew to feel guilty,
                  and it was only at rare intervals I mustered courage to look either her or Malinda
                  Jane in the face.
               The anticipated addition to the family brought an immediate addition to our
                  furniture. The way the chairs multiplied was marvelous, and the number of sofas
                  that accumulated in our parlor would have been gratifying to a Grand Turk. We
                  suddenly grew plethoric in wash-stands, and appeared to possess armoires and
                  bureaus in quantities and varieties sufficient (as the advertisements say) to suit
                  the most fastidious taste. Even the bath-room did not seem to be neglected, and a
                  modest effort was made to furnish the back gallery. One day I was astonished to
                  find in the hall two hat-racks, and was nearly knocked down by the end of a great
                  four-post bedstead that followed me in. I turned on the intruder, and discovered
                  the little cobbler, apparently as much under the influence of liquor as on the day
                  of his previous eccentricity, stupidly endeavoring to push one post in the door
                  while the other bade fair to thrust itself through the ventilator. It was then I
                  learned that in the array consisted the entire household treasures of Mrs.
                  Mountchessington Lawk.
               I may here mention that the cobbler had contracted a chronic habit of hanging
                  around my back gate, but slunk away whenever I happened to observe him.
               Gradually (leaving out the patients) our house began to wear the aspect of a
                  hospital. The doctor made his appearance three times daily. An aged, red-faced
                  nurse, smelling strong of whisky, wandered about like a disembodied spirit; and a
                  lively young woman, her assistant, clattered up and down stairs at all hours of
                  the day and night. Had the entire city concluded to multiply and replenish, the
                  preparations could not have been on a grander scale.
               Of the exact particulars of the event, I fear I am not altogether clear. I have an
                  indistinct recollection of battling with a midnight thunder-storm, in a hopeless
                  search for our medical man, and that, immediately on my return, that functionary
                  (who had arrived during my absence) dispatched me on an equally important
                  errand.
               I remember pulling a great many night-bells and arousing an unlimited number of apothecaries; but
                  the only act at all fresh in my recollection was slinking in the back gate at
                  three o'clock A.M. (I had been locked out the front way), and finding the little
                  cobbler, and a surrounding crowd of damp newsboys, cheering lustily for "Jinny."
                  The cause of that commotion was also a mystery; but, when I entered the house,
                  Master Moses Alphonso Butterby feebly echoed their shout of triumph.
               Under different auspices, my paternal affection might have developed rapidly; but
                  really, during the first few weeks of Moses Alphonso's existence, our intercourse
                  was so exceedingly limited I scarcely knew him. Any intrusion within his little
                  horizon of flannel or atmosphere of paregoric was so severe a tax on the nerves of
                  Mrs. Lawk, that, out of consideration for her feelings, I rather avoided it.
                  Indeed, had it not been for the activity of that eminently respectable lady, I
                  would have fancied Moses Alphonso a brother-in-law instead of a son.
               Bolted in by flannel bandages, barred with a cambric shirt, locked up in towels,
                  imprisoned in petticoats, and finally incarcerated in a dungeon of wrappers and
                  shawls,—from the first he had the appearance of an unhappy little convict. Mrs.
                  Lawk invariably acted as chief jailer, and, taking him into custody, changed his
                  various places of confinement with the austerity of a keeper of the Tower. My own
                  position hourly became more ambiguous; indeed, had it not been for the monthly
                  bills, I would have scarcely believed myself possessed of a house at all. I
                  impatiently awaited the promised evacuation; and when Moses Alphonso reached his
                  third birthday (babies have these interesting periods monthly instead of annually)
                  I ventured a hint that our own furniture was ample for all requirements.
               To my despair, Mrs. Lawk had rented her house. Malinda Jane's confinement (which
                  in my simplicity I imagined was of short duration), it seemed, had been protracted
                  from the day of her marriage.
               Society was essential to her happiness; and society Mrs. Lawk was determined she
                  should have. If through her illness my privileges experienced curtailment, her
                  recovery brought annihilation itself. Notwithstanding my piteous petition, we
                  suddenly expanded into eminent gentility.
               I am dimly conscious that to many of our guests my introduction was to Mrs. Lawk a
                  poignant mortification. Most of them I never did know. Several, however, seemed
                  invited for my especial benefit; and this piece of malignity will never cease to
                  harrow.
               How could I talk to Miss Rose Buddington Violet, when she let down
                  her back hair and made eyes at the moon? I had no back hair (in fact,
                  none at all to speak of), and scarcely knew there was a moon.
               When Mrs. Jesse Hennessee of Tennessee (whose husband is interested in iron) persisted in making
                  a blast-furnace of the kitchen stove, what could I say?
               There was Miss Aurelia Wallflower, who believed the world hollow, and dolls
                  stuffed with saw-dust, continually expatiating on the sufferings of early
                  Christians. I have never read Fox's Book of Martyrs. With Mrs.
                  Lucretia McSimpkins I had some relief. She was fond of operatic music, and, it is
                  true, banged our piano out of tune at every visit,—indeed, her efforts resembled a
                  boiler-maker's establishment under full headway; but, when she did subside, her
                  perfect and refreshing silence lasted for hours.
               Malinda Jane, for whose amusement all this was designed, did not seem more
                  enthusiastic than myself. Most of her time was spent in a corner, staring
                  confusedly at the assembled company, and contemplating in silent amazement the
                  volubility of her respected parent.
               In addition to toning down my exuberance with the softening influence of ladies'
                  society, Mrs. Lawk decided on a course of restriction. My allowance of clean linen
                  suddenly diminished one-half and under no circumstances was I to presume to take a
                  fresh pocket-handkerchief more than once in two days. She changed the dinner-hour,
                  and declared supper (except for Malinda Jane, poor dear!) strictly prohibited. For
                  a time I mitigated the last grievance by eating oysters; but, an unlucky burst of
                  confidence having divulged the dissipation, a solemn lecture on my duty to my
                  family was its quietus. Every article of food was put under lock and key, the
                  night-latch was changed, and Mrs. Lawk, in addition to her duties as jailer to
                  Master Moses Alphonso, constituted herself turnkey of the establishment. The
                  parlor, except when we "received," was declared forbidden ground: her dismay at
                  finding my papers there, one evening, was perfectly heart-rending. There was a
                  sudden inquiry concerning my loose change, and I was furnished with a
                  memorandum-book in which to write down my daily disbursements. Frequent visits to
                  the opera (oh, the torture of those evenings!) had been an invariable rule with
                  the Mountchessingtons; and, at the risk of rendering impotent the tympanum of both
                  ears, I was compelled to continue that respectable custom. Persons occupying our
                  position should be careful with whom they associated; and the character of my
                  companions underwent a severe investigation. She even interfered with my business,
                  and declared the soap brokerage (one of my most lucrative departments) utterly
                  beneath a gentleman. One by one my little personal comforts faded away. Symptoms
                  of annoyance, persistently repeated, whenever I took off my coat or put on my
                  slippers, kept me at all times prepared for the streets. Cabbage (a favorite dish)
                  was quietly discarded from the dinner-table. My library was turned into a nursery
                  for Master B.
               
               The mute, unresisting manner in which I surrendered my fading glory was
                  surprising. I was appalled in contemplating it; I am breathless now with
                  indignation in referring to it. In short, like Daniel and the Hebrew children, I
                  went up through much tribulation; but my deliverance (oh, how I daily and hourly
                  thank Divine Providence for that blessed moment!) was at hand.
               It was the evening of an election for an alderman, I think; but, as in our retired
                  portion of the city none but the lowest vagabonds gave politics a thought, there
                  was comparatively no excitement. Mrs. Lawk, from the wide circle of society in
                  which she moved, had invited a goodly number to an entertainment. Even our
                  inordinate supply of sofas were filled, and scarcely a chair in the house remained
                  unoccupied. In a rash moment I asked two or three of my own cronies; but not many
                  minutes elapsed ere both my companions and myself were made to feel the folly of
                  the temerity.
               Ignorant of dancing, unskilled in whist or the art of polite conversation, we were
                  terminating our third hour of judicious snubbing in a corner. Mrs. McSimpkins had
                  just concluded a battle-piece of great length and power, when the rehearsal of our
                  shuddering comments was suddenly banished by the deafening roll of a drum. I
                  rushed to the window, and, to my horror, discovered a torchlight procession halted
                  immediately in front of the house. Perhaps a hundred men, in all stages of
                  political enthusiasm and intoxication, surrounded by a crowd of wretched women and
                  girls, waved their lights with demoniac frenzy, and, apparently through a common
                  throat, gurgled three hideous cheers. There was a charge of Mrs. Lawk's friends to
                  the windows, and then a stampede to the back parlor. In vain I expostulated; idly
                  I insisted on my utter lack of interest in the questions of the day: the political
                  party would come in, and how was I to prevent it? The absence of
                  embarrassment and amiable indifference to form that characterized the intrusion
                  was something unique. There was a difference in shape and mode of wearing, about
                  the hats, really refreshing, and a variety of quality and nauseousness in the
                  cigars everybody smoked, that, if anything, added zest to the scene.
               Boots unconscious of the existence of a door-mat speedily graced the hall-floor
                  with a perfect cushion of mud. Their wearers, rapidly dividing into groups,
                  plunged into earnest conversation concerning the events of the day. The candid
                  manner in which my own character was discussed, and their frankness in touching on
                  my peculiarities, was not the least gratifying feature of the visit. In the course
                  of two or three minutes, one would have supposed my residence a political
                  club-room, and my uninvited guests in the peaceful enjoyment of their inalienable
                  rights.
               
               At length there was a cry of "Here he is! here he is!"
               Every window on the square went up, and the neighborhood suddenly whitened with
                  night-capped heads. I heard a crash of glass, and felt convinced that this time
                  the ventilator had gone for certain. There was a fresh rush from the street, and,
                  finally, seated on a shutter (borne on the shoulders of four stout men) and
                  complacently swinging his legs, appeared the little cobbler. A radiant joy in his
                  face, and a knowing wink in his eye, told plainly the combined influence of
                  triumph and unlimited libation. Reeling profoundly to the assembled company, and
                  casting a drunken leer at Mrs. Lawk, he exclaimed, "Mary Ann,—'s—no use,
                  I'm—'s—good—as—he—is. I'm—an (hic)—an—Alderman. Butterby—embrace—your poor
                  ol'—father—'n—law."
               Of the conclusion of this episode, I fear I am somewhat confused. I have an
                  indistinct recollection that Mrs. Lawk and Malinda Jane were both carried off in a
                  fainting condition; and that my enthusiastic friends gave three rousing cheers for
                  Alderman Lawk, and three more for me. I remember my father-in-law insisted on
                  holding a meeting then and there and nominating me for Governor. His constituents
                  considered the idea most judicious, and warmly applauded it. Mrs. Lawk's friends
                  disappeared precipitately through the back way, amid renewed sounds of crashing
                  glass and breaking china, while I hovered around the unterrified Democracy of the
                  —— ward, earnestly beseeching them to go into the street. My efforts were at last
                  crowned with success. I was left alone amid the wreck of my household gods; but
                  for an hour afterward, as I lay cowering on the sofa, I could hear disconnected
                  speeches from my door-steps, encouraged from time to time with tremendous cheers
                  for Lawk, cheers for Butterby, and cheers for "Jinny." The same general
                  mystification and uncertainty regarding my actions pervaded the entire night; but
                  morning brought relief, and in more ways than one. Mrs. Lawk had disappeared, and
                  her chattels were following. The victory was as sudden as it was unexpected.
               Who would have thought that out of this storm of mortification was to spring the
                  bow of promise? The day after witnessed the exit of my most respected
                  mother-in-law and her amiable husband, for Cheyenne City; from which place we have
                  recently heard from them as ornamenting the first Comanche and Black-feet
                  circles.
               Her reason for concealing the relationship was never developed. Indeed, I was too
                  much overcome with joy ever to inquire. Undisturbed by discordant elements, the
                  fires of matrimonial affection burning as brightly as when lighted upon my
                  marriage morn, I now calmly survey the
                  re-establishment of a happy household, over which reign domestic bliss and—Master

               Such is an accurate statement of the case, all of which is respectfully
                  submitted.
            
            
               DIAMONDS AND HEARTS.
               A Sketch of Rio De Janeiro.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  THE sun was setting on the Passeio Publico. On one side the fading light gilded
                     the delicate green of the palms; and on the other it shimmered on the placid
                     waters of the bay.
                  It whitened the little lodges, nestling in the luxuriance of foliage, and
                     glistened on the gaudy boats, lying motionless on the pearly bosom of the deep.
                     It sparkled on the little lakes where troops of joyous children gathered around
                     the swans, and lost itself in the blue mists that circled the green and purple
                     mountains in the distance.
                  Past the clustered giants of the sea, whose banners told of mighty nations that
                     made war, past the forts where the sentries kept weary pace on the ramparts, it
                     lighted up the "Pão de Assucar;" through the crowded thoroughfares where the
                     hum of traffic told of multitudes in peace, it glowed on the Corcovado.
                  
                  Far into the golden west, past the islands that dotted the harbor, past the
                     last villa of São Christovão, it burned and blazed among the hills, until
                     shadowy peaks, that seemed but ghosts in the dim remoteness, burst resplendent
                     on the view, gorgeous in their prodigality of color.
                  Rio de Janeiro had mustered her children in crowds. Long and broad as was the
                     promenade, its marble mosaics scarce contained room for the multitude. Anxious
                     matrons, on one side, gathered on the granite stairs to watch their children in
                     the garden beneath; heedless youngsters, on the other, hung over the
                     balustrades for a view of the tide swelling at the foot of the wall; fair young
                        donnas, bewildered at the throng of
                     admirers, filled the air with peals of glad laughter; exquisite senhors, thrilled by the music, yielded themselves
                     willing captives to the seductive influences of the hour.
                  Who but a Latin can understand the wild abandon on a festa? who but he can enter into the spirit of the many fête-days
                     sanctioned by his ancient Church?
                  Armand Dupleisis, in his seat over the sea, stared absently at the jocose
                     revelers, for he was a stranger in a strange land. He leaned back on the
                     granite railings with the easy indolence of an invalid, though his frame was
                     robust and sinewy as a mountaineer's. The hidden power of his bronzed and
                     Moresque features, if developed, might inspire a certain amount of wonder; but
                        then you would as readily have sought expression in the statues
                     below. His gaze was almost indifferent; yet the unmoving eyes took a mental
                     inventory of everything. Had their owner been provided with a memorandum-book
                     and a stubby pencil, the catalogue could not have been more complete.
                  Among the hundreds present, those eyes picked out one man and one woman. They
                     followed them in their rambles through the dome-roofed shelters; they
                     scrutinized them as they lingered near the band; they searched them out when
                     mingled with the throngs on the promenade. They did not seem to be watching,
                     but they were; and their owner did not look interested, but he was.
                  The man, physically speaking, was a marvel; but there was an air of foppish
                     elegance in his movements, and a silky kind of beauty, like that of a leopard.
                     His head was small, but finely formed, and covered with flossy hair black as
                     ebony. His features, though clearly cut, wore, from their extreme delicacy, an
                     almost feminine expression. His hands were small and exquisitely shaped; his
                     mustache curled gracefully from his lip; and, when speaking, he bit the ends of
                     it in a nervous, almost embarrassed way.
                  The woman was a proud, passionate daughter of the sun. The brown blood of the
                     sun burned in her veins, and the soul of the sun streamed shaded from her eyes.
                     A sumptuous splendor mingled, moist and languid, with their light. She was clothed in the sunlight. It glistened in
                     the soft darkness of her hair; it glowed in the rubies that clung to her
                     swelling throat; it flashed on her robe tremulous with radiance. From a
                     coquettish little hat a long white plume fluttered over her curls, and a
                     floating cloud of fleecy under-sleeve half concealed an arm of snowy purity.
                     Her life, though in its spring, seemed goldened with the flush of summer; her
                     morning flashed with the meridian luster of perfect day; and yet the eyes that
                     scanned so closely remained undazzled. Their owner had heard of her, and of her
                     conversation, sparkling with wit and humor and mocking irony; but he was not
                     fascinated. He saw but a woman for whom no surprises appear to survive. What
                     see we?
                  Were you to question the crowd, they would tell you the man was Edgar Fay;
                     that, years before, his father brought him, a velvet-coated boy, to Rio de
                     Janeiro; that shortly afterward he died, leaving the son and a baby sister a
                     small fortune; that the sister, being under the control of a mother who had
                     deserted her husband, was never heard of; and that the guardians, finding no
                     coheir, had spent the money on Edgar's education, afterward securing him a
                     position under the Imperial government.
                  About the woman they would say, "She is Mademoiselle Milan, just arrived on the
                     French packet, to fill an engagement as leading lady at the Alcasar."
                  Concerning Dupleisis, except that he had arrived recently on the English
                     steamer, that he seemed to be a man of leisure, and paid promptly for what he
                     received, they could tell you nothing.
                  The glowing sunshine faded entirely out of the sky, the thick-walled houses
                     flickered faintly through their staring casements, the lamps on the streets
                     glimmered dismally at the returning crowds, and one by one the lights began to
                     quiver on the water. The Passeio, an hour before too cramped for the multitude,
                     was now deserted; but Dupleisis, nothing daunted, smoked on. Disgusted at the
                     necessity which compelled his presence, and annoyed at the stupidity of the few
                     people he had met, he commented savagely on their peculiarities, and
                     anathematized with merciless ingenuity.
                  "Pshaw, M. Dupleisis! you are only angry because you cannot have chicken-pie
                     every day for dinner. What have the Brazilians done to you?"
                  Dupleisis gazed at the speaker in astonishment.
                  "Their impudence, rather than degeneracy, perhaps should surprise."
                  "Really, M. Dupleisis! I fear you are a cynic. In the gayest promenade in the
                     empire, you are filled with violence. You are a spoiled child looking in at a
                     shop-window and admiring nothing. Are you going to cry with a mouth
                        full of sugar-plums?
                  "Pardon me," said the Frenchman, haughtily, "but it is an awkward habit of mine to feel curious
                     concerning the names of my associates."
                  "Let me hasten to enlighten you:—Percy Reed, diamond-dealer, Rua do Ouvidor, at
                     your service. You brought me a letter of introduction; but, unluckily, I was
                     out of town when you arrived."
                  The dark eyes glanced at the speaker closely as they had watched the man and
                     the woman. There was something in the face that commanded respect. The broad
                     high forehead, the eyes flashing with scornful mirth, and the thin lips curling
                     with such a whimsical mixture of kindliness and sarcasm, bespoke a man of mind.
                     Since reaching Rio, Dupleisis had searched for these three, and he liked this
                     one the best. Reed took out his eye-glass, and, adjusting it carefully on his
                     nose, surveyed Dupleisis deliberately from head to foot.
                  "You'll do," he remarked, after some little thought; "but I still believe that
                     in your bread-and-butter days some friend thought you sarcastic. I knew a young
                     girl once who was told she had a musical laugh, and the consequence was she
                     giggled the rest of her life. Now, if you don't wish to see us locked in here
                     for the night, come along."
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE establishment of Percy Reed, diamond-dealer, Rua do Ouvidor, was a
                     corner-building, almost the exact counterpart of a dozen edifices on the same
                     square. The basement was of polished blocks of black and white marble, and the
                     upper portion faced with blue and white porcelain tiles. From above, the front
                     rooms looked out through bow-windows at small balconies with brass-knobbed
                     railings and thick glass floors; those in rear looked through glass doors at a
                     flat roof, one story high, paved with black and white marble squares. This
                     breathing-place of the household was adorned with pots of flowers and
                     evergreens and provided with neat iron chairs. It was divided from the
                     breathing-place of the adjoining household by a low brick wall.
                  Below, pedestrians gazed in through rose-wood doors and French plate windows.
                     The counting-room had rather the appearance of an elegant boudoir than of a
                     place of business. The floor was of alternate strips of satin-wood and ebony;
                     the walls and ceiling were paneled with rose-wood, and rows of small glistening
                     show-cases contained samples of the dazzling gems. In the rear—but so covered
                     with the glossy finish as to be almost imperceptible—was a huge vault,
                        containing ing precious stones of
                     a value almost sufficient to change the fate of an empire. Farther back, and
                     opening on the side street, was a long, dark hall-way, from which a winding
                     staircase led to the residence above. The second floor of the adjoining house
                     was usually let furnished to members of the dramatic profession; and on this
                     occasion it was occupied by Mademoiselle Adrienne Milan, of the Alcasar.
                  
                  The day after the festa, the lady, in a
                     simple morning toilet, had moved her table and sewing-chair into the open air.
                     Instead of sewing, she was occupied in furbishing up some old stage jewelry,
                     and her visitor, stretched on an iron bench, calmly puffed a cigar. From his
                     manner, one would imagine him master rather than guest; but that Mademoiselle
                     Milan and a female servant were the sole occupants there is not a doubt.
                  With the utmost nonchalance, he had ordered a pillow, and, his ambrosial locks
                     buried in its soft depths and his feet raised high above his head, he lounged a
                     modern Apollo, scrutinizing with supercilious indifference the lady's work. If
                     the cigar-ashes at his side were a criterion, he had been lying there for
                     hours; and if the nervous movements of Mademoiselle were significant, he had
                     been lying there for an hour too long. For some minutes the silence was broken
                     only by the jingle of the gaudy ornaments, and then the man exclaimed, "But,
                        ma chère Adrienne, I am short—deuced
                     short. Delay is ruin. How am I to live?"
                  "Work," said the lady, curtly.
                  "There you are again, with your cursed woman's wisdom! What are you here
                        for? What am I here for?"
                  Mademoiselle answered, with a shrug, "Judging from your position, I would say,
                     to enjoy your ease; from your language, to annoy me."
                  He raised himself to a sitting posture. "Adrienne Milan, do you take me for an
                     idiot?"
                  "Edgar Fay, you are insulting."
                  "Prima donnas of the Alcasar are not usually
                     so sensitive," broke out the visitor, with a laugh.
                  The woman sprang to her feet, and in the haste overturned the table with its
                     glittering baubles.
                  "Go! go!" she fiercely exclaimed. "The compact between you and me is sacred.
                     Another word, and I reveal all."
                  White as any ghost, he started up, and, without uttering a sound, slunk
                     away.
                  Trembling with rage and mortification, Mademoiselle Milan sunk into a seat; but
                     hers was not a nature to dwell long on trouble. With a woman's spirit of order,
                     she commenced picking up the finery scattered around her, and putting it away.
                     Among other things was a box of quartz diamonds, which, being small, flew in
                     all directions. All within view were collected, and she turned to go.
                  "There are several lying near that flower-pot in the corner."
                  
                  The lady looked up. Standing on a chair on the other side, and leaning lazily
                     over the wall, was Armand Dupleisis.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  
                     
                        "Has Flora proved more attractive than Thalia?"
                     
                  
                  ARMAND DUPLEISIS, long since become acquainted, stood examining a bouquet of
                     roses and geraniums in the music-room of Mademoiselle Milan, and the lady was
                     seated near him, trifling with the keys of her piano.
                  "I gaze on beauty, mademoiselle, to accustom my eyes to divinity."
                  "Really! Were it not for his gigantic proportions, one would suppose man was
                     reared in an atmosphere of compliment."
                  "You mistake us. Though not a favorite diet, in Pekin we devour rice with the
                     gusto of the most polished Celestial."
                  "I bow to your sincerity. Women, then, are to be talked to of birds, and
                     flowers, and stars, and fed on water-cresses?"
                  "Women, mademoiselle, make men apt scholars in the art of pleasing. I have
                     studied much."
                  "How singular!" rejoined the lady. "I should never have detected it."
                  "True art, mademoiselle, lies in its concealment. My life has been one of
                     concealment."
                  "Now you pique my curiosity," she replied. "Do let me learn the 'veritable
                     historie.'"
                  The smile on Mademoiselle Milan's face showed that the interest was feigned,
                     but the grim look about Dupleisis' mouth proved him conscious of it. A man
                     without an object would have changed the subject at once; but Dupleisis
                        had an object, and did not.
                  "I was ushered into this land of hope and sunny smiles with scarcely any other
                     patrimony than a name."
                  "What limited resources!" ejaculated the lady, with a slight sneer.
                  "While blushing with the consciousness of my virgin cravat, I went to Paris,
                     that sacred ark, which saves from shipwreck all the wretched of the provinces
                     if but crowned with a ray of intellect."
                  "And which saved you, of course," continued the lady.
                  "Through the influence of my friends, I entered the École Polytechnique, and, after graduating, cut the army, and
                     cast my fate, for better or for worse, in the flowery paths of literature."
                  "Now, do not say it proved for worse."
                  "It was for worse," said Dupleisis. "My family were treated shabbily; 'the muse
                     is a maiden of good memory,' but a cocote; my
                     satiric efforts were rewarded by a lettre de
                        cachet."
                  
                  "What a loss to France!"
                  "At the accession of the Emperor, I returned, a prodigal son of Mars, and now
                     manage to sustain myself by—-"
                  "By writing sonnets to Brazilian hospitality," interrupted mademoiselle.
                  Dupleisis bowed gravely. "Anxious to do so, mademoiselle, but I have not, as
                     yet, collected sufficient material."
                  The retort crimsoned the lady's face, and Dupleisis adroitly covered her
                     confusion by asking her to sing.
                  "What will you say to me, when you speak of yourself as though you were a block
                     of wood?"
                  "The prosy geologist talks pedantically of a granite rock, and is mute when he
                     sees the flower that blooms above it."
                  "Mon Dieu, M. Dupleisis! I cannot sit by and
                     hear Chamfort so ruthlessly robbed."
                  "Mademoiselle, you are unkind. I say nothing complimentary but you cry, 'Stop
                     thief!'"
                  The lady played a few sparkling bars, and sang. She had a magnificent voice,
                     but her music, like herself, was studied, faultless, but chilling as the north
                     wind. It swelled deep and full, in rich, flute-like tones, now ringing clear
                     and sweet in pure, rippling notes, now quivering low in waves of enchanting
                     melody. There were soft, gurgling sounds, that flowed wild and free as a
                     mountain-rivulet. It was brilliant, bewildering; but the dazzle was like the
                     frozen glitter of an icicle. Suddenly, a look of unmitigated scorn swept across
                     her face, and the music ceased.
                  She eyed Dupleisis for a moment half defiantly, and asked, "Would you really
                     like to hear me sing?"
                  Dupleisis answered, earnestly, "Yes."
                  A plaintive prelude followed, and her voice mingled with it almost
                     imperceptibly. It was one of those gloomy Spanish ballads, dramatic rather than
                     harmonious, that poured forth its mournful strains in the fitful measure of an
                     Æolian harp. There were bursts of pathos that seemed to echo from her very
                     soul. It was fierce, mocking, passionate; tender, wicked, terrible. It sank in
                     sobs of melting compassion; it implored pity and sympathy in words of thrilling
                     entreaty; and then it rose, cold and calm, in sounds of withering derision and
                     implacable hate. It trembled, it scorned, it pleaded, it taunted, it struggled,
                     it hoped, it despaired; and then, as if for the dead, it wailed and died in a
                     long, helpless cry of sorrow.
                  Dupleisis sat listening to the dreary history entranced. There was love, and
                     feeling, and fond womanly devotion; there was refined thought, gentle pity, and
                     warm generous charity; and there was a neglected heart, a gloomy, embittered
                     mind, a life lost in utter desolation. The glorious being whom God had created to cheer and encourage
                     man was a beautiful statue.
                  Who would teach that heart to feel again? Who turn to quivering flesh that
                     rigid marble? Yet the man of iron sat masking his features, controlling his
                     emotions, with every muscle under his command. It was a flash of real feeling
                     from a proud, sensitive woman, but it passed lightly as a snowdrift on a frozen
                     river.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  "MR. REED, you certainly are the most old-maidish man I ever saw in my
                     life."
                  The room did appear old-maidish, as Mademoiselle Milan stood looking in. The
                     balmy breeze fluttered pleasantly past the little French curtains, the glowing
                     sunshine warmed the delicate tracery of the walls and lighted up the flowers on
                     a huge rug spread on the bare floor. A tiny bouquet of Spanish violets, in a
                     wonderful little vase, filled the room with a dreamy perfume, such as one
                     sometimes imagines he would find in those far-off little islands in the South
                     seas. There were crayon sketches hung between the windows, here and there a
                     statuette filled a niche, and out on the glass-floored gallery was a perfect
                     bower of flowers. There were several easy-chairs placed about in comfortable
                     positions, as if they were all made to sit on, and a great lounge, covered with
                     green marine, stood, like a small grass-mound, under one of the windows.
                  Percy Reed, seated near a table loaded with needle-books, silk-winders, and a
                     hundred little trinkets, with a cigar in his mouth, and a sock, with a little
                     round gourd shoved into the foot of it, in his hand, was intently occupied in
                     darning a hole in the toe.
                  "There! don't throw away your cigar. Mon
                        Dieu! can a person never see you without being overpowered at your
                     grand politeness?"
                  "Mademoiselle, I make no apologies. Buttons will come off, and stockings will
                     contract holes. Washerwomen are heartless. The mountain will not come to
                     Mahomet: therefore I darn 'em myself."
                  "A philosopher under all circumstances. And pray what have you done with your
                     pupil in morality and economy?"
                  "Oh, Dupleisis? I have started him out in a carriage to view the wonders of
                     this 'River of January.' By-the-by, if you ever hope to attract, don't dream of
                     mentioning figures in the presence of our mysterious Frenchman."
                  "Why?"
                  "The branch of mathematics known as simple addition seems to be the crowning
                     glory of his intellect. He knows to
                     a milreis the value of this building, from
                     chimney-pot to cellar."
                  "Blessed with curiosity," said Mademoiselle, significantly.
                  "Mathematics entirely. If Armand Dupleisis were entering the pearly gates of
                     Paradise, amid the resounding hallelujahs of cherubim and seraphim, he would
                     deliberately count the cost of the entire wardrobe, before he thought of
                     receiving the waters of eternal life."
                  "Mr. Reed," said Mademoiselle, earnestly, "who did you ever see of
                     whom you could not speak lightly?"
                  "One person in the world—my mother. Sometimes in my dreams of the 'auld lang
                     syne' I almost see that dear little lady; she had a window just like that, with
                     the foliage rustling over it just as this does. Never, mademoiselle, does that
                     little morning-wrapper come up before my eyes without making me a better and a
                     purer man."
                  Both were silent for some minutes after this. Mademoiselle Milan sat leaning
                     her face against the crimson lining of her chair, apparently lost in
                     thought.
                  At length she said, "Would to God that all men understood women as well as
                     you!"
                  "But your mother; where is she, mademoiselle?"
                  The lady's face turned as pale as marble, and her little white hands grasped
                     the arms of her chair, until they seemed almost imbedded in the ebony. She
                     attempted tempted an utterance, but her voice failed her, and there was a dead
                     silence.
                  Reed was a man of feeling. He did not talk, nor persuade her to talk. He did
                     not even sit doing nothing. He went out on the balcony to examine the flowers.
                     He climbed noiselessly up the lattice-work for jasmines fluttering in the
                     evening breeze. Finally, he took up a violin and played.
                  He always played well, but now the music was low and soft,—old Scotch ballads,
                     wild and mournful, touching little German songs, plaintive romances full of
                     subdued passion. Mademoiselle Milan did not notice him; but in her heart she
                     felt grateful for his consideration. Gradually the color returned to her face,
                     and, soothed by the sad, sweet strains, she sunk into dreamy reverie.
                  "When we have reached another sphere, where emotion governs instead of thought,
                     I think that man will speak in splendid music."
                  Reed looked at her earnestly for a moment, and then said, "Mademoiselle, why
                     did you never write?"
                  "The public treats authors very much as drill-sergeants do recruits,—drunk the
                     first day, and beaten the rest of their lives."
                  Great minds rule the public."
                  "And yet I fear your courage would ooze away when you came to lay a lance at
                     rest against such a windmill as the common sense of the nineteenth century,
                     whirling its rotary sails under the steady breeze of ridicule. I am a woman, and know a woman's
                     place. I have had dreams in my time,—'dreams like that flower that blooms in a
                     single night, and dies at dawn;' but they are passed. You see, I carry the
                     glare of the foot-lights even here." And a bitter smile curled from her
                     lip.
                  "Mademoiselle," said Percy, solemnly, "the foot-lights enable you to move man
                     to a hundred passions."
                  "Yes; it reduces me to the level of a harlequin, to be laughed with, and
                     laughed at. Who are my friends? Are they the idle
                     boys who send me bouquets and never mention my name without looking unutterable
                     things? Have I no tastes, no likings, no feelings, no emotions? In the name of
                     God, was I created only to memorize so many lines of Racine, Corneille, or
                     Voltaire per diem?"
                  It was a tone of almost ferocity with which she spoke, and the trembling lip,
                     the flashing eye, and the swollen veins on her temple betrayed the self-scorn
                     racking her heart within her.
                  A bang at the hall-door, and heavy footsteps on the marble pavement, forced her
                     to composure.
                  "Old-maidish to the last!" (the lady commenced picking the dead leaves off a
                     geranium). "This geranium looks as if you had watched it a year; and this old
                     gray hat, I suppose, you have hung above it for good luck."
                  "The hat belongs to a friend abroad, and is not to be moved until his safe
                     return; but the geranium was presented not a week ago by my ever-faithful
                     money. You see the magic charm. Here are careful watching, weeks of anxiety,
                     and, no doubt, a modicum of affection (for I have heard people say
                     they loved flowers), bartered away for one milreis."
                  "Apropos of money,—I thought I was to have a view of the treasures of Aladdin,
                     locked up in the vaults below."
                  "Of a surety you shall."
                  Reed excused himself, and in a short time reappeared, bearing a large iron
                     casket. Mademoiselle Milan's face turned a shade or two paler when she saw him;
                     for he was accompanied by Edgar Fay. It had now become quite dark, and Percy
                     Reed lighted the gas-jet before opening the casket. It was made in imitation of
                     the ordinary iron safe, but opening at the top.
                  When the glare of the gas struck the dark recesses of the velvet lining, a
                     gleam of radiance shot up that fairly dazzled. Great grains of light, large as
                     peas, shimmered and glittered with an unearthly brilliancy. Blue, purple,
                     violet, and a gorgeous white that combined the whole, sparkled in their turn
                     with weird splendor. It looked like a flash from heaven turned suddenly on a
                     startled world. Both Mademoiselle Milan and Fay stood breathless with
                     astonishment, and it was many minutes before they regained their composure.
                  
                  Hearing the heavy rumbling caused by the lowering of the iron shutters in the
                     counting-room, Mademoiselle urged Mr. Reed to return the gems to the vault
                     before it closed.
                  He assured her it was entirely unnecessary, saying that larceny was a crime
                     unknown to Brazilians, and that he had provided for exigencies such as this.
                     Moving the piles of thread and embroidery silk to the side of the table, he
                     touched a spring, and a lid flew up. The table, though presenting the
                     appearance of fragility itself, was really iron, and contained a vault that
                     would puzzle the most expert of burglars.
                  Just then Dupleisis called from the street, and both Reed and Edgar Fay went
                     out on the gallery to see him. He had made arrangements to spend the night with
                     a friend, and the three stood chatting for some minutes, the Frenchman giving
                     an amusing description of his adventures among the Brazileiros.
                  
                  Shortly afterward, Mademoiselle Milan and Fay took their leave. The wind by
                     this time was blowing so fiercely that no taper could live in the gusts; so
                     both were compelled to grope their way through the hall, which was dark as
                     Erebus.
                  The door was faithfully bolted, and the casket carefully placed in the secret
                     vault; but when Percy Reed awoke in the morning he found both open, and the
                     diamonds, worth a million, missing.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  "MADEMOISELLE MILAN, I wish you good-evening."
                  The lady bowed. She was reclining on a divan, before a large mirror, absently
                     turning the rings on her finger; but in her simple négligée she appeared more
                     beautiful than ever. The long, dark ringlets gave the oval face a look of
                     earnestness, the fierce Italian blood glowed in her cheeks, and the flashing
                     brilliancy of her eyes had a restlessness that was unusual. She was evidently
                     suffering from nervous excitement; but there was a fascinating grace in every
                     movement, and even in the easy indolence of her position.
                  "Take a seat on that sofa, by the side of my little dog. Is he not pretty?"
                  "Very," replied Dupleisis; "but I am more interested in his mistress. We have
                     not met for a week,—not, in fact, since two thieves robbed Mr. Reed of a
                     fortune."
                  Dupleisis said this with pointed significance; but the lady preserved the
                     coolest unconcern.
                  "The muse of the foot-lights is the most jealous of mistresses."
                  "True," replied Dupleisis; "but in this case she has had rivals."
                  "I choose to amuse myself with a crowd, who eat my suppers and make me
                     laugh."
                  
                  "And among the jesters you number the Minister of War and Chief of Police."
                  "I may need their aid."
                  "Mademoiselle Milan, you do need their aid; but, with all your
                     charming courtesies, you have not secured it."
                  "M. Dupleisis chooses to speak in enigmas. I am obtuse."
                  "At our last most agreeable tête-à-tête, you
                     were pleased to feel interested in my somewhat sluggish history. Would you
                     pardon a few inquiries concerning yours?"
                  "M. Dupleisis, I am at your service."
                  "Two months since, you resided in the Rue de Luxembourg, Paris."
                  "This is an assertion. I expected an inquiry."
                  Dupleisis took from a pocket-book a half-sheet of thin, closely-written
                     letter-paper, and spread it out on the table before him.
                  "It was about two months ago that this document was blown from your window. Am
                     I right, Mademoiselle Milan?"
                  "It was blown from my writing-desk into the street."
                  "I knew I was right; for 'twas I that picked it up. It is a letter, written in
                     Rio de Janeiro, and contains the details of a plot to rob one of the wealthiest
                     diamond-dealers in this city. You may think my interest singular, mademoiselle;
                     but the merchant deals with every large jewelry-house in Paris. Their loss by a
                     felony of this magnitude would be immense."
                  Mademoiselle Milan listened with an air of indifference that was absolutely
                     freezing.
                  "You may think it singular, also, that when, shortly afterward, you started for
                     Bordeaux, I went by the same train; and that when you concluded to prolong your
                     journey to Brazil by the French packet, via Lisbon, it was I who
                     assisted with your luggage."
                  "There is nothing low enough to be singular in M. Dupleisis."
                  "Mademoiselle Milan, one week ago you and Edgar Fay went into the hall-way of
                     Mr. Reed's house together, and you went out alone. Denial is
                     useless, for I saw you. If you remember, the door was banged
                     violently, and it was you who did it. A careless servant locked him in. He
                     opened the secret vault in that table, and abstracted diamonds worth a million.
                     You were wise in courting the Minister of War and Chief of Police, but your
                     passports have been stopped. No power under heaven can get you out of Rio."
                  For the first time her countenance changed, and she looked at Dupleisis with a
                     smile of contemptuous pity.
                  "So I was not wrong in suspecting you to be an agent of the police. How strong
                     an alloy of cunning exists in every fool! The man whom you believe to have
                     stolen a million is my own brother. The letter which caused this display of
                     sagacity was paid for out of my
                     wretched weekly earnings. At the sacrifice of every sou I owned, I came here to thwart the plot it spoke of."
                  Dupleisis glanced at her with an incredulous sneer.
                  "He wrote to Paris for a woman to assist him,—what weaklings you men are!—and,
                     utterly unable to prevent the larceny, I pretended to be his accomplice. While
                     you were exposing your ill-breeding by coarse criticisms on a people in every
                     way your superior, I substituted for the real diamonds the paste gems you were
                     so particular in noticing. What was stolen is my property. Go back to Mr. Reed,
                     and tell him his diamonds are bundled into an old hat that hangs on the wall of
                     his sitting-room; and tell him, furthermore, it was I who put them there. I did
                     court the favor of the Minister of War, but it was to put that man in the army.
                     I have watched over him for years, and, by the blessing of God, I will watch
                     over him to the end. He has never known me, nor will he—". Suddenly she turned
                     livid, and nervously clasped her hands over her breast.
                  "M. Dupleisis, I regret my inability to be present at the Assembly; but,
                     really, I am engaged."
                  Dupleisis looked at her in astonishment.
                  Edgar Fay, pale and trembling, was standing behind them. He must have heard
                     every word; for he sunk helplessly and faint on the floor, hiding his face in
                     the depth of his degradation.
                  Why should we follow them any further? Can I tell how the
                     miserable man, cringing at the feet of that pure woman, narrated his dreary
                     history of folly, extravagance, and dishonor? Need it be said that, through all
                     his dissipation, frivolity, and crime, his gentle sister clung to him, and,
                     smiling through her tears, bade him go and sin no more? She stole upon him like
                     a shadow in the night, and, her labor of love ended, faded away. No entreaty of
                     the generous diamond-dealer dissuaded her; no apology of the detective turned
                     her from the one fixed purpose. The star of the Alcasar rose, culminated, and disappeared in two weeks.
                  O woman! I have seen you in the brilliant whirl of society, where all was
                     gayety, gallantry, and splendor. I have seen your eyes flash triumphant, and
                     daintily gaitered feet move fast and furious to the music of les pièces d'or. I have seen brave men stand
                     fascinated at your side, and careless youth overflow the bumper of
                     Johannisberger to health, and youth, and beauty. I have heard the stern cynic
                     jingle his Napoleons in unison with the frantic strains, and sneer out,
                        "Vive la bagatelle!" Daughters of marble!
                     daughters of marble! Turn your snowy arms to the glittering gorgeous, scatter
                     the golden heaps, deluge the world with champagne. Diamonds,
                        diamonds must win hearts. I have watched you in a deeper,
                     darker, madder whirl, while I have seen fair, blooming flowers wither in the hot hands of drunken
                     licentiousness. Oh, Becky Sharp! Oh, Dame aux
                        Camellias! you are but single dandelions in a parterre of
                     heliotropes!
                  There was hurrying to and fro on the broad decks. Bustling cabin-boys rushed
                     hither and thither with great baskets of stores; the jauntily-arrayed
                     stewardess chatted saucily with her friends in the shore-boats; sailors slipped
                     quietly over the bulwarks with their secretly-collected menageries of pets;
                     watermen contended stoutly at the gangway for a landing near the steps; and
                     dusky cameradas cursed, in broken French and
                     Portuguese, at the weight of the trunks. Here a naturalist trembled with
                     anxiety for the fate of a coral; there a bird-fancier worked himself into a
                     small frenzy at the jostling of his parrots. Bones, fossils, plants, bottled
                     fish, bananas, oranges, and mangoes, were mingled in one promiscuous heap.
                     Monkeys of all tribes and shades of complexion, from the golden Mumasitte to
                     the fierce Machaca, were crowded pell-mell into passages; and forcing them
                     against the bulkheads were boxes of wine, jellies, and doces in their infinitesimal variety. Men and women, crouching in
                     retired places, hurried through their few broken words of parting, and eyes
                     were dried for the great heart-throb left for the very last. Off in the painted
                     boats, ship-chandlers smilingly bowed their bon
                        voyage, and faces pallid with grief gazed with swollen eyes at
                     loved ones convulsed with emotion. The gorgeous custom-house officer has smoked
                     his last cigarette and taken his last "dispatch;" the belated passenger, whose
                     agonizing shrieks and spasmodic contortions finally attracted the attention of
                     the captain, is at length, carpet-bag in hand, on board, and the sharp crash of
                     the gong severs the lingering groups.
                  Who ever made an ocean voyage undismayed by the knell! It is the trumpet-tongue
                     of reality, awakening the mind from the lethargy of its distress. The woe of
                     separation, the terror of the journey, the vague apprehension of the future,
                     meeting, burst upon you in the fullness of their stern reality. The bewildered
                     mortal turns to gaze at the companions of his danger, casts a lingering look on
                     those he has left behind; the groaning paddles, with reluctant plunges, begin
                     their weary labor; the faces of the cheering crowd, one by one, drop out of the
                     picture, until distance swallows the whole, and those nearer and dearer than
                     all earth beside become a memory.
                  Far aft, under the waving tricolor, stood the woman of our story. Her fingers
                     twined carelessly through the glittering necklace thrust into her hand as Percy
                     Reed clambered into his boat, and her eyes rested sadly on an ungainly
                     transport, already freighting with its cargo of mortality for the sacrifice at
                        Humaita maita. The golden glow of the
                     harbor was lost in the chilly mist; the bare mountain-tops loomed bleakly
                     through the piles of cloudy haze. White waves curled dismally at the base of
                     the Pão de Assucar, and the weird shrieks of the sea-gulls on the rocks that
                     jutted around it made the dreariness more desolate. Far out in the trackless
                     waste the sky lowered gloomily over the weary waters. Fit emblem of her path
                     through life—dark was the picture, threatening the surroundings.
                  Pray for the woman doomed to a calling she cannot but despise! Pray for the
                     being overflowing with good thoughts toward all mankind, sentenced to "tread
                     the wine-press alone!" God have mercy upon us miserable sinners!
               
            
            THE END.
