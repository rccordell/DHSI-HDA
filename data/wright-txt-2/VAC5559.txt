            Ernestin, or, The heart's longing
            ERNESTIN:
            or THE HEART'S LONGING.
            
               BOOK THE FIRST.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  THE GUARDIAN ANGEL.
                  THERE was emotion in Heaven. The voice of the UNUTTERABLE Being, who, veiled in
                     the effulgence of His own light, brighter than a million times to human eyes
                     were ten thousand suns at noon-day, is never seen, even by the highest
                     Seraphim, was heard in the heart of the great Archangel that is nearest to Him;
                     and its vibrations sounded as a pulse in the hearts of the distant multitude,
                     even to the remotest and least distinguished of the angelic host.
                  Floating in the invisible ether, amid the myriad stars of a system, whereof the
                     faintest glimmer never will be reached by lens of human sage, they rose
                     upright, and, bowing low, folded their spread pinions with a gentle movement
                     which made sweet music; and the myriad stars about them seemed for the time to
                     shine with greater lustre.
                  But one angel, though he bowed submissive as the rest, stooped sadly, looking
                     down upon the distant Earth, of which,
                     with his supernal vision, he saw every part at once, and all the actions of all
                     that live in it; and a tear, as he gazed, dropped through the blue ether, and
                     appeared to the inhabitants of Earth a shooting-star; and lovers, ere it
                     vanished, raised rapidly their glowing eyes to the fulgent streak, and wished
                     impassioned wishes.
                  Then the angel's voice, mournful as his tear, and gentle as his starry visage,
                     rung with a silver sound on the tremulous air. "Poor child of Earth!" it said;
                        "I will plead for thee."
                  Full on the outspread pinions of the angel, which glittered with a thousand
                     varying dyes, the stars poured all their lustre as he shot by them, and the
                     breezeless ether made itself more buoyant under his rushing weight. Onward,
                     world after world by-passing, now above them, now between them, now beneath
                     them, now coasting them upon his right wing, now on the left, onward, onward,
                     onward, far into the inexplicable infinite, sailed, soared, and swooped the
                     pitying angel, till, to the far-seeing eyes of his fellows, he was confounded
                     with the stars. Then aweary grew the mighty pinion, weary with its million
                     leagues of steady flight, though rapid as the thunder-flash, and he paused a
                     moment, balancing his plumy oars, over the convex of a not far globe, that
                     seemed the Earth enlarged and beautified, then, wheeling in three vast spires
                     whose rings sloped downward, shot on slant wings well-nigh precipitate, and
                     lighted on the summit of a glorious mountain, that threw an awful shadow, under
                     the risen moon of this grand world, across a valley, where numerous
                     habitations, and rare and twinkling and disappearing lights, evinced the
                     presence of a sleeping city.
                  To the eyes of the descended Spirit, the pores of the solid walls were open as
                     the meshes of a net, and the dimness ness of the moon-lit chambers had no
                     concealment. So he saw into a room, where slept what seemed two sisters, fairer
                     than Earth's daughters, and of a form and features that were neither man's nor
                     angel's. On the beautiful lips, where dwelt an innocence and sweetness
                     inexpressible, that made the angel's eyes o'erflow again, but with a delight
                     that all good spirits find in all things beautiful, the beneficent being gazed
                     an instant, and his own lips moved; and straightway before the minds of both
                     the sleepers rose the vision, a happy vision, of him the angel had
                     apostrophized, and who was their brother upon Earth.
                  Then a light as from within glowed with a golden radiance over the visage of
                     either virgin, and the air of the room was illuminated as if no walls made
                     shadow with the moon, and their lips moved with a like movement, and both
                     together murmured the name of their brother as they had known it upon
                     earth.
                  Then the angel knew that his gentle task was pleasing to the Most High. With a
                     sudden motion he turned his eyes. But in vain; the Earth was now too distant
                     for his vision. But he blessed the brother for the sisters' sake. And
                     upspringing with fresh vigor, and increased alacrity, the glorious Spirit
                     resumed his course; and the rush of his pennons on the mountain-top, as he
                     cleft the atmosphere that was like to Earth's, was as the sound of a silver
                     harp swept by night-winds.
                  Onward, still onward, now floating with suspended oars between the island
                     stars, now sweeping by them with long and nervous and measured strokes, which
                     sent him forward like an arrow, in the waveless ether, onward, onward sped the
                     benignant Spirit.
                  And now he saw the great Archangel, sitting 'mid the farther stars, solitary,
                     sleepless, that knows no equal, and
                     feels but sees not a superior. On his broad forehead, vaster in its arch than
                     the famed bridge which Trajan threw over the Danube (magnificent design!
                     leveled by envy in the sequent reign), sat Wisdom, robed in terror,â€”though no
                     gloomy lines ploughed its large cham'paign 'twixt the low-hung brows,â€”but
                     terror from its reach of thought, all but almighty. Awful his eyes, which
                     shone, under the vast pavilion of their lids, amid the deep shadows of their
                     vaulted walls, with light unsufferable, whose steady blaze that flickered not a
                     moment, nor waved, nor spread nor lessened, save as the lids enlarged or
                     narrowed the resplendent globes, illumed his cheek's broad summit, which sent a
                     more soft reflection on the grand swell of his stupendous shoulders, and into
                     the shadow of his orbits, and lit the undulations of his hair, whose tresses,
                     though they stirred not on the still head, gleamed like rivers seen at distance
                     under the moonbeams. Yet solemn was the splendor, solemn and sad; for it was
                     the outshining of an almost omnituent perception; and its glory harmonized with
                     the placid mouth, where, with wisdom that read the souls of all things lower
                     than himself, sat a melancholy sweetness that made the coming angel thrill with
                     pleasure, as the eyes that beamed on him their changeless noon made him
                     tremble.
                  Almost repentant of his boldness,â€”for he felt at the instant how inconceivably
                     awful must be the Being whom this glorious yet dread creature never saw, since
                     He was farther above this lonely one than the lone Archangel was above himself,
                     or the lowest angel was above man, between whom and the very last of the
                     heavenly people there were so many and so great intervals,â€”veiling his eyes
                     before the dread effulgence, which lighted up each feather of his plumage, like
                     chiseled gold rendered various in hue by chemic art and interstudded with all
                     lustrous gems, he waited for a sign to speak, though he knew his heart and
                     purpose were already read at the first impulse and in the moment of conception,
                     ere they had given direction to his flight.
                  "Lover of fallen man," said the lonely Spirit. His voice was as the bass of
                     some mighty cataract subdued by distance, yet clearer than the chimes of
                     fine-toned bells, and sweet yet mournful as the plaintive tones of a flute
                     breathed on placid waters in the eventide. "Thou comest on a fruitless quest.
                     But thy benevolence and love find favor in the heart of Him who is all goodness
                     and all lovingness; nor canst thou sin in sorrowing for the desolate. Speak,
                     that I may repeat thee." Sadder grew the Archangel's lips, sadder, yet sweeter;
                     the Spirit familiar with the children of earth could almost fancy that he
                     sighed; and, encouraged, while his tender vision moistened at their melancholy
                     beauty, exceeding all that he knew in all things else, the lover of degraded
                     man thus spake:â€”
                  "Not even whom I plead for, murmurs at the will of his Creator. Thou who seest
                     where my feebler vision cannot reach, look down into his lonely chamber." The
                     Archangel's lids bent downward, nor rose again until the speaker ceased. "Is he
                     at his never-ending toil, enduring all things, sacrificing all things, for its
                     sake, though never yet repaid by human love or human approbation, his
                     compensation but the cheerfulness of hope, expiring with the finished task?
                     thou dost not see his pale brow knitted, nor his thin cheek furrowed. Is he at
                     prayer? Deign to listen. Thou wilt not hear him impiously pray the course of
                     nature may be set aside for him. He praysâ€”and with what anguish! for some human
                     sympathy, for some living heart to love him and respond unto his own"â€”the
                        sadness of the Archangel grew deeper
                     and deeper, and his quiet lips appeared to shut against a sigh,â€”"some patient
                     ear to which the outpouring of his spirit may not sound as madness, or, if at
                     all intelligible, find no echo save from mocking lips. 'Tis for this he prays;
                     and I, whose heart, when Heaven stood looking on the unborn man, where desolate
                     he trod the wilds of Eden and marked all creatures mated but himself, welcomed
                     the utterance of Creative Will, It is not good for man to be
                     alone, I, too, pray with him and for him."
                  Without a word in reply, the Archangel rose, and turned; and it seemed as if a
                     sun were in eclipse, or had sunk behind some mountain, when his sea-wide
                     pinions opened on his back and threw their shadows over the meaner Spirit, who
                     shivered as with cold, and felt as human beings when plunged suddenly in
                     darkness out of brilliant light. Then becoming familiar with the change, he
                     raised his eyes, and saw the Archangel already far away, diminished to a cone
                     of fire, which even in that instant lessened to a spark, and disappeared. Then
                     the pleased seraph backward winged his way, unto his station, 'mid the hither
                     stars.
                  But the majestic and lone Archangel like some awful meteor sped on his course,
                     through seas of light where no one save himself of all Heaven's sons durst
                     venture, none but one had ever ventured, and he fallen, sped on his course, not
                     unaccompanied; for the mighty globes that circled there unceasing, rolling over
                     and over, over ever, with a noise louder than to mortal ears a thousand
                     whirlwinds, or the roar reduplicate of gathered thunders, yet so melodious it
                     entranced the melancholy soul and made it thrill with ravishment well-nigh
                     voluptuous, these mighty and mysterious worlds of the central heaven, seemed
                     instinct stinct with life, wheeling round him in immense progressive circles or
                     horizontal spires, while all the while revolving on their axes, and singing as
                     they rolled, and, as they circled onward in their erratic orbits, gave out
                     fires like mazy lightnings, which crossed their crooked flashes above, beneath
                     him, everywhere, that he seemed to fly as in a network of flame.
                  And now in the distance shone the central glory, which, emanating from the
                     Eternal Spring of Universal Life and Light, enclosed His inconceivable essence
                     as with a wall of flame, on which no eye save the lone Archangel's can look and
                     not be blasted, and which not even his can ever penetrate; and the erratic
                     worlds ceased to accompany the Archangel, and circled backward until his
                     return.
                  And now the volant ship took in his outspread sails, and floating slowly
                     onward, not steered, but abandoned with solemn submission to the inflowing tide
                     of the Divine attraction, came where seven vast planets appeared to circle
                     round the central radiance; for their huge orbs, which shone all over, not from
                     inward fire, though no eye could pierce their vivid blaze, but from its sole
                     reflection, vanished and reappeared, as in a circuit; and their course made
                     music, under whose influence the Archangel's soul seemed both humbled and
                     aggrandized, made loftier while more sensible of its comparative
                     insignificance.
                  Before the awful brightness the Archangel's splendor grew as pale as the moon
                     when in her wane she is seen at noon-day, yet every feather in his plumage
                     flashed out a light that mocked the glory of his eyes, and his tresses seemed
                     to stream with fire. Down on his knees he stooped his majestic figure, and, his
                     spread palms crossed in reverence over his sloped breast, and eyes bent lowly
                     downward, was mute an instant, till he felt the Divine permission; then his solemn voice repeated what the pleading
                     Spirit had said.
                  No voice answered; but suddenly the light grew insufferable, that under his
                     curtaining lids, as the Archangel shut them close, he felt dazzled and dizzy,
                     and the circling planets seven, blazing with ten-fold lustre, stood still; and
                     the cessation of their song made fearful silence, whose effect was told in the
                     quivering of the Archangel's form, which shook as mountains in an earthquake,
                     while the feathers of his wings waved as the boughs of oaks in a storm. Then in
                     his heart was heard the Unuttered Will; and its echoes resounded instantly in
                     the hearts of the myriad angels unto the remotest of the angelic people.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE STUDENT.
                  IN one of the busier streets of the growing parish of Chelsea, in a decent
                     dwelling-house that formed one of a row, whose quiet aspect made them quite
                     conspicuous amid the bustling shops and warehouses of that thoroughfare, at the
                     window of a little chamber that opened into the drawing-rooms on the first
                     floor, sat or lounged, in one of those postures which are natural to a fine
                     figureâ€”I might say inevitable to it, for in them only such alone find
                     ease,â€”resting on one hip, his left arm on the sill of the window, the hand upon
                     his inclined head, a man whose appearance is that of a student, and his
                     employment that of an artist; for, while on a French couch that is in the room
                     you see a manuscript plainly incomplete, and whose compositionâ€”which consists
                     of verses where you read at top, Act V., Scene I.â€”a certain
                     indescribable air in the man's face makes you connect with him as author, his
                     right hand holds a blacklead-pencil, which he is using on the frame of the
                     window. It is the head of a woman he is drawing. The eyes are very large, and
                     looking downward, almost hidden by the lids, which beautifully define the ample
                     orb beneath them,â€”the brows, which have a graceful inward sweep, are arched
                     slightly at the temples,â€”the nose is straight and delicate like a Greek
                     divinity'sâ€”matching in that classic character the short upper lip (whose curved edge is just lifted from its
                     fellow enough to show the swelling and in-falling tip), the delicately rounded
                     chin, and the oval visage. The lips are full, but of a virginal innocence, to
                     which the visible tip gives marked effect; yet the artist's touch has lent such
                     softness to the outline, that they seem but to be waiting a more full maturity
                     and the heat of passion to become voluptuous; not sensual, ever; they have too
                     much shape and are too small for that. You could swear they were, in the living
                     model, very young, very rich in color, very kissable. And one peculiarity would
                     show, the model, if not living, was not the antique, albeit three heads above
                     it, on the same board, evince the artist's tastes to lean lovingly that
                     way,â€”and that is, the hair, which, though very full and rich, hangs in long and
                     heavy ringlets down the sides, covering the ears, and reaching to the slope
                     between the neck and shoulders. The ringlets are large and irregular, looking
                     like a curl shook out, or drawn out by the fingers; and the little, scarcely
                     visible rings which wave over the spire, as if taken up by the wind, denote the
                     hair to be very fine, light, and pliable. Another peculiarity appears in the
                     foreshortening of the chin, the extreme oval of the visage, and the great
                     height of the top of the head, which, like the length of the nose, would show
                     the artist to have been seated above the model. Was it taken from the
                     street?
                  And now he takes up a penknife which lies before him, and with the point
                     scrapes off here and there the exterior outline of the hair, so that it melts
                     completely into the background; and with the same instrument he picks out
                     touches of light in the ringlets, as well as a broader surface in the hair of
                     the forehead. But it does not please: he aims, you see, at exquisite softness:
                     for he gives a finer point to his pencil, and with a rapid motion, like that of
                     a butterfly, or of a humming-bird diving at the cup of a flower, tips
                     everywhere the too brilliant light he has made, and, with a slower and broader,
                     yet still feathery touch, melts it into the shades and the shadows. It is
                     evident he is a colorist, and his passion is in light and shadow rather than in
                     outline. His looks grow more delighted; he rises and, standing off for a
                     moment, goes up to his little picture, and, with knife again and pencil, the
                     outline of the ringlet next the cheek is melted perfectly into the flesh. And
                     that flesh, with all its little dots and lines, scarce visible by the naked
                     eyeâ€”it has pulpâ€”it is compressibleâ€”it is peach-likeâ€”it isâ€”. The action of the
                     artist saves the word; for, in a perfect rapture, he throws down the pencil,
                     his palms lock together, he raises up his eyes as if to thank Heaven for his
                     transport, and, bending forward, kisses the air just before the drawing.
                     Undoubtedly, it is a portrait. What makes him start? He has not blurred it! No,
                     no; the drawing is nothing now to him. He looks with all his eyes through the
                     laths of the blinds that shade his window. Two ladies are just passing in the
                     street below him. One of them seems conscious that she is gazed at; for, though
                     you cannot see her face (she is already too far from the window), there is a
                     kind of hurry and earnestness in her manner, as she speaks to her companion,
                     which does not look natural, and there is a motion in the neck as if it would
                     willingly turn.
                  A moment elapses, and the student lifts the sash noiselessly, and, bowing the
                     blinds, which are external, of a kind common in warmer latitudes, but rarely
                     used in England, leans out with all his body, we may add his soul, and gazes
                     without motion, till the two ladies are lost in the distance. Then he returns
                     to his former posture.
                  
                  And now where is the artist's rapture? His bearded jaw drops, his visage is
                     sad, he mutters something about "twice!" and "shadow for the substance!" and as
                     he says so, he looks, but no more triumphantly, but very pensively, at the
                     drawing. I can read him easily. He is complaining that for the second time he
                     has lost sight of this party, while absorbed in the drawing. One of the two is
                     then the model! But is not so transient an appearance as little substance as
                     the drawing? More so. But you will not so content him. He has sat there, this
                     man, who is old enough to know better, for the entire morning, to watch for
                     this appearance. And now he turns his chair about, his back to his
                     pencil-works, and waits for its return.
                  How he muses! An hour is gone, yet he still is there. The expression of his
                     eyes is very beautiful under the top-light of his window; but though it is
                     undoubtedly love that gives them that beauty, yet they look not amorous. It is
                     not in his visage, which resembles, in its style of profile, that of the busts
                     of Junius Brutus, whom, by the by, the man is not unlike in the sterner
                     features of his character. And his forelock, now somewhat thinned by time, and
                     a certain loftiness of air, which better befits, as I have half implied, the
                     apparent subject of the manuscript than the theme of his pencil and the object
                     of his thoughts, make the physiognomical resemblance still more real.
                  It is late in the afternoon, and a young girl, the effrontery of whose visage
                     plainly indicates an Irish origin, as do her handsome hands and her finely
                     formed figure, enters with a small salver, and sets it on the table very
                     softly, and with an air of grave respect which for the moment completely masks
                     her natural assurance. It is evident she stands in awe of the silent student;
                     and it is as evident from the length of her upper lip, the droop and projection
                     of the under one, her stumpy nose and most impudent eyes, she is not of his
                     selection. An artist would no doubt have chosen differently. So he has no
                     temptation, despite the dainty bust and rather elegant hips, to turn that way
                     his eye; and the servant backs from the room as lightly and as reverently as
                     she had entered. But what is on the salver? A plate of simple seedcakes, such
                     as are bought for children, and a glass of fair water. Is this the student's
                     dinner? it is too late for luncheon. Surely, those well-knit limbs were never
                     rounded upon seedcake and water!
                  Perhaps the next occurrence will explain it. A loud knock at the street-door is
                     followed by a gentle tap at the door of the room, and, in answer to the
                     student's mild "Come in," the girl re-enters, and presents an evening journal
                     to him, which he declines, and, as he does so, he puts his hand to his forehead
                     and his brows lightly contract, while there is a corresponding movement in the
                     eye and in the mouth, rendering the likeness to Rome's first consul still
                     stronger. The solitary is laboring under an affection of the head, the
                     hemicrania probably which crushes the pride of the ambitious man of letters,
                     and teaches him the bitter lesson, that even virtue may be overstrained. Alas!
                     how much easier it is to mortify the stomach than the heart, to fetter the body
                     than to put trammels on the imagination! The artist-poet has some acquaintance
                     with the science of medicine, and knows his disorder and its danger well; yet,
                     while he diets, he watches for his mistress, though to see her sends the blood
                     into his head and shakes his weakened nerves, with a consequence to which the
                     plethora of overeating were as nothing.
                  But the diet is untouched; for still the innamorato is at the window. He has
                     fastened with a pin a curtain of
                     writing-paper over his picture, not to protect it from erasure, but himself
                     against its temptation; for he feels every now and then a desire to turn about
                     and look at it. What a world of starts and stares! for his expectation is
                     bewildering him, and in every pair of ladies he is sure, until they come nigh,
                     he is about to see his model. At last, his whole face lights up with pleasure,
                     the Brutus becomes Antony, once more the sash rises, he leans against the
                     blinds as closely as he can, bearing backwards in his chair, and his eyes, his
                     whole frame, become motionless. Yet, I fancy that within the skull there is
                     more commotion than is good for him. But let us follow his example, and watch
                     too, though without his prepossession.
                  The same two ladies. How distinguished in their mien! You wonder, though
                     Chelsea has many most respectable families, whose incomes will not bear the
                     expenses of Westminster, that in this suburb should be walking two such women,
                     whose appearance you would notice for its decided air of birth and breeding,
                     even in modern Belgravia, or the select localities of May Fair, the more so
                     that ladies of their youth and beauty walk rarely unattended in or near the
                     great metropolis. This style must be peculiarly marked in them, for neither of
                     them is tall; quite the contrary; and little women seldom are distinguished.
                     One of them is a finer figure than the other; but the latter, who is two or
                     three years her junior, has the face which has bewitched our poet.
                  They are now upon the other side of the street, and, as the day is rapidly
                     declining, you cannot see distinctly if he have transferred her exact features;
                     moreover, her eyes are now cast down; but the expression, the air, the
                     softness, the charm, all that is most appreciable in a portrait, these are
                     there, behind him as before him. She is certainly very handsome, and her style
                     of face very noble, which the paleness of her cheeks adds greatly to. She is
                     not speaking now, and both walk gravely; but there is that which, if you look
                     closely, will tell you that the younger lady is not unwilling that the window
                     now opposite her should catch the full radiance of her eyes, and she lifts,
                     designedly, to their utmost capacity, their lids, as she looks across the
                     street a moment, but not at the window, that nothing of their beauty may be
                     lost. In the present light, they are intensely blue, as her hair is of the
                     darkest brown, but from the glimpse of a fair curl under her bonnet when before
                     she passed beneath the window, I should think her eyes are light, and changeful
                     as an opal, and her hair the most delicate shade of brown, sunny and brilliant.
                     If she see the gazer or not you cannot say, but, observing the pair
                     attentively, you will judge as he does, that she has a satisfaction in
                     believing he is there, and that her companion knows all about it.
                  They pass; and the blinds are bowed a second time; and this great fool of a
                     man, he has his body out again, but inclining in the contrary direction, and
                     follows the slowly moving figures, till they turn the angle of a street that
                     intersects his own a little way above.
                  And now the street has no more charm for him, though a most noble head upon a
                     tall woman, whom he is wont to call his Venus of Arles, is
                     watching for him in the window of a common house nearly opposite. It is a face
                     that, with equal advantages of breeding and education in its owner, would have
                     outshone perhaps the lady's that has passed; for, as the parallel he has made
                     for it would imply, it is more rarely classic still.â€”Attracted by it as an
                     artist merely, then beginning to feel the danger of such admiration for himself
                     and its object, who was a married
                     woman, he had struggled, with but partial success, to escape its fascination,
                     till the lady, younger and more beautiful, had rescued himâ€”has it been forever?
                     from this, as from other perils of his passions. Yet to judge from the
                     expression of that pale, thin face, this woman, who seems well nigh as lonely
                     as himself, is actually in love with our student, which the lady certainly is
                     not. May the passion, though sinful, purify her nature, as to have struggled
                     with it has exalted his own!
                  The window is shut down, and, lifting the paper from his picture, the artist
                     looks at it a moment, but is evidently dissatisfied, and sits down to his
                     slender meal. What is he about? He takes the paper, and, as an entremÃªt to his repast, he writes on it, first
                     looking round him. Let us, who are invisible, peep over his shoulder.
                        Agnes Elphinstone. Ah! the name, of course, of the lady whom he
                     loves. He looks pensive; but he does not kiss it. And now, what next?
                        Ernestin Fitzherbert. That is his own. He pauses again;
                     andâ€”what a ridiculous fellow!â€”he has joined her name and his; and the third now
                     reads, Agnes Fitzherbert. He shakes his head. I can translate him.
                        "Ernestin Fitzherbert is a fine name, and rather romantic; but
                        Agnes Elphinstone,â€”what a noble one! Agnes
                        Fitzherbert,â€”that is well enough; but the union takes a half from
                     each, to mar a little both." And so I think, and so perhaps good angels,
                     prescient of his destiny, thought with him. Backwards and forwards, with his
                     pencil, he draws an endless zigzag over the three names, though with a sort of
                     reluctance over the first one; and, not content with this, tears off the slip,
                     and chews the paper to a pulp. In this, as in the act of looking round him ere
                     he wrote, I read pride and excessive delicacy, for Ernestin Fitzherbert is the
                     very reverse of cautious.
                  The meal gone through, and with a relish which showed his digestion was a good
                     one, it is dark; for it is now mid-winter. Putting on a foreign cap without a
                     visor, and a surtout, the solitary descends into the back yard, where a strange
                     playmate awaits him in a large but young dog of one of his brothers, which
                     springs upon him with a loud delighted bark that echoes through the whole
                     house. The creature is an odd cross between the spaniel and the mastiff, and
                     very heavy: he does not feed on seedcake. The man is of pure blood, and agile
                     as a deer. So, as they bound off together, down the yard and up again, the man
                     with all the eagerness and delight of a boy, the dog executing trills and rapid
                     arpeggios that help to exhaust him, the dog is first tired. So they pause
                     awhile till the quadruped has blown a little, when he entices, himself, the man
                     to a new gambol; and off they start again, no doubt somewhat to the annoyance
                     of the neighbors, as it would be much to their amusement and wonderment, were
                     it not too dark to see, till suddenly there is a stop. "You Sanch'! you bite
                     too hard," says the man. Sancho takes this as a proof of prowess, no doubtâ€”and
                     he had actually bitten through surtout and coat, trowsers and drawers, into the
                     side of his playmate's thigh,â€”and wants to repeat the demonstration; but the
                     student beats him off; and, after describing sidelong three or four immense
                     circles around the grassplot and retracing them to the starting-point, to show
                     he is in vigor still, he settles on his legs in the manner of a stool, and,
                     with a plunging motion that curves his back inward like a housetile, invites
                     with short, sharp barks, a renewal of the sport. But the game was not equal; if
                     Sancho had no cover to his hide, his playmate was too tall to bite it; and so,
                     with a short, puffy ejaculation from his windpipe, that might have meant Good b'ye, but sounded very like disgust at human ingratitude, Sancho creeps to
                     kennel, where he lies with his head out for the rest of the scene.
                  And now the lonely man finds a new pleasure. He leans his flushed cheek against
                     a pillar of the verandah, and lifts his eyes upward. The moon, which is in the
                     full, has not yet risen, though her dawn is whitening all the east before him;
                     but the night is unusually clear for the humid clime of England, and the stars
                     are beginning to hang out their silver lamps, and darkness, the darkness of
                     heaven, never is such unto Ernestin. Does he pray? I know not; but his thoughts
                     are solemn and his heart is heavenward; for, as he turns away, he lifts his
                     eyes slowly and with a lingering look to the sky, and when he shuts the door,
                     on entering the house, it is very softly.
                  But his feet forsake their measured fall ere he reaches the staircase, and,
                     with a bound that clears three steps of the flight at once almost without
                     noise, he regains his little chamber, where a new delight awaits him. His
                     neighbor, a woman of middle age, is an excellent musician, a teacher as he
                     judges, since he sees her at stated hours every day go out and return with
                     rolls of music in her hand. She does not sing remarkably well, though not
                     without taste and precision, but she plays to a charm, and her piano-forte is
                     against the wall, on the other side, which backs Ernestin's gilt couch on this,
                     and the wall is so thin, the faintest pianissimo is heard. With a soul full of
                     anticipated luxury, in which for the moment Agnes is forgotten, he shuts the
                     door quietly, not to alarm, and, sitting in the dark against the wall, gives up
                     his senses, his whole being to the charm. Piece after piece from all his
                     favorite operas, in which the tender and impassioned melodies of Bellini, that
                     best suit his present mood and the ever wakeful pathos of his softer nature,
                     find no mean place, and variations on selected themes that seem chosen as if
                     purposely to oblige his tastes as well as to display the skill of the
                     performer, are executed without fault. He has not stirred, his very breath has
                     seemed to be suspended, he has in fact forgotten he is flesh, and in the very
                     rapture of his senses is yet pure spirit and a spirit in Paradise. Now a burst
                     of solemn grandeur makes him more than mortal; then a soft, and melancholy, and
                     interrupted strain complains the lover's woe, or the despair of the forsaken,
                     and the demi-god comes down to earth to melt at human sorrow; and anon a shower
                     of liquid notes, poured out with a rapidity and a purity that seem scarce
                     possible for even that player's practised fingers, and which blend in the
                     listener astonishment with transport, wrap him in such ecstasy that he
                     absolutely weeps,â€”this man of haughty features and fiery spirit weeps
                     passionately; but the tears are of enjoyment, and the flood relieves his heart.
                     All is still. Ernestin raises his limbs, and, reclining on the cushion, his
                     arms folded on his breast, in a few moments he is fast asleep.
                  And even now he has his pleasures, for Ernestin never, never since the farthest
                     day he can remember, has slept or slumbered without dreaming. Closes he his
                     eyes but for a moment, his imagination is yet wide awake, and, released from
                     the thraldom of the outward sense, hurries along in the joy of its freedom to
                     happier scenes, in which time and space are reckoned nothing, and eternity and
                     infinity, which mock the bounded intellect when under volition, are made more
                     intelligible by partial experience. Such participation in the faculties of
                     higher spirits, the rapt poet feels even in his waking hours, when keenly
                     excited. Then the present slides away, the imagination makes excursions as it
                     were into regions that are all its own, and in a moment, without stirring from his seat, the
                     blest of the Almighty lives whole generations, and travels over an entire
                     world. And such a share of immortality is well known to Ernestin. But in his
                     slumber always.
                  It is fifteen minutes since he closed his eyes. He wakens quite refreshed, and,
                     lighted sufficiently by the shop-lamps in the street, puts on his hat and a
                     heavy Spanish mantle, and sallies out. Whither is he going? Ah! Agnes is once
                     more sole sovereign of his brain! and round the corner where she had turned,
                     and down the street where she resides, he paces gravely, not looking to the
                     right or left, until before a certain house he slackens his slow step, and,
                     looking anxiously at every window, but without stopping, tells us what is
                     there. He seems to feel, as we do who look on him, how strange it is a wall and
                     a few steps alone divide him from his mistress, yet he has no power to ascend
                     the one or penetrate the other. Sadly onward he continues his walk, his head
                     bent down all the way, until he has passed, by many a street, the one that is
                     to him the centre of the world, and then, gradually even that recedes before
                     his healthy mind, and feeling the influence of the air, and of the space, his
                     thoughts expatiate to fitter themes.
                  The moon has now ascended, and her level beam makes enormous masses of deep
                     shadow with the scattered houses and the clumps of trees; for Ernestin has got
                     more into the country. The artist is awake in him, and, philosophic reasoner as
                     he is, he sees how nature in her chiar'oscuro aims at and attains to unity, and
                     he marks the unbroken and grand mass of shade, then the smaller masses that
                     make it dominant, and, bringing in the light with similar distribution, finds
                     the whole, thus called up without labor by nature, to correspond with the
                     elaborate perfectness of human art in light and shade; and unavoidably,â€”since
                     human art has borrowed it, or it would be false to its foundation, from the
                     mastery of nature.
                  With a grateful and awe-struck mind, Ernestin, who adores habitually the Author
                     of all grandeur and all beauty as the God of Light and Shadow, looks from the
                     scene whose humbleness and even meanness is thus masked, and made solemn and
                     even majestic, by what seems so mere an accident in nature, yet teaches man so
                     profound a principle, he looks from it with a heart which the shadows of
                     moonlight ever soften to a feeling that is sympathetic (if I may so say) with
                     its solemn beauty, up to the heaven that seems to separate as a floor the
                     humble tenants of this world from superior orders of being; and the same
                     longing, and sad, yet not unhappy gaze, which fixed his eyes in the verandah,
                     makes them rest now upon some point which is yet a blank; and then he slowly
                     turns them to the moon; and still his lips move not; but his heart is full of
                     adoration, and he turns his step homeward.
                  He has ceased to feel his dangerous malady, and, remembering his task, he
                     endeavors, as he walks, to arrange his thoughts for the completion of his
                     drama. But the moment he comes back to this world, Agnes rises up before him,
                     and, lapsing into revery, it is with a sort of despair that he finds, ere he
                     regains her door, which he repasses ere he seeks his own, that another day is
                     gone without a line.
                  It is the hour for tea; and Ernestin takes it, as his other meal, apart from
                     his family. Still in his little chamber, where is no fireplace. What is its
                     attraction for him? He opens a polyglot Virgil, and to exercise his lungs
                     begins to read aloud, across the page, by passages, in all its six languages;
                     but the hot spot and the small
                     pricking pain in his head alarm him, and he leaves it with a sigh as he had
                     declined the newspaper. Then he tries his voice at singing; but, distrustful of
                     himself from his imperfect musical culture, he is careful not to be heard by
                     his neighbor, therefore passes into the adjoining drawing-room, which is dark,
                     and there, with closed doors, expands his chest at pleasure. What does he sing?
                     I can recognize nothing that is known; the strain seems all impromptu, though
                     there mix with it decided touches of Bellini. It is melancholy, or grand, but
                     ever nervous and impassioned, according to the sentiment to which he adapts it,
                     and which is taken by snatches from his own poetry, chiefly from Italian
                     verses. Agnes, I am afraid, from what I overhear, is here too mistress still.
                     Yet what matters it? it is the prompting spirit, or subject, or occasion that
                     he wants, whether for music, or for verse, or for pencil, and he has found it
                     now in her. All this he sings while walking up and down. Then, as he lolls on
                     the sofa, I hear regular snatches, all of melancholy songs, in which the
                        Che farÃ² of Gluck, with its Scena, (sometimes foolishly varied by substituting
                        Agnese for Euridice despite the "Ah! piu non vive, &c.,") and the Tutto Ã¨ sciolto of Bellini (the male part), are
                     very conspicuous. It is plain to see that if Ernestin should ever make any
                     thing of a singer, he will be noted chiefly for expressionâ€”and peculiarly in
                     the pathetic. There is all his forte.
                  And now he takes a lamp from the little chamber, and ascends to his study,
                     which is on the second floor. But first, like a great schoolboy, seizing hold
                     of one of the rails of the balustrade, he raises his tall figure by the
                     strength of his arms and chest (for Ernestin has much physical power), and,
                     stretching himself thus and in other similar gymnastic manÅ“uvres for awhile,
                     the eccentric creatureâ€”all creatures are eccentric that are not common-place;
                     the common world revolves around one common centre; its uncommon particles fly
                     off, and make their own orbits; this is a truism; and the action is correctly
                     defined eccentricâ€”this man by himself, I would say, feels refreshed as much as
                     by his nap, and by his walk, and by his singing, and he enters his study.
                  A fire is burning in the grate, but the window is open: he cannot bear a close
                     atmosphere. Blowing out the light, he looks out of the window. Behind the
                     house, the grounds are almost open, for the streets in that direction are not
                     yet built up. Thus the moon is here for him again,â€”and the broad black shadows
                     (though fast diminishing as the planet ascends the zenith) with their softening
                     penumbra,â€”and here a solemn tree gently stirring with the night-breeze,â€”and the
                     grand lightâ€”which is now getting too high for him; for he loves the moonlight
                     chiefly for its shadows.
                  All this, which had consumed the mortal's afternoon and evening, had passed as
                     a point of time before the angels, when their hearts, stirred by the Creative
                     Will, had asked them, Among men, who is there happier than he
                     whom men call Ernestin?
                  And Ernestin so felt it. And his soul's involuntary thankfulness was perhaps
                     more grateful to the Supreme than the homage of his nightly duty which he is
                     about to render.
                  But he turns, and looks around him. It is a painful sight, which the fire and
                     the moon, though softening its true deformity, alike betray. Pictures upon
                     walls and easels, but all unfinished; heaps of books, but all dust-covered; a
                     bust of clay, which has the singularity of being made despite of shrinking to
                     remain thus, for he has cemented it to a marble pedestal; but the bust wants the finishing fingers, for the likeness,
                     which is meant for his sister Ilda, is not complete, and the folds of the
                     drapery, his first attempt, are too much in detail to suit his now maturer
                     taste. Upon the mantel-piece is another, a miniature bust of clay, with the
                     like peculiarity; but this is of fancy, and, though having, like the other, the
                     imperfections inseparable from a first essay, it is complete. So it is covered
                     with a glass. And on a table, covered with a cloth, is another work in clay, a
                     medallion with three heads, his father and his sisters, in high-relief. It is
                     his favorite, yet it is undone, though like the others it is dry. How he must
                     have labored to counteract the shrinking of the earth, or to supply its thence
                     resulting deficiencies! And this, like the greater bust, he means to repeat in
                     marble. He has vowed it in his heart, where reign forever the beings that alone
                     have loved him, and for whom he prays nightly. But where are the signs of the
                     workman? Alas, his tools lie, like his pencils, slumbering in their places; for
                     Agnes, Agnes, not his sister Agnes, but Agnes Elphinstone, is in all the room,
                     and Agnes and Ilda, both of sculpture and painting, and his father, remain with
                     his tragedy, and the pictures that should win him glory as an artist, dusty in
                     their incompleteness, reproaching him, and torturing him, who is scrupulously
                     neat and a lover of order, torturing him not less with their uncleanness and
                     confusion than with their incompleteness.
                  Is not this criminal? Let us hear him.
                  Down on his knees, his face to the open window, sinks the lone artist, and
                     clasping his hands before him, with the palms turned outward, but not lifted,
                     for his arms hang down, and the backs of the thumbs touch his thighs, he
                     ponders for awhile in silence, the events of the day, to see wherein he has
                     transgressed or been deficient, then in a deep and distinct voice, yet low of
                     sound that he may not be overheard, he pours out his feelings and his
                     adoration, to the only ear that is ever open to listen to him; and as he
                     proceeds his hands are raised, even as a child prayeth, or fold at times across
                     his heart.
                  "Almighty and Universal Father! for so Thou permittest us to address Thee, and
                     for the beating of our hearts pardonest the presumption,â€”Mysterious Source of
                     being! who, throned in infinity amid the circling stars, look'st down upon this
                     world, an atom in thy immeasurable universe, yet not forgotten, and seest us,
                     mere atoms in that atom, with the same glance that measureth the rolling
                     planets,â€”Thou, whose temple is everywhere where the heart bids kneel, but is
                     better builded in the immensity of darkness than in the light which, with Thy
                     glories, revealeth to man's eyes his own creations, to contend for worship and
                     to make his senses triumph over reason and the consciousness of duty,â€”Thou
                     Ever-present Comforter of the lonely and forsaken, Who bringest gladness out of
                     sorrow, and with the tears of the tortured heart makest the parched soul to
                     blossom and bear fruit of grace, hear me! hear Thy humble creature, who
                     acknowledging the many and rare blessings he has received at Thy hands yet
                     prays Thee to have compassion of his desolate condition!
                  "O my Creator! Thou Who hast made nothing in vain! it cannot be that the
                     affections wherein thou hast made me fertile should bear fruit to wither, or be
                     gathered by thankless hands! Alas! those who loved me, and who alone of all the
                     earth had sympathy with me, have passed away, and their memories, though ever
                     present, have ceased to fill the chambers of my heart. My melancholy
                        fortunes â€”it is not for me, blind
                     that I am, to call them evilâ€”have shut me out from all communion with my true
                     equals; and with the rest of my fellows I have naught in common. Is it so
                     sinful, that lone and forsaken, full of tenderness, and feeling ever happiest
                     in the fellowship of childhood, I should long to know the sweet relations of
                     husband and father? Wo is me! even while I speak, the voice within me that is
                     never silent tells me that the higher duty cannot be sacrificed without sin to
                     the claims of the lower, and that reason must ever dominate affection, or man's
                     wisdom is in vain. Even so be it, Father Almighty! Strengthen me to subdue this
                     weakness! If Thou will, and this woman be indeed worthy, let my wishes have
                     attainment and the soul be quieted; but if I err in thus imploring, if she have
                     been made only the instrument of Thy merciful purpose, to call me back from the
                     error of my ways to my once pure and pious course, hasten, I beseech Thee, the
                     term of its employment, that my unfinished tasks may no more reproach me with
                     my mis-spent hours! Kindle Thou the rather in me the love of higher beauty! Let
                     Thy stars, Thy light and shadow, Thy awful thunder and Thy astounding
                     lightning, the rain that is Thy music, and the winds that breathe with their
                     grand melodies the song of Thy beneficence, let all these fill me topful with
                     adoration, that the heart may have no corner left for loveliness that is less
                     exalting to gaze upon, and that makes the soul the minion of the senses!"
                  Thus, and further, with a like suggestion, prayed Ernestin; and concluding, as
                     usual, with invoking a blessing on the spirits of his departed sisters and
                     father, he remained a few moments in silence on his knees, then slowly and
                     reverently rose, to retire to his sleeping-chamber, which, because the least
                     noise disturbed him and destroyed his rest, was in the highest story of the
                     house. Its windows looked upon the roof of Agnes' dwelling; and his last gaze,
                     ere he closed reluctantly his windows, rested on its moon-lit walls; and the
                     firmament and the shadows of earth were alike forgotten.
                  An hour afterward Ernestin was asleep, but not in the spirit. A thousand
                     dreams, such as haunt the imagination of the poet only, made of his pillow a
                     cushion of enchantment. And in dreams our life is as the life of angels; we
                     live whole years of human computation in the breathing of as many minutes, and
                     our feet ate carried over immeasurable space with the noiseless wings of
                     thought.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER III.
                  THE STUDENT'S PATRIMONY.
                  ERNESTIN FITZHERBERT was a gentleman by long descent. But his family had been
                     more distinguished, certainly for the last two centuries, for their talents
                     than their wealth; and their politics had not helped their fortunes. They were
                     tories of the most bigoted kind; so much so, that even in Ernestin's time, his
                     grandfather, a man equally remarkable for his virtues and his intellect, would
                     drink to "The Kingâ€”over the water," with as much solemnity and
                     mystery, as if the toast, like its subject, had not been so long dead, as to
                     give umbrage to nobody, and convey a meaning but to few. Nay, Ernestin's
                     father, when disputing one day with our hero, who had imbibed whiggery with his
                     mother's milk, was so moved as to tell him with tears in his eyes, that "if
                     those were his sentiments, he was no son of his." Ernestin, who was his
                     darling, though touched to the heart by his father's broken voice, did not
                     however allow this burst of overstrained loyalty to overwhelm reason. He looked
                     at his father's superb head, and thought in respectful silence, that it had
                     been better, certainly for the present generation (for his father was without
                     ambition), if its organ of veneration had been less finely developed.
                  It was impossible indeed for a youth of Ernestin's opinions, and with his
                     passion for distinction, to look around him and see the patronage of government
                     bestowed on men far less qualified than were all the members of his father's
                     family, and not feel vexed at a superstition which had shut them out from all
                     political eminence. His maternal grandmother had given him a spirit that was
                     the very antipodes of the paternal. Indeed she had little else to give him. His
                     mother's ancestors had squandered wealth, as his father's had neglected to make
                     it. Her maternal great-grandfather left his two sons an estate that in 
                        Enerstin's
                        Ernestin's
                      time would have furnished a revenue for a lord; and they sold it all
                     most literally for a song. But it was a song of their own. They were
                     distinguished for their musical talents, and keeping open house with a
                     prodigality that would have scared, if not have shamed, even an Irishman, they
                     found friends in abundance, who received their music with tumults of applause,
                     and eased the singers quietly, slice by slice, of their immense possessions,
                     leaving them to transmit to Ernestin, through his mother, nothing more
                     appreciable than a fine ear, figuratively and physically, and an elegant
                     person, appurtenances however which our artist-poet was more grateful for, than
                     he would have been for a long rent-roll without them and for thousands in the
                     three-percents.
                  But for his imprudence, Ernestin's father would have made this loss of little
                     moment. He was a man of rare sagacity and foresight, and at an early day
                     presaged the growth of the suburbs of London, and wherever he could, and
                     according to his means, purchased land in most of them. He lived to see them
                     rapidly fulfilling his most sanguine expectations, and already thought it
                     certain that his sons, for private gentlemen, would be wealthy, when an act of
                     simple weakness blasted in an instant the calculations of thirty years. United
                     with great disinterestedness ness, and
                     a liberality that wanted but occasion and large means to show itself
                     magnificent, he had a fatal want of firmness. To say No, when asked for
                     important favors, was to him more painful than it is to most men to say Yes;
                     and men, that never did say Yes in such cases, profited by it. In an evil hour
                     he endorsed to a considerable amount for a merchant to whom he was under no
                     obligations whatever, not even those of a long friendship; and the next day the
                     merchant, who might more properly have let others suffer than a man whom he had
                     never benefited, failed. The imprudent life which Mr. Fitzherbert led had
                     already involved his property, but not materially; a small sacrifice would at
                     any time have freed it from every incumbrance. But now the choicest and the
                     greater part of his possessions in Islington, Kensington, and Chelsea, went by
                     the hammer. As if to make the blow more sensible, the very next year saw a
                     prodigious increase of houses in all these parishes; and ere the twelvemonth
                     had doubled, the lands that he had parted with had nearly quadrupled their
                     value. But ere that time had expired the unfortunate gentleman, already in
                     infirm health, died, fastened to his end, beyond a doubt, by a misfortune, of
                     which, after its occurrence, he never once uttered or listened to a word. His
                     family were still independent. They retained their town property. But times had
                     changed: commerce had become stagnant, and, as a natural consequence,
                     housebuilding was in a great measure suspended, and land in the out-parishes
                     sunk greatly in value. So, partly to economize their means, partly for the
                     advantage of the youngest son, who had just been qualified as a practitioner in
                     medicine, the family rented their town house, and contented themselves with a
                     more humble dwelling in the village of Chelsea.
                  As for Ernestin himself, he was poorer than his brothers. Foreign travel and
                     the publication of unsuccessful works had eaten deeply into his inheritance,
                     and, with the interest of his debt continually accumulating, was eating still.
                     So, as the dullness of the times rendered a division of the property
                     unadvisable, Ernestin contented himself with living with his mother and
                     brothers, waiting, as he had been all his manhood, for a better day.
                  It was now the third or fourth year of his suburban residence, when the event
                     occurred of which the consequences form the theme of my narration.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  CUPID'S ARCHERY.
                  WHEN you tell me of a poet, a painter, a sculptor, or a musician, who is young,
                     good-looking, well-made, and a bachelor, I take it for granted, if they be
                     really what they are named, they are absolute idolaters of beauty in women. Now
                     Ernestin was poet, painter, sculptor, and though he had never had much
                     knowledge practically, and but little theoretically, of music, and had long
                     forgotten nearly all he had known, he was in soul and sense perhaps as largely
                     gifted that way as any other. That he had reached his seventh lustre without
                     worshiping at many shrines of female loveliness will not then be supposed; and
                     if he had committed many follies both at home and abroad, and been more than
                     once upon the very verge of crime, who of Adam's sons shall cast the first
                     stone at him? Not they at least who are of kindred temper, and who are exposed
                     to like temptations.
                  Let us leave his punishment to the avenger Memory, which sitteth in everlasting
                     judgment in his own soul, nor will forego one lash of his atonement. Our story
                     dates but from his reformation, from the dawn of that day which saw him step
                     back again with a steady foot into his pristine path of innocence, guided and
                     sustained by the very passion whose vagaries had been the sole cause that led
                     him from it.â€”In the physical world the elements that bless and save are
                     likewise agents of devastation and destruction, and in the moral the rivers of
                     vice and of virtue rise often in the same small spring, and flow onward in
                     undistinguished course till they separate in distinct streams, again perhaps to
                     mix their waters, and again to separate, till one of them is swallowed up in
                     the sands of time, or, lessening by degrees, loses its existence forever in the
                     vaster flood of the other.
                  It was in the summer of that year whose winter gives the scene of my second
                     chapter, when Ernestin, one bright Sabbath morning, looking through the blinds
                     of his little front parlor on the groups of church-going folk that passed the
                     window, had his attention suddenly arrested by one particular person. It was
                     that of a lady who had already passed when he saw her, so that her face was not
                     visible; but the back of her head and the neck, and her carriage, had that
                     nameless grace which is almost positive evidence of the beauty of the face.
                     This was something in itself; it piqued the curiosity of the connoisseur and
                     artist. Then, her mien was one of marked distinction. This pleased the
                     fastidiousness of the man of refinement. And lastly, she wore in front long
                     loose ringlets, which, twining round the edge of her bonnet, sparkled in the
                     sun like gold. And this was another, and, under the circumstances, not perhaps
                     the least attraction.
                  It was not only, that as a painter he thought light hair was more harmonious,
                     more youthful, more virginal in expression than dark hair, and having in itself
                     far more of style, for women; the ringlets had for the man the immortal charm
                     of association with a darling image. In early youth he had been enamored of a
                     fair-haired girl, whom in after life he had often regretted that he had not
                     married. Man is always regretting unsatisfied desires, despite spite of his persuasion that his destiny rules
                     all things for the best. Beauty, and that of the most refined order, virtue,
                     great gentleness, family, fortune, were enough for the requirements of almost
                     any youthful lover; but Ernestin, the most headlong man in the world in all
                     matters in which men of the world are most circumspect, was prudence itself in
                     the very matter in which men of the world are headlong, and had so much
                     discretion as to look for something of more importance to domestic happiness
                     than any of these qualifications. He feared that Imogen had not mind enough to
                     be his partner; and to be married to one who had no sympathy with his tastes,
                     and who could not comprehend his sentiments, would have driven him mad. But his
                     ignorance of women had misconstrued virginal timidity into want of intellect.
                     Loving always with a love more like that of a hero of romance than of a sane
                     Christian of the nineteenth century, Ernestin's sudden passion had frightened
                     the inexperienced girl of sixteen, and while the blushes that suffused neck,
                     cheeks, and brow, added transcendent loveliness to an immaculate complexion,
                     she could but open her untouched lips to answer yes and no, to all his
                     questions. What availed it that, in so doing, she disclosed a set of teeth no
                     mouth could rival save his sister Agnes'? His heart sank in him. He battled
                     with his passion like a strong man, and conquered, as he after thought, like a
                     weak one. Six or seven years elapsed, in all which interval he had never once
                     forgotten her, though unseen, and what is more, though he had loved, and truly,
                     six or seven other beauties in various countries. At the end of that time, he
                     found her changed indeed. Still handsome, but no longer dazzlingly so, still
                     gentle, but no longer timid, willing to please him, and perhaps remembering he
                     had been her first and completest conquest, Imogen had now to encounter in her
                     admirer a new distrust, and that was of himself, and an enemy moreover which he
                     himself could not subdue, his pride. Loving her still so well, that he could
                     not hear her voice without a flutter of the heart, nor meet in any manner with
                     her sweet and most rare name without pleasure, he felt not any more that
                     passion which at an earlier day had nearly brought him to her feet. Besides,
                     his fortune was no longer what it then was, while hers was unreduced. Poor, and
                     court an heiress! That was not for Ernestin Fitzherbert, though he saw plainly
                     his addresses would not be more unwelcome to the lady's family, than to
                     herself. And unwedded died Imogen, of the disease which carries off in their
                     bloom so many of the good and beautiful and spiritual of England's daughters,
                     leaving to her bashful lover but a fond regret, and a tress of the beautiful
                     hair, which he obtained of one of his sisters.
                  In that strange heart of his, which seemed made to accommodate all the world,
                     both men and women, and yet have room remaining for another when the first
                     should be exhausted, lay the image of the bright-haired girl for ever, and
                     received beside it all of its own likeness, even children, whom, when of that
                     kind, he could not look upon, without inwardly sighing to think that such as
                     they he might himself have had, but for his punctiliousness.
                  It was then no unfamiliar key that gave out its melody to Ernestin's breast,
                     when he saw the ringlet sparkle in the sunshine.
                  He leaves the window; but it is not to muse on charms he as yet can only fancy,
                     though the impression is sufficiently pleasing to draw him back again to the
                     observatory, at the hour he might expect the new-discovered planet to make her
                     second transit. But, as before, he is half a minute too late.
                  
                  Not disconcerted, the star-gazer, at the next periodical revolution, takes his
                     station somewhat earlier. But the disc of the luminary is so closely hidden in
                     the cloud of a thick veil, which is gathered fold on fold before it and held
                     down by the wearer's hand, that he could catch but a glimpse of the light
                     behind, though that was enough to reveal unusual brilliancy. Absorbed in study,
                     he did not this time wait her re-appearance; and so, the habit broken, he
                     gradually forgot the whole discovery.
                  The summer was drawing to its close, when one evening Ernestin, seated with his
                     window wide open, and the Venetian blinds thrown back, a thing unusual with
                     him, who was shyer of such personal exhibitions than a Seville maiden, sees a
                     lady crossing the street towards his side of the road, in such a manner that
                     her face is full before him; for she has come from another street, that is
                     diagonally opposite, and he is seated sidelong. As she sets her foot on the
                     curb-stone, the lady lifts her eyes, and they encounter Ernestin's.
                  It was the hour that painters love; for the sunset atmosphere gives a magic
                     tone to their coloring; and as it is with pictures, so with the living beauties
                     that serve for models. And the smile,â€”a very common one for young ladies when
                     they are very handsome, and the consciousness of looking particularly well puts
                     them in an amiable humor with all things, and especially with a new
                     admirer,â€”the smile that lighted up her features, as she caught Ernestin's
                     enraptured gaze, lost none of its sweetness, nor of its irradiating power on
                     her superb face, as she saw her victory.
                  Into his inmost soul shot the glance of the most beautiful eyes, he deemed, in
                     all the world; and when, in the brief moment ere she had gone by, his rapid and
                     practised vision saw in the oval face, straight and noble nose, and delicately
                     curved lips, all that he most admired in his standard of female loveliness, he
                     scarcely needed that the face should be adorned with long loose ringlets of the
                     lightest brown, sunny and silky, the very hair in short that he most loved to
                     see in women, to give up his whole being to the fascination.
                  Only see the enthusiast, as he leans out at the window, quite regardless of the
                     very observation to which at other times he is so sensitive! The charmer is
                     going up the street. And now she stops before a row of small dwelling-houses at
                     no great distance; and, as she turns to enter one of them, she looks back and
                     sees her admirer. And he is pleased that she should; for he would not be
                     forgotten, and he will be restless, till again his nerves be made to tingle
                     with the sweet shock from the battery of those eyes.
                  As she appears to ask a question, and pauses at the door, ere she enters the
                     house, he supposes she does not live there. So he waits, and waits; and in a
                     little while, as he has anticipated, for it is growing dark, she reappears,
                     and, giving a side glance at his window, crosses the street, and is soon lost
                     in the dim air of the evening and the passing crowd.
                  Who is she? She is very distinguished in mien. But beauty of a classic order
                     has always something of aristocracy in its air; and he conjectures from the
                     visit she has just made, that she is the daughter of some decent tradesman,
                     forgetting that he himself is living in an out-parish, and that others as
                     respectable, and even more so, may have a like humble residence. The idea
                     disturbs him; yet he cannot deny himself the happiness of once more seeing her.
                     Nay, it will be of advantage to his art. Ah, sophist! how often have such persuasions led thee into heart's peril!
                     But she shall not again behold him watch her; for that would be ungenerous.
                  At the same hour, of two, of three, of four succeeding days, the student, full
                     of amorous fancies, watches behind his blinds for the eyes whose lightning
                     still quivers in his brain, though with a soft and summery flash, sheet, not
                     forked. Skilled himself, by practice, in all the wiles of love, its forecast,
                     and its calculations of sympathy, he takes it for granted that the fair one
                     will suppose he will be there to look for her at the same hour, and accordingly
                     will present herself to make secure her conquest. Too artful by far! He has
                     overlooked the fact, that a girl so young, so virginal in look, couldâ€”and
                     should, to satisfy a man so nice as heâ€”know nothing of such logic.
                  The fifth day, a little earlier, behold her once again! though not coming
                     towards him: she is on the same side of the street. She does not raise her
                     eyes, but the expression of her face, her very walk tell his experience and
                     keen sight that she believes he is observing her. Is she so vain? or has she
                     discovered him, ere he perceived her coming? No matter; he devours all her
                     features. What a brow! what a nose! what a contour of the whole visage! But is
                     not the upper lip peculiar, or does the shade of evening deepen the channel
                     that intersects it? But then the lids of those eyes! How his nerves tingle! And
                     the hair, the hair! Could he but put his hand about the long and wavy mass, or
                     run his fingers only once, only for one minute, through the silken threads!
                     Voluptuary! dreamer! But she has passed, ere he can smile at his own fancies.
                     Forgetful of his self-promise he bows his blinds, that he may follow her with
                     his eyes, and sees her cross as before, and suddenly disappear. Has she gone
                     into one of those little shops? In vain he strains his sight. Down fall the
                     shadows of evening; and the street twinkles with the many lamps, on post and in
                     window, and the gloom is deepening into darkness, ere he leaves his station.
                     And then, it is to sally out and follow the path the fair has taken. How he
                     gazes into every show-window! and despite the danger to his reputation, which
                     he has full time to ponder, he goes back in the same direction slowly, and then
                     retraces his steps, and back again, pausing, and peering anxiously into
                     milliners', haberdashers', and toymen's, fancying she is somewhere there. Has
                     he lost all recollection of her air of breeding, the proud and bridling gesture
                     with which she drew up her graceful head, at the very instant she was most
                     directly in his view? Ah, he is full of her beauty only, and, with a
                     profanation which he afterwards thought her gentle blood would have deemed
                     outrageous, he is thinking on her in connection with his colors and his
                     clay!
                  Not many days after, he beholds her again; and this time it is early in the
                     afternoon, and he sees her pass the shops, and turn down the street beyond
                     them. And now, but in the night, he visits that street, and, curiously enough,
                     pitches upon the very house as her dwelling which he subsequently discovered to
                     be hers. But that house and the neighborhood make the probability still
                     stronger that she is the daughter of some simple tradesman. Decidedly, he must
                     give up the adventure, or he will be deceiving the poor girl. And reason comes
                     in aid of conscience, (they are sisters, and so like as to be almost one,) and
                     remonstrates with his passion, and with success,â€”but a success that accident
                     makes very transient.
                  For the very next day, while in the accustomed place, he sees the young lady
                     coming up on his side of the road, in
                     company with a lady much older, and a little boy, who have both the same
                     thorough-bred look as the beauty. She has seen him, and, while still a good way
                     off, he observes her lips in motion, and her eyes turn towards the elder lady,
                     though her head does not move. She has evidently told her about him, and is now
                     directing her attention to him; and he feels annoyed; not the less so that the
                     action has an air of sliness, which he hates. But as she has seen him, it will
                     be misinterpreted if he draw back. So, on the contrary, he rather widens the
                     intervals of the blinds, and stands slightly leaning against the window-frame,
                     that the party may have a full view of him. But, as they approach, none of them
                     regard him. The younger lady bridles a little as before, and opens wide her
                     magnificent eyes,â€”which, he now sees, are of a kind in which the colored part
                     appears to fill up all the orb; and the elder, as she passes the house, throws
                     a reserved and momentary glance at the door without moving her head, or
                     altering in the least the composure of her lips,â€”which confirm Ernestin in his
                     opinion that the other has made no secret, to her at least, of his eye-worship.
                     The little boy is perfectly unconscious of any thing unusual.
                  They pass; and Ernestin never again beheld the elder lady.
                  The impression made by this incident was not quite pleasing. That the elder
                     lady was the young girl's mother, as the boy her brother, there could be little
                     doubt; the whole manner of the party, one towards another, as they walked
                     together with their slow grave step, was such as to denote a close relationship
                     without equality. In a later stage of the adventure that the girl should ask
                     the approbation of her mother, or of any relative to whom her confidence was
                     strictly due, would be but proper; but now, what had there passed between her
                     and himself that should make her so precipitate? From first to last, putting
                     every petty space of time together, he had not seen her, in the whole, five
                     minutes. Was his manner so expressive of a fixed purpose, or even of a deep
                     attachment? She had not looked to see. He had followed with his eyes a dozen
                     women, as who has not? looked for them again, and encountered their glance and
                     half-repressed smile of recognition, yet none of them had looked upon his
                     admiration as any thing so serious. The girl must have excessive vanity, orâ€”He
                     knew not how to supply the alternative; for his thoughts could only settle upon
                     this conclusion, that, whatever grounds he might have given for such conduct,
                     it was at least precipitate, if not indelicate.
                  But, think what he will, the affair admits of no more trifling. The girl is
                     manifestly a lady born: either he must court her with a serious intent, or
                     discontinue his open admiration. Is he prepared to marry her? He does not
                     hesitate a moment, but answers to himself, Yes,â€”and his heart beats very
                     high,â€”Yes, if she be all that he requires in a wife, and there be nothing
                     objectionable in her family. But that if! what a world of significance lies
                     hidden under its miniature compass! and with a man too so fastidious!
                  The next Sunday he sees all alone a lady, whom, though she has no resemblance
                     to the one he admires, he sets down at once from her style to belong to the
                     same family. And he is right. It is a sister, very little older. She is
                     remarkably well made, though small, and her bearing evinces high fashion or
                     thorough breeding. She does not appear to know any thing about him.
                  He looks in vain for the only face that he now cares to see, and is
                     disappointed, uneasy, when the night sets in, without it. But the next day appears his
                     enchantress, in company with the very lady he supposed to be her sister, and
                     who is now evidently, though her manner is discreet, not uninstructed. And soon
                     after he sees her again, with another sister, younger than herself, and whom he
                     instantly takes a fancy to, partly because of her extreme youth, partly because
                     she seems to be a favorite with her he loves; and she too is in the secret! He
                     is annoyed, surprised, displeased; and certainly not without reason; for,
                     whatever propriety there might be in communicating the matter to her mother,
                     there was no occasion to take them into confidence. It showed, he
                     thought, a want of delicacy; and Ernestin, nicer in such matters than men more
                     callous by friction with the world, is a good deal fretted. "But the girl is
                     very young; and it is always something to have got the start of one's sisters;
                     and she is so handsome, that"â€”Ah yes! she is so handsome. Poor Ernestin! his
                     senses are bad logicians.
                  At all events, as he sees her now very often, and her manner is encouraging, it
                     is certain that her mother is satisfied. Doubtless, they know all about him, or
                     at least about his family. But he, he has not even ascertained her name! Why
                     does he sit there so effeminately at the window, when he should go out like a
                     man, and act as is expected of him, and as it would become him to act?
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  THE CAGED TIGERâ€”AND HIS KEEPERS.
                  IF foreknowledge of what must happen could make man contented with results when
                     unpropitious, if to be assured that the source of his misfortunes lies not in
                     his own imprudence or misconduct, but in the very fountain-head of human
                     passions, could render him resigned, then would Ernestin have been well
                     satisfied. Indeed, he did not much repine; but his contentment was
                     constitutional, his resignation piety engrafted on a nature, despite its
                     loftiness and independence, gentle and most docile, and the unshaken confidence
                     which he had in the justice of his claims, in Time the Avenger or the Judge,
                     that brings at last most (not all) things to a righteous verdict, and above all
                     in the decrees of the Almighty, Who, he felt assured from his own heart, would
                     not permit forever envy and ignorance to triumph, nor had made even
                        his talents to be in vain.
                  From the outset of his literary career, which began with his adieu to Oxford,
                     he had foreseen and foretold the difficulties that would attend him,â€”tracing
                     before his mental vision the long vista of the coming years, gloomy, craggy,
                     full of sunken bog, and precipices invisible in the perspective; easy to enter,
                     but, once penetrated, offering equal dangers and impediments to progression or
                     retreat; its thickets filled with beasts of prey and venomous reptiles, and
                     destitution staring him in the face from every barren tree and choked-up well; but before him,
                     far, far away in the horizon, a single star, brilliant as the sun, that shot
                     its level ray over all the path, revealing all things, guiding through all
                     things, cheering, sustaining, refreshing, in all things.
                  There was nothing wonderful in this presension and prophecy. It was but the
                     knowledge of his own nature, gentle, tractable, and submissive to reason, fair
                     treatment, and affection, but contemptuous of popular prejudices, stubborn and
                     haughty to dictation and assumption, and resentful of the least injustice; in a
                     word, not the nature of a man to make his way in a world where lying is
                     universal, honor and religion but mouth-words, and where the most unpardonable
                     offence that can be committed is, not to murder, not to commit adultery, not to
                     steal, not to bear false witness, but to think and act in opposition to the
                     mass, especially where the action and the thought are right and a reproach to
                     the general conscience. Self-love is the mainspring of all human action, and
                     whoever weighs on that, let him beware! unless he be so high above the reach of
                     malice as to convert revenge into brute submission and calumny into adulation.
                     Were the sun to sink within human reach, a thousand million hands would be
                     stretched, as by one impulse, to put out a flame that had scorched them in
                     midsummer.
                  A true poet is always a philosopher; and the philosopher is, by the very nature
                     of his reflections, and by the exercise of his observation, a satirist. And in
                     the truest and greatest poets you will always find touches of satire, except it
                     be rigidly excluded by the nature of the composition.1 By satire,
                     however, I do not mean that contemptible sarcasm which is the child of spleen
                     and envy, and which, as it is seeking ever in society, where is its only
                     sphere, food for its insatiable malice, renders those who have it in their
                     keeping the secret terror and abomination of that society, while they are the
                     objects of its open admiration, loud applause, and assiduous caresses. Wit,
                     genuine wit, has no portion in the mouth-invective of these malapert
                     heart-wringers, whose insolence and callous malignancy, where they cannot be
                     chastised by cutting speech, should meet with physical correction in the actual
                     whip, as boys and slaves are punished. Wit is rarer than imagination (indeed
                     imagination, except of the very highest kind, is not in any way rare), yet, as
                     all aspire to be thought possessed of it in some degree, all envy its complete
                     possession in the more favored of nature. Ernestin was too amiable and too
                     benevolent to ever wound the feelings of those with whom he came in contact,
                     and even when they wounded his, which was not seldom, he was so little
                     suspicious of their motive, having nothing in his own nature that was like it,
                     that it was only too late, when indeed alone, reflecting on their conduct, that
                     the spirit of retort rose in him, and he longed, with a heart that was almost
                     savage in its momentary ire, to be placed again where he could punish their
                     wickedness as none than he knew better how. But, its unfuelled wrath burnt out,
                     his heart cooled down to a disregardful or disdainful pity, and the certainty
                     that his unconscious good-nature had worked out his revenges, by disappointing
                     these assassins, finished his restoration to equanimity. But on paper Ernestin
                     was another man. Here he saw not the individual, but looked upon the vice or
                     folly in the abstract, and, in the exhilaration which always attends the easy
                     exercise of conscious power, he shot around his arrows without even looking if
                     the wounds they gave were mortal. They however whom they hit, and they who
                     stood within their reach, made common
                     cause. The rankling wound, the ugly scar, and the dread of either, were to be
                     avenged.â€”The weak, incapable of legitimate defence and of masculine aggression,
                     resort to cunning, falsehood, and feminine intrigue. Witness, in the late war
                     of the United States with Mexico, the Falstaff boasting and lies, the barefaced
                     calumnies, and the petty tricks of Santa Anna. Call these to mind, and set
                     against them the magnanimity, truthfulness, and unsuspecting faith, almost
                     credulity, of the American generals, and you have, what ever has occurred, and
                     ever will occur in the collision of man with man, whether in the battle-field,
                     or in social intercourse, or in the pen-and-ink warfare of the study. Ernestin
                     spoke but truth, even when he was bitterest and most terrible. Truth was his
                     idol,â€”and to the divinity it represented he sacrificed all things of human
                     consideration; or, it was his essential spirit,â€”and he followed its suggestions
                     with the reckless impetuosity wherewith he obeyed the other promptings of a
                     somewhat too impulsive nature. But his enemies had no such devotion, and they
                     knew of no such element in their spiritual being; and as they were a cohort to
                     a man, and influenced legions, the single combatant fell overwhelmed by the
                     multitude, though their weapons could not pierce his armorâ€”for truth is
                     impenetrable; nor crush him beneath its weightâ€”for they who have around the
                     body of their souls such mail are indestructible.
                  It was in vain that his earliest books had sold to the last copy, and were
                     still read where they could be come at. The clamor his works had caused, and
                     the unmeasured obloquy, or, still worse, the crafty indifference of his
                     pretended critics, had made his reputation as an author so low or so formidable
                     with the booksellers, that he could induce none to venture for him in his later
                     and maturer works. I had nearly said, persuade none; but Ernestin's disposition
                     was not a suasory one. He knew not the art of coaxing, or was incapable of
                     practising it. It was indeed one of the great faults of his character, that he
                     was too unbending in matters in which conciliation would have implied no
                     meanness, nor persuasive reasoning have compelled to any dereliction from
                     principle. But one of its excellencies was a perseverance which no impediment
                     could frighten nor defeat destroy. Ever above the wave of obstacle he rose
                     still buoyant, to buffet with a strong arm against succeeding surges, often
                     submerged, but shaking as he rose again the brine from his locks, with a
                     cheerfulness that laughed at discomfiture, and with undimmed eyes keeping ever
                     in view the shore he strove for, satisfied that sooner or later he should reach
                     it, and submissive to his fate, if it were to be but as a corpse.
                  Therefore he wrote on, and published at his own expense. But disaster had not
                     taught him prudence, or his sanguine temper made him disregard its dictates;
                     and though only too ready to listen to others' suggestions, even where their
                     judgment had no right to lead his own, he had no friends to aid him with
                     advice. His pages told unpleasant truth, and his satire hit hard. Moreover,
                     there was an air of superiority about them, which, though not meant to humble
                     others, yet had the same effect, and made enemies of those who might otherwise
                     have acknowledged his claims. The book, however, sold well: but his publishers
                     swindled him out of the entire proceeds. And, as it was printed in an
                     extravagant mannerâ€”his tastes always overmastering discretion, his pecuniary
                     loss was in proportion to their gain. Yet not disheartened, he came out again.
                     But his new publishers, though not rogues, were yet publishers. They had
                     enterprise where their venture ture
                     was sure, and liberality where their outlay would come back to them quadrupled.
                     Having nothing to lose by Ernestin's book, on which they had expended not even
                     the care of selecting type and paper (though as usual they got all the credit
                     thereof), and a great deal by others on which they had disbursed both money and
                     pains, they made a sacrifice of his to avert the displeasure of the critics
                     from the others, and put it on their back shelves when, guided by their
                     critics, the public called it vulgar. Vulgarity in Ernestin!
                  These examples furnish the brief history of all his publications. Bidding
                     defiance to public taste, because it had assumed a false direction, and he
                     carried his detestation of falsehood into every thing,â€”spending largely to
                     gratify his passion for elegance, though the credit of its display went to
                     others and a homelier appearance had made the circulation of his books more
                     easy,â€”cheated by the roguery of his publishers where successful, and where
                     unsuccessful wronged by their neglect,â€”expending ever and never gaining,â€”it
                     need not to be said, that, with Ernestin's circumscribed fortune, all his means
                     that were directly available must soon come to an end. Suo pauper in aere, poor but his own creditor, he was obliged, in
                     order not to become another's debtor, to be more cautious, until the rise in
                     real estate should enable him once more to ruin himself for the benefit of the trade.
                  His publications now were few and far between, and never of such writings as he
                     composed for fame alone. These, though offered without charge, not a bibliopole
                     from Ave Maria to St. James's street would undertake, however they sometimes
                     ventured on his hackney work, and paid for it at such a price as enterprising
                     men of their business pay the drudgery of Grub-street, namely, at half a crown
                     a day.2
                  
                  Inheriting, from both parents, indifference to money, no difficulties could
                     teach our poet prudence in expenditure. He never wasted, never destroyed, but,
                     in purchasing, the slenderness of his purse was always forgotten; and as his
                     tastes habitually directed his purchases, like every thing else that depended
                     on his will, the purse had never a chance to grow stouter,â€”plethoric was out of
                     the question, while booksellers had no bowels and the public had but a public's
                     brains.
                  Like his grandfather before him, the moment he got money, the book-mart was
                     attended, and he, who never spent a farthing in dissipation, nor in the
                     gratification of sensuality, nor in the decoration of his person, became a
                     perfect prodigal in the purchase of volumes, half of which he never had the
                     time to read. So that Ernestin's wardrobe was most meagerly furnished, and had
                     no chance of being replenished or renovated, except its absolute necessities
                     appealed to him at the exact moment the void of his purse happened to be filled
                     up. Then the surplus went immediately to Mr. Evans,3 and the student
                     had not even a sixpence to get into an omnibus, or if he had, and a beggar or
                     crossing-sweeper intercepted him on his way, the omnibus did without him, and
                     the pocket was not the less emptied.
                  Then would the thoughtless creature all at once, at some moment when he was
                     most desirous to go out, find himself with broken gloves, or with the lining of
                     his frock sadly frayed, or with some other dilapidation of his outer raiment.
                     Too filial to permit his mother to assist him, too nice to be contented with
                     the botching of a servant, he would sit down, and, working without thimble,
                     never leave the job till it required practised eyes to detect the reparation.
                     For he boasted that he could do all things that a woman could do, except bear and suckle
                     children; dry-nurse them he could well. Sew and darn, make cake and pastry,
                     bake and brew, all faculties of the housewife and the housemaid came handy to
                     him as the common labors of the artisan or the exalted tasks of the artist; and
                     from one to the other he would fly with equal dexterity, and perform them all
                     with equal care, now busy with the loftiest fancies or most abstruse
                     speculations, then altering the collar of a vest to make its worn-out fashion
                     less conspicuous, and again, without the least constraint, applying to his
                     muse, or taking up the pencil. But it is not to be supposed with equal
                     pleasure. Vanity, or necessity, or filial consideration might make him do one,
                     but the poet in him or the painter reproached him as for wasted time, or sighed
                     at its unprofitable expenditure; but in the other, if duty and pleasure went
                     not always hand in hand, there was no sense of humiliation and no reproach of
                     reason.
                  He was now in one of these straits. The slender sum he had obtained for a labor
                     of half a year, that had actually brought on his cruelly overtasked brain the
                     affection we have described him suffering under, had gone the wonted road to
                     the auctioneer and binder; and alike profitably; for if he did not con the
                     pages of his new-bought tomes, neither were their covers visible behind the
                     solid doors of his presses. Without a single farthing in his pocket, with but
                     one decent coat to his back, albeit, quite in character, he abounded in fine
                     linen, and with a hat too shabby and too old-fashioned for a man of his
                     neatness and who set so high a value on gentility, too proud to ask a favor,
                     and too independent to accept one that he could not hope to return, behold
                     Ernestin Fitzherbert caged like a bird, or rather, like a tiger,â€”for he chafed
                     in his den, and, as he himself was wont to say, beat his soul against the bars,
                     unable to go out save at night.
                  His anguish indeed may readily be imagined. To see the mistress of his fancy
                     pass within arm's reach almost daily, expecting, nay, inviting him to come out,
                     yet to sit there passive, at the risk of being deemed a trifler, faint-hearted,
                     or a fool! Yet, go out in such a trim! He turned to his glass, and took down
                     his rusty beaver. Shape its brim he could, no hatter better; but the crown was
                     monstrous, and the body had a solution of continuity which his little nephew,
                     when they were frolicking together (on terms of perfect equality), had switched
                     into it, and which might gape inopportunely, and the scurvy band, with the
                     furless wool that neighbored it in front and rear, redder than a fox's brush,
                     would make her think she was courted by a schoolmaster. He hangs the hat up
                     again, and, returning to the window, is just in time to see the subject of his
                     meditations pass once more under it. She looks grave. No wonder!
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  THE TIGER GETS OUT.
                  IF you suppose that Ernestin's anxiety was but natural impatience of obstacle,
                     or the irritation of self-love wounded by the idea of disparagement, you do him
                     wrong. He chafed much more at the thought that he might be the cause, however
                     unwilling, of continuing the delusion of this young girl, if such she were
                     laboring under as regarded himself. He knew that his father had been reputed
                     wealthy, and that it was known that much of his estate remained in the family
                     and was increasing surely, though slowly, in value. Beside the inducement this
                     afforded, she might be under the impression that her admirer was younger than
                     he really was; his figure being of that kind which continues youthful till
                     bowed and enfeebled by absolute old-age. He was resolved to enlighten her on
                     both points. Otherwise the delay was rather of advantage, since it would
                     increase the desire of the girl to know him,â€”and he was so humble, or rather so
                     distrustful of woman's imputed proneness to love, as to see in this constant
                     incitement the surest, if not the only chance, of moving her to a return of his
                     affection; without which, though she had all the beauty and virtue of some
                     favorite of fairy-tale,â€”nay, if she were an angel incarnate, she would make no
                     wife for Ernestin Fitzherbert.
                  Autumn was already closing, with its rains and chills. Still glared the lover
                     from behind the bars of his prison, nor seemed the piteous lady to grow weary
                     waiting for his disenthralment. And now, natural effect of distance, which
                     veiled the shore of promise in a purple haze, and made its real insignificance
                     of landscape quite magical in the atmosphere of perspective, Ernestin began to
                     love her very faults, those, I mean, of manner, and to imitate them
                     involuntarily, though not unconsciously. Sometimes in his lonely night walk he
                     caught himself sinking his man's stride into an effeminate and sliding step,
                     his erect person cowering, and seeming, to his fancy, to shrink into ladylike
                     proportions, as the slender figure of the fair one, with her languid
                     gaitâ€”perhaps affected, but appearing to denote lassitude, or physical weakness,
                     passed before his mental sight. And then, ere the smile had left his lips, he
                     would open his eyes to an extraordinary width, as he saw in his soul, and
                     thrilled at the vision, her magnificent orbs, with their breadth of iris,
                     dilating for his particular inspection.
                  Nor was this all. What was perhaps a trait still more amusingâ€”amusing to us who
                     read of it, though any thing but such to himâ€”was that, when watching for her at
                     the window, the least similarity in dress was forever beguiling him into the
                     hope or fear, as might be, but always in fancy, that it was she, or one of her
                     sisters that was coming. Tall or short, it was of little consequence, full or
                     slender, erect or stooping, and, stranger than all, however different the gait.
                     Then would Ernestin torture himself with the idea of the vulgarity of the girl
                     and of her family, and make a thousand resolutions to break in pieces the
                     earthen image he had enshrined in his imagination, and no more be degraded by
                     so mean a worship, when behold, of a sudden den the true divinity would come before him, or
                     her sister goddesses, and what was his delight to recognize the immense
                     difference between their marked, even distinguished, or, to use a much abused
                     epithet, aristocratic gentility of mien, and the plebeian coarseness of those
                     he had mistaken for them! and vowing in his heart that his idol was of Parian
                     marble, or Pentelic at the least, he brushed the dust from its pedestal, and
                     knelt before it with more enthusiastic prostration than ever.
                  One would suppose, that one or two errors of this sort and he would be set
                     beyond the possibility of a mistake; but no; for hope and longing expectation
                     blinded and bewildered him, as they do wiser men,â€”that isâ€”men who do not tie
                     their hearts to a petticoat,â€”though Solomon did, and Socrates might have done
                     soâ€”if his ugliness had not forced him to confine his professional idolatry of
                     beauty to the men.4
                  
                  At length, ere the last autumnal month had quite expired, the sum of five
                     guineas came to Ernestin which his bowelless bookseller, who was making
                     hundreds by his book, had reluctantly consented to give him on the sale of a
                     first edition; and the student sought at once, not Evans's, but his hatter's in
                     St. James's street.
                  It was a pleasant afternoon, the weather seeming to hold up on purpose to
                     oblige him, when our amorous knight sallied out in chase of his Dulcinea, who
                     had just passed. But, not being over head and ears in love, he first stopped
                     before the mirror and arranged his side-locks becomingly under the brim of his
                     new beaver; and in that act, more flattering to the lady than to himself, he
                     lost his opportunity, for when he reaches the pavement she is nowhere to be
                     seen.
                  Abusing his own vanity, Ernestin returns disconsolate; but scarcely has he
                     resumed his station, his hat still on his head, when he sees the beauty coming
                     back on the opposite side of the street. Another look at the glass, and another
                     twist of the hair, notwithstanding he has just blamed himself for such
                     coxcombry, and he is out again. There, at an interval easily passed over, moves
                     very slowly his unknown divinity, and as she moves looks back, and back, and
                     back, and back again, but not over the way, pretending she does not know he has
                     just left the houseâ€”though he had slammed the door behind him, yet anxious to
                     encourage him; an action more natural than well-bred. But Ernestin's pulse is
                     beating too violently to permit him to criticise it over closely, or to
                     remember that he held in particular dislike this will-and-won't behavior of the
                     sex. Had there been half the tumult in the lady's veins that was in his, she
                     would have dropped.
                  One street she passes, and another. And now he crosses to her side of the way;
                     for she is near the head of the street where he supposes that she lives. But
                     just before she reaches the corner, she enters a small shop.
                  Any other man in Ernestin's situation would have followed her directly; but
                     Ernestin, when he had fixed his mind upon doing a particular thing, did it, and
                     nothing else. Opportunities for better action appealed to him in vain,â€”he saw
                     them not; the inutility of the thing, nay, its positive impropriety, became
                     apparent,â€”his reason acknowledged it, but his will yielded not. Hence he often
                     got himself into strange predicaments, and made men of soberer fancies stare,
                     and women, despite their natural penetration, smile and wonder. I believe this
                     fixedness of purpose and pertinacity of the will are not unusual in men of
                     strong imaginations, even where they are the reverse, as was the case with
                     Ernestin of headstrong; and I have
                     elsewhere said, that the world often does them injustice when it weighs their
                     obliquities in the vulgar balance of right and wrong. On the present occasion,
                     Ernestin's sole purpose was to discover where the lady lived, that he might
                     ascertain who and what she was, and regulate his conduct accordingly. So he
                     waited long, parading up and down, and right and left, and made himself the
                     gaze of idlers standing near, who, if they knew any thing of intrigue, must
                     have thought a man of his figure could be there for no good. Perhap the lady
                     waited too.
                  But at last she appears, and, rounding the point, floats gently down the road,
                     with the pursuing frigate in her wake. They passed the house where he supposed
                     she lived, and Ernestin, who does not like the neighborhood, is pleased. Down
                     all the length of the street, then up a broader one, still moves the lady,
                     without looking behind or aside; and he fails not to notice that her gait is no
                     longer languid, but firm, her carriage upright, and her foot well planted. And
                     now, that she is in a neighborhood where it is not at all likely that she
                     lives, he begins to be annoyed. "Can it be possible that she wishes me to join
                     her? Does she think, that, if I wanted to, I dare not?" And he is almost
                     tempted, in his hurt pride, to prove the contrary. But that step taken leaves
                     him no power of retreat, for after what had passed it would be tantamount to a
                     declaration of love. No, he will see where she lives, and that only, if he
                     follow her till night. And now she turns directly about; and they are
                     approaching, face to face. As they near each other, he sees the color of the
                     lady's face, who keeps her eyes fixed, but not firmly, upon his, deepen and
                     deepen, till, in the shade of the evening, her cheek grew almost dusky.
                     Beautiful she still was certainly; but with the paleness of her face, and the
                     steadiness and dignity of her mien, had disappeared much of her style. Yet
                     Ernestin, though he sees these signs of emotion, and this involuntary
                     acknowledgment of recognition, bows not, nor yields in any way to the
                     temptation of his heart. They pass each other, and, after walking a suitable
                     distance, Ernestin turns likewise back upon his steps and follows her again.
                     But he is now in great displeasure, perhaps as much from mortified vanity, as
                     with dislike of her freedom; for, when he repeats the question to himself,
                     "Does she think I need encouragement?" his answer is instantaneous: "She
                     certainly does."
                  They pass again the street they had descended, and still she goes on. He is
                     however so disappointed and irritated, that he thinks he should like to turn
                     about and leave her forever; and but that such an action would, under the
                     circumstances, be insulting, he would have done so. And now she enters another
                     little shop, and when he comes near with a slow unwilling step, she appears at
                     the door with something in her hand, as if to examine it in a better light. How
                     could he be displeased with her, she looked so unmistakably innocent, the
                     character of her whole face was so virginal, when she lifted up her eyes from
                     the stuff, and, looking at him encouragingly, smiled? But he was absolutely
                     indignant. Yet never had he seen a face more lovely,â€”the stooping posture
                     assisting its oval contour, the color now entirely vanished, and, in the
                     lessening light of the evening and the shadow of the door-way, her eyes
                     transcendently beautiful. Blue they now appeared as indigo, or the depths of an
                     American or Italian sky, or the water of mid ocean. Yet he is only more
                     displeased. But perhaps had he been able then to examine his own heart, he
                     would have found that wounded self-love had as much to do with his
                     exasperation, as any supposed indelicacy on her part; for in that heart it was written, that the lady must esteem him
                     spiritless.
                  Nothing now but the fixedness of purpose I have mentioned, would have kept him
                     near her a minute; but he is there to ascertain her condition, and ascertain it
                     he will, if at all in his power.
                  Her shopping, or the pretence, is over; and she now ascends the very street,
                     and in a few moments lands upon the steps of the very house where he had
                     determined that she did live. She faces about, she regards him. He scarcely
                     looks; he passes; he is very grave and thoughtful, and stooping his head, and
                     with his hand in his breast, walks along in deep meditation.
                  But the irritation is not over. His head is soon lifted, his limbs stretch into
                     a haughtier stride, his lip is slightly curled, his brows slightly knit, his
                     eyes are fiery, he is in a mood to quarrel with any man, and, out of pure
                     despite and heart-sickness, to make love to any woman. Happily for Ernestin,
                     his better angel presided in that hour, or he might have returned to the
                     follies he was, through this innocent love, throwing off for ever. As it was,
                     he walks all the way into town, and stepping into a confectioner's in the
                     Haymarket, to purchase some delicacy for his mother, he pays such open court to
                     the man's wife, that afterwards, when he had repented, he found the woman, a
                     handsome coquette, so mindful of it, that he avoided the shop to escape being
                     courted in turn. Thence he turns down into Charing Cross, and there, entering a
                     pastrycook's with a like filial purpose, makes love to the attendant, a
                     brilliant and impertinent brunette. And these were actions which were singular
                     in Ernestin; for, with all his amorous folly, as he had never debased himself
                     with the polluting pleasures that tempt the vulgar-minded and the foolish at
                     every step in a great city, so his pride and delicacy had kept him from the
                     disgrace of such effrontery as he was now, in the simple bitterness of his
                     heart, assuming, though for the last time.
                  Alas for man's consistency! alas for his reason! This very Ernestin, who had
                     been frightened by the timidity of Imogen, is now repelled by the freedom of
                     the unknown and still more beautiful stranger. Had he but reflected that she
                     too was very young, and that his conduct had been such as to justify her in
                     supposing him to be timid, and that he had never before thought ill of such
                     advances in beautiful well-bred women to whom he was an utter stranger, which
                     now offended him in one with whom he had for nearly half a year held
                     intercourse by the eyes, he might have regained much sooner his equanimity. And
                     in fact a night's repose, though brief and broken, restored him to his truer
                     senses, and he resolved, and not the less readily that he did not see her all
                     the next day, and began, even so soon, to mistrust the impression he might have
                     made, he resolved to pursue the adventure to what he considered its proper
                     close.
                  So, when the night comes, Ernestin puts on his despised old beaver, and
                     muffling himself in a capacious cloak, concealed moreover by an umbrella, for
                     it was raining, visits the street where dwells the fair. The darkness made it
                     seem still meaner; and, despite his love, his heart sickened. He looked about
                     him. There was near the head of the street, on the opposite side, an obscure
                     ginshop. Conscious of his conspicuous appearance, which the old hat could not
                     hide, he hesitated a good deal, casting, in the meantime, many a look at his
                     lady's dwelling, and wondering what part of it she occupied, but finally
                     entered and called for a tumbler of
                     rum and water, which, in order to have more time, he desired to have made
                     hot.
                  The keeper, a decent and civil-spoken man, looked at him with slight surprise,
                     and remarked: "I fear our rum will not be good enough for you, sir."
                  "O no matter," said Ernestin, moving to the fire. "Let me try it."
                  The man puts a pipkin on the grate, and brushing off a chair moves it towards
                     Ernestin, who however declines sitting.
                  "You are greatly changed in this place," said Ernestin.
                  "Sir?" said the man.
                  "I mean you are growing up very rapidly."
                  "O yes, sir! one scarce knows oneself, the streets fill up so. But we are a
                     good way from London yet."
                  Ernestin assented to so reasonable a remark; then observed: "That row of houses
                     nearly opposite must be quite new. I do not remember to have observed them till
                     very lately." It would have been strange if he had, for until very lately he
                     had never been in the street at all.
                  "Within a very little time, sir. Very nice buildings."
                  "Quite so, but small. By the byâ€”Ah! the spirit."
                  "A little sugar in it, sir?"
                  "Thank you, no." Ernestin places the tumbler on the mantle-shelf as if to cool
                     a little, and purposely spills half.
                  "Let me fill it up again for you, sir," said the man.
                  "O no," said Ernestin, "there will be more than enough. I am sorry to give you
                     so much trouble,"â€”as his host began to sweep the mixture from the hearth.
                  The man is very much pleased at this civility,â€”the more so that Ernestin's
                     voice tells that he speaks sincerely; and he grows himself very polite. "No
                     trouble, sir, in the least. A pleasure to wait upon you.â€”Is it mixed to your
                     taste, sir?"
                  Lying becomes a habit, and so does truth-speaking; and habits prompt
                     unconsciously, like simple instincts.5 Ernestin did not think of
                     evading reply, but answered simply: "I do not know. I dare say it is very good.
                     Do you know who it is lives in the last house of the row?"
                  "Martha!" said the man, going to the door of a back room, which was open;
                     "What's the name of the folks in the fartherest house off, over the way?" A
                     voice civil as his own instantly replied, "Helviston."
                  "Do you know who they are?" said Ernestin.
                  "No, sir," said the man; "they have only been there since Lady-day. She's a
                     lone body, is the lady."
                  "A widow, you mean."
                  "I don't know, sir. They have a good deal of dancing there."
                  What a foolish fellow is Ernestin, to let such a remark from such a person pain
                     him!
                  He had learned enough; and it were indiscreet, if not useless, to ask more. So,
                     after one or two commonplace questions about other familiesâ€”not to appear
                     particular in his inquiries, Ernestin paid his reckoning, and withdrew.
                  "Dancing!" thought Ernestin, and frowned. And then he smiled, as he added in
                     mind: "The man has heard a fiddle once. So young, 'tis natural they should love
                     gayety; and people do not give up company because they cannot live in
                     town."
                  His way is homeward; but I suppose he wants exercise; for, though it is raining
                     now quite hard, he makes a perambulation down the street and up again on the
                        other side; and, as he passes a
                     certain house, his umbrella is laid backward on his shoulder, though the storm
                     is directly in his teeth.
                  "Helviston?" he says to himself, as the umbrella is once more
                     held before his face; "I know no such name. Elliston, perhaps.
                     'Tis not a mean one."
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  THE DISCOVERY.
                  THE next morning, quite early for a poet, the student takes his way to town,
                     and stopping at his stationer's, asks to see the Court Guide. His fears would
                     have prompted him, I believe, to have searched the Tradesman's Directory; but
                     the recollection, that it would be idle for a house in Chelsea, saved him that
                     pain.
                  "I suppose," he said, "Mr. Sams," as that polite person handed him the Guide,
                     "the names hardly extend to the out-parishes?"
                  "I fear not, sir. And yetâ€”I do not knowâ€”a good many of the gentry live there
                     now, and not a few literary gentlemen and artists."
                  Ernestin turns over the leaves. Helviston is not there; and Elliston does not answer anywhere to the locality. His face begins
                     to burn. "Can I assist you, Mr. Fitzherbert?" asks the urbane stationer.
                     Ernestin was nearly rash enough to state his difficulty; but beginning anew at
                     the letter E, with the resolve to go through all its catalogue, he thanks Mr.
                     Sams, and proceeds. Elphinstone: that is like it. Earl of Elphinstone.â€”Sir Edward Elphinstone, Bart.â€”Rear Admiral Sir Anson Elphinstone, K. C. B.â€”Elphinstone,
                        Esq.â€”Elphingstone, Esq.â€”Esq.â€”Esq.â€”All in town. Hum! Lady Elphinstone. There is a widow. But
                     she is in town too.
                     Mrs. Elphinstone. Ah! And Chelsea! and the very street!"â€”Had he
                     been alone, I verily believe he would have kissed the book.
                  He goes home very well satisfied; for he knows precisely the standing which the
                     respectable families of that name held among the gentry. But the party in
                     question might not belong to them. This he must ascertain.
                  Providence had endowed our poet with a happy heart, as I hope I have shown in
                     our introductory or second chapter. But, as I think that happiness is always a
                     result rather of the constitution and organization, than of the temper
                     considered separately (if such separation be at all reasonable or even
                     possible) as a quality purely of the mind or soul, it would perhaps be better
                     to apply the epithet of happy to both brain and heart,â€”for his nerves had no
                     less to do with this precious endowment than his arteries and veins. If nothing
                     depressed him long, so the least excitement, were it but the exercise of a
                     brisk walk, was sufficient to raise his elastic spirits to the tiptop of
                     exhilaration. Now he had both physical and moral excitement to send his blood
                     dancing through his veins, and his nerves made him tingle all over his
                     sensitive body with a feeling of alacrity that was pleasure, that was
                     happiness. As he sprung up the staircase and bounded into the back
                     drawing-room, where he found his mother, as he had hoped, alone, his eyes
                     sparkled, his cheeks glowed, a brighter red was in his lips, his very hair
                     seemed to be animated with sensation. Putting down his hat, he took his mother
                     by the hand, and drew her for securer privacy into the little front room.
                  "Mamma," said Ernestin, " how would you like to have me marry?"
                  "Provided it were to a suitable person, very much. But you are so difficult, my
                     son! I am afraid you will search long before you find that Miranda."
                  "And if I do not find her, be assured I never will marry. You know I told you,"
                     he continued, but in a more subdued tone, "that I was very much"â€”It is curious
                     how ashamed both men and women are to use the word love. In love! Ernestin would as soon have thought of opening his door
                     when he was praying. Is it that in both cases we fear to be suspected of
                     hypocrisy?â€”"that I was very much taken," said Ernestin, correcting himself,
                     "with a young lady"â€”
                  "Whom you knew nothing about."
                  "But whom I now know something about. She is an Elphinstone."
                  "Where did you learn that?" said his mother, who did not seem to be
                     particularly pleased with the announcement.
                  "In the Court Guide, where I found her address,â€”that is, her mother's."
                  "And is that all? You forget, my son, that there are many of the name; and they
                     do not all belong to the better family."
                  "No, but it is not difficult to learn who do. Old Lady Saville knows everybody
                     that is of any consequence, and is a complete herald in matters of genealogy.
                     Isabel" (that was his elder and married sister) "tells me that her daughters
                     constantly ask about me, and in a way that shows they would be glad to have me
                     renew my visits. But"â€”Ernestin paused in some hesitation. "I am afraid," he
                     added, "I must give up that idea. You know why I left off visiting there?"
                  "Because, though they always welcomed you warmly to their family circle, they
                     never invited you to their dinners or evening parties."
                  
                  It was his mother that spoke, yet Fitzherbert's cheeks burned. "Yes," he
                     rejoined; "I thought myself a visitor on sufferance. And on such terms I would
                     not visit the king." He rose from the sofa where they were seated, but as there
                     was no space to walk in, in the little room, sat down again. "No, I cannot go
                     there, not if it were the only place where I could learn what I desire.
                     Besides, it would not be right to make an intelligence-office even of Lady
                     Saville's; for her manner has ever been kind and courteous. But there are the
                     Evelyns, who do not insult my obscurity by such distinctions. Miss Margaret
                     Evelyn visits a great deal in Chelsea, and is not unlikely to know this very
                     family. She knows I have not visited anywhere of late, and will not resent my
                     past neglect." He paused. "But I ought not to make her a convenience either;
                     and the less so, that she and all her family are so amiable and so hospitable.
                     I am afraid, Ma', I shall have to end this adventure as romantically as it is
                     begun, and be my own introducer."
                  "Take care, Ernestin," said his mother, rather uneasily. "That step would
                     scarcely admit of retreat. It would be in itself almost a declaration of
                     love."
                  "Faith, and I am like enough to make an actual one if I come to speak with her,
                     be it how or where it may. And, to my reasoning, I have done quite as much
                     already, and she has found no Latin in it. But you do not seem to be over
                     pleased with this affair. You make me sorry that I have told you."
                  "Only because, my son, I think you will be disappointed."
                  "And why?" said Ernestin, rather hurt; for it mortifies our self-love to find
                     what we admire, or what we found great expectations upon, slighted or made out
                     to be unpromising. It disparages our tastes and judgment, and convicts us of
                     being too sanguine; which is to argue a superiority in the more dispassionate
                     mind that sees, or thinks it sees, so clearly, while ourselves are blind.
                     "Would you have been so distrustful of Imogen, or of Grace Wortley, or of Lady
                     Augusta Johnstone?"
                  "No, I think that any one of them would have made you happy."
                  "Yet, excepting Imogen, you knew no more of those ladies than you do of
                     this."
                  "Pardon me, my son, I knew enough of Miss Wortley's mother to be sure that her
                     daughter had been brought up, as, to make you happy, she would need to be. And
                     for Lady Augusta,â€”your darling sister's admired friend! Poor dear Ilda! how
                     much had she told you that was so noble, so singularly generous in that young
                     lady's character!"
                  "And she was so beautiful," said Ernestin musingly: "Do you remember her large
                     Spanish eyes, of a black like velvet, and with lashes that glistened like
                     steel? and her long arched neck, which she would draw up so gracefully, and
                     with a gentle pride that so became her? I should have been a happy man had I
                     married her, certainly."
                  "And then her family, Ernestin! How often have you said that one might marry
                     Lady Augusta, if it were only to be connected with her sisters. Such grace!
                     such thorough breeding! such charms of intellect!â€”and not without some beauty,
                     too; especially as met together in the eldest,â€”Lady Clara, I think."
                  "Yes, she was a little fairy. And by the by," said Ernestin, "they were, all,
                     just the size of these Miss Elphinstones."
                  "But, my son," said Mrs. Fitzherbert, a little impatiently, though she was
                     equanimity itself, "even if this
                     family be all that a man like you could desire, yet they are evidently poor, or
                     their proud blood would never be contented to stagnate in a village; and all of
                     the ladies you have named were either rich in their own right or had large
                     expectations."
                  "And has not that been the very cause of my discouraging the feelings I
                     entertained for them? Poor Imogen! but for that!â€”No matter. How do you know,
                     mother,"-Ernestin never called his parent by this name in his caressing moods,
                     and it argued now a little discomposureâ€”"that Grace would have had me? She did
                     not know even that I admired her; for I never permitted myself to show her what
                     I felt; and you know why; because her haughty mother seemed to suspect that I
                     had intentions that way; and to put a stop to such suspicions, false though
                     they were, I discontinued my visits. She little knew my pride. Court her
                     daughter, with her wealth and fashion!" Ernestin rose and threw up the window,
                     then shut it down again. "And as for Lady Augustaâ€”though I loved her" (the
                     speaker is warm, and no longer measures his phrases), "and do still, though so
                     long departed, nearly as much as I did and do poor Imogen, ill-fated like her,
                     I never could have brought myself to address her. She saw my passion indeed,
                     and did not seem displeased with it. How should she? I was young then, and
                     good-looking, a gentleman, and her friend's favorite brother. But it does not
                     follow that she would have permitted a serious courtship. She with her high
                     family, the first, by universal admission, in their county, and her large
                     fortune! It would have been madness to think of it. Perhaps," he added, with a
                     very unpleasant expression, "her family would have called it insolence."
                  "I do not think so, my son. She married, as Grace has done, a man certainly not
                     your superior in any respect, and perhaps not even your equal,â€”and your father
                     was then reputed, and not without reason, wealthy."
                  "But I tell you, mother, I would not have had her think even for one moment,
                     that I courted her for the sake of her rank and fortune, not though I had loved
                     her as well as I do Miss Elphinstone, who is far more beautiful, and, if there
                     be any truth in features, quite as noble of nature." Now Ernestin knew well
                     enough (and had paid for his knowledge), that there is no true indication of
                     the moral character in features, though there is in the expression, fugitive or
                     habitual, of the visage. But he did not like to be too particular. His mother
                     however, not being in his romantic predicament, was not so nice; and
                     accordingly she said:
                  "I advise you, my son, not to trust to what is but the outside of the casket
                     after all. Be cautious before you bid for a jewel that is locked up, lest when
                     you have resigned all that you possess to obtain it, I may say even to your
                     soul, you find it but a common pearl, of little price, which you might even be
                     ashamed to wear."
                  "Mother!"
                  "I am sorry to offend you, Ernestin; but it is my simple duty. If you court
                     this lady before you know any thing about her, you may find yourself involved
                     when it will be too late to retreat, at least with honor."
                  "How so?" said Ernestin, even fiercely. "Do you think that if I find her to be
                     a Scotch pebble, when I took her for a diamond, I will purchase her? Not though
                     a thousand relatives stood around her to enforce the bargain! Better to part
                     before marriage, than after."
                  "You forget! For better, for worse."
                  "That is the worse of accident, or of mistake, not of wilful deception.â€”But you go beyond my meaning.
                     If I pledge myself, I redeem my word, though it cost me my salvation. But I
                     have no intention to enter into any engagementâ€”and I shall so give her plainly
                     to understandâ€”until I have learned to read her well, and to know if we may live
                     together, as man and wife should live."
                  "But how is that possible, without the means of life? You are both poor."
                  "Have you never heard me say that I would give up all my hopes of glory for a
                     dream of love? O let me but find this beautiful creature worthy of the
                     sacrifice, and if she can return my passionâ€”for without that there is nothingâ€”I
                     will at once forsake the paths I now tread in, and struggle for mere
                     subsistence as others do. You know that two years of study at any time will fit
                     me to embark in the profession for which I am partially prepared. There is
                     enough left of my little patrimony to sustain me respectably, even with the
                     addition of a wife, for at least two years, and it will be strange, if with my
                     industry I cannot get along where even fools so speedily attain to wealth, and,
                     in its kind, to eminence. After that time, what additions may come to our
                     family will not want a blanket."
                  "Psha!" said his mother, who seemed bent to oppose him, "you are not so sure of
                     having a family."
                  "By Jove, there is every likelihood of such a consummation!" said Ernestin.
                     "And such children! What eyes they will have! and what noses! and such
                     beautiful hair!" He put his arm about his mother's waist and actually hugged
                     her. She laughed lightly, but withdrew herself. "I shall never be in want of
                     models for cherubsâ€”nor for full-length angels either!" As he spoke thus in the
                     gayety of his heart (forgetting, that as those heavenly beings were not to be
                     fed on ambrosia he must give up the arts they were to serve), he saw, that in
                     his mother's yet handsome face there was not the least trace of sympathy, as in
                     her action there was confession of the want; and Ernestin once more felt
                     himself alone.
                  "Mother," he said, the tear rising to his eye; "you cannot wonder that I long
                     to marry."
                  His mother looked as if she did wonder; but she said nothing. Her hand was now
                     on the door.
                  "Because," continued Ernestin, "I am dying to have somebody to love, that can
                     love me, that can understand me, that will not chill me in every aspiration of
                     my solitary heartâ€”some one that will replace Agnes and Ildaâ€”and make me once
                     more feel that I am not an outcast in the world. Go, mother; you cannot
                     understand me." He opened the door; and when it had closed upon her, he added
                     bitterly, "And I was a fool to think you would."
                  "O my Creator!" he exclaimed, throwing up his hands to Heaven and kneeling by
                     the couch; "pardon me that irreverence, even for the anguish of the heart that
                     prompted it! Have compassion on me, I supplicate of Thy goodness, and let me
                     not be thus desolate!"
                  The guardian angel saw down into the little chamber, and into the soul of its
                     occupant, and, as he marked the pang that wrung it, he turned his sorrowful
                     eyes towards the further stars; and instantly the voice in his own breast
                     answered:
                  "To be desolate, is to be compelled to rely for all things on one's
                     self-resources. He who leans upon another never will learn to know his own
                     strength."
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  FOIBLES.
                  ONE of the foibles of Ernestin's character will have been easily detected in
                     the foregoing scene. Conscious of being honorable and disinterested, to a
                     degree that most men would call romantic and many men insane, he could not bear
                     to be suspected of meanness or selfishness, even by those who he knew would
                     think the better of him were he stained by both. And in this excessive pride
                     and self-loveâ€”for such it was, though not of a little or narrow kindâ€”he had
                     stifled a passion which he began to feel for a noble and accomplished girl,
                     whose character, as indicated in many magnanimous traits revealed to him by his
                     sister Ilda, her schoolmate, he had every reason to be satisfied with,â€”he had
                     stifled this legitimate love through fear he should be suspected of wooing her
                     for her birth, her fortune and her high fashion! when he should have known that
                     the girl's own vanity, her consciousness of merit and of great personal charms,
                     whose impression upon Ernestin she had observed with evident pleasure, would
                     have prevented her entertaining such a suspicion, while the world, in believing
                     such to be his views, would have found nothing in them either censurable or
                     uncommon.
                  Another weakness was the exacting nature of his affections. That his mother
                     loved him was not enough. That she did not love him as he loved her, as his
                     sisters Agnes and Ilda had loved him, that she was incapable of such love, this
                     conviction tortured him, and in his pain he often gave vent to expressions that
                     his conscience afterward severely reproached him for; nor conscience only, but
                     reason; for, if his mother were incapable of such affection, how unreasonable
                     was it to expect it in her! how tyrannous, as well as unfilial, to reproach her
                     because she had it not!
                  Another and very serious infirmity was his impatience of contradiction. Perhaps
                     indeed his greatest torment arose from his not being able to put his own eyes
                     into the heads of others, and especially of his mother, who, with the most
                     admirable natural talents as well as virtues,â€”to which Ernestin always ascribed
                     his own moral and intellectual constitution quite as much as to his father's
                     nature, in whose family high talent was hereditary,â€”was so blind to her own
                     feelings and perceptions, and, a true woman, so obstinate in resisting all his
                     efforts to give her insight, that, loving her so truly, he suffered more from
                     this cause than perhaps all others put together. The recurrence of this torture
                     became at last, by repetition, a habit (effect easier to follow in such
                     thoughtful minds as Ernestin's, than in others); and when, after a night of
                     broken rest, Ernestin felt his head somewhat relieved, if he commenced
                     conversation with his mother, her contradiction or opposition (become probably
                     with her also habitual), to what in his eyes was almost self-evident, would
                     excite it to a degree that brought on again all his symptoms. Then, raising his
                     hands and eyes to heaven, he would give vent to some murmured expression of
                     sorrow or suffering, and fly to his room to bewail his fate, and at the same
                     time to reproach himself for irreverence and ingratitude to his widowed parent;
                     for, ever clear-sighted, and a rigid
                     and constant self-examiner, Ernestin never shut his eyes to his own faults
                     while opening them wide to the defects of others. And it was this impartiality
                     in himself which exasperated him against all around him, whom he saw incapable,
                     from want of sagacity or from self-conceit, of like justice.
                  Was such a man fit to marry? Yes, one of lofty character yet docile
                     disposition, and susceptible of loving with devoted tenderness, like his
                     sisters in Heaven; but none other. And to such a one! he would have been, as to
                     them, the sun of her existence, in the firmament of her affections rising
                     daily, whether in cloud or clear, to give light, warmth, health, happiness,
                     every blessing.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  THE POET'S MUSE BECOMES EROTIC, AND STOOPSâ€”BUT NOT TO
                     CONQUER.
                  TO the elastic temper of Ernestin Fitzherbert, vexation of any kind was but a
                     transient depression; and his mother, from whom he had derived this temper,
                     felt it scarcely more. Rebounding from the shock of her supposed indifference
                     to his natural, and, as he regarded them, reasonable desires, he thought more
                     calmly on her advice, and, recognizing its wisdom, resolved to follow it,â€”the
                     more readily that it squared with his own self-counsel. Yet the only means that
                     presented itself, of learning what it was proper he should know of the Chelsea
                     beauty and her family, was so repugnant to his sincerity that he could not
                     bring himself to adopt it. Day followed day in complete inaction; and each day
                     left him at its close still more enamored, but still unresolved. But the poet
                     shall explain his own feelings, and in a poet's way.
                  He was seated at the accustomed window, and a little anxious; for it was
                     several days since the adventure of the street chase, and, whether in disdain
                     or not, the enticer had not reappeared. Not entirely forgetful of his duty, he
                     had endeavored to bring his mind to his unfinished tragedy; but Love had
                     blocked up every passage, and Poetry could find no entrance save by his
                     permission. It occurred to the student therefore, that he would make a
                        compromise between them, and let
                     them for a while perform in company; and the pain he felt, when he endeavored
                     in despite of love to force his muse to her proper and more dignified
                     employment, helped to resolve him. At this moment the expected planet presents
                     itself to his delighted gaze, and without a cloud upon its disc. He could not
                     doubt that he should find spirit now for his meditated love-verse. But, alas!
                     the flesh was weak; and the first stanza brought on his formidable complaint to
                     so distressing a degree, that he was obliged to abandon it like his drama; and
                     it was only after a long interval that even this trifle was completed, in the
                     form in which I now present it.
                  
                     I.
                     'Tis my lady! O behold!
                     Like twin stars her eyes are shining.
                     In the sun her locks are gold,
                     Pale as from the mint's refining;
                     In the shadow, chestnut-brown,
                     Light, and softer than the down,
                     And above her cheek's curve twining,
                     Twining with an amorous fold
                     Fills me almost with repining,
                     As the wind, with kisses bold,
                     Waves the ringlet up and down,
                     On her cheek so white and cold.
                  
                  
                     II.
                     O that cheek so cold and white!
                     O those eyes that shine so brightly!
                     O those locks! their wavy light
                     Gleams before me daily, nightly,
                     Twining, with their threads of gold,
                     Round my heart in magic fold,
                     Twining softly, yet so tightly,
                     That, with pain that is delight,
                     Scarcely can I reason rightly,
                     Watching hourly for the sight
                     For whose minutes I have sold
                     All my day and all my night.
                  
                  
                     III.
                     'Tis my lady! See! she glides
                     Proudly whither I am waiting.
                     Now no envious wimple hides
                     Queenly air and features mating.
                     Shall I linger? If I stay,
                     All my heart is stolen away.
                     If I leave the wooden grating,
                     Still my spirit there abides,
                     With her motions fluctuating,
                     She the moon that sways its tides.
                     And its ebb leaves, all that day,
                     Stagnant senses, naught besides.
                  
                  
                     IV.
                     'Tis too late: those starry eyes
                     'Neath their lids' broad curve have seen me;
                     And the sweet lip vainly tries
                     To look steady, while I lean me
                     At the window. O my heart!
                     Is not this a childish part?
                     From its shame what blind shall screen me?
                     Yet thy promptings ill advise:
                     Man-like if I dare demean me,
                     Prudence springs before and cries,
                     "Know the goal before you start.
                     Blindly run, and honor dies!"
                  
                  
                     V.
                     Ah! 'tis reason. Yet, behold!
                     How like stars those eyes are shining!
                     And those locks, like virgin gold,
                     Pale as from the mint's refining,â€”
                     
                     See! the shadow makes them brown!â€”
                     Light they float, and soft as down;
                     Now about her cheek's curve twining,
                     Twining with an amorous fold
                     Fills me almost with repining.
                     Would 'twere I, whose kisses bold
                     Wav'd the ringlet up and down,
                     On that cheek so white and cold!
                  
                  These stanzas have not the vigor, the man-tone of his larger compositions. But
                     vigor is not in keeping with the melancholy languor of amorous musing; and this
                     is the strain which prevails in the piece. For us, it has the interest of
                     painting his heart's mistress in the colors of poetry, and of giving us, in the
                     brevity of verse, a description of his own feelings.
                  Further than this, it is something of a rarity. Ernestin thought, and rightly,
                     that such compositions are unworthy of a true man, and left them therefore to
                     the less masculine of poets. Not but that their gentle sweetness, especially
                     where plaintive or melancholy, pleased his ear as well; but it was the pleasure
                     afforded by a soft and pensive song, or by a well-painted landscape in little,
                     and won no respect for the author, nor admiration for the art, as the nervous
                     opera or the vigorous picture of human life, wherein every element of power
                     that either art enjoys finds ready and harmonious admission, according to the
                     capability of the artist or composer, and which none but a man and a master can
                     manage fitly.
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  CUPID IN CHURCH.
                  IT is now the middle of December. There has been a light fall of snow; and the
                     ground is frosted over. It is the sabbath morning, and the parish bells are
                     summoning the church-going people of Chelsea to their weekly devotion and
                     religious homage. Ernestin never or rarely goes to church. There is something
                     in its ritual that does not chime with his own ideas of the Deity; and in the
                     extemporaneous worship of dissenters he finds, besides, much that is repugnant
                     to his tastes. His temple was everywhere, its floor the spot he knelt on, its
                     altar his own soul, its vault the arch of heaven,â€”for in all his prayers, at
                     morning or at night, whatever the atmosphere and the season, in the depth of
                     winter as at mid-summer, in the time of cloud and storm as when the firmament
                     was serene and the elements were at peace, he put down the sash of his window
                     from the top, and looking upward poured out his orisons to the open air.
                     Sometimes at midnight, seated by his study-window with the sash raised, he
                     would look upon the stars until he lost sight of the dark sky, and saw nothing
                     but a mighty void with the planets rolling in it, system within system, orb
                     circumgyrating orb, rank on rank as it were, one behind another, far far away,
                     with rapidly lessening intervals, into the minute perspective of the fathomless
                     infinite. Then the soul of Ernestin
                     grew indeed ethereal, and in its temporary resurrection put on the wings of
                     immortality, and his eyes wept the adoration to which his lips gave expression.
                     Or in the shadow of some ancient tree, when the night wind whistled in the
                     leaves, and the footfall of man had died away in the distance, Ernestin would
                     stop, and, taking off his hat, murmur his adoration, his supplications, his
                     contrition. But whatever was the temple, ever preferably when its aisles were
                     darkness and its solitude had not an echo of human sound except his own.
                  Yet not the less, Ernestin held all places of public worship in profound
                     respect. It was the habit of his childhood, engrafted on natural piety by his
                     father, whom he had seen pray with as much reverence in a synagogue as in St.
                     George's or St. James'; and though forgotten in the passions of his youth,
                     which made him, like lighter men, profane the sanctuary by amorous gallantries,
                     such as unhappily may everywhere be seen where women worship with men, it had
                     now returned, and with increased strength, since reason, and (if I may apply
                     the words to behavior in the house of God) good taste and a more enlarged
                     politeness, had demonstrated its propriety. This solemn sense of what was due
                     in such a place had been an additional and very powerful motive of his absence;
                     for despite the preparation which he underwent in mind before crossing the
                     vestibule, something or other would happen, to put to flight solemnity or to
                     banish devotion. Now it was a ludicrous defect in the preacher, or the
                     drowsiness of some overfed worshipper, and now a beautiful hand, which,
                     studiously raised in some feminine manÅ“uvre, would catch the artist's eye
                     despite his immobility, and divide his attention, by intervals, for the rest of
                     the service. Why need I add more? thee arc diversions from duty which few
                     persons regard as sinful; but Ernestin they filled with remorse.
                  The sophistry of love, which persuades to every thing, even where it does not
                     convince, had now come to plead on the side of religion; and Ernestin on a
                     sudden takes it into his head to go again to church. He knew that it was not
                     piety, nor a sense of duty, but the sole desire of seeing and being under the
                     same roof with the woman he loved; and the purity of the sentiments he
                     entertained for her seemed to justify in his eyes this latitude of action,
                     which his soberer reason had taught him to regard as profane.
                  Moreover, the imaginative and sanguine lover whispers himself, that perhaps he
                     may contrive to make there the acquaintance he has so much at heart. Such
                     fortune had happened to him indeed in Italy; but how he proposed to bring it
                     about in the exclusive pews of an English church, and with one of his own
                     reserved countrywomen, the object too of a serious courtship and not of casual
                     intrigue, does not appear, and perhaps he did not know, himself. But his head
                     was always full of romantic schemes, and hundreds of extraordinary contrivances
                     had occurred to him for effecting an introduction to the new sovereign of his
                     heart. Sometimes he saw her followed in the street by some importunate
                     debauchee,â€”the most unlikely of all occurrences, especially in the sober
                     streets of Chelsea,â€”when he, her own true knight, would sally out from his
                     fortress, and delivering the insulted princess from the obscene ogre, conduct
                     her in honor to her own castle. Then he saw himself taken suddenly sick before
                     her door, and admitted out of pure benevolence, and attended to by the gentle
                     damsel,â€”forgetting that, as he had not the impudence of those rascal gentlemen,
                     Aimwell and Archer, so neither was he
                     sure to find a Lady Bountiful in his Dorinda's mamma. Then again, the very
                     humane vision of a house on fire comes before his musing brain. He sees the
                     flames enveloping all the roof, and gushing out in torrents from all the
                     windows. The fire-escapes are somehow not at hand, and no one is bold enough to
                     ascend the ladders, which have ignited several times; yet in the house is the
                     lady he loves, the sole being not yet rescued. He sees her, and she stretches
                     out her arms for aid. Frantic with delight as well as horror and alarm, he
                     rushes up the ladder, envelopes her in a blanket, and lifting her little body
                     in his arms, bears down the precious load, at the expense of all his hair and
                     half of his cuticle.â€”When a boy he had read over many times the
                        Gonsalve of Florian, and, in the precocious development or
                     prelibation of his amorous propensities, he had taken special delight in the
                     scene on shipboard, which he would ponder, while musing in some solitary corner
                     as his wont, till he had identified himself with the Great
                     Captain, and stood, in imagination, with his back against the mast, and Zorayda
                     on his left arm, slashing away among the surrounding Moors, as if they were so
                     many wine-skins. The effect of this and other like reading was to feed the fire
                     of a naturally romantic spirit, and make of a man who had an unusual share of
                     good sense a very paladin of the closet: so that, while Ernestin's writings
                     among those of the nineteenth century were not a little conspicuous for the
                     practical view they took of life, and made open scoff of the visionary nonsense
                     of his compeers, his conduct, wherever his heart could direct it, was in all
                     cases in commerce with men as with women, as simple and apparently as wayward
                     as a child's.6
                  
                  Full of expectation, his pulse beating as if he were about to storm a battery,
                     or to do, for the first time, something else equally formidable, our hero waits
                     until his lady with her sisters has passed the house, then makes sail after
                     her.
                  Now it so happened, the hour being rather late, that there was not a single
                     person between himself and the party, though about a hundred yards off, as they
                     reach the head of the street that led to the place of worship; and, as the lady
                     with her younger sister turns the corner, she looks back, sees him, and
                     immediately says something to the eldest who is alone behind the two, looking
                     at the same time significantly towards Ernestin, and the eldest turns her head
                     in the same direction. All the pulses in Ernestin's heart seemed for a moment
                     to stop. Here was another act of indelicacy,â€”one moreover deliberate and
                     inexcusable. Dissatisfaction takes the place of pleasure, and expectation in
                     his heart yields her seat to indifference, if not disdain. But he has made up
                     his mind to a certain course, and, as usual, nothing stops him. He takes
                     however another road, which will presently cross her own path, and does so,
                     partly that he may not appear to follow her, partly to meet her face to face.
                     And he so well calculates his time, that he comes up with her quite closely.
                     She sees him again, looks quite composed, if not indifferent; and the party,
                     which is now without the eldest sister, walks on. But he has had time, as they
                     crossed his path, to mark the lady's profile. It is not what he was prepared to
                     see by his former bird's-eye views; but it delights him exceedingly. It is very
                     youthful, and full of innocence, and with more of character than he expected;
                     and there is a nobility about it, owing in a great measure to the shape of the
                     eyebrow, which rises a little at the temple, with an undulating swell of the
                     orbit in that part, as is constant in
                     such a case, and which pleases him not the less that it was a marked
                     characteristic in the features of his sister Ilda.
                  Once more her admirer, Ernestin takes his place at a proper distance behind the
                     party, but once more to be displeased, for after a little further progression,
                     the younger of the two looks back. Was it by her sister's direction? It was not
                     much matter; they both knew he was there. He is now cold again, and criticises
                     the fair one's feet, which muffled up in overshoes look clumsy.
                  But the door of the church is reached. Ernestin hangs coldly back, and sees
                     with perfect indifference the lady look at him as she ascends the steps. As he
                     enters the vestibule, he finds her at one of the side-doors alone, with her
                     hand on the knob; but though she regards him, and encouragingly, he does not
                     hasten to open it for her, though by so doing he would have had the opportunity
                     of seeing her closely face to face, perhaps of touching her gloved hand,
                     certainly of bowing to her and of hearing her thank him. It is so fine a thing
                     too to look into a handsome woman's eyes, when you are a stranger, and she is
                     thanking you for some voluntary act of courtesy or of gallant attention! He is
                     an awkward creature, this Ernestin, when he is put out. He does not even move
                     to take the door from her hand when she has opened it, but lets it slide
                     heavily behind her. And this was the man, who when abroad had startled his own
                     countrymen by his ready gallantry and ceremonious offices to the fair! manners
                     so difficult of adoption by Englishmen, though Englishwomen are as ready to
                     appreciate them as their more lively sisters of the continent. It is true,
                     Ernestin is ten years older now.
                  After some little delay, our adventurer enters the church. His lady is in one
                     of the foremost pews alone with her sister, and directly under the nose of the
                     rector, who is already in the desk, and waits but the conclusion of the
                     voluntary, to begin the service. She is seated sidelong in the angle of the
                     door, and has her eyes on Ernestin. She has never seen him before without his
                     hat, unless behind the veil of his window-blind, and is probably a little
                     curious to observe the effect. For this she has a special opportunity, as the
                     red-nosed beadle is very anxious to be permitted to show the stranger a
                     pew,â€”which for private reasons he declines.
                  Ernestin in a strange church usually went into the gallery, but he is
                     determined now to remain upon the ground-floor, and, as if he must do every
                     thing badly, instead of going modestly up the aisle, and taking a seat directly
                     behind his mistress, where there is a pew unoccupied, he walks directly up the
                     nave in full view of the assembled congregation, and plants himself in a vacant
                     seat diagonally opposite. Awkward even here, he sits by the door; and, when the
                     anthem is sung; he moves deliberately to the inner corner of the pew in order
                     to catch the sound of her voice if possible. The action brings him nearer, and
                     enables him to have a better and full view of his charmer, but not to hear her
                     voice, which is, perhaps purposely, inaudible among so many. It also makes him
                     again noticeable by the congregation, one of whom, in a pew directly opposite,
                     on the other side of the nave, a fine showy girl, has a perfect conception of
                     the object of the stranger's apparition in that place, and, forgetful of the
                     tenth commandment, more naturally than generously endeavors to divert his
                     attention to her own merchandise. This in Fitzherbert's eyes adds to the
                     ridicule of his position, and as he has a quick perception and keen relish
                        for the ludicrous, and very little
                     command of his countenance, he looks facetious, which makes the whole affair
                     appear still more indecorous and not less ridiculous. Add to this that the
                     church is cold, and Ernestin, having put off his cloak, begins to shiver, but
                     is afraid to make another movement to resume his mantle, because he has already
                     moved too much for a man of his age and figure. All this however was rather in
                     the lover's conscience than in reality; for, though certainly conspicuous both
                     in himself and from his appearance there being novel, there was nothing after
                     all in his deportment that would attract the notice of the many, and the few
                     that observed it saw nothing therein to which they were not too well accustomed
                     in others. Besides, his devotion in prayers was more reverent and his attention
                     to the sermon closer than those of nine out of any ten men that were then in
                     church.
                  Ernestin did not indeed hear the voice of his enchantress, but he saw her
                     mouth, which more than pleased him. The lips were parted, as we see them in
                     sculpture, just wide enough for him to study their shape, and, as the side of
                     her face was towards him, he saw they were marked by some of the
                     characteristics of a model statue's, the upper having that protuberance, at the
                     inner side and bottom of the middle line, which gives such beauty and so much
                     innocence of expression, even to masculine mouths, and the under fitting, in
                     its convexities and indentations, except at the angles, exactly to the upper.
                     The color was deep yet bright, the texture soft, yet firm and dry, and the
                     whole character singularly virginal; one of those pure mouths that excite in
                     pure minds correspondingly pure feelingsâ€”admiration, not desireâ€”love, not
                     sensual passion. And now he marks the nose, and observes that it is not
                     perfectly straight in the outline, but has the faintest swell on the ridge,
                     which gives it more character, and, as it is beautifully feminine, it pleases
                     him quite as well: then the eyes. They seem now dark gray, with a dash of brown
                     mixing with the varied and varying colors of the iris. They are large and full,
                     and well cut, soft and feminine, but not languid nor amorous; and he would not
                     have them so. The browsâ€”He can only see their extremities, which, as we have
                     said, arch slightly and add greatly to the nobility of her air. And finally he
                     notes the forehead, which is not perfectly smooth, as it had appeared under his
                     window, but wants fulness over the inner part of the eyebrows (the place of the
                     sinuses), which makes the face appear particularly youthful. Her chin he fails
                     to notice. Perhaps the mouth prevented him, or the corners of her hat and the
                     bow of the ribbons and her length of ringlet were in the way; but it must be
                     good, as the contour of the face is regularly oval.
                  And now the Gloria is ended, and the rector, opening the great
                     book, commences the first Lesson. This gives Ernestin again an opportunity to
                     observe her, as she sits with a composure all her own, yet not without a care
                     that his view shall not be obstructed, which seemed to mark also a gentle wish
                     to encourage him. Her rich hair follows the slope of her shoulders, and
                     glistens on the collar and cape of her cloak. It looks, in the light of the
                     church, deep auburn, and is very full and soft. Ernestin is perfectly enamored.
                     And her sister's manner too is so quiet and lady-like, though she is very
                     young. How soon has he forgot his dissatisfaction!
                  The sermon is done, the benediction said. Why does not the lover hurry out with
                     the first and contrive to meet his lady at the end of the aisle, that their
                     eyes may encounter safely? He seems to be under a spell, the spell of an ill-natured fairy; for he does nothing
                     well. He dallies in the pew, making busy with gathering his cloak about him;
                     and so does the lady at the door of hers, waiting ostensibly for her sister.
                     She dares not look at him, which is becoming, and pleases Ernestin, but,
                     standing with her face towards him, conscious that he is gazingâ€”for her cheeks
                     are flushed, seems to intimate by this delay that he should go out first. But
                     there is no longer an excuse for staying, and she is obliged to precede him. If
                     she do not think him a fool, it is not his fault.
                  On the way home, she is joined by a fine, and rather distinguished-looking man.
                     But Ernestin is not jealous; for he sees she is inattentive and uneasy. He is
                     not then surprised, when presently she turns her head to look behind her, while
                     he is pleased, when he sees that she is afraid to do so, and gives but a timid
                     sidelong glance which fails to reach him. It was an action full of nature and
                     simplicity and youthfulness, with more of heart in it than any she had yet
                     displayed. It was such a movement as might be made by a very young maiden yet
                     unsophisticated by the world, and unfamiliar even with her own desires; and it
                     washed from his mind in a moment all traces that yet remained of her supposed
                     unfeminine independence and want of delicacy.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  A DRAWBACK.
                  ERNESTIN'S contentment was not to be without some drawback. A few days after,
                     as he was standing, not at the blinded window of the little room, but at one of
                     the open windows of the drawing-room, partly hidden by the curtains, he saw a
                     handsome but pert-looking young girl, whose face was familiar to him, stop, in
                     company with another young girl equally handsome, but whose face he had never
                     seen before, at the corner of a street nearly opposite, and, pointing directly
                     to him, say something to her companion, who in her turn looked, but with less
                     effrontery, when the other appeared to continue her communication, giving it in
                     his eyes significance and application to himself by occasionally raising her
                     head and inclining it towards the window. The conference continued for a few
                     minutes, when they both crossed the street, passing under his window, but
                     without looking up, and disappeared in one of the neighboring houses. The
                     interpretation which Ernestin put upon this little scene was at a somewhat
                     later period verified, or nearly so, by three circumstances,â€” by his discovery
                     that this young girl was a neighbor of the Elphinstones, by his seeing her
                     escorted from church one morning by the little brother of those ladies, and by
                     his observing their aunt on another Sunday in company, but with an evident air
                     of reserve and reluctance as if it were not of her own will, with a coarse, vulgar-looking woman of middle age, whom
                     he saw very frequently with the fair impertinent, and who was probably her
                     relative.
                  It was likely, that the family to which these inconsiderable persons belonged
                     had in some manner scraped an acquaintance with the Elphinstones. Had then his
                     lady or her sisters, none of whom however he had ever seen in company even for
                     a moment with the ill-bred beauty, been so indiscreet, to use the mildest term,
                     as to make him in connection with themselves a theme of conversation with
                     persons out of their family? Or had this girl, whose action was nothing
                     extraordinary in a vulgar-minded woman, than which there is nothing more
                     impertinent, more treacherous, more envious and malignant, in two words more
                     impudent and mean, in nature,â€”for man is not, or dares not show himself, so
                     contemptibly little,â€”had she been a witness of his extraordinary visit to the
                     church, and with the penetration of envy divined its object?
                  He had in his time, like other men who have frequent love affairs, suffered
                     much annoyance from the effrontery and treachery of many who are recognized as
                     ladies, and who sacrifice the character of a man without scruple on the altar
                     of their egotism, to appease the angry spirit of disappointed vanity, or to
                     gratify the insatiate demon of envy, or to gain a reputation for chastityâ€”in
                     the same way as hypocrites do for holiness, or simply in that love of
                     detraction which is the bodily salvation of little characters, who, without its
                     meat to chew upon, would eat their own bowels in vexation and self-disgust;
                     Ernestin, I say, had suffered not a little from this baseness, which flourishes
                     because the world, which scouts it in a man, makes it, like cowardice and
                     lying, of no consequence in a woman; and when he met it in those whited
                     sepulchres, which too thickly mark the highway of life, beautiful women of
                     every class with souls that are corruption, it made him much more sorrowful
                     than angry; for it was his own fault, that, attracted by the seeming goodliness
                     of these deceitful monuments, he had gone out of his way to visit them, his own
                     fault, that, when a near approach had shown their true structure, he had not
                     been satisfied until he had penetrated their interior, only to fly from it with
                     horror and disgust. His moral and religious sense taught Ernestin to look upon
                     afflictions or vexations of this nature, as the unavoidable consequences of a
                     departure from right reason or severe principle; it was the penalty of sin, or
                     the mulet of folly; he kissed the rod because it was laid on him by the
                     sentence of Divine Justice, but the hand which wielded it he detested or
                     despised. Now however that reason had but little, and that little mere surmise
                     or doubt, to oppose to his passion, and that, when summoned before the bar of
                     conscience, he could plead, with an assured and lofty tone, Not
                     Guilty, to every count in the indictment of moral principle,â€”now, when, instead
                     of fearing, as in impurer days, to kneel in the Invisible Presence to make his
                     daily offerings of confession and supplication, instead of silencing the
                     sleepless monitor of his own breast by that sophistry which finds in the
                     passions of nature a necessity for their indulgenceâ€”as if they were, like the
                     craving of the stomach, a foremost impulse of self-preservation, to be
                     satisfied at whatever cost! he could invoke the Divine blessing on his purpose
                     and feel the god within him satisfied with his desires,â€”now,
                     now,â€”that he should be made to undergo this humiliation,â€”and at
                     her hands, for whom he was prepared to sacrifice the dear ambition of all his
                     life, the ambition to which he had hitherto sacrificed all things save his
                     honor, his affections, and his pride!â€”But he will not credit it: she has been indiscreet perhaps,
                     but not treacherous; vain, but not meanly selfish.
                  It is now the middle of the holidays, and the streets are filled with happy
                     children, whose penny-whistles and tin trumpets make the air vocal with a not
                     unpleasing discord, while the sentiment it awakens may be read in the relaxed
                     visages of the careworn parents and guardians, who, as they pass each other,
                     exchange, despite of distance, unsociality, or pride, involuntary smiles at the
                     exuberant gayety of the little ones they can scarcely keep beside them.
                     Ernestin, whose sunshine, like those little ones', is of the breast, is never tired looking on them, smiling as they
                     smile, and listening to all their harmless dissonances with as much zest as if
                     they were the warbling of a Malibran. I really believe he longs to be with
                     them, capering in their own droll fashion, trying all their tiny instruments,
                     and examining with real interest their gaudy toys. Indeed he has spent a happy
                     week in selecting and collecting a number of curious animals, covered with
                     spotted cloth like hair and provided classically with a croupezia or musical bellows in their pedestals,â€”dogs, monkeys,
                     cats and horses, parrots and cock-chickens; and, ranging them all in line upon
                     the mantlepiece, he has actually found amusement and a source of cheerful
                     laughter in practising on the various scabilla, that serve for voices to his infant menagerie, a little
                     every day, until the beasts were distributed to his nephews and nieces to be
                     dismembered after the promptest mode in use in the nursery. He is now at one of
                     the drawing-room windows. It is nearly twilight. What makes him serious all at
                     once? It is not a child swallowing its whistle instead of blowing it, but the
                     youngest Miss Elphinstone executing a movement, to him, quite as frightful. She
                     is on the opposite side of the road, and as she gets before his house she looks
                     back, up the street, and to somebody that is on his side, and then turns her
                     eyes a moment to his window, where he is probably, from the obscurity of the
                     hour and the shade of the curtains and his black clothes, not visible. Ernestin
                     never needs more than a look or the half of a look to divine what is passing in
                     a person's breast, or to surmise his meditated action. Rapidly lifting the
                     sash, and drawing to the blinds, at once to satisfy himself and to defeat the
                     purpose he has read, he sees a servant-maid with a bandbox, who, just as he
                     closes the laths of the blinds, lifts up her head with a scrutinizing and saucy
                     air of intrigue, that tells him just what he had supposed. The young lady had
                     engaged her attendant to see if Ernestin was on his usual look-out, and had
                     given the preconcerted sign, to indicate the house and story she was to
                     examine.
                  A sense of shame, mixed with deep indignation, flushes all over Ernestin's
                     visage, which a minute ago was so peaceful and so happy. Throwing himself into
                     a seat before the fire, he gazes on the noisy and fitful flame, but sees not
                     the light, feels not the heat, hears not the sound, except that he is not
                     disturbed by darkness and by cold or by the sense of sudden stillness. Has he
                     brought himself to this, at his age,â€”so deserving of respect, as he feels
                     himself to be, from every one,â€”to be made the amusement, the ridicule perhaps,
                     of trifling girls, and to have his heart's secret, which none but his Maker and
                     his mother had ever heard on his lips, surrendered to the loose
                     keeping of a serving-wench? He calls to mind his own young sister now no more,
                     who would have thought a life's repentance could not atone for the disgrace of
                     such an act; and, in his just displeasure, he is almost resolved to give up, at
                     once and forever, all idea of a connection with persons sons who could so far forget the decent reserve
                     of gentle life. But alas! with the morrow come thoughts less hasty but far more
                     unwise; and with the morrow comes too the beauty of his mistress, which he has
                     not seen for many days; and, as he looks upon the really noble contour of her
                     face, he forgets the record of his manifold experience both in masculine and
                     feminine countenances, and repeats to himself: "She has had no hand in this.
                     She has made the one error, in a natural vanity, of speaking of me to her
                     sisters; and she cannot control their conduct. Perhaps it would pain her as
                     much as it does me." Has he forgot the Sunday scene so soon? Alas! alas!
               
               
                  CHAPTER XII.
                  THE DAY-DREAMER.
                  ALL this time, Ernestin has not failed to revolve in mind a good deal the
                     necessity of coming promptly to some decisive action. But he has a hard
                     struggle to make with his sense of propriety, and the world has not taught the
                     hermit the unanswerable argument of self. Does the world ever teach a man any
                     thing which nature has not previously prepared him for learning? I doubt it.
                     No; I have no doubts at all; I am positive it never does.7
                  
                  Scruples of pride or of conscience lose strength in proportion as the passion
                     they oppose gains intensity. Ernestin has almost ceased to hesitate to renew
                     his intercourse with the Evelyns. And while the balance in his mind is still in
                     motion, he meets, ere yet the holidays are over, the head of that family, who
                     kindly presses him to be more social. The scale of his desire drops plumb with
                     this new weight, and, pride and conscience springing violently upward, the beam
                     hangs almost vertical. So the very next evening sees Ernestin in town at the
                     ever-hospitable house.
                  The Evelyns are glad to see him; and he reciprocates the feeling; for they are
                     especial favorites of his, and theirs is one of the last families he had ceased
                     to visit, compelled by his necessities as we have intimated, not prompted by
                     his distastes or by any preference of seclusion sion. In the course of conversation, Chelsea is introduced; and Ernestin is asked if his mother still
                     continues to like her residence there. This is Ernestin's opportunity. So,
                     after replying to the friendly question, he observes:
                  "By the by, you visit a good deal at Chelsea, Miss Margaret. Do you know a
                     family of Elphinstones that is now there?"
                  "Yes," said Miss Margaret; and, with a smile,â€”"The ladies are considered very
                     handsome."
                  "One of them is, certainly. I am not familiar with the faces of the others. But
                     what has most struck me is their air of distinction, which of course is very
                     noticeable in our suburban streets. Are they of the better family of their
                     name?"
                  "I presume they are," said Mr. Evelyn, to whom Ernestin had turned. "They come
                     from the same county."
                  Ernestin had the prudence to change the subject.
                  As he rose to go, the gentle Margaret, with her eyes on his, said something
                     briefly half-aside to her mother, who thereupon said aloud:
                  "Margaret expects a few friends on Thursday evening. It will give us all much
                     pleasure, Mr. Fitzherbert, if you will join them."
                  "As an inducement," added Margaret, "you will meet then the
                     Miss-Elphinstones."
                  "There needs no inducement but your own kindness and Mrs. Evelyn's, which is
                     far more than I deserve, Miss Margaret. I will come with the greatest
                     pleasure.â€”On Thursday evening. Early, I suppose?"
                  "Quite."
                  So far, Ernestin had done very well; and if you consider what a shower of
                     happiness, as it seemed, had fallen so suddenly upon him, upon him so nervous,
                     and even in his best time incapable of concealing his impressions, you will
                     think he did wonderfully well. But it was simply because he was sincere. He was
                     so susceptible to the least touch of kindness, and this civility of the Evelyns
                     was so truly amiable (for he knew that a man obscure like himself, whom no one
                     of the company was likely to know or care to know, Margaret could not consider
                     a very desirable accession), that his heart had but little room for any higher
                     satisfaction. When his adieus were said and he had gained the street, it was
                     another thing. Like Alfieri, whom morally and intellectually he resembled a
                     good deal, more so perhaps than did any other man that ever lived, he would
                     have tried to break his neck had he been on horseback,â€”as he will be found
                     presently to say himself. As it was, not able under the high pressure of his
                     animal spirits to control his steps to a walk, he set off on a run, bounding
                     and leaping in the lonely street like a great schoolboy; and had there been a
                     hedge or two in the way, he would probably despite the darkness of the night
                     have essayed to leap them, as an additional means of expending the nervous
                     energy with which his joyous excitement had overcharged his system.
                  Backwards and forwards in the front drawing-room, when he had reached his home,
                     he strode with rapid strides, incapable even yet of composing himself, his eye
                     dilated and enkindled, his cheek flushed, his whole face and form indeed
                     radiant and expanded with animation. At last after sundry endeavors to sit
                     down, which in their brevity and the abruptness of their cessation made him
                     appear very much like a man who had put himself on a hot iron by mistake, he
                     opens the folding-doors, and beckons-in his mother from the back room.
                  Drawing her reluctant arm through his, he led or rather drew her to the fireplace. "Wish me joy,"
                     he said.
                  "Of what?" said his mother absently. Then, with more spirit, "Don't keep me
                     long. Henry will think so strange of it!"â€”meaning one of his brothers to whom
                     she was particularly attached, and whom, as is always the case with women where
                     they love, she stood in constant fear of displeasing.
                  In his ordinary mood, Ernestin would instantly have ceased, and perhaps have
                     led her himself back to the society she preferred; but he is too much excited
                     to mind the unkindness now. What he wants is vent, vent; and the whole room,
                     every body and every thing seem too few objects on which and through which to
                     exhale himself.
                  "In three days I shall see her!"
                  His mother is silent, and turns her head back to the door which she had
                     purposely left ajar. Ernestin, cautious of the sole secret of his heart,
                     thought at the time the act imprudent, but is too eager now to correct it,
                     though he dreads its danger all the while.
                  "What a happiness, that I did not demean myself to revisit the Savilles! Heaven
                     has rewarded me for my self-denial. The Evelyns receive a few friends on
                     Thursday night, and the Elphinstones are of them."
                  In spite of herself, Mrs. Fitzherbert, who had great natural amiability,
                     becomes infected with Ernestin's delight, though of course not anywise in his
                     degree.
                  "And what will you do till then, innamorato?" she asked him, with a smile.
                  "Neither eat, drink, nor sleep, I am afraid. Sleep I certainly shall not."
                  "And so, when you come to meet her, with your always excitable temper?"â€”
                  "I shall be so ready to explode, that I shall make love to her, I am afraid,
                     before all the room."
                  "And thereby save the Evelyns some trouble of entertainment. But take care,
                     Ernestin! your hot blood is preparing for you a deal of disappointment, as
                     usual.â€”I must go now; Henry will be impatient." And his mother left him, for a
                     company with which she better sympathized.
                  Sleep Ernestin did not, all that night. The highly excited state of his nerves
                     gave a supernatural distinctness to his mental vision, and on the ever-changing
                     canvas of fancy he began to paint the future with the instantaneousness and
                     clearness of a camera.
                  First, he goes through all the expected scene at the Evelyns'. This shifts to
                     give place to the chancel of a church, where a ceremony takes place in which he
                     figures conspicuously, without being at all embarrassed by the fact that he
                     does not yet know the name of his partner. Behold, a twelvemonth nearly gone;
                     and he sits by the bedside of his wife, her hand in his, his heart swelling
                     with sensations of the most exquisite satisfaction; for see! where her mother
                     is holding in her experienced arms an infant which she calls a miniature of
                     himself, though it is very red and has its features all in a heap, and whose
                     extraordinary weight she requires his own mother to attest, as the latter
                     carefully assumes in turn the delightful burden. 'Tis past. And now he is
                     standing up, resting on one hip, his feet crossed, one hand upon the back of a
                     rocking-chair, where sits his wife with their infant at her fair breast, its
                     little hand creeping over the smooth globe, and all her chest as far as it can
                     reach, with a satisfaction which is in perfect harmony with the animal relish
                     with which, its eyes closed, it draws in, and sighs, the first nourishment of nature. The father, his head bent
                     pensively over to the raised shoulder of the arm that presses the chair, looks
                     down upon the group, and wonders how Raphael could be so deficient. Presently
                     the mother lifts her very beautiful eyes to his with an expression that thrills
                     him with ecstasy, and putting the tiny hand of the infant to her sweet lips,
                     she holds it in turn for him to kiss, which he does; and when, taking the
                     little hand, all its soft fingers fold tightly about his fore-finger, a large
                     tear trickles down his cheek; and, for the first time in his life, he has a
                     great admiration of babies.â€”Then the wakeful visionary draws his handkerchief
                     from under the pillow, and wipes from his eyes the sole reality of the
                     scene,â€”which at once gives place to something less charming.
                  He sees himself an old man, or at least no longer young. But his wife retains a
                     great part of her bloom, and all her beauty. They are in a large company of
                     both sexes. Ernestin, standing at one end of the room, observes his wife at the
                     other using her magnificent eyes to dazzle a man still younger than herself. He
                     turns to a mirror;â€”his grizzled hair gives back the light in unmistakable
                     clearness, and his forehead is nearly one half of his head. He goes
                     nearer;â€”that forehead is wrinkled; there are wrinkles too in the corners of the
                     eyes; and the angles of the mouth are defined by ridges that no kind of light
                     can lessen. He walks over to the flirting couple. As he approaches, his wife,
                     without embarrassment, turns smiling to him, and says: "I am trying, my dear,
                     to convince this gentleman that you are my husband; but he will not believe
                     it."â€”"I do not wonder," says Ernestin. "He will see, however, that we have one
                     home." So saying, he puts her arm through his, and, bowing with distant
                     ceremony to the gallant, leads her from the room.â€”They are driven home in
                     silence. When there, "Madam," says Ernestin,â€”"since I loved you, I call Heaven
                     to witness for me, I have never suffered my heart to entertain a feeling for
                     any other woman. I have kept my eyes as sacred to your beauty as if there were
                     none other in the world. When they strayed a moment, from habit or from
                     forgetfulness, I have reproached myself as for a crime. Has that beauty in
                     return been kept sacred unto me?"â€”"This is very extraordinary language, Mr.
                     Fitzherbert," says the lady.â€”"A little poetical," says Ernestin. "In common
                     English, it is this. I have seen this night what I must never see again. I have
                     wed your soul, madam, not your body only. Nor must the wife of Ernestin
                     Fitzherbert allow another man even to suppose that Ernestin is not husband unto
                     both."â€”"Really," says the lady in a gentle, but supercilious tone, "you must be
                     out of your senses."â€”"Madam," says the husband, (and Ernestin now rises
                     half-erect in his bed, as if the scene were real,)â€”"It is then for the last
                     time. Before I wooed you, I warned you of my age, I told you of the exacting
                     nature of my affections, I concealed not a vice of nature or of habit from you,
                     no more than the gray hairs which I bade you notice ere I said one tender thing
                     to gain your love,â€”so fearful was I of deceiving you, so utterly do I abhor a
                     lie. Is it true or not?" She is silent. "Answer me, madam, Iâ€”entreat you."
                     "Yes," says the same mild voice,â€”but carelessly. It seemed indeed, as if the
                     speaker were sleepy and would yawn. "Yes," echoes, but sternly, Ernestin, in
                     the chest-tones which he rarely used in speaking: "But you concealed your
                     pettiest foiblesâ€”or thought you did; and when I saw them, I dropped the veil of
                     my own charity, or of my passion, over them. That I was better than my picture, I will not ask you to
                     affirm; but I was, by all the difference that there is between my immortal soul
                     and my decaying body. If you were equal to yours, I need not say; for 'twas I
                     that drew it, from my fancy,â€”and what shall equal the models of the
                     imagination? that imagination in whose temple I had set you up, to worship to
                     the exclusion of all other things earthly. You are impatient, madam. This is
                     not the way to meet my anger, my just anger; nor do your resentful glances
                     become you half so well, though I had rather see them than those you were so
                     liberal of an hour ago. Stay! I command you." He puts his hand
                     upon her arm,â€”then, recollecting himself, as she sits down again, speaks more
                     slowly, and less passionately. "I am sorry that your contemptuous or careless
                     manner has made me speak more violently than I ought. Let that pass; and our
                     accounts this night shall balance, for they are both perhaps of errors that are
                     sins of habit; but for the future, I must have honor, if not love,â€”honor and
                     obedience,â€”which perhaps are all of your vow that it is now in your power to
                     keep. I shall pray God to give you strength to subdue the vanity which I have
                     myself perhaps too much fostered. If you forget your obligations again, I will
                     cancel them. Nothing shall compel me to live with a woman whom I cannot
                     trust."â€”With Ernestin, to speak is to mean, and to mean is to do. His wife, of
                     course, sets at naught his threats; and the next scenes are terrible,â€”painted
                     each with more vividness, as the nerves of the sleepless poet get more and more
                     excited, till the misery of a double household and divided children end them,
                     as they have ended others in actual life. This time there was no tear on the
                     visionist's cheek, but the pulses of his temples beat like a clock against the
                     pillow, and a fire seemed to be consuming the marrow of his arms, and burning
                     up the vitals of his breast, across which he felt a constriction as if of a
                     cord drawn on the inner side.
                  And so on through the night, and till late in the morning, worked the brain of
                     the student, when, utterly exhausted, he fell into a feverish sleep, starting
                     up once or twice with a gasp as if suffocating. And still two other nights he
                     has to pass, and three whole days. What shall he do? He is so anxious, too, to
                     appear to advantage! He tries to sleep during the day; but, as is common, the
                     more he needs repose, the more difficult it is to obtain it. He has forgotten
                     already the frightful picture of anticipated jealousy; and when he sees its
                     principal figure pass, and all alone, it is with difficulty he refrains from
                     following her and addressing her at once, on the strength of the formal
                     introduction he is now so sure of having. But the advantages of waiting are so
                     immense, the importance of forming a more deliberate judgment so vital, that he
                     acts, for once, discreetly.
                  And now another night comes on; and in his anxiety to sleep he banishes the
                     power effectually. As before, it is only when completely exhausted, that his
                     brain ceases to be controlled by the outward senses, and his eyelids close to
                     the faint light which already struggles through the crevices of his
                     window-shutters.â€”One more night, and two more days! Hours are wasted on the
                     parlor sofa; but the closed curtains, and the studiously still house, give him
                     no repose, because he is without composure. So he takes occasion of his
                     mother's being for awhile alone, to renew with her a talk upon a theme she does
                     not relish.
                  "What if I should find her name to be Lucy!â€”or Susan!!â€”or Ann Jane!!" he adds,
                     with a terrible nasal prolongation of the sound.
                  
                  "There is little cause for fearing that," said his mother, smiling at the mock
                     distortion of his visage. "Her family are rather remarkable for their handsome
                     names."
                  "Yes! And it may be Cora! or Gertrude!! or Adelle!!!"â€”
                  Or Imogen," interposed his mother, with a purpose.
                  "Ah, that would make me too happy!â€”Imogen!" he repeats with a very soft accent,
                     "Imogen Elphinstone!â€”But that would be expecting too much. And so very rare a
                     name!"
                  "What say you then to Augusta? or Theresa?"
                  "Theresa! One of the sweetest names in any vocabulary, and sweeter in English
                     than in any other tongue. Poor Lord Byron's mistress was named Theresa; and she has long bright ringlets too! and so had Alfieri's!"
                  "Long bright ringlets may very well recommend a mistress, Ernestin; but I
                     should think a man of sense would look for something more in a wife."
                  "And that reminds me that I am talking nonsense, which you never particularly
                     like in meâ€”especially on this theme. I beg your pardon, Ma', and will try again
                     to sleep."
                  Ernestin winds the ringlets round and round his heart, and stretches his
                     handsome limbs upon the sofa. But the cushions seemed made of thorns, or to be
                     stuffed with fire, or the fillet of fine hair, however imaginary, repressed his
                     circulation. So he looks at his legs with an artist's satisfaction, which the
                     recollection of the use he was to make of them, in striding into
                     Imogen-Theresa's affections, redeemed perhaps from vanity, and sitting up puts
                     them in a posture to show the knees to advantage, then glancing at his ankles,
                     of which he had still more reason to be proud, laughs at himself, and going to
                     the mirror exclaims, half-aloud, "But what the deuse does she know
                     about knees! and I shall wear boots. And with this haggard face! O by Jove!
                     this will never do!"
                  With such frivolities, and others of a kindred nature, the weary day drew to a
                     close, yet not without one sober effort at the suspended tragedy; fortunately,
                     vain; for the consequences of such labor in his present state might have been
                     serious. And when the night came on, did the lover sleep? No; for he was,
                     unhappily for him then, poet as well as lover, or poet more than lover, and
                     being a castle-builder of consummate experience, he was constructing and
                     demolishing through all the night,â€”which in any event would have been a
                     sleepless one, because of the habit of unrest created by the two preceding.
                     With the habit however of the morning slumber, he fell at the same hour as
                     before into a brief but heavy sleep, waking to wonder how he should be able to
                     get through the long day and the eventful night, when he feels already scarcely
                     able to keep his feet. But that eventful night! it reminds him at once of his
                     duties and his necessities; his religious duty, his moral necessities.
                  Making his ablutions, he puts down the upper sash of one of his windows, and,
                     before completing his toilet, breathes his orisons in the cool air of the
                     morning. And this, among other things, he might have been heard to say:
                  
                     
                        ....."And ope these eyes, thou Ever-flowing Source
                        Of human wisdom, lest I darkling fall
                        Into the abyss of passion, dragging with me
                        Her whose weak feet I would not lead astray!
                        O, if in either heart there haply lack
                        
                        What to be wanting threatens ill to both,
                        Teach me to scan it, and Thy outstretch'd wings
                        Waft me beyond the verge of my own wishes
                        Ere I grow dizzy! But if in the breast
                        Of this young creature dwell that hidden sweet
                        Which is to beauty what the rose's scent
                        Is to her fading leaves, infuse therein
                        The spirit of love reciprocal, Thou Who art
                        Love's Proper Spring, and Who hast made Thy world
                        In all its animate parts to feel its need!
                        Yet not my will, Almighty! Thine be done!
                        For Thou alone of evil bringest good,
                        And the heart's famine mak'st to feed the heart
                        With food ambrosial. Weak albeit I am,
                        Yet even me Thou hast given heart-strength to pray,
                        Still as before, that if the yearn'd-for bliss
                        Must shut out higher aims, and the mind's growth
                        Make less prolific, whose unperishing fruit
                        All men should gather, planting its quick seed
                        For wider culture, let me miss the joy,
                        Living still spouseless, wedded unto fame,
                        My home the future, and my friends the dead!"
                     
                  
                  An elastic spirit and well organized body, while yet unimpaired by age, soon
                     shake off the feverous lassitude of broken slumbers or long unrest, and the
                     stomach, the soul of the system, when appealed to lends instantly her puissant
                     aid. After his temperate breakfast of tea and dry bread, Ernestin is again
                     alive; but his face as well as his person shows very plainly the drain a three
                     nights' watchfulness and the incessant action of his brain have made upon his
                     physical resources. His eyes, which are well-shaped, appear, by the depression
                     of the orbits and the sinking of the cheeks, to be nearly as large as the pair
                     that have charmed him. "No great advantage in that," says the poet as he
                     consults his looking-glass, "since the thinning of these jaws has added a whole
                     decade to my years, confound them!"
                  "And how do you feel, this morning, Ernestin?" asked his mother, who now does
                     him the unusual honor of a voluntary visit.
                  "Feel?" said Ernestin, gayly, elevating his eyebrows with a droll expression;
                     for he was one of those persons who find something to laugh at even in their
                     own distresses,â€”"Now fancy, Ma', that all the atoms of which that handsome
                     frame of yours is made up were put together, for the time being, so loosely as
                     to justle or to rub with a rotatory motion against one another,â€”but of course
                     without losing their placesâ€”or you would fall to pieces. If you can fancy that,
                     and then will suppose that I feel this atomic commotion in every part of me, a
                     sort of creeping, tingling, exquisitely small and infinitely multiplied
                     sensation, such as might be given by the legs of myriads of insects threading
                     the tissues of my body,â€”as if, in short, I were made up of young spidersâ€”there
                     you have it! you will form a nice little atomic theory that will give you an
                     atom of an idea, my dear mamma, of what I enjoy at this present."
                  "Enjoy?â€”But you seem to be in a very good humor about it," said his mother, who
                     knew as much about atomic theories as she did of cellular tissues.
                  "I have need to be. If I were to suffer myself to think for one moment, my
                     brain would be after the one image that has engaged it for these sixty hours,
                     and that would set my heart to beating in a way that I do assure
                     you, seriously, is frightful. I am glad to do any thing to escape it."
                  "Had you not better then look over your wardrobe? You know it is not so
                     extensive, that you can pick and reject."
                  
                  "That's true; and there is my dress-coat not yet come from that rascal
                     tailor's! You see, Ma', it is a bad thing sometimes to have money. Had I taken
                     it in hand myself, I should have been sure to have had it in time and done as
                     it should be. Do send Bridget after it at once. I cannot wear my new frock. And
                     go I will, if I have to borrow your petticoat."
                  "Which would certainly be less conspicuous than your frock! Ahâ€”as poor dear
                     Ilda used to sayâ€”I believe, Ernestin, you would laugh if you were dying. You
                     will make a queer husband."
                  "A merry one, if that be queer.â€”And I suppose it is," added poor Ernestin, as
                     he saw his mother retire, too impatient in his presence (from habit) to stay
                     with him five minutes. "I suppose it is, to those who cannot, like Ilda, love
                     my humor whether I be grave or gay." The door closed. "Blessed Ilda!" said
                     Ernestin, in a low, soft, melancholy tone, "Look down from Heaven, and inspire
                     me with thy lovely resignation! for I need it all."
                  Did experience in man's nature teach us any thing but theory, or make us wiser
                     in act as well as thought, Ernestin would have been less pleasant, and thus
                     have forced his mother to a truer appreciation of his social qualities. For he
                     had not failed to observe, that when he was less lavish of his affection and
                     his gayety, she seemed to miss them, and would become uneasy, sometimes
                     reproachful, until the return of the vanished light restored to her self-love
                     its contentment, and to her manner its indifference. It is indeed one of those
                     consequences of our moral nature, which are not the more agreeable that they
                     are inevitable, that we grow ungrateful, both men and women, to any excessive
                     affection, but, the moment it diminishes, become sensible of the deprivation.
                     So, passing vapors make the warmth and beauty and gladdening spirit of the
                     sunshine more appreciable, which, diffused around us for entire days without a
                     cloud, is as little thought of as the air it permeates.
                  Pondering some such thoughts, the student goes to his closet, and from between
                     the piles of superabundant linen, losing its whiteness for want of use, takes
                     up his solitary pair of dress-gloves, and finds they want the rubber and a
                     stitch. This reminds him of his mother's occasions, and, visiting in turn her
                     wardrobe, he selects her best gloves, which, advanced though she is in years,
                     give evidence of the symmetry of her hands, for which, like her ears, she had
                     in youth been celebrated.
                  Examining them with a pleasure, wherein the judgment of the artist has its
                     share as well as the affection of the son, he conceives the idea of an
                     agreeable surprise to their owner, by restoring them in appearance to their
                     original newness. It is an act of considerateness that carries with it its own
                     reward; for his mind thereby is diverted and his nerves are relieved. But as,
                     after two hours' labor, he envelopes the mended, smoothed, and reburnished kid,
                     he shrugs his shoulders and pouting his under lip, while his eyes assume a
                     mischievous expression, murmurs, "Ah, si ma dame me voyait!" What
                     if my lady saw me!-What if his lady saw him, indeed! She would have thought his
                     occupation more useful than dignified, and, were she classically read, would
                     perhaps have been reminded of Hercules and the distaff, as she thought of the
                     chisel and mallet giving place to a needle about as long as his thumb-nail and
                     not thicker than a hair. It may be Ernestin is struck with somewhat such a
                     contrast himself, for as, his work completed, he gazes at the common mon laundry-iron with which he had
                     drawn and pressed flat the fingers of his mother's gloves and of his own, he
                     suddenly repeats in a sonorous tone some lofty lines of his unfinished
                     play.
                  "A pretty fellow I am!" he exclaimed at the end. I ought now to call for the
                     meal-tub, etcetera, and set to work to make a twelfthday-cake. I say, mamma,
                     shall I do it?" he cries through the folding-doors.
                  "What is that?" said his mother.
                  "Make you a cake for Twelfth-day. It is scarcely over."
                  "You are crazy," said his mother. "I don't think my petticoat after all would
                     be so inappropriate. Were it but a masquerade you were going to!â€”But what is
                     that?" Seeing she was alone, he had tossed her the gloves.
                  "A Christmas-box."
                  "Where did you get these?"
                  "Not in Bond street, nor in the Strand."
                  His mother is astonished, and greatly pleased, not at the work, but at the
                     proof of his affection it afforded. You may read her satisfaction in her
                     girlish tone. "Oh Ernestin! This is positively too bad. I do declare I shall
                     have to lock up my things from you, busy-body!â€”I should really" (examining the
                     gloves narrowly) "have thought they were new."
                  "Really?" Ernestin is delighted to see his mother delighted, not at her
                     compliments. "Please then to recommend me, when I send somebody to you to
                     enquire my character as a partner."
                  "A sleeping one you had better be, if you look to such employment."
                  "A sleeping one I mean to be, most certainly; for I am quite tired of sleeping
                     alone."
                  "Yet you do not seem to get up head-foremost, for all."
                  "No, because for these three nights I have lain awake alone, and the very devil
                     has got dominion of my nerves and made them quicksilver." Ernestin puts his
                     hand to his head. Ah! his head and his heart are so often at variance!
                  "'Tis a merry imp then," said his mother smilingly, not heeding the action.
                  "Surely. He is shaped like a fat baby, and wears wings,â€”but is a devil
                     incarnate for all that." And Ernestin sings (scherzando
                        amoroso): 
                        
                           "'N'avoir jamais qu'une pensÃ©e
                           Et n'eprouver qu'un sentiment,
                           Avoir toujours l'Ã¢me oppressÃ©e
                           Par un chagrin plein d'agrÃ©ment'â€”
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     N'est-ce pas vrai, maman?"
                  "How should I know?"
                  "True, you never plead guilty to the soft impeachment.
                  
                     
                        'Voir et sentir toujours de mÃªme,
                        Matin et soir, et nuit et jour,â€”
                        VoilÃ  comme on est quand on aime,
                        VoilÃ  le mal qu'on nomme amour!'"
                     
                  
                  The door closes. (rinforzando) 
                        "ViolÃ  le mal qu'on nomme amour!"
                      And as he flings himself on the sofa, the singer's eye catches his incased
                     guitar, and the pianoforte now forever covered, and he is reminded (graveâ€”slentando) of another talent and the fruit of
                     other labor gone to waste.
                  
                  So wears away the day. His coat comes home, rather botched; which does not help
                     to soothe his nerves. As he ascends to his toilet, he tells his mother that he
                     does not know whether he stands on his head or his feet. But he does not put
                     his neckcloth on his ankles for all that. No, the veriest coxcomb might have
                     been ashamed for him. At his hair, and his hair only, for half an hour,â€”and not
                     yet done? Yet it is not to curl it. He is simply trying to coax it over his
                     forehead more becomingly, which is, more youthfully; for the artist must be
                     satisfied as well as the lover and the man. But alas! the artist makes the
                     lover sensible of his deficiencies and reminds the man of his declining youth.
                     He actually works himself into an agony of despair; and then he laughs, to see
                     his own wry faces. At last, when it is no longer early for a social party, he
                     settles the matter by compromise, and resigning his taste for the beautiful,
                     puts back his once redundant and still handsome hair from his temples,
                     reconciled but scarce contented to appear intellectual, since he cannot, for
                     that night at least, look young.
                  What a terrible moment! He is at the door of the house. He is admitted. He has
                     laid aside his cloak and hat in the room provided, and consulted the mirror.
                     But his heart beats so violently, he stops on the staircase for a few minutes,
                     to the wonderment of the servants; and it is only after a powerful exertion of
                     his will, compelling his brain to a temporary abstraction from the one idea,
                     that he dares permit himself to be announced. It is a deal of trouble surely
                     for one little girl. But the heart would sanction fifty thousand times as much,
                     were so much possible.
                  His dues of ceremony paid in the proper quarter, he looks around for the twin
                     planets that could alone make a heaven for him in that scene. They have not yet
                     risen with the other fires, though the hour is late; and when, at a suitable
                     moment, he inquires of one who was learned in their ephemeris, the poor
                     Chaldean of love's astrology is told they will not be visible in that
                     hemisphere, but, with their sisters of the triple system, were lighting happier
                     regions, in a different inclination to the fashionable ecliptic.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XIII.
                  THE NAME.
                  WE hardly need to say, that though Ernestin was one of the last men to appear
                     in the rooms he was the first man to leave them on a decent opportunity. Did he
                     sleep that night? Ask yourselves. Yet you will answer yourselves, I doubt not,
                     wrong. He slept wellâ€”for him. He had in fact worn his nerves out completely;
                     and Hope and Fancy, which had seen their object suddenly vanish as in a
                     quicksand, were for the while both mute and blind.
                  With a new day, new plans,â€”or rather, one; and that, about as promising as
                     though he should have placed himself at the corner of some particular street in
                     town, to wait for one whose course he could not reckon, and whom he did not
                     even know to be in motion. He resolved to wait until his visit of ceremonious
                     acknowledgment to the Evelyns, with the chance that he might meet the sisters
                     there; that truly forlorn hope failing, he would make the assault in person and
                     carry the fortress by a general storm. He makes the visit, is in high spirits,
                     finds the room full of ladies, but not among them those he cared alone to
                     see.
                  "I am afraid you passed a dull evening," said Miss Margaret Evelyn.
                  "It was then my own fault, Miss Margaret," replied Fitzherbert, "and I have
                     made the earliest call I could, to apologize for my very bad return to your
                     kindness." This was true; he felt really sorry and mortified.
                  "But I do not think you were at all to blame," rejoined Margaret. "There were
                     no ladies present that you knew, and I ought to have seen that you were made
                     acquainted with such as would please you."
                  "A civility that would have been sadly wasted," said Ernestin; "for I was in
                     one of the most unconversable humors possible. Though indeed I did miss some
                     faces that I looked to see. I had hoped, for instance, to renew the brief but
                     agreeable acquaintance which I once made with Miss Sumner at your house."
                  "She has lost a sister but recently."
                  "So I understood. And there were, you know, my window-acquaintances, the Misses
                     Elphinstone."
                  Margaret smiled. "Ah! they had a previous engagement; which was a
                     great pity, you admire them so much."
                  "One of them, very much. It is the second sister, I believe; I do not know her
                     name."
                  Now any other lady but Miss Margaret Evelyn, seeing his drift, would have
                     disappointed him; but she was too amiable, and in the kindness of her nature
                     was as simple as himself. So she answered immediately:
                  "Agnes is the name of the second sister, the lady with long
                     ringlets,â€”Miss Agnes Elphinstone."
                  Ernestin held down his head, not to show the pleasure which he knew must
                     sparkle in his eyes. Agnes; the name of one of his darling
                     sisters! and a name romantic in itself!
                  "I am going to ask of you a great favor," he pursued. "I wish you would take me
                     with you to see the Miss-Elphinstones phinstones, if you suppose it would be agreeable to them."
                  "I am not very intimate there," said the young lady, hesitatingly. She
                     hesitated, because it did violence to her disposition to refuse. But she looked
                     at her sister who sat opposite, and glanced at the bevy of dames between them,
                     seeming to think, "What an odd creature! before all these strangers!" It was
                     odd, but not in Ernestin, who had taken it into his head to ask the
                     introduction, and would have done so had the Primate been present and the party
                     resolved itself into a prayer-meeting. And his answer was equally
                     characteristic:
                  "Then do not." For the thought of entreaty never occurred to Fitzherbert on any
                     occasion, and he was moreover in the constant habit of self-denial where his
                     own wishes came into collision with the convenience of others.
                  "They will be here some evening," resumed the good-natured Margaret; "and I
                     will send for you."
                  "What! all the way to Chelsea?"
                  "All the way to Chelsea."
                  What an immensity of expectation did that simple promise open to the sanguine
                     poet! If on his way homeward he met any body who was happier, gayer, more
                     ethereal than himself, it must have been some one who had an Agnes likewise in
                     his head, and who had practised quite as long at castle-building.
                  But his mother, when returned he told her, so triumphantly, so mysteriously,
                     silly fellow, of his great discovery, did not seem to share his satisfaction.
                     She probably felt it was a new rivet in the chain that was already over
                     strong.
                  "How cold you look!" exclaimed Ernestin. "I thought you would have been
                     delighted to have a new Agnes!"
                  "And a true Agnes I should. If she have half the merit of your sister I shall
                     love her dearly. Nay," continued his mother, her really generous heart
                     expanding at the memories called up by the darling name, "if she be simply
                     amiable, and good, I shall love her, Ernestin, very dearly; and she shall be my
                     Agnes, for the daughter I have lost."
                  Then Ernestin kissed his mother. And the lone Archangel, looking, from his
                     awful distance, on the scene whose joy was so illusive, while ten thousand
                     other scenes of hopes as shadowy, among the sons of men, met his glance at the
                     same moment, smiled mournfully, a smile so sweet, though sad, the heavens
                     around him assumed the tender colors of Earth's twilight, and the glory of his
                     countenance, unutterably beautiful, became in softness as is the light of
                     moonlight, that the ever lucid nights of the many-mooned worlds most nigh his
                     place were for that instant, which was to them whole ages, made lovelier while
                     brighter still, filling the hearts of their inhabitants with gentler
                     aspirations, and chastening and elevating their minds to purer and to higher
                     thoughts.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XIV.
                  THE VENUS OF ARLES.
                  THUS, by a long detail, which was essential to the ethic nature of our theme,
                     though haply the writer's own disrelish have contributed to make it wearisome,
                     we have brought the reader to the point of time in which, in Chapter II., we
                     introduced him to the hero of our story. But one more, and a brief delay, and
                     henceforth, its heavier freight thus landed, the course of our bark will be
                     more rapid. May the breeze blow steady in its sails, and a constant sense of
                     the interests confided to him keep the navigator, under Heaven's providence,
                     from the breakers which he knows to be ahead, and of which a part is dashing up
                     before him now!
                  In that chapter we observed, that while Ernestin was watching for one whom he
                     loved unwisely, since too well, he was in turn
                     watched for by one who loved him, and with perhaps a still more passionate
                     attachment.
                  Unspotted by that hideous commerce which contaminates the minds as well as the
                     bodies of youth in a metropolis, incapable indeed, from his proud and romantic
                     nature, of such defilement, yet was not Ernestin immaculate. He had intrigued
                     too often, in his younger days, with women of a caste below him, and had parted
                     with the whiteness of his spirit, without the satisfaction of gaining any thing
                     in return save that bitter knowledge of his kind which close intimacy with the
                     sex alone can teach. Prone to love, both by the tenderness of his affections
                     and that passionate admiration of beauty which is inseparable from the soul of
                     the poet and the artist, Ernestin actually gave his heart to every object of
                     his amours. But while his intercourse benefited them to a certain
                     degree,â€”because it was impossible for a woman to come so near the gold of his
                     poetic and refined spirit without receiving some streak of the lustre, some
                     faint gilding which wore more or less long according to the moral surface that
                     received it,â€”he himself was conscious of losing more than any moral wisdom
                     could repay him for; for he durst not, when involved in these intrigues, lift
                     up his heart to Heaven; and the stars and darkness spoke no more to him their
                     silent and mystic language.
                  Lapped in ecstasy, but in an ecstasy in which the soul had little or no part,
                     and imagination dropped from her loftier and severer course to dip her wings in
                     the waters of voluptuousness and to hover in an atmosphere of enervating
                     warmth, he saw his hours mostly wasted, nor could ask, for those that were
                     better spent, the approbation of Heaven, whose displeasure the never silent
                     voice within him told him he so surely incurred. Why did not the dreamer waken?
                     Why, in these better moments, did he not shake off the fascination, and rise
                     redintegrate from the lap of enchantment? Sophistry had come to lend her aid to
                     the force of habit, and the Artist excused the Poet for amours, where Nature
                     gave her priceless lessons in the mystery of art, and partial Beauty promised
                     fresher ectypes than the hired models which were common to all and which made
                     all common. And alas for Philosophy! she whispered to him the ordinances of
                     nature, the universality, the unconquerableness, the necessity, the moral benefit even, of sexual
                     passion,â€”whispered, for there was not one word of God in all, and the liar
                     durst not speak aloud.
                  One day when Ernestin, having his affections as yet unoccupied, save by the
                     memories of former loves, or by the images of the unforgotten and still beloved
                     dead, was amusing himself as usual with watching from behind his blind the
                     groups of passers-by, towards whom the heart of the man leaned despite himself,
                     though his spirit had no sympathy with theirs, he was conscious of a female
                     figure appearing at an opposite window, and raising his eyes mechanically he
                     saw a face and form which made the street vanish directly, and the passion for
                     the beautiful take its animated place in his artist-soul, instead of the
                     listless sense of a vague humanity. It was the Venus of Arles we
                     have briefly introduced in the second chapter. The enthusiast so christened her
                     the moment he saw her; and his spirit ever afterward recognized her by that
                     name.
                  Now had the artist been contented with admiring, unseen and unsuspected, the
                     singularly oval visage, with its long straight nose, short curved upper-lip,
                     low brows and almond-shaped eyes, which, in an admirable head, set upon a neck
                     that was symmetry in her and would have been beautiful for any one, made
                     harmony with a body whose proportions and whose height a queen might choose had
                     she the selection,â€”had the artist, the artist only, been content to make his
                     study of this model woman,â€”though he had devoted hours to it, there would have
                     been simply folly to counterbalance the advantages of this pleasant
                     contemplation,â€”folly, because experience had taught him the danger of such
                     indulgences. But the heart of the man began to beat full and quick, and his
                     cheek to flush; and when he felt, who never yet could plead an ignorance of his
                     own impulsions, that the artist had given place to the amorist, and that desire
                     was mingling with admiration, when he felt assured of this, and came to the
                     window still, his folly became a positive violation of conscience; and the next
                     step, to that, is crime.
                  Love by iteration becomes a habit, like every other appetite and passion of the
                     soul; and the difficulty of not loving was one of the most serious
                     which Ernestinâ€”poet, artist, music-madâ€”had to contend with. On
                     the present occasion, he struggled with the propension very earnestly; the more
                     so, that the object of his admiration was to him a sort of miracle; for though
                     young, not more at most than two or three and twenty, and of a style of beauty
                     whose superiority to the meaner charms of her associates she must have been
                     well aware of, however its just degree she might not understand, she took no
                     pains to display it, but appeared at all times free alike from affectation and
                     coquetry. Her hair, which was very beautiful, and of the deepest shade of
                     brown, harmonizing with her dark hazel eyes, was always dressed with great
                     care, but in one unvarying manner, and with perfect simplicity. With that ready
                     perception of what is personally becoming which women of all degrees very
                     generally display, she arranged it precisely as a thorough artist would have
                     done it for her, so as to show to best advantage the oval of her face: parted
                     in the middle, it descended on her temples in an even line, which was not
                     interrupted by the ears, but passed over their upper half, so that there was no
                     break in the unity of the whole head,â€”which made still more striking its
                     resemblance to the antique, despite the absence of the double fillet, and the
                     want of wave. Equally simple and almost as unvaried, equally modest, though
                     devoid of . all elegance save what
                     it borrowed from her form, for the material was common and the cut unskilful,
                     was her sober-colored and always high-necked dress. And here too, were the
                     taste her own, she deserved to be commended, especially as few women seem to be
                     aware how much a high dress sets off a well-formed bust, or they are unwilling
                     to purchase the advantage at the cost of fashion. Was it however from the
                     consciousness of a shapely arm, or for convenience in her housewife-tasks, that
                     she wore invariably within doors short sleeves?â€”The woman never went abroad
                     save to the neighboring shops, and then closely muffled, head as well as
                     shoulders, in her shawl. At home she seemed to have very little to do, and
                     would come often to the window, usually with a puny child, to amuse it, never
                     betraying in her manner any thing like a wish for observation, or a
                     consciousness of meriting it, so that, with her fine proportions, all her
                     gestures had a world of grace. Sometimes, it is true, her unsophisticated
                     nature or her want of breeding prompted her to actions much less picturesque;
                     and when Ernestin saw her with a slice of bread-and-butter, lunching quite at
                     ease within the very window, his admiration struck him as ludicrous, and
                     smiling at himself rather than at her, the temperature of his feelings sunk
                     instantly; for love has little to do with merriment, or even cheerfulness,â€”and
                     they who paint Cupid on the broad grin know nothing about him.
                  Ernestin's travels had not, any more than all the sin he daily saw in his own
                     country, changed his principles in the least degree. He still looked upon
                     intrigues with married women as a plain robbery, differing in no other respect
                     from other robberies, than in the commodity stolen and its greater value. Yet
                     as he everywhere saw the levity with which the marriage covenant is almost
                     universally regarded, the bride, scarce a week from the altar, resuming her
                     flirtations, and taking a keener as better understood delight in the excitation
                     and reciprocation of desires which the eyes alone convey and receive, and the
                     pulses take sole cognizance of,â€”as he came in for his share of the enjoyment,
                     his senses were continually betraying him, while conscience and twin reason
                     looked on with horror and disgust, and for every thrill of pleasure sent into
                     his soul a twinge of pain. But we have elsewhere touched upon this subject, and
                     we need not dilate upon it here. Do we not already offend the common sentiment?
                     The philosophy that would extend the observation of duties to the heart is too
                     rough for general wear; and who expects a sermon in a novel? Enough to repeat,
                     that Ernestin, like other men, had leaped the quickset of his neighbor's
                     garden; and if he never had shook down the fruit, or gathered yet one flower,
                     but merely pressed the roses delicately to him, or drew down the boughs, and
                     passed from bush to tree, reeling, half intoxicated with the odors he had
                     inspiredâ€”with long draughts, as if his life depended on them,â€”still he had no
                     business there, and that he came not out a spoiler, 'twas that Providence was
                     kinder to him than his own heart.
                  And now, what shall keep him innocent? Alas! he calls himself a thief in vain;
                     he looks upon that pale thin face, pale from confinement and thin perhaps from
                     scanty fare, but so young that thinness mars it not, and so spiritual that
                     paleness only adds to its interest, and to its noble style, he looks upon it as
                     it leans pensively against the narrow panes, and, with a resolution not to lead
                     her into folly, even the folly that so few or none regard as sinful, retires,
                     to meditate upon it, and to return, to look on it once more. He dares not pray;
                     and in that fear, he throws aside
                     the only shield that could effectually protect him. Who does not foresee the
                     issue? Presently, sophistry lends him an excuse: he is curious to know if this
                     wonder of a woman be really unsophisticate, or if she seek not for admiration
                     because in her own sphere, and with her peculiar style, she is unaccustomed to
                     its incense.
                  Stopping his ears to the voice within him, which told him that he lied, the
                     heart-student leaves the shaded window of his closet, and goes to an open one
                     of the drawing-room. The woman has retired. He leans against the window-frame
                     in an attitude calculated to display his person, and looks steadily for a
                     moment at the now blank window opposite, then carelessly up and down the
                     street, and once again at the window,â€”then, after lounging a little while,
                     withdraws, to await in his closet the result.
                  In a little while, he sees the model head again. It leans as before against the
                     pane, with the same unconscious expression of the beautiful face. Presently,
                     how his heart beats! it turns quickly, and looks directly at the window he has
                     left. In a few moments, it looks again, and with the same manner,â€”as if she had
                     worked herself up to the effort. And yet, after a still longer interval, a
                     third time. And now there is a pang in Ernestin's breast, and a tightness at
                     his throat. Conscience has resumed her seat; and the tumult of pleasure is
                     succeeded by a mortal sickness. He loathes himself, and is disposed even to
                     abuse the woman. "They are all alike!" he exclaims, with curling lip, as he
                     turns his back upon the scene, disappointed at his own success, "all! I might
                     have known it!" Oh, Ernestin! is this thy knowledge of the heart? is it so
                     strange a thing, a woman young and handsome, uneducated, solitary, having so
                     much time upon her hands, should obey an impulse which those who should be
                     stronger in her sex rarely think of resisting? she too in humble life, and
                     seeing thee above her! Take care! thou art the tempter. If she come to the
                     forbidden tree, the sin is thine, though the frailty may be hers.
                  If Ernestin said any such thing to himself, as well he might, it certainly was
                     all in vain; for, the next day, he looks to see if she remember him, and finds,
                     not unexpectedly, she does. Where are his pangs of conscience now? and what
                     excuse shall sophistry now lend him? In every vein of him, he feels that he is
                     guilty, and though he meditates no flagitious wrong, and the devil assures him,
                     very positively, there is no danger of such, yet it is pleasure that now stirs
                     his senses, and the habit of old sin, and, when the tempted leaves her window,
                     the tempter repeats in his the allurements of the preceding day, and stifles
                     conscience in the very sensations that wake her into action.
                  Man's penalties, of soul and body, profit neither him, nor, by their example,
                     others. It is one of those things most difficult to account for in the
                     dispensations of Providence. We violate the ordinance of nature, whether in the
                     moral or physical world, and the punishment follows as an inevitable result.
                     But it does not deter us. The offence ceases to be repeated merely with the
                     power to accomplish its perpetration. And we die penitent, because we die old,
                     or exhausted. This state is but probationary. In the future only, shall we
                     practice from the lesson which we learn so hardly here.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XV.
                  TRY HER AGAIN.
                  IN all wrong-doing, as everybody knows, it is but the first misdeed that gives
                     us trouble. The hand once in, though it were the vilest filth that ever
                     sickened humanity, soul and senses grow less nice, and, persuaded we can not be
                     dirtier, we suffer convenience, weariness, or satiety to prescribe the time for
                     purgation.
                  It is a week since Ernestin has forgot the model in the woman. His guardian
                     angel in Heaven has hid his face, and the invisible Spirit of Evil at his elbow
                     whispers, nor is interrupted, Try her again.
                  The woman is amusing, but languidly, her child in the window, and for some
                     reason, that made the experienced heart of the student flutter, has turned her
                     face the other way, so that her back is toward him. Ernestin goes to the
                     drawing-room window, not directly, but behind the curtains, and sitting down,
                     on the corresponding side with hers, puts back the drapery, and waits. It is
                     not long. The woman suddenly turns round, and, meeting for the first time his
                     eyes, springs upâ€”almost dropping the child from her lap, and instantly
                     disappears.
                  There was no coquetry in the action, no prudery, no affectation of any kind; it
                     was simple terror, the most impulsive act of nature Ernestin had ever
                     witnessed; nor did he mistake it. With a terror great as hers, though from a
                     different cause, and which drove the devil from him instantly, he sat still for
                     a moment, pale as the window-frame, assuming as well as he could a look of
                     unconcern; which was precisely what the woman herself would have done, had she
                     not been a child of nature but a creature of the world. He knew well that she
                     must watch him from the back part of her room, and it gave him, in his now
                     changed feelings, an honorable motive to affect indifference. He then rose, and
                     retiring to his own apartment, gave vent to his pent-up anguish.
                  "What have I done!" exclaimed inwardly the conscience-stricken student, as,
                     with knitted brow and set teeth, he strode hurriedly up and down, his right
                     hand grasping under his vest his left breast, as if he would tear it from the
                     ribs: "The only artless woman, out of my own family, that I ever saw, save one.
                     That one I lived with for a month, day after day utterly alone with her from
                     morning until evening, have felt her warm breath, as she leaned over me while I
                     was drawing and her soft ringlets brushed my cheek, and though my pulse beat
                     sometimes very high, I call my Maker and all angels to witness, I never for a
                     moment nursed one thought contrary to her honor, never looked at her save when
                     necessary, though she was beautiful as a spirit, was not yet twenty, I but
                     twenty-two, and we were all alone. Did I act thus because her husband trusted
                     me, and shall I be less honest now? now, when there is less temptation? for
                     that one loved me, as, when I left her roof forever, to return to my own land,
                     I saw too plainly, though happily not till thenâ€”so innocent had I been of even
                     pondering the peril of our situation. And what a satisfaction has the
                     recollection of that virtue ever been, is still! Can any pleasure in this low
                     amour, which as it aims at nothing is fitter for a boy than man, weigh against the sense of duty violated towards
                     my Maker, my fellow-creature, myself? Her husband, too, has
                     confidence in her, and virtually confides in all his neighbors; and I am one.
                     May God forgive me! for I am very wicked."
                  The next day the marks of his fingers were on Ernestin's breast; but the heart
                     within beat voluptuously as before. It was the outward discipline of the Romish
                     church. The spirit is not to be pinched, any more than flagellated, into
                     repentance.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVI.
                  THE WAY IT WORKS.
                  THE terror of her inexperience soon forgotten, Ernestin's fair neighbor began
                     naturally to take a manifest pleasure in an amour, which, so far as the eyes
                     and heart were concerned, was regularly kept up. Poor creature! so lonely, with
                     little or no occupation to distract her from the thoughts in which her brain
                     must have been, whatever her defects of education, fertile,â€”for the
                     configuration of her head gave evidence of capacity, and the character of her
                     features spoke habitual and serious contemplation,â€”so very handsome, what
                     wonder was it she should take a pleasure in a new conquest, which women that
                     are less exposed, and who are better mated, triumph in! she too, whose husband,
                     though a younger man than Ernestin, was so insignificant and vulgar, while
                     Ernestin was the very opposite of either,â€”what wonder, even were she wedded in
                     a partnership of love, as not one is in any thousand women any whereâ€”who take
                     to marriage as the legitimate and preordained result of womanhood, the single
                     goal of their existence, for which they run with all their soul, though at the
                     risk of its dislocation, if not eventual destruction,â€”what wonder this poor
                     lonely, handsome, seemingly ill-mated woman, should yield to a seduction to
                     which so many voices in her spirit called her, while but one, and that most
                     harsh and unto self-love most offensive, warned her back! Poor creature! if those thoughtful
                     features lie not, what shall keep thee from staking all that thou possessest
                     from Heaven or from earth upon a game, which thy more used antagonist is
                     playing, warily it is true, and not without zest, yet for little more than
                     pastime?
                  It is strange that he, the inviter to the game, should not himself have
                     pondered this. But Fitzherbert was, as we shall presently see, a thorough
                     skeptic as to woman's proneness to love, at least where he himself was
                     concerned; and though he set a sufficient value on his own person, it was
                     rather as an artist than a man; and he never conceived the possibility of a
                     woman's loving him for that alone. Did he then deny them all imagination? What
                     we long for we do not always like; but, longing for it long, we learn at last
                     to love it. Hang an apple from a ceiling, and put a woman in the room alone
                     with it, and, leaving others near her for her use, make her vow she will not
                     touch that one. Though worms had eaten it one half, and rottenness and mold
                     defiled and spoiled a moiety of the remainder, yet so long as there was left a
                     portion of it sound or fragrant, or that she could fancy so, she would,
                     despising all the others, covet that alone, and end by leaping up to it,
                     striking at it, climbing to it, nor ever rest till she had got it down, and
                     swallowed it, it may be worms and all.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVII.
                  THE AWAKENING.
                  NOW it chanced, one day, our student's brother, Henry, took his station at the
                     very drawing-room window where Ernestin played the foolish if not wicked game,
                     which he told his unbelieving conscience was the study of fine nature. The
                     blinds were now habitually closed, for the student's accommodation: (thieves do
                     not need the light, to find their way into their neighbor's entry.) At this
                     moment, the fair one comes to her unshaded window, and mistaking Henry for
                     Ernestin, directs him certain timid glances, which, being a handsome man, he
                     does not doubt are intended for himself, and returns them gratefully and with
                     interest. From this day, Mr. Henry Fitzherbert was a regular visitant at the
                     window, and Ernestin abandoned it altogether.
                  He was not one of those men who are stimulated in the race of love, nay,
                     sometimes then only either on it seriously, when they see beside them a
                     competitor. The instant that another stripped for the same course, he stopped,
                     disgusted, and withdrew for ever. A single look at his brother, and Ernestin
                     saw what he was about; as brief an observation from his closet window convinced
                     him that he was not mistaken. And the next day, when he saw the same doings,
                     upon both sides, he seemed to waken from an idle dream. "Innocent!" he
                     exclaimed in mind, as he stood with
                     locked arms, his eyes sparkling and his mouth any thing but lover-like, and
                     eyed the woman through the blinds; "Innocent! Bah! I wonder if the devil be
                     really male?"
                  If he were assured of the woman's levity, of her wantonness, he might well ask
                     himself the question,â€”for nothing could be more remote from either than the
                     expression of that modest, sad, almost dignified, yet very gentle face, and the
                     still unaffected demeanor with which at all times she behaved. Still simple,
                     still retired, still timid, never smiling, save on her child, and ever pale,
                     save when at times she would kiss it abruptly, and rub her face over its little
                     cheeks, under feelings which Ernestin well understood,â€”either she was the most
                     complete dissembler that ever existed, or she was laboring under some delusion.
                     And in fact, Ernestin, now cooler, began to reflect that though his brother was
                     dark while he was fair, and there was besides no resemblance between them
                     either in feature or stature, yet she could probably see behind the blind, at
                     that distance, only a bearded cheek and a pair of speaking eyes, and
                     imagination might supply the rest, especially as she had no reason to suppose a
                     change. Accordingly he stationed himself once or twice at an open window of an
                     upper room; but, though he succeeded in attracting her attention, she still
                     persisted in entertaining her new admirer, and, filled with contempt both of
                     her and of himself, he tried no further. It was then that the design of his
                     tragedy occurred to him, and, under the irritation of his feelings, and in the
                     new impetus given to his moral sense by this escape from the enervating
                     thraldom of pleasure, he wrote rapidly, and in the fiery, masculine, and severe
                     style which he considered best adapted to that noblest of human songs. In the
                     elevation of his thoughts, in the lofty joy of anticipated fame, even in the
                     purified expression of his brightened eyes, the poet, etherealized, exalted
                     above common passion, felt little inclination to resume his folly, nor faltered
                     when he learned, as soon happened, the injustice of his suspicions.
                  The spring was now advanced. One evening, while it was yet light, Henry, who
                     had been studying much to his satisfaction Ernestin's model, threw back the
                     blind; or perhaps it escaped his fingers. Ernestin in his closet, hearing the
                     noise, raised his eyes, and saw the Venus run from her post in
                     pure dismay. From that day, she was more chary of appearing, and never allowed
                     herself to look at the accustomed window; so that Ernestin's brother, getting
                     tired, abandoned the pursuit.
                  By and by, she seemed to have discovered that Ernestin occupied the little room
                     over the doorway, and thither, and to his bedroom in the upper story, she
                     turned her whole attention. Whether supposing that his alienation arose from
                     her mistake, and she was anxious to convince him of her true feelings, or that
                     the season had its usual physical influence, she had now laid aside much of her
                     timidity, and betrayed an amorous restlessness and impatience, which began to
                     have a manifest effect even on her already pale thin cheeks, and thoughtful
                     brow. Often, when the sun shone into her windows, he would see her from his
                     bedroom seated in the back part of her humble parlor, with the child in her
                     lap, her face turned towards the quarter where she now was wont to look for
                     him; and as often as he returned to observe her, while the sun enabled him to
                     see, she was still there in the same attitude of patient watching. In his
                     changed feeling, or more justly his state of restoration, Ernestin felt sorrow
                     and remorse, not for his suspicions, which had done her no harm, but for the folly into which he had led her
                     and the seduction of which he now believed he had been guilty; but he shuddered
                     when, a day or two after, he saw her go out, dressed as for a long walk, with
                     her child, and knew by her manner, by her dallying at the door when ready, and
                     by her previous protracted preparation, while she equipped her diminutive
                     companion at the window, that she invited him to join her, and gave him time to
                     do so. This manÅ“uvre was repeated once or twice; and I should not render
                     nature, if I failed to add, that, the shudder once over, Ernestin found his
                     heart to beat rebelliously; but he struggled against the temptation; and when
                     his neighbor saw he would not take the hint, she returned to her old habit of
                     complete domestication, and became sadder than ever. "In time," thought
                     Ernestin, "she will grow tired. May Heaven forgive me, for both of us! for I
                     only am to blame."
                  Most truly was he, as a brief incident soon taught him. One morning, when he
                     accompanied his mother out, he was conscious that his model left her house at
                     the same time, and took the same direction. He did not look aside. But when
                     they had come to a cross-street, the woman quickened her pace so as to traverse
                     their path. Now Ernestin was naturally curious to see if a near inspection
                     would justify his admiration, and he returned her look when she came before
                     him. She was muffled in her customary shawl, which passing over her head hid
                     the side of her face, but revealed enough to show him, that though she was
                     somewhat freckled she was very handsome, still younger than he had supposed
                     her, and that her eyes were singularly fine. But the expression of those eyes!
                     The stale comparison of a startled deer or fawn's, would be not more insipid
                     than inadequate to convey it. Never did the timidest maiden, just entering
                     puberty, betray, under the impulse of desires that were new to her and the
                     restraint of a modesty that was habitual,â€”longing yet afraid,â€”more agitation,
                     more of actual fright, than did this grown-up matron, who had probably been
                     married several years. Indeed, when at the door of a house in their way, where
                     she stopped, she turned, as if with a desperate determination, and looked again
                     at him an instant, her large dark eyes rolled in their dilated lids so wildly,
                     and the dread she had to meet his look while she solicited it gave so vacant
                     and wandering an expression, that, with her lips also wide apartâ€”for she was
                     breathing hard, she appeared to be insane.
                  Then did Ernestin deeply regret this notice of her,â€”for he knew it would
                     encourage her infatuation; and convinced, not without a pang of conscience,
                     that he had found one other innocent and artless woman besides the fair
                     country-girl he had boarded with in France, he rejoiced, for both her sake and
                     his own, that the growing business of their part of Chelsea would compel his
                     mother to change her domicil at the end of the term.
                  And now it was that the guardian angel, seeing his sorrow and sincere
                     repentance, to aid his struggles for a better life, and to keep him from
                     relapsing into evil ways,â€”although, for that last act of sinful folly, not yet
                     the full atonement had been made of the heart's anguishâ€”for the laws of God are
                     unalterable, and he who breaks them must pay all the penalty, though he should
                     weep tears of blood,â€”now it was that the beneficent Spirit brought to his
                     delighted vision the fresh and noble beauty of young Agnes Elphinstone; and
                     Ernestin Fitzherbert saw himself rescued by his passions from the depth of
                     uncleanness into which those very passions had precipitated him. Such was the will of that Providence Who
                     alone bringeth good out of evil, and Who had so ordained, when first the stars
                     were onward rolled in the Creation, that all things should have their partial
                     counterpoise of good and evil, whereby the dead stagnation of inertness should
                     not paralyze the heart of virtue, nor ceaseless disappointment, and a
                     never-ending struggle with opponent evil, exhaust it to the lethargy and palsy
                     of despair.
                  From that day, he rapidly regained the virtues if not the innocence of his
                     early boyhood, with enlarged views of duty and a heart purified as the heart
                     may only be purified, in the furnace of affliction. No longer now he feared to
                     pray, no longer were the stars for him silent, and the glory of the field of
                     heaven dim, but, as he stood upon the housetop in the warm summer night,
                     leaning on the copestone of the chimneys, every planet blazed out with
                     increased effulgence and spoke to the ears of his spirit those mystic sounds
                     which the rapt poet and the inspired sage alone can hear, and only then when
                     they are sinless, and the shadows of the moonlight filled him with a dreamy
                     ecstasy that made his eyes to swim,â€”ecstasy how far above that animal
                     voluptuousness which exalts not but depresses, and whose consequences are
                     diminished beauty and premature senescence!
                  When therefore he told Agnes herself, when they came to speak together, He owed her more than any other woman he had ever known, he told
                     but truth. His mother had given him life and breeding; his sisters had
                     perfected what in him was of good, and had shed a light upon his youth which
                     burned still in memory, ever bright, nor lessened, save, as the stars, when he
                     fell from virtue; but she, through the will of Providence, was the
                        "Picciola"8 that recalled him to the paths of innocence and
                     virtue, and renewed the compact which nature made for him with God.
                  We are at the point of our history that ends all retrospect. Loose we now the
                     cables, and stretching all our canvas to the breeze, move rapidly, with
                     lightened hull, down the Rhine of our voyage, which henceforth has no
                     stopping-places, though on every side are prospects that will brighten and make
                     brief the way.

                  CHAPTER I.
                  THE FALLEN ARCHANGEL.
                  AMID the jarring elements in which oscillated, and revolved, and rose and fell,
                     and shot forward and back like a weaver's shuttle, by a movement that took
                     every way by turns, the yet unshapen and scarce compacted mass of Hell,
                     floated, upright, buoyed by the thick air as if they stood, Satan, and the
                     rebel Spirit next to him in might.
                  Far downward, making the only spot in what was undefinable, bickered the flames
                     of their dread dwelling-place, lighting up by flashes, as in a vast stithy, the
                     shoreless gloom, and showedâ€”or would have showed, had there been gazers where
                     no seraph cared to lookâ€”the pair whose direst punishment perhaps it was, not to
                     die.
                  The wings of the Archfiend were in shape, and double like the larger moths',
                     that flutter in the sunshine their brief season of complete existence over the
                     scented flowers. But the smoke of Hell had blackened into one dismal hue their
                     once varied colors; and their huge nerves, under the deep discoloration, looked
                     like the iron beams of some vast engine. Out from his back, though pressed
                     together, they stood as stand the moths'; and their prodigious vans seemed as
                     the sails, but twenty times more large, of some great vessel floating in the
                     night, ere the moon has risen. Not dusky or obscured however his body, which
                     stood revealed by its own light, the feeble remains of its innate splendorâ€”now
                     but a phosphorescence, brightest in the field-wide surface of his breast and
                     the cheeks and forehead of his sullen and terrific head,â€”sullen in sorrow,
                     terrific in its sullenness. How unlike the sorrow of his once co-mate, Heaven's
                     lone Archangel! Between the knitted and down-gathered brows, which were like in
                     length the lowest boughs of some gigantic oak, deep-brooding passions and
                     corroding care had ploughed a furrow shaped like the area of some theatre where
                     men sit to see themselves made little or aggrandized under others' forms. His
                     once resplendent eyes had been injured by the light of the highest Heaven,
                     which he had insolently sought to penetrate. Hurled into utter darkness,â€”for a
                     million years beholding no light but the lurid flames of Hell, save when by
                     stealth he soared to the region of the inferior planets and caught brief
                     glimpses of their brightness,â€”they had become like those of some forest beast
                     that prowls under the stars; but the mind within shot out a glare, like the
                     tiger's from the shadow of its jungle, that illumined not his featuresâ€”as with
                     the glorious Spirits of whom he had been the brightest saving one, and with
                     that one co-equalâ€”but burned in the elliptic pupil like a red yet flameless
                     fire, which, when he spoke as now in scorn, and bent his already lowering
                     brows, glowed with a white heat, as glows the bed of coals under the funnel of
                     a forge when the blast of the smith's bellows is streamed upon them.
                  "A creature like that! say'st thou?" exclaimed the mightier
                     fiend. "'Tis spoken well! fifty of whom might stand at ease within the hollow
                     of this hand, nor should I feel it.
                     For all that is himself, the thing might buzz his hour of sunshine, not so much
                     regarded by me as is by him the fly that spots his table; but he is one of
                     those whom Heaven's lord regards with interest, because they alone of all their
                     paltry kind live in hourly adulation of his power, bending the knees of the
                     heart in sycophantic homage of all that he vouchsafes to let them see in his
                     Creation, and struggle to grow wiser by the anguish of the brain.â€”I too strove
                     to be wiser; but it did not stead me much." The Archfiend never laughed with
                     the eyes,â€”they glared still cold and sullen; but his bearded upper lip rose
                     derisively at the left corner, and his dilated nostrils threw out smoke.â€”He
                     opened his double pinions and closed them again. The noise they made was as the
                     roar of a whirlwind upon Earth under the line. "For what else," he continued,
                     facing his companion,â€”who stood aside, behind him, just without the broad sweep
                     of his wings,â€”"for what but to thwart the reptile's Master, or, if not that, to
                     work despite, or at least oppose him (there is pleasure even there), do I
                     stoop, myself, to visit that poor spark which men call Earth, when ten thousand
                     greater stars, whose habitants surpass in faculties the Earth's, feel yet my
                     influence? Nor is it wholly dead in the orb where dwell his sisters. Men in
                     their vanity dare make me chaffer for their wretched souls!" His lip curled
                     again. "What would it better me, if this worm, this wingless grub, that hopes
                     by self-torture and the blessing of his hard taskmaster's trials to attain a
                     higher sphere, should drop, by my wayâ€”which is much more pleasant,
                     into one more nigh to Hell? I do not think his wisdom would illuminate its
                     darkness much. But if in so doing I reverse his destiny, and make him, at the
                     eleventh hour, forswear his Maker?"
                  "And what hope is there of that?" asked the inferiorâ€”made familiar by community
                     of crime.
                  "The memory of Eden. Long ere this, the fruit were swallowed stem and core, but
                     for another Eve, who calls the Adam back from the forbidden tree and points to
                     Paradise around. But for these dimmed eyes which cannot pierce this gloom, I
                     might have met at every turn the powers that shield him, who at their ease,
                     accursed slaves! see all, and counteract my happiest plans. But thanks to use,
                     which even in Hell adapts one's functions to their proper sphere, a few hard
                     wing-strokes put us even."
                  So saying, the fallen Archangel, not waiting for reply, sprung forward, and,
                     plying all his strength of wing and limb, clove with effort the dense air, and
                     slowly lessened in the murky space. Fallen indeed! for even the fiend behind
                     him sneered at this bitterness of malignity, this gluttony of revenge, which
                     made a meal of insects rather than not feed,â€”sneered in safety from his lord,
                     who in his impaired faculties saw no longer into the hearts of those beneath
                     himâ€”since none were now beneath him save in the degree of sin. Awhile by the
                     watcher he was seen with dusky wing sailing solitary in the vast ocean of
                     eternal darkness,â€”glimmering, then lost again in the blacknessâ€”as the faint
                     splendor of his body appeared and disappeared with the rise and fall of his
                     pinions. So sees by night, lone musing on some river's bank, the tired wayfarer
                     or the student sad, what time thick-gathering clouds have hid the stars, the
                     lights of some far vessel, beating with an adverse wind across the stream. Then
                     the inferior fiend, cursing bitterly his own folly and his who had tempted him,
                     drifted downward to the yet burning and unsolid shore of Hell.
                  Satan's progress, though slow in comparison with the speed of seraphs or his own in upper air,
                     exceeded yet in swiftness that of any bird of Earth as much as did his form in
                     bulk; and soon it brought him, weary with his toil, to where his sooty pennon
                     looked still blacker for the flood of light, and his body grew all dim as does
                     the firefly's in mid-day, and where his motion, though it sent him forward with
                     a tenfold swiftness, was repose; for now his limbs, stretched out at length, no
                     longer plied as oars, but served as rudder to his easy course.
                  Onward, onward, shading his unaccustomed eyes with level hand, flew the gloomy
                     Spirit in the no more now familiar air; and now he sees the Sun and its
                     revolving planets, and prepares with slackened sail to coast about it, when
                     behold, above, before him, darting precipitate towards him as gentil-tercel on
                     the ravening kite, the Spirit that so loved the sons of men! and Satan knew his
                     purpose was discovered.
                  Pausing abruptly, the lord of Hell drew himself upright, fanning the ether with
                     slow and measured strokes of his enormous vans, and faced the advancing seraph.
                     But his audacity availed him not. His blasted vision could not brook the
                     undiminished lustre of the Spirit of light. The narrow oval of the iris shrunk
                     into the smallest speck, and the whole orb grew almost colorless. Dazzled,
                     bewildered, like a night-bird by the glare of noon, enraged to be so dashed, he
                     stumbled as a mortal groping in the dark on Earth, his wings for a moment
                     ceased to move, and he had well-nigh fallen precipitate; but pride and his
                     natural courage, not wholly lost, restored both mind and body to their
                     equipoise, and with haughty mien, though downcast eyes, he addressed his
                     glorious adversary.
                  "Minion of Heaven's despot! who worshipest a presence which thou canst not
                     see"â€”
                  "And which to strive to see"â€”broke in the angel mildlyâ€”"hath stripped thee of
                     thy better sight."â€”
                  "Presumptuous slave!" exclaimed the Archrebel fiercely, "darest thou reproach
                     me with my blindness? thou! who whilom couldst not look upon me without
                     shrinking?"
                  "As thou, now, canst not on the meanest of thy Maker's servants, so much has
                     loss of virtue sunk thee."
                  The fiend ground his teeth with rage, and, stretching forth his right hand,
                     seemed prompted to some deed of violence, but the consciousness of want of
                     power, the sense of guilt, restrained him; and it fell heavily to his side, as
                     falls a tree on Earth with the last stroke of the woodman's axe.
                  "Unhappy Spirit!" continued the benevolent angel, "I reproach thee not; I pity
                     thee, as all the fallen." He paused an instant, and, as the Voice within him
                     blessed him with its approbation, he added, "as 'tis meet I should."
                  "Pity not me, soft-hearted, servile hypocrite! I ask not for thy pity, nor thy
                     Master's. Why stopp'st thou me my way?"
                  "Because the way is banned, and thy purpose is malignant."
                  "My purpose! This from thee! What can such as thou
                     know of my purposes?"
                  "All," answered the angel mildly, "since thy heavy crime has sunk thee under
                     me."
                  Rage now added to the scorn that swelled the chest and spread the nostrils of
                     the Evil One, he might scarcely keep within him the pent-up fire; but his very
                     consciousness of departed power, while it had fanned the flame, made him fear
                     to give it vent; and the gentle angel, undaunted by his terrible emotion, continued uninterrupted.
                  "A feeble child of Earth, whose longest term of life, should he live it all,
                     were not in thy immortal being as long as seems to him the passing of a day, a
                     creature whom the Unutterable has seen fit to rescue from the death of sin"
                     (the Devil sneered hugely) "and to inspire with a steady purpose of a better
                     life, this humble mortal, thou in pure spite, and with the monstrous daring
                     none save thee alone would even conceive, art trying every wile to lure back to
                     his ruin."
                  "As thy good Master is, to coax him forwardâ€”this poor, feeble"â€”
                  "Peace, impious!" cried the angel, now no longer mild. "The Almighty Will moves
                     not; or couldst thou rest here now? The weak that struggle truly He
                     strengthens, through their own nature; thou interferest directly, and to do
                     despite, as thou presumestâ€” But wherefore talk to thee, who knowest thou
                     couldst not even tempt this mortal, but that it is permitted for his better
                     trial,â€”out of which he shall issue safe, despite thy wiles."
                  "Preach that to slaves and cowards like thyself!" exclaimed the fiend,
                     forgetting all his prudence: "My will is sovereign of itself, and acts not by
                     another's sufferance. Why else does not thy Master interfere?"
                  It was not in anger, but with a tone of deep sorrow, that the seraph answered,
                     solemnly yet softly, "Hast thou not enough suffered?"â€”and the effulgence of his
                     eyes became so intensely beautiful under his celestial pity, that the ruined
                     Spirit, who in his overboiling wrath and pride had raised his own a moment to
                     the seraph's face, became utterly confounded.
                  Conscience-struck, despite the habit of long guilt,â€” smitten, spite of passion,
                     with the sense of his own weakness,â€”dazzled, notwithstanding his audacity, by
                     the ray of superhuman benevolence which streamed upon him, and whose source he
                     knew was in the Wellspring of all Beauty and all Virtue,â€”he fled
                     precipitateâ€”but fled not backward,â€”and took his course beyond the region of the
                     Sun.
                  Everywhere the stars looked pale; the angelic host had disappeared; the harmony
                     of the spheres was broken, and seemed to have a movement that was expressive of
                     wo and consternation: and this solitary and desert course smote more upon the
                     heart of the rebel Spirit than had he been met by opposition and pursued with
                     obloquy. He smote his forehead with his heavy hand, and a large tear glistened
                     on the fatal orbs that perhaps had never until now been so suffused; but it was
                     a tear of wounded pride and of despair, not of sorrow, far less of penitence.
                     "Accursed be," he cried, "the elements whereof I was created! accursed be the
                     stars that once were vocal at my bidding! May the fires that are part of them,
                     and those which give them glory, burn up their pregnant entrails and redissolve
                     their solid forms, and make them once more like the Hell that is my home!"
                  As he spoke, he plunged on slanting wing amid the thickest galaxy, and,
                     skimming nigh the multitudinous orbits of its suns, feeding his soul with spite
                     at the splendor that could no more make him happy, appeared as a comet, numbing
                     with consternation the spirits of the ignorant, but an object of delighted
                     study to the sage whom science places above fear. The atmosphere of some of the
                     worlds took fire at his breath, and a drought which lasted for a yearâ€”though
                     that period was but a moment to the fiendâ€”burnt up their soil, and made
                     desolate with famine their peopled cities.
                  
                  Animated by the sight of the mischief he had caused without specific effort,
                     his proud lungs inflated with the conceit of his malignant influence, nor
                     seeing in his blind vanity that its exercise was but permitted him by the
                     Unutterable Will, in Whose hands both evil and good work out mysteriously the
                     purposes of a never-sleeping beneficence, the wicked Spirit turned backward to
                     the region of the Sun, and, coasting the Earth about its middle parts, steered
                     upward to the pole.
                  As he passed the Tropics, stooping still nearer to the orb, with slackened
                     pinion and incurvate sweepâ€”as the sea-bird over the ocean when in search of
                     prey, a furious storm raged before him. Trees were torn up by the roots, or
                     their branches twisted off and carried, with the tiles and timber of unroofed
                     houses, to an immense distance; and men and cattle, lifted off their feet, were
                     obliged to take refuge in caves and under cliffs, to escape destruction.
                     Grasping in his hand the thunder, he hurled it in pure malignity and scorn
                     against a house, where sat a young husband and his wife with their infant
                     child. The mother was struck dead, but the babe lay on her breast untouched;
                     and the Devil laughed. He knew not that the wife had been spared the long
                     consumption of a broken heart, and the child been rescued from the ruinous
                     indulgence of its mother's weakness.
                  And now, his spleen somewhat abated, he ascended, with renewed audacity, to his
                     former height in ether, and, hovering o'er the northern seas, gazed through the
                     atmosphere upon an island, and in itâ€”in the suburb of a mighty cityâ€”on an
                     humble house, where sat a pale woman of a most rare beauty,â€”rarer even for its
                     kind than its degree. She sat within the shade of a poor apartment, with a
                     sickly child pressed to her bosom, its head over her shoulder, and which she
                     seemed, by the motion of her hand, to be endeavoring to soothe to sleep; but
                     her own head turns incessantly towards the window, and her large dark eyes are
                     fixed with an anxious scrutiny on the Venetian shutters of a dwelling nearly
                     opposite.
                  "Frail sex!" said the Devil, while his invisible attraction, as he floated down
                     a little lower, drew the woman to the window, with a flushed cheek and beating
                     heart, and made her kiss her offspring with a thousand kisses, which even
                     herself surmised were not a mother's,â€”"Frail sex! who are easily moved to evil
                     or to good, but who are steadfast in evil only, and there so firm myself can
                     scarcely lead ye! Man needs no devil, as he nameth me. You are ever at his
                     elbow, his readiest tempter, as at first."
                  "And, as at first, his sweetest solace and support in sorrow and trial," said a
                     voice behind him.
                  Satan turned, and saw the benevolent angel at his shoulders, though some human
                     leagues apart.
                  "Canst thou thwart me here?" cried the fiend.
                  "Virtue, and Afflictionâ€”which is its human mother, can everywhere."
                  "We shall see," said the lord of Hell.
                  "I see already," rejoined the brighter subject of Heaven.
                  The fiend looked, and saw the seraph's eyes regarding Agnes Elphinstone, who
                     was then passing under the very window of the pale woman.
                  "That other creeping insect?" cried the evil Spirit, with a laugh which caused
                     a flurry in the atmosphere; and lo! the sudden gust drove Agnes for a shelter
                     to the humble doorway, so that she faced the rescued student. "See!" continued
                     the short-sighted fiend; "she yields to my mere breath,â€”as did the common
                     mother of them all."
                  
                  "Whose seed have yet their feet upon thy head, obdurate rebel!"
                  As he spoke, the seraph turned him Heavenward; and the fiend, plunging forward,
                     in a direction opposite, drew, into the void created by his wings, the clouds
                     that hung upon that portion of the ocean-isle; and the sky of Chelsea was once
                     more serene.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE RESOLUTION.
                  NOW Ernestin in society and Ernestin alone were two different persons, in all
                     matters that needed judgment. Sanguine and excitable, open-hearted, and such a
                     slave to his word, that even when he had promised what he ought not or what was
                     inconsequential (as often happened to one who, when animated by the unfrequent
                     stimulus of conversation, forgot all prudence and lost absolute sight of what
                     he seldom had fairly in viewâ€”self-interest) he felt himself bound to his
                     engagement, though none but himself remembered he had made it,â€”being, I say, so
                     hopeful, truthful, single-hearted and impulsive, it was unavoidable that he
                     should fall into the error of supposing others as simple as himself; but the
                     moment he returned to his closet, credulity gave place to reason, and reason
                     took counsel of experience.
                  Taught by constant disappointment what faith to put in most men's words, and
                     particularly in most women's, certainly in cases where neither think it of any
                     consequence to keep it,â€”lying, since the hour when Adam hid himself and pleaded
                     nakedness, being rarely held a vice, except where deliberate or the act is done
                     on paper,9â€”Ernestin, returned from the Evelyns', and retired from
                     his mother, cooled very rapidly, and began to ask himself what ground he had
                     for so much happiness. He remembered that no lady had ever cheerfully introduced him to another of
                     her sex whom she suspected to be more attractive in the points in which she
                     herself laid claim to admiration. If she were conversable, she introduced him,
                     in defiance of his evident reluctance, to a fool,â€”if young and handsome, she
                     listened not to his remonstrances, but led him to some stale and shrivelled
                     virgin; but the objects of his taste or fancy, these seemed always out of
                     reachâ€”except to his more accommodating sisters. He recalled to mind one
                     instance on another, where the favor of an introduction was volunteered, nay
                     pressed upon him, until he had expressed a wish for the acquaintance, and, as
                     he always did this warmly, then there always came excuses for not
                     complying.
                  Pondering this, and more to like effect, Ernestin felt very sure that Margaret
                     Evelyn would not keep her promise. In the first place, she would not probably
                     remember it; and, if she did, his manner, in soliciting the favor, had been too
                     animated. To gain his point, he should have known how to dissemble. But craft
                     and cunning, though teachable like other moral qualities, are not, any more
                     than other moral qualities, acquirable in practice: they are born in a man, and
                     neither observation, nor knowledge of the world, nor penury, nor danger, can
                     make them habits of his character. Margaret knew that Ernestin was nothing to
                     her otherwise than as a friend, and she was besides of a simple, sincere, and
                     amiable nature; but she belonged to a family that were all more or less
                     good-looking, and in the very point in which Agnes Elphinstone was most
                     remarkable, the eyes, she was herself quite handsome. And there was that fool
                     Ernestin, with his rapid tongue and speaking looks, avowing his admiration of a
                     younger girl, as if that were the way to recommend them both to her good
                     offices!
                  "Mamma," said Ernestin, "I have been discreet, as you desired," (wonderfully
                     so, certainly!) "and, you see, I am no nearer to my wishes than I was before.
                     There is no use in waiting for Margaret Evelyn. And besides, they may not go
                     there in a year! What will she think of me!" (he meant Agnes; but he did not
                     name her.) "It drives me almost mad, when I know that she must hold me to be
                     spiritless, or worse."
                  "What is that?" said his mother. He stopped; for he was walking up and down her
                     bedroom rapidly.
                  "Why a male flirt, to be sure. I have gone too far, not to have gone further;
                     and I only regret that I did not do so at once. I will now address her in the
                     public street."
                  "You will?"
                  "I will."
                  And he did.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER III.
                  THE ASSAULT.
                  THE weather was still cold; the ice was yet upon the ground. It was a fine
                     morning, and the sun was shining tolerably clear for England, when the student
                     saw the lady of his heart's longing pass directly under his window.
                  The student's eyes were always in their post, true sentinels to his brain. But
                     his blood was a mutinous one, and, when the insurrection was at its height,
                     prudence beat to arms in vain. He sees plainly that Agnes is in a hurry, that
                     she does not wish for him to join her, and he knows enough of women (he had
                     been unhappily a careful scholar) not to expect a welcome when they are not in
                     the humor. But he has made up his mind; and his hat and cloak are on the pegs
                     beside him.
                  How his heart beats as he comes near her! She evidently has no idea of his
                     approach. He is at her shoulder; yet she shows no sign. And now the artist sees
                     that she is short; he had made no allowance for perspective: and the
                     disappointment cools him sensibly. But he is in for it. He looks under the
                     lady's veiled bonnet.
                  "Pardon my presumption, Miss Elphinstone," begins Ernestin; and his voice is
                     much more timid than his action.
                  The lady stops instantly and faces him, looks but very little frightened, and
                     the sweetest voice in the world, from the reddest lips in England, says very
                     gently, but without confusion, "Whom have I the pleasure of speaking to?"
                  The voice was the very voice of Imogen! and the face too wasâ€”or he fancied soâ€”a
                     little like hers; but they touched him not; they seemed both to want soul; and
                     the coolness of the question that interrupted him, so different from what he
                     expected, finished the work of disappointment, and put a man, who was certainly
                     not the steadiest in the United Kingdom, completely off his balance.
                  "Mr. Fitzherbert." Then he corrects himself: "Ernestin Fitzherbert." And then,
                     with the sense of the ridiculousness of styling himself Mister to
                        her pressing upon him, he makes it more ridiculous by adding,
                     "Mr. Ernestin Fitzherbert." And it is all said in a breath, and the office of
                     speaker and of censor is performed at one time in his mind, and Agnes is
                     looking him full in the eyes, and he feels, also in the same rapid instant,
                     that she must think him a fool, and he becomes still more embarrassed, which of
                     course makes her still more composed, as her composure reacts on him, and
                     finishes his discomfiture. He even begins to talk about his character! But the
                     very desperateness of the occasion restores him to his senses, and, swallowing
                     the absurdity, he hastens to continue,â€”fearing to give her time to think, lest
                     she should leave him. "I have sought in vain, Miss Elphinstone, for an
                     introduction to youâ€” For pity's sake, do not stand in the street! a hundred
                     eyes are on us."
                  There was emotion in this abrupt appeal. And it had its effect. The lady
                     turned, and walked on slowly, Ernestin beside her, stooping low, and doubtful
                     whether to think himself happy or miserable. "O why were you not at the
                     Evelyns' the other night? I was so sure that I should see you there!"â€” She interrupted him
                     again; which was a pity; for only such romantic gentlemen as himself can know
                     what he would have added, and Agnes may have missed a scene. But perhaps Agnes
                     did not read romances.
                  "If you wish to see me, sir," she said, half turning, but without looking at
                     him, "you must come to the house." And she quickened her step so as to throw
                     him behind her.
                  Would any one believe that a man of sense, that had seen any thing of society,
                     would answer this by saying, "Would you be happy to see me?" Yet Ernestin
                     Fitzherbert did, and Ernestin Fitzherbert was a man of sense. No doubt he was
                     dreaming, and had tacked to her invitation what he thought was the proper
                     postscript: Come to our house, Mr. Fitzherbert; I shall be happy
                     to see you! Agnes did not laugh in his face; but if she had laughed, though it
                     would have cured him of his passion, he could not have wondered, for he was
                     instantly conscious of his fatuity.
                  Coloring to the roots of his hair,â€”while she answered, without looking at him
                     or stopping, "I am always happy to see any gentlemen, that are known to
                     me,"â€”and quickening his own step to come up with her, which, with his long and
                     heavy foreign cloak about him, was not an act of grace, he exclaimed earnestly,
                     "Do hear me!"â€”
                  Agnes again stopped short; but it was not to hear him. She looked rather saucy;
                     more as a man, and not a very amiable one either, who would brow-beat an
                     inferior, or face down presumption, or check the intrusion of an unfashionable
                     acquaintance, than as a timid and gentle maiden repelling the solicitations of
                     a lover. I do not mean to say that she looked haughty; Ernestin's proud blood
                     would not have brooked that; but with something, just the slightest dash in the
                     world, of that air of mixed decision, boldness, and mischievous humor, which is
                     commonly met with in conceited upstarts and the narrow-minded minions of
                     fashion, but in the perfection of effrontery is the national characteristic of
                     the low Irish; in a word, saucy. The manner, which had a rapid
                     effect on Ernestin's admiration, was however a little softened and redeemed by
                     something which she said more feminineâ€”"that she could not permit"â€” Ernestin
                     was afraid to let her finish.
                  "You cannot suppose, Miss Agnes Elphinstone, that I would venture so far, had I
                     any hope of knowing you in any other manner. I haveâ€” But do move on! for your
                     own sake! It is not right that you should be seen in this position with
                     me!"
                  She did as he adjured her; and, as they turned together, Ernestin saw before
                     him, on the opposite side of a wide street which crossed but a few steps off
                     the one they now were in, two young men of gentlemanly appearance, who were
                     amusing themselves with the scene as they walked, and putting, no doubt, the
                     worst construction upon it.
                  Ernestin resumed. "I have thought of renewing a brief acquaintance I had with
                     your friend, Miss Sumner"â€”
                  "Yes," said the soft, sweet voice.
                  "Do you know the Savilles?"
                  "No," said the soft, sweet voice. They were just at this moment, having passed
                     the wider street, arrived at the head of another, and Agnes stood still, and
                     again faced her uninvited companion, who continued:
                  "There is another hope gone. I saw you and your mother, at least a lady I
                     supposed to be your mother, going directly towards Lady Saville's, and I
                     thought that you would surely know
                     them." Agnes backed a little. "Miss Margaret Evelyn has declined to take me to
                     see you; but she has promised that some time when you and your sisters shall
                     pass the evening at her house, she will send for me." This Ernestin threw out
                     as a hint, and by premeditated design. Agnes continued to retreat, slowly, as
                     if she did not wish to offend him, yet half turning her back upon him, so that
                     at last he could not avoid leaving her, which he did without bowing.
                  It was a characteristic of Ernestin's, which I have observed before, or
                     intimated, that he wore his heart too near his lips. What he had long and
                     fondly pondered he was sure to speak of, however improper the occasion, and
                     uncalled-for or even rash the confidence. The double disappointment he had
                     experienced at the Evelyns', of seeing neither Agnes nor her friend, Miss
                     Sumner, and the plan he had long cherished of renewing an acquaintance, which,
                     in itself desirable, promised him the surest opportunity of knowing the
                     Elphinstones; this, and perhaps the wish to have Agnes speak of him to her
                     friend, who must know something of him through the Evelyns, brought to his lips
                     a name, the mere mentioning of which, in the manner he did, was the actual
                     though insignificant cause of all his subsequent trouble. At the very moment
                     that he spoke he felt confused, and his cheeks burned; for he had no right to
                     speak of Miss Sumner as an acquaintance, and that he did so might, under Agnes'
                     unconscious misrepresentation, bring him under the imputation of falsehood or
                     impudence. As for Lady Saville, he learned afterward, when too late, that she
                     was a distant relative of Agnes' mother, though there was no intercourse
                     between the families. But with Lady Saville's extensive acquaintance, nothing
                     could have been easier than to procure the introduction he so ardently
                     desired.
                  But to return.â€”Scarcely had he crossed the street, before indignation succeeded
                     to mortification and disappointment; and not without some cause. Indeed,
                     neither of them had made due allowance for the other. Agnes forgot she had
                     encouraged Ernestin to this step; and Ernestin forgot that Agnes was a woman;
                     that therefore he could not expect frankness on her part; while he had no time
                     to reflect, that if her manner was not respectful, it certainly was not
                     insulting, and was any thing but repulsive. Hurrying back, he overtook her. The
                     street was solitary, and the houses infrequent.
                  "Miss Agnes Elphinstone," said Ernestin, in a most decided manner, and still
                     more passionate than decided, while the haste he had made combined with his
                     emotion to quicken his breathing, so that his voice was interrupted,â€”"I have
                     yet something left to sayâ€”which I must say. I see what impels you to this
                     conduct. You are proud. I too am proud; and my pride perhaps is greater than
                     your own. It has been outraged to find you have betrayed me to your sisters,
                     who have made of my passion a subject of amusement, if not of ridicule. I have
                     now to beg that you will not be so cruel, so unjust, as to repeat any thing I
                     have this day said to you. I adjure you not to so dishonor me who have never
                     treated you with disrespect. Do not stop; I cannot disgrace you by walking
                     beside you, and it will not be for long."
                  Agnes walked slowly, and with downcast head; and this docility,â€”probably the
                     result of a natural reaction in her feelings when he had quit her,â€”perhaps the
                     mere consequence of his violence, the yielding of a weaker to a stronger
                     temper,â€”perhaps again the mere effect of a desire to know what he had left to
                     say,â€”somewhat mollified the lover. Moreover, if she did not promise she would not again betray him, she had
                     not denied the charge; and this to Ernestin, to whom a lie of any sort was so
                     odious, was much. But he still spoke passionately, if not angrily.
                  "The unequivocal admiration I have so long shown for you, you have been aware
                     of from the first; and it has been as respectful as open. Were you a princess,
                     it could not have been more so. Had you been an object that I courted par amours" (Ernestin's heart was again upon his
                     lips, and betrayed him into impropriety), "I should have known how to speak
                     before this. And, as it was, it has enraged me to think I must have appeared to
                     you less than a man. But, with the serious feelings with which I regarded you,
                     I could not be too cautious, for your sake as for my own; for I knew nothing of
                     you, not even for some time your name."
                  Agnes still walked on, and Ernestin still walked beside her. How could he, he
                     with whom resentment was always the shortest-lived of emotions, how could he
                     but return to all his gentler feelings!
                  "For your sake only," he continued, his tone gradually softening, "I have gone
                     again into society; and I thought myself the happiest of men, when I was
                     invited by the Evelyns, and told you would be there. It seemed as if my destiny
                     had ordered it so. I could scarcely contain myself; I ran the whole way home,
                     as if I were mad or were but a boy. Had I been on horseback" (the heart again),
                     "I must infallibly have broke my neck. For three entire days and nights I
                     scarcely rested; I was almost frenzied with excitement." Agnes showed symptoms
                     of stopping; and Ernestin, hurt to the soul, changed again his tone.
                  "I will be brief, madam." She has stopped, and his resentment is rekindled. "It
                     is enough that I do not please you. Henceforth I will act more wisely. I will
                     shut up my blinds"â€”- He has his eyes bent upon her face, which he studies
                     intently, even while he talks, and talks so angrily. Agnes has not lifted up
                     her veil,â€”which is a black one, of that open kind that gives a dazzling
                     clearness and softness to the complexionâ€”glazing the carnations, as the
                     painter-lover might have termed it. But what is thus gained in brilliancy is
                     more than counterbalanced, in Ernestin's regard, by the loss of style, which
                     such a veil occasions. The face itself does not appear so fine as he has
                     thought it; for the hair, which owing to some effect of the atmosphere looks
                     rather yellow than light brown, as it truly was, is knotted up at the temples
                     in little stiff curlsâ€”a mode that Ernestin detests; and thus the oval contour
                     is sacrificed. The eyes too, though singularly clear and transparent, telling
                     of youth, and health, and innocence, had lost in the unbecoming light the
                     beauty they derived from the admixture of colors, and showed every tint
                     distinct and pale. The artist saw in an instant whence they obtained their
                     singular power; but the lover was disappointed; the more so, that they seemed
                     devoid of sentiment. And so too did the lips,â€”though, like the eyes, they
                     satisfied the physiologist, they were of so deep and rich a red, so smooth and
                     yet so dry. You would have sworn they never had been touched by any male but a
                     parent or a brother, and, though you might have been mistaken, you could not
                     have been considered rash. And now, as the imprudent lover, quite beside
                     himself, tells Agnes he abandons the pursuit, a shade of uneasiness passes over
                     her face, and the air of quasi-sauciness gives place to one of more
                     sedateness.â€”"I will return to my study, which I have too long deserted, and you
                     shall be to me as if you had not
                     been. Farewell, Miss Elphinstone. Forget Ernestin Fitzherbert, and all that he
                     has said to you."
                  As the student said thisâ€”not angrilyâ€”but gravely, slowly, and impressivelyâ€”the
                     beautiful mouth of Agnes, who herself had become quite serious, quivered for an
                     instant, while the eyes sympathized with the movement and looked uneasy. But,
                     as Ernestin was not a coxcomb, he did not therefore think she was in love with
                     him; for he had seen precisely such a spasm more than once in the lips of other
                     women, when he had bitterly reproached or had piqued them and they durst not or
                     could not answer. And he thought right. It was in fact nothing but the
                     convulsion of wounded self-love; for Agnes cared no more for him, than nine
                     hundred and ninety-nine young women out of every thousand do for their future
                     partners, when they make ready to vow to love, honor, and obey them as their
                     lords. He looked her steadily in the face, as she stood before him motionless,
                     touched his hat stiffly, but did not lift itâ€”for he saw she did not mean to
                     return his courtesy, and, backing a step or two, turned about, and took the
                     nearest way home.
                  I have spoken of Agnes' first manner, as it appeared to Ernestin himself; but I
                     am inclined to think it was like many other appearances, somewhat deceptive.
                     She could not look tender, for she did not love him; she did not look serious,
                     for she feared it would repel him; and if there were something more in her
                     smile than the mere wish to show she was not angry, it was not very
                     inexcusable, for the lover's earnestness, to a girl whom it could not frighten,
                     and whom it did not move, must have appeared rather ludicrous. So that with
                     this combination or opposition of feelings, desirous not to seem too yielding,
                     and anxious lest she should not yield enough, if Agnes did look a little saucy, it might have been, that the unsteadiness of her sensations
                     would not allow her to look grave, and she was too honest and too gentle, or
                     too innocent and inexperienced, to look angry.
                  The first thing Ernestin did, when he got home, was to consult the mirror; and
                     being assured by that explicit oracle, that, if he often had appeared to more
                     advantage, it had known him to appear to less, he went deliberately and drew
                     close the laths of all the blinds, not without a perfect perception of the
                     ridiculousness and boyishness, or even girlishness, of the action. But he had
                     said he would; and so he did. Had he been still more of an ass, and told her he
                     would go back and hang himself, though no doubt, with the wiser second thought
                     of Walsh's lover at the precipice, he would have saved his neck,10 I
                     am very sure he would have felt it for a wicked purpose.
                  Jephthah was just such another foolâ€”that is, speaking with the notions of the
                     world. In my own heart and head, I really think and feel, with Ernestin, that a
                     fool of such a sort is far better than a liar of any.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  AGNES AT HOME.
                  WHEN Agnes got home, she found herself not solitary like the student, but in
                     the midst of mother, aunt, and sisters. So the first thing she did was to say,
                     "Oh dear!" then, "I have had"â€” Then she went to the glass; and, as the shaded
                     light of the room gave back to her resplendent eyes their known effulgence, she
                     broke into the prettiest little laugh in the world. Then she took another gaze,
                     expanding the already ample arch of the lids; and undoing the knotted locks of
                     her hair, she turned them round her fingers in that pretty way which women
                     have, and let them fall in a wavy sweep over her cheeks now flushed with
                     excitement. Why was not Ernestin behind her? So perhaps Agnes too reflected;
                     for her eyes flashed triumphantly as she still gazed, and again she
                     laughed,â€”and so happily!
                  Agnes!" said her mother, gravely, "Are you beside yourself?"
                  "I have had!"â€” said Agnes. "O dear me!" And she laughed again, and sat down to
                     take breath.
                  "What?" cried a plurality of voices.
                  "Somebody beside me." And she laughed a fourth time.
                  "Not your schoolmadam, I presume," said her dignified fied mother, with
                     displeasure; "for I see you are a child again."
                  "O no indeed! Dear mamma! do not be angry! I have hadâ€”Do guess! won't you,
                     somebody?"
                  "Not Mr. ?"â€”said the eldest sister.
                  "Yes, Mr."â€”returned Agnes. And she now laid down her hat, and shook her pretty
                     head, while the freed ringlets danced, and seemed to say exultingly, Ernestin, you unlucky dog! why are you not here?
                  "Not Mr. Fitzherbert?" continued the sister, rapidly.
                  "Mr.â€”Ernestinâ€”Fitzherbert," answered Agnes, slowly. And then she laughed a
                     fifth time, and drew the ringlets on her right cheek caressingly through her
                     fingers. Unlucky Ernestin!
                  "And do you laugh at that?" said her mother, angrily; and even the quiet aunt
                     now looked displeased.
                  "Yes, mamma," said Agnes; "for he is the oddest man!"
                  "The boldest, I suppose you mean."
                  "Perhaps so," said Agnes. "Butâ€”" and she paused, musingly, a momentâ€”"I forgive
                     him."
                  "Leave that to me, if you please," resumed her mother. "And now tell us,
                     plainly if you can,â€”what is this discreditable affair?"
                  "You know, mamma, Mr. Fitzherbert has"â€”Agnes stammered, and looked down; for
                     something near her conscience added, Agnes has.
                  "Has made you think you were worth his admiration; but perhaps, were he to see
                     you now, he would change his mind."
                  "I am afraid he has changed his mind already," said Agnes, gravely; there being
                     no looking-glass now before her, save that of memory.
                  
                  "Afraid? Really, Agnes, considering who you are, you are very humble."
                  "Dear me, mamma, I thoughtâ€”you did not disapprove?"â€”
                  "Mr. Fitzherbert's family I do not disapprove of, Mr. Fitzherbert's character I
                     do not disapprove of, but Mr. Fitzherbert's manner of courtship, if such it be,
                     I should not think even my second daughter would approve of, or I have not been
                     able to give her the breeding which I sought to, and which my mother gave to
                     me."
                  Poor Agnes wept. And the aunt, who loved her dearly, and admired her perhaps
                     nearly as much as Ernestin, went good-naturedly to her, and sitting beside her,
                     said to Mrs. Elphinstone, "Leave it to me, sister. Poor child, she is hurt to
                     think you should doubt her propriety."
                  "I am sure, aunt, I am not to blame."â€”Take care, Agnes!â€” Did conscience say so
                     too? for she did not finish.
                  "I hope not," resumed the aunt. "But let us hear, that we may judge. Mr.
                     Fitzherbert has spoken to you;â€”in the street, do you mean to tell us?"
                  Agnes hesitated. But there was no other way of telling her story. So, after a
                     moment or two, in the midst of a profound silence, her mother looking on her
                     very steadily and gravely, she began anew.
                  "He had expected to meet me at the Evelyns'â€”and, in his disappointment, and
                     despairingâ€”I mean, not knowing how, to obtain an introduction, he took the
                     liberty to address me in the street; for which he asked my pardon very
                     humbly."
                  "But not as if he thought he were doing any thing very criminal," interposed
                     the aunt smilingly.
                  "Why no," said Agnes; and she smiled in turn, and looked like a seraph newly
                     plumed.â€”Certainly, Ernestin was an unlucky fellow.
                  Mrs. Elphinstone resumed,â€”still seriously; for even a woman less proud would
                     have felt uneasy and displeased:â€”"But he must know somebody, surely, who could
                     give him the introduction he affects to desire."
                  "O yes," said Agnes eagerly; "he knows Constance."
                  "Then his course is a plain one; and he is old enough to know it. Let Mr.
                     Fitzherbert come here, my child; and it is before me, not in the street, that
                     he must woo you."
                  "So I told him, mamma."
                  "You did?" cried the elder sister. "Really, Mr. Ernestin Fitzherbert must be a
                     very bashful lover!"
                  "Gertrude," said Agnes, nettled at the palpable insinuation, "it is your fault,
                     if I did wrong. I had heard you say so often, If he wants to see
                     you, let him come to the house, that it was upon my mind, and I repeated it in
                     your very words. I do not see any thing so very forward in that, nor what else
                     I could do, unless I insulted him, which I had no right to do."
                  "Is he handsome?" inquired Gertrude.
                  "No," replied Agnes, a very little, in the slightest perceptible degree,
                     confused; "his eyes looked red, and his whiskers looked yellow."
                  "And, I suppose, his cheeks had a tinge of blue," rejoined the elder sister,
                     glancing significantly at Agnes' own cheek, where a spot, not blue, but
                     crimson, was now distinctly visible."
                  "I had better retire," said Agnes, rising indignantly; "for you only question
                     me to mock me."
                  "Not yet," said Mrs. Elphinstone, mildly, yet firmly. "It is I that question you, not Gertrude. It
                     would have been better for yourself, and more proper as respects Mr.
                     Fitzherbert, to have spoken to me in private; but, since you have been so
                     indiscreet, you will please to answer further. Is that all, my child?"
                  Agnes resumed her seat. "No, mamma. He would follow me, and became quite angry
                     that I would not let him walk beside me. And then"â€” And so the beautiful
                     creature went on to tell the whole adventure, which she was really quite as
                     anxious to repeat, as her friends to hear. Ernestin's appeal to her generosity,
                     to her justice, went for nothing,â€”as he himself saw, at the time, it would. Not
                     a word, not a gesture he had used, was forgotten; and though the dignified
                     mother still looked grave, and the good-natured aunt semi-serious, the sisters
                     found infinite amusement in laughing at the most ridiculous conduct for a man,
                     as they said, that they had ever heard of,â€”especially when Agnes told of his
                     threat to close his windows, which she had found, on her return, was fully
                     executed.
                  The inexperienced and imprudent girl had, in the fulness of her heart, or, more
                     strictly, under the impulsion of her vanity, been so indiscreet as to speak of
                     Ernestin's window-courtship before her brothers. And now she reaped the fruits
                     of it in her own vexation. Her eldest brother, a lad a little younger than
                     herself, had entered the room just in time to gather the pith of Agnes' story,
                     and exclaimed, at the close, "It was very impertinent in him!"
                  "It was no such thing," said Agnes, quite irritated. "His manner was as
                     respectful as if I were a princess. And you have no business with it,
                     Eldon."
                  "Haven't I!" cried the youth. "If I were a little older, I might perhaps make
                     it my business."
                  "And make a great fool of yourself," said Agnes, tartly. "What is it to you?
                     you did not see him. And if he were presuming"â€”
                  "I dare say he had good cause," said Eldon, scornfully.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER V.
                  THE SICK MUSE.
                  ERNESTIN too had his confidant; and one only; his mother. And, as we have seen,
                     he had, or thought he had, cause to repent of having made even that one.
                     Probably it was not done from duty and affection, as he flattered himself, but
                     from a habit of unburthening all his feelings, which made him restless under
                     their weight, and for the dear delight of talking on a darling theme. If so,
                     the amorist was doubly disappointed; for the relief he obtained was but
                     partial, and the pleasure was invariably short-lived.
                  On the present occasion, his confidant, to his surprise, took sides with Agnes;
                     but she did it so gravely, yet so gently, that he saw directly it was not from
                     a spirit of opposition, or, if that were the remote and predisposing impulse,
                     like his own habit of communicativeness, there was perfect sincerity and
                     deliberation in the act.
                  Of her own accord, the next day, she took an opportunity to repeat her opinion.
                     It called up all the student's irritation, not at his mother, but at his
                     mistress. "You don't see how she could have acted otherwise?" he exclaimed,
                     gazing in his mother's still handsome face with absolute incredulity, but
                     meeting there only a look of perfect candor.
                  "No; I should have been frightened to death."
                  "And that would have pleased me better. But so cool! and with that sweet voice
                     of hersâ€”so unshaken! Whom have I the pleasure of speaking to?
                     [mimicking]â€”The little hypocrite!" There was a tone of satisfaction in
                     Ernestin's invective, that showed the memory of the sweet voice, and perhaps of
                     the sweet lips, was too pleasant even for his hatred of deceit to embitter.
                  "But it was certainly politely said, Ernestin."
                  "Politely! I only wish I had been prepared for such politeness! I would have
                     answered more to the purpose than I did." His mother replied not, but looked
                     inquiringly; and Ernestin continued, "I would have answered, To a
                     fool, madam; who has now the honor of bidding you farewell." And suiting his
                     action to the word, Ernestin left his mother's bedroom, and went through the
                     connecting passage to his study.
                  We have already exposed the infirmity of our student in expecting, in defiance
                     of nature, the same measure of affectionateness in others which he had himself.
                     This unreasonable exaction he applied to other qualities; and it neutralized,
                     or nearly so, all his real and singular amiability. Yet was he then himself
                     free of faults? No, for he were not human; and not to be conscious of his
                     infirmity, he were not wise. Ernestin saw his weaknesses too plainly; but they
                     were not the weaknesses of other people: they were not selfish, nor deceitful,
                     nor malignant; they harmed himself, but did no wrong nor threatened it to
                     others. Such he had had sympathy with; but such he met not; and his hatred of
                     falsehood, treachery, deceit, and all the little or malignant passions from
                     which he was so singularly exempt, increased day by day, and made him
                     intolerant of all who were in any way spotted with them. And where were those
                     who were not so, more or less? Alas!
                     they were in the grave; and their memories were all he had of truth and
                     generosity to be companions to his own.
                  Ernestin should have remembered that truth was not deemed a necessity in
                     society; for where was it taught save in his own books? And them no one read.
                     To cheat one's parents, to extricate oneself from difficulties by craft, to
                     save one's reputation by mean evasion or by barefaced lying, to meet the demand
                     of a starving tradesman with buffoonery, or to answer it by dishonorable
                     pretexts or with heartless impudence, in fine to cover wickedness with wit and
                     make integrity ridiculous by dullness, these were the moralities of plays and
                     novels, taught in the prose and poetry of daily reading and inculcated by the
                     hourly practice of those who are involuntary models for the young. The wisdom
                     of the Odyssey and of the Arabian Nights; alas! the wisdom taught in the
                     example of Jacob; this is handed down unmutilated, and finds natural disciples
                     where high integrity and unbending pride of honor are scouted as romance.
                  But Ernestin thought on the evidently gentle andâ€”was he sure of this? (for
                     docility and gentleness are by no means one)â€”the docile nature of Agnes; he
                     recalled to mind the noble outline of her profile, and the artlessness and
                     innocence of her mouth, whose configuration was of a kind he had never seen
                     except in ingenuous characters; and remembering her youth, he said to himself:
                     It is the error of her education; I could mold her to a better standard were
                     she mine.
                  With such and similar reflections, what availed it him he no more watched to
                     see her beauty? His study has become a prison. All day he sits upon his sofa,
                     dreamily feeding on the loved idea. He has no heart to recommence mence his
                     labors as an artist; to resume his tragedy he dares not, for the briefest
                     attempt renews the suffering of his brain. O infirm of purpose! enervate votary
                     of beauty and of love! the pains that fright him from his duty have no terrors
                     for his pleasure. Though to think on Agnes almost drives him wild, he does
                     nothing else; and he even dares invoke the neglected muse, that through her he
                     may tell his deity of his hourly heart's-sacrifice.
                  In fact, Ernestin now took to his amorous verses with a more serious purpose
                     than before, resolved firmly, that she should see and read, if she would not
                     receive from his lips, the story of his passion. But alas! the will was greater
                     than the power, or, in the apostle's phrase, the spirit was strong, but the
                     flesh was weak; for his overtasked brain could not obey, without a torture that
                     was perilous, the suggestions of its presiding spirit; and he was forced to
                     drop his pen at every couplet or quatrain.
                  The sonnets therefore, that follow, have the defect of the Archbishop's sermon;
                     they smack of apoplexy.
                  
                     I.
                     Shut up the lattice? fly the fatal spot
                     Where my heart drank its poison, and drinks still?
                     'Tis done! 'Twas but an effort of the will.
                     But can the mind what is make what is not?
                     Back to my lonely study have I got,
                     Yet find no solace, but increase of ill;
                     For memory leans above the wonted sill,
                     And the mind's eyes leave not a trait forgot.
                     In vain the unfinish'd pictures on me glare,
                     Or smile sad pity of my wasted hours;
                     In vain the tragic muse recalls my care,
                     And Fate reproaches my neglected powers:
                     For fancied woes what tears have we to spare,
                     When real anguish of the heart is ours?
                  
                  
                  
                     II.
                     I look around me. Was it all a dream?
                     Methought, ere this, herself would press that chair,
                     Seated before me; while her sunny hair,
                     Her eyes that like the stars at midnight beam,
                     Would lifelike on my radiant canvas gleam,
                     And make a portraiture beyond compare.
                     How could I fail, when Love would aid me there,
                     And the dull walls a paradise would seem?
                     Wo's me, my sisters! look not from the sky
                     So mournful on me, that I still defer
                     Your half-form'd images. Why should I try
                     Pencil or chisel, when I needs must err?
                     In memory alone your models lie,
                     And memory now is but one dream of her.
                  
                  
                     III.
                     Have mercy, GOD! forgive my wasted hours!
                     Is it such sin, to indulge a loving heart?
                     If in Thy gifts Thou hast given me mental powers,
                     Didst Thou not too a tender soul impart?
                     Thou canst not deem it evil, Thou Who art
                     Thyself all love, that now, while Fortune lowers
                     Gloomily on my path, and Sorrow showers
                     Her rain and hail, where sunshine has no part,
                     I yearn for sympathy, for some fond breast
                     That beats in unison with mine alone.
                     Grant me this, FATHER! Yet Thou knowest best,
                     And Thy weak children seek what they should shun.
                     I bow submiss, whatever Thy behest:
                     Not mine, O FATHER! but Thy will be done!
                  
                  It were supererogation to comment upon these pieces. With all their feebleness,
                     they are more truly ethographical perhaps, than any thing we have said in prose
                     in delineation of the poet's feelings and character under the influence of his
                     heaven-prompted passion. The accents of Truth are ever unmistakable; and even
                     they who worship her not, acknowledge on the instant the presence of her
                     divinity.
                  In its proper place, we shall give one other and imperfect sonnet, which, with
                     these, is, of a series that their author purposed should be much more
                     extensive, all that he had strength to complete or to attempt, before the
                     occurrence of circumstances, which, restoring for a time his energies, took
                     away all motive for wasting them on such profitless and unelevated songs as
                     these.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  ST. LUKE'S BY NIGHT.
                  WHO does not see what will be the result of such a state of mind in Ernestin as
                     his own words describe? One does not learn to forget a mistress, by meditating
                     on her; and when one finds he has been unreasonable in mortifying his desires,
                     it is wonderful what a votary of wisdom he becomes, and how eagerly he seeks to
                     be restored to her protection. The closet window, I foresee, will not be long
                     unopened. Am I deceived? or is not this bearded, full-grown man actually
                     peeping even now through the blinds? O Jephthah!â€”But thou hadst not to
                     sacrifice thy own desires, but thy flesh and bloodâ€”which is easier.
                  One Sunday evening, a certain Honorable and Reverend gentleman, whose eloquence
                     had made some noise in the metropolis, was expected to preach in the new church
                     at Chelsea; and Ernestin, who, in his newly-awakened religious feelings, had
                     intended to go to town to hear a Scotch divine, equally famous in his sect,
                     suddenly changed his mind, and proceeded to St. Luke's. Agnes by candlelight!
                     He had been more than mortal, or less than a lover, had he resisted the
                     temptation.
                  The church was already nearly full. Ernestin looks up the nave, and sees,
                     regarding him, a Miss Carrington, a young lady whose family was the only one,
                     with the exception of that of the rector of his church, he had ever visited in
                     Chelsea. She was a good girl, and therefore much liked of our student, who, at
                     the beck of her father, a man he almost loved because of his manner and
                     disposition, took his seat in a pew before them, and immediately, carried away
                     as usual by his vivacity, commenced talking to her with more animation than
                     proprietyâ€”though of course in an under tone.
                  The service soon commences, and Ernestin, looking over and through the dense
                     mass of heads before him, searches in vain, despite his stature, for the
                     Elphinstones. And now, made restless by the excitement of his nerves, produced
                     by expectation and his talk with the lady behind him, he repents of his
                     position; for the preacher does not please him, yet in decency he cannot go
                     out. But time moves on, even for the restless and impatient; and Ernestin, the
                     sermon over, sees, as he moves to the door with Miss Carrington, the
                     Elphinstones approaching from the aisle. But Agnes is not of them.
                  At the door, the sisters stop, with the apparent purpose of speaking to his
                     companion. By what contrariety in the lover's disposition is it then, that now
                     that he has, notwithstanding the occasion and the place, a most unlooked-for
                     opportunity of effecting the long-desired introduction, he acts in such a
                     mannerâ€”continuing with increased briskness his solo, while the lady with him
                     put not in one noteâ€”that the eldest sister, who had moved a step toward them,
                     falls back again, and his fair companion, who had half stopped, moves on? He
                     was, in fact, as some men are when under the influence of wine; for he seemed
                     to himself to be at home with Agnes, and he felt that all he did would be
                     carried home to Agnes; and so, to the great surprise, if not scandal of the
                     congregation, who saw a man of his age and figure conducting himself as if he were in a ball-room and not in
                     the vestibule of a temple, he passed into the open air, still by the side of
                     his Chelsea acquaintance, and talking at a rate she must have found it hard to
                     keep up with, unless the succession of her thoughts were as rapid as his
                     own.
                  Now if you suppose that Ernestin, with all his simplicity and perfect
                     frankness, was absolutely void of art, you suppose an impossibility. He was a
                     man who knew the heart and the world well, though acting habitually in defiance
                     of his knowledge. When therefore he saw, without turning his head, Agnes' aunt,
                     with the elder of her nephews, place herself hastily behind him and his party,
                     knowing that it was to listen to him and observe him, and feeling sure that
                     nothing that he said or did would be lost to Agnes, he determined instantly to
                     talk through them to Agnes.
                  And talk he did. Mr. Carrington, who was on the other side of his daughter,
                     must have thought him crazy; and the lady herself, did she number him among her
                     admirers, might, without any extraordinary vanity, have supposed that his
                     unexpected meeting with her was what had made him so superlatively happy. As
                     for the pair who in unbroken silence walked close behind them, he saw with the
                     corner of his eye, his face being turned toward his companion, the youth touch
                     his aunt with the elbow and glance with jealous disdain at Ernestin's cloak,
                     which in his excitement the student had got so curiously twisted about him that
                     his arms were impeded in the straitened folds. Coolly loosening the skirt upon
                     his left shoulder, Ernestin spread his mantle more gracefully, and while he
                     said to himself, The brother is no friend of mine, whatever be
                     the aunt, continued to talk on.
                  Now, he was in Heaven; then, on earth again, this moment, discoursing
                     philosophy; the next, lecturing on clairobscure (for the moon had risen and the
                     night was fine); and not from ostentation, nor even to inspire Agnes through
                     her friends with a good opinion of him, but simply to convey to her thus
                     indirectly what he could not otherwise: anon, without a pause to breathe, he
                     ascended to divinity, then, rapid as the skylark, fell plumb down into
                     nonsense, where he hopped about and fluttered quite at ease. And will it be
                     believed that he who had such reverence, such adoration I might say, for the
                     memory of his sisters, durst in the next breath speak of them in connection
                     with the mystery of a future state, for the sole purpose that Agnes might be
                     told that one of them had borne the same name as her own? He who with all his
                     religious awe could forget himself so greatly in the house of God, would not be
                     likely, notwithstanding his romantic delicacy, to remember the reserve that was
                     due to the sisters he had in his spirit sainted.
                  And so Ernestin continued to talk on, even when the Elphinstones, whose way
                     diverged from that of his own party, were no longer within hearing; not because
                     he was in the vein, but to disguise from his companions the true source of his
                     excitement. And this was in a single hour the second trait of duplicity, in a
                     man who abhorred it in whatever shape and under any pretext, and who lived in
                     constant, open, and dangerous contempt of even the most ordinary disguise of
                     both sentiment and motive! I consider it one of the chief evils that
                     countervail the moral advantages of the passion of love, that it teaches craft
                     and dissimulation even to the open and the single-minded. Nor is this in any
                     degree a result of what are called the artificial habits of society. Womenâ€”(it
                     is a more palpable illustration than to adduce the other sexâ€”) women in the savage state are as
                     counterfeit in their amorous tactics as the she-cat.
                  However, Ernestin went on his way, exulting in the thought that he was set down
                     as a fool or crackbrained by Agnes' family, and calculated, with the same
                     certainty as he would upon the foreknown result of any chemical operation, on
                     the flutter and doubt, and agitation in various forms, that their exaggerated
                     report would cause in the heart of the inexperienced virgin;â€”this, apart from
                     the information he contrived to insinuate as to his pursuits and his intended
                     movements. Nor think him empirical. He trusted more to the worry he should
                     cause her than to any respect he could inspire; for what he wanted was love,
                     which did not depend on him, and not esteem, which he knew he could create at
                     any time.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF IT.
                  AGNES was alone in the parlor. The returning party entered, full of excitement
                     and mischief.
                  "O if you knew what you have missed!" exclaimed the eldest sister.
                  "O, if you knew!" chimed in the youngest. "Guess whom we have
                     seen!"
                  Agnes said nothing. Her heart was up in her throat; how could she?
                  "Bah! it's not the elephant,"â€”said Eldon, contemptuously.
                  "No; but it's Agnes' lion,"â€”added the aunt good-humoredly.
                  "Why not say, monkey?" rejoined the youth.
                  Agnes' mouth did open now, spite of the heart which blocked the air-pipe, and
                     her eyes looked particularly brilliant; but, before she could speak, the aunt
                     again interposed.
                  "Because he is too long in the legs. Besides, my dear"â€”
                  â€”"He is not so much of a monkey as Eldon's self," interrupted Agnes, in
                     continuation.
                  "Then I never heard one chatter," said the youth, drawing off his gloves, and
                     flinging them into his hat by way of emphasis.
                  
                  "But do be quiet, Eldon," said the oldest sister, ere Agnes could again retort;
                     "and let us hear about the animal. We can then judge who has the more knowledge
                     of zoology."
                  "Aunt would not tell us, Agnes, nor let Eldon, till you were by,"â€”added the
                     youngest.
                  "And Agnes does not care to hear at all," said that young lady, moving towards
                     the door, but stopping halfway. (Doubtless, she could not go without a light.)
                     "Only Eldon has no right"â€”
                  "Who is but a boy, to call a man a monkey for being voluble," said the
                     aunt.
                  "No; but, I leave it to yourself, aunt, if you ever heard a man or boy talk
                     more at random."
                  "On the contrary, I never heard one talk with more design." All the party
                     looked surprised, except Agnes, who was wonderfully busy putting a ring
                     backward and forward on her finger. "Sit down all," said the good aunt,
                     "andâ€”Agnes, my dear, you are on my muff. It is the one you wore the day that
                     some one joined you. I won't lend it you again." This was said so
                     good-humoredly, that it restored Agnes' equanimity. Smiling, in spite of
                     herself, she went to the pier to lay the muff on the table, and continued to be
                     busy about it, while the aunt resumed: "I say that Mr. Fitzherbert talked as he
                     did from design, because he saw us behind him, and every thing said he thought
                     would be repeated to Agnes. I have therefore a great mind to disappoint
                     him."
                  "And so disappoint us all!" said Gertrude. "Do, dear aunt, go on!" Agnes was
                     still busied at the pier.
                  
                     
                        
                           "And when before your eyes she has set him,
                           If you don't find himâ€”fool, I'll eat him,"
                        
                      said Eldon. Agnes made no remark; but she moved to another part of the
                     room.
                  "You must sharpen your eye-teeth, my son," rejoined the aunt. "For thus I produce the beast. You must know, my dears, the creature walked
                     all the way home with Charlotte Carrington.â€”She is quite a pretty girl, Agnes."
                     Agnes bridled,â€”so proudly! "What eyes the darling has!" thought the admiring
                     aunt, wishing that Ernestin were by. But she went on. "He talked of the sermon
                     of course,â€”said he had meant to go to church elsewhere, which I am afraid was a
                     great storyâ€”for he said it certainly that somebody, which was not Miss
                     Charlotte Carrington, should not suppose he went to our church from
                     premeditation, to see her. From the sermon was a natural transition to
                     immortality, which he made by a prodigious leap,â€”he has very long legs, Agnes.
                     And then he said, he did not think he should be Ernestin Fitzherbert in another
                     world, nor his deceased and darling sisters would still be Ilda and still
                        Agnes." (Agnes colored; and the aunt smiled.) "Of course, he
                     did not say that with any design to let us know he had had a sister Agnes, whom
                     he had loved, and whose name was naturally very dear to him. And then, after a
                     deal of other matter"â€”
                  "Which was nonsense," said Eldon.
                  â€”"To those who did not understand it," continued the aunt, "he adverted to the
                     moonlight, and said he had so fine a prospect from his study windows; at which
                     Mr. Carrington laughed; and then he laughed in turn, and said the foreground
                     was stony it was true, but he had such charming distances for the study of
                     perspective; all of which was merely to let usâ€”no, to let somebody, understand
                     his usual place was not the front of the house. He then continued to say, how sorry he was to be
                     obliged to leave such a place, but that the landlord was about to convert the
                     whole row into shops, which he said was rather vexatious, as he had just been
                     painting with his own hand all the wood-work of his study, and that he had
                     meant to do the walls in the manner of Herculaneum, with designs therefrom, but
                     his mother had fortunately prevented a labor whose result he would not have
                     been permitted to enjoy. That for his partâ€”being here asked by Miss Charlotte,
                     when they intended to removeâ€”it was of little consequence, as he thought he
                     should go again to the Continent." Agnes' heart fluttered, as the sagacious
                     aunt knew it did, though she saw no outward sign,â€”the girl's back being towards
                     the circle, as she stood in a corner of the room turning over the leaves of a
                     book on a stand.
                  "Which showed he was a traveler of the very kind that disputed of the
                     chameleon,â€”'a proud, conceited, talking spark,'" said Eldon, fresh from his
                     verse-citation.
                  "Which showed no such thing," returned the aunt. "His eyes serve
                     him to better purpose, eh, Agnes? What he meant was merely to tell somebody he
                     was an artist."
                  "A poor devil, therefore," interposed the nephew.
                  "Perhaps so; but he did not say he was one by profession; perhaps merely to let
                     that same somebody know something about his occupations: further, that his time
                     was short in our neighborhood, perhaps in the country; that therefore, if
                     somebody cared that he should know her, she ought, I suppose, to spend an
                     evening at the Evelyns'."
                  "I shall do no such thing," said Agnes, turning round briskly, "if it is I you
                     mean, for I do not care. And aunt, if you have any more to tell of
                     his"â€”
                  "Impertinence," said Eldon.
                  "There was not much more said," hastily resumed the aunt, to save the peace;
                     "for we soon parted company. But he talked of a hundred things in the same
                     rapid and rambling way; yet all for you" (nodding to Agnes). "How he managed to
                     string them all together I don't know; but he did so."
                  "Any fool could do the like," said Eldon.
                  "That knew how," retorted Agnes; "which Eldon Elphinstone does not."
                  "Not being born a bead-maker, as perhaps your artist was."
                  Agnes bit her pretty lip. But all the things that she had heard of Ernestin she
                     kept, and pondered them in her heart.
                  "Agnes, my dear," said her aunt, going to the pier-table, and gathering up her
                     shawl and gloves,â€”"take up my bonnet, will you, as you have nothing to
                     carry?"
                  Agnes approached the pier. "Mr. Fitzherbert," said the good aunt, in her ear,
                     "loves you dearly. Never mind his windows."
                  Agnes, coloring like the rose, and raising her aunt's candlestick with one
                     hand, as she lifted with the other the bonnet, looked up into the glass before
                     her, and caught the blaze of two stars of the first magnitude, that sparkled in
                     their reflected spheres with unclouded effulgence. And Agnes smiled.
                  
                     Loves me dearly, quoth the starlight.
                  
                     I believe it, said the smile.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  THE SHAVED HEAD.
                  THE next Sundayâ€”what a day of delight to Ernestin!â€”he sees Agnes going to
                     church in the morning unattended save by her little brother, and he manages to
                     go out with his mother in time to have the beauty cross the street directly
                     before him.
                  She did not look brilliant now, but she looked, what was far better to the
                     poet-lover's exacting heart, sad, subdued, and tender. The light of her eyes
                     was gone, there was no color in her cheeks, no smile upon her lips. She did not
                     turn away her head, she did not even appear embarrassed, but kept her eyes
                     steadily fixed on his until the whole breadth of the street, both roadway and
                     pavement, was gone over, he gazing at her as steadily, but far less tenderly.
                     They who had seen them would have supposed it was an old friend looking with
                     gentle and affectionate reproach on one long alienated, and whom she felt it no
                     departure from self-respect to endeavor to recall. "Do you indeed love me dearly?" her looks seemed to say, "and can you blame me, that I have
                     not been less nor more than woman?" The sole drawback to the lover's
                     satisfaction was that she did not seem to regard the presence of his mother; by
                     whom however the whole scene passed unnoticed; for Mrs. Fitzherbert, partly
                     from being a little near-sighted, was habitually unobservant of persons or
                     manners in the street. Ernestin merely told his mother, that the lady who had
                     passed was Agnes, and, finding that she had not observed her, said no more.
                  There is no reason now for keeping closed the blinds; for Ernestin regards, and
                     justly, the spirit of his declaration rather than its words. Besides I suspect,
                     as you have seen, that he has already paid too much attention to the words, to
                     the virtual violation of the spirit. Turn about is fair.
                  But it is in vain; Agnes comes no more. And Ernestin, who now indeed dearly
                     loves her, not because she loves himâ€”for that he does not believe, but because
                     he thinks she has a soul that might be taught to love him, Ernestin is sorely
                     troubled, troubled dangerously. With his worn and irritable nerves, with an
                     imagination that was only too prompt to suggest to him a thousand causes, and
                     each one distressful, Ernestin is fairly in a condition, that but for his
                     singularly elastic constitution, might be considered hopeless. He cannot now so
                     much as read a line without the most alarming pains; incapable of resuming his
                     pictures or his busts, labor which he well knew would be his restoration,
                     incapable, because he could not or was unwilling to drive from his mind the one
                     idea of Agnes, he passes his waking-hours in a state that is truly terrible,
                     but whose terror has a fascination for him that he cannot resist. And now he
                     has to resort to measures of relief which he had especial reasons at this time
                     to look upon with aversion; but he is too well read in pathology, not to know
                     their full necessity. So, with a sigh, Ernestin, Ernestin the artist, Ernestin
                     who is a very Apuleius in his admiration of the hair, shaves with his own hand
                     the back of his head, sparing with a fondness excusable in his situation all
                     that he could, and on the denuded place, a narrow handbreadth, applies a blister. Behind either
                     ear he puts a like application, and on his temples three or four leeches. It
                     would have done you good to see him look in the glass when all these appliances
                     were on him, gaze at the gorged bodies of the bloodsuckers, as they dangled
                     with a slimy undulation like ringlets on his cheeks, then think of Agnes and
                     her ringlets, and, imagining her looking on, laugh, but not aloud, at the
                     ridiculous figure he was presenting; for he was one of those men, as I have
                     already intimated, who, finding something of absurdity in almost every thing,
                     might laugh though they were dying.
                  But there was no sense of mortification to mingle with that of the ridiculous.
                     On the contrary, Ernestin thought with satisfaction, as he saw his pale thin
                     cheeks, his eyes shining with redoubled lustre, and looking, from his condition
                     and from the becoming artist-light of the room, dark and large as her own, his
                     handsome throat uncovered, and his long fine hair which, gathered behind his
                     ears, floated in rich brown masses over it, that Agnes as his wife would not
                     have cause for disappointment, since, as is often the case with men of his
                     pursuits whose style of feature is intellectual, he lost nothing by the undress
                     of his study, nor by the disarray of sickness, while his form was of that kind
                     to which recumbency is an attitude of elegance, and lounging one of grace.
                  Was not Ernestin then vain? Enough so. But his vanity was not the vanity of the
                     coxcomb. He would have been much more flattered, had he seen a judicious artist
                     looking at him admiringly, or enviously (in most cases it is much the same),
                     than a pretty woman; and as to believing that a woman could fall in love with
                     him for his person, you could not have beat it into him, as we have before
                     implied, not even in his better day. Agnes has just regarded him with a look of
                     tenderness. He is pleased with it, and loves her therefore more, because it
                     gives indication of a softer soul than he had feared that she possessed, but he
                     interprets it not as showing love for him, but for herself. And he interprets
                     truly.
                  Could such a man, a man too thoroughly and constantly self-disciplined not to
                     bridle natural vanity, could such a skeptic in the imputed proneness of the sex
                     to love, could Ernestin Fitzherbert, the philosopher though artist, and who saw
                     himself ever by the partial baldness he could not wholly hide, and the
                     deforming habiliments of a cheap tailor which his poverty compelled him to
                     indue, could in short the man I paint, poet though he was and amorist, suppose
                     that a girl so young as Agnes Elphinstone, and filled topful with conceit of
                     her own beauty, would measure his proportions, when nor art nor nature had lent
                     her any rule? With a widow, he had been more sure.
                  Ernestin, as I have said, trusted to none of this exterior, to win Agnes. He
                     trusted to his affectionate and self-sacrificing nature, to his integrity, his
                     frankness, his generosity,â€”in short, to all that had made him dear to his
                     sister Agnes, to win this second Agnes over; and I shall not be surprised, if,
                     when next they meet, he tells her as much, with other thoughts and fancies we
                     have ascribed to him in this chapter, including the romantic episode of the
                     shaved head and leeches.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  THE ORPHAN.
                  IT is the anniversary of the death-day of his sister Ilda,â€”a day he has
                     hitherto observed by fasting and by devotion to her memory. What is he doing
                     now? The little pile of letters tied about with a tress of her dark hair is not
                     now before him, he does not read the record of her single-hearted affection, no
                     kisses press the pages, nor the hair, no tears moisten his cheeks. He meditates
                     indeed; but it is not on her; and his absent gaze is on another object of the
                     memory. Alas! he has even forgotten the day! And now he takes up a pencil, and
                     he writes these lines. 
                        
                           Where art thou, Agnes? Shall I never more
                           See the dear eyes I love so? Know'st thou not,
                           I am not master of my wretched lot,
                           Nor can forego the strangeness I deplore?
                           O if thou knewest my heart, how weary sore
                           With its long watching! pining on the spot
                           Of its lost joys, its wounded pride forgot,
                           Conscious of this alone, that I adore!
                           Thou wouldst notâ€”
                        
                      He can no more. To indite another verse would kill him, orâ€”for death
                     affrights not men like him, deprive him of his reason.
                  But better as it is. Thus, in its imperfect state, the sonnet must have moved
                     her more, had she seen it, than any perfect picture of the suffering she has
                     unwittingly caused; else were she little worthy of a poet's love.
                  A poet's love! What is like it? It is the poet alone and artist that keep
                     forever lighted the heaven-kindled fire of love's lone altar. Sexual love
                     indeed is universal, and the affection that springs from sympathy and esteem,
                     from congeniality of tastes, or from the mere habit of intercourse which makes
                     a necessity of cohabitation, these prevail everywhere more or less, according
                     to persons and to circumstances; but that union of passion and sentiment, of
                     affection and desire, whose mother is beauty and whose sire is the soul, where
                     shall we seek for it, the embracing Cupid and Psyche of the heart, but in a
                     poet's love? Happy she who wins and can enjoy it! her life is beatitude; and
                     the odor of her beauty breathes unwasted in her lover's pages, eternal incense
                     from the altar of his heart that invites the homage of universal adoration in
                     the temple of the intellect.â€”So be it, sweet Agnes, with thy beauty, in this
                     chapel-shrine of mine!
                  Ernestin, it will be seen in his unfinished verse, supposed that Agnes had
                     become indignant at his neglect to obtain an introduction, not knowing that he
                     could not command it, or, in his own words, that "He was not master of his
                     wretched lot,â€”nor could forego the strangeness he deplored. "But to this
                     conceit, unpleasant as it was, succeeded an imagination much more painful, and
                     which rapidly expanded into an image of absolute horror. In the absence of
                     Agnes, it was always a pleasure to her lover to see any of those who were
                     connected with her; but not one of her family, male or female, had now been
                     visible for many days. Was Agnes sick? What need of more? The seed, that in a
                     poet's brain gives rise in an instant to the wondrous fancies whose
                     multitudinous and wide-spreading ing
                     branches cover the whole earth, and reach at times even to heaven, needs never
                     be bigger. Sometimes indeed, it is so small as to be altogether invisible.
                     Agnes is dying! And he who should be beside her cannot enter the door. And now
                     she asks to see him; and her mother sends for him. He is kneeling beside the
                     bed of the unfortunate girl, and her poor thin fingers, folded in his own, are
                     pressed to his lips. Heâ€”Why copy a picture, which, as its figures had no
                     reality, can have no interest save to its designer? for whose excited brain it
                     had a luxurious agony (if I may say so), or a terrible voluptuousness that
                     seemed to rend his very soul to pieces, by a mere excess, that was both anguish
                     and delight, of melancholy rapture. Bathed in tears, every nerve in his body
                     seeming to be endued with a distinct actual existence, so that he was alive and
                     with a living soul in a million of places, or a million of existences in one,
                     and every one an entity of transport, but a transport that was pain, Ernestin
                     passed a day of which a few more such would have put him in his grave or driven
                     him distracted.
                  It is folly, or ignorance, and in both cases vanity, to laugh at this
                     infatuation. What matters it how we live? The poet in his fancy has his
                     spiritual existence as much a reality to him, as does the sensualist in the
                     delights of his less capable, because limited, physical body. This
                     is measured by cubic inches and has its extent in narrow surfaces; but what can
                     estimate the solidity of the former and confine the expansibility of its
                     superficies? It is the angel separated from the man, the antedated immortality
                     of the spirit enjoyed in perennial resuscitation. Why should Agnes be dead or
                     dying, rather than her sisters, or her brothers, her mother or her aunt? Thus
                     would ask sober Reason. But sober Reason, if she feel no pains, has not the
                     pleasures, the ecstasies that compensate the agonies of the imagination; and as
                     we cannot be keenly sensible of pleasure without a proportionate susceptibility
                     to pain, and the finer the organization so the more feelingly and quickly is it
                     alive to every touch of either, I would rather have been Ernestin with all his
                     suffering than the man of duller sensibilities who laughs at it.
                  However, his relief is at hand. He has carried his fears to that excess that he
                     has the journals brought him, that he may consult, and with a beating heart,
                     the obituary column. It is now the third day since the penciling of the broken
                     sonnet, when his eyes are riveted by the very name he looks for. It is Agnes'
                     mother who is dead; and Ernestin, notwithstanding the pain it naturally gives
                     him, and the shock in his condition, feels immediately relieved. Even the cause
                     of Agnes' non-appearance is now explained. And more: see! he calls his mother
                     to him, and silently points out the paragraph, which his mother reads gravely
                     and without remark.
                  "You must now admit," said Ernestin, "that you were wrong. Her mother, you see,
                     was an Eldon."
                  "She has then, I am sure, been well brought up," said Mrs. Fitzherbert,
                     promptly, and with perfect frankness,â€”and very seriously. Was it the occasion?
                     or that she felt that the last barrier perhaps was broken down she could offer
                     to Ernestin's impetuous desires? for to mention Agnes' poverty, was to preach
                     to him prudence; and prudence to a poet? prudence to a lover? prudence to
                     Ernestin?
                  Ernestin is more than ever enamored. Not merely because the blood of Agnes on
                     both sides is satisfactoryâ€”though the philosopher sets its due value upon that,
                     nor because of his mother's reluctant satisfaction, but because cause Agnes is now an orphan, and in this
                     quality her claims on a nature like Ernestin's, romantic, generous, and
                     affectionate, are a thousand fold increased.11
                  
                  On the day of the funeral, the student placed himself at the accustomed window,
                     but with what different feelings! As the sad procession moved onward to St.
                     Luke's, he, who by accident, or his own imprudence, was excluded from any part
                     therein, was as truly a mourner as perhaps the fondest of the sons. When the
                     last carriage had disappeared, he went to the top of the house that he might
                     there follow the train with his eyes. Then Ernestin descended to his study,
                     and, reclining on his couch, wept silently, as he would have done for his own
                     mother. Yet he had not known the departed even by repute. Doubtless the state
                     of his nerves had much to do with this excess of feeling, and much the
                     singularity of his position; but imagination, and his now deep love for Agnes,
                     had much more.
                  There is however a relief in tears, that drop not violently, but with a soft
                     and silent fall, the fertilizing dew of the heart's paradise rather than the
                     tempest-shower of the wilderness of passion. Ernestin, soothed and quieted,
                     slumbers like a child, and wakens better both in mind and body; wakensâ€”O the
                     fluctuation of human thought as well as feeling! to call the orphan girl before
                     his spirit, and admire her in mourning!
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  THE LONGING HEART BEATS HOPEFULLY.
                  IT is the author of Pelham, I think, who says that a person
                     should be of very distinguished mien to appear well in black. He is certainly
                     mistaken. Black clothes give a degree of outward gentility to every body,
                     especially to women; and when the air is naturally noble, they exalt it
                     greatly,â€”and this in proportion to the deepness of the mourning.
                  It is the third week since the funeral of Mrs. Elphinstone, and Ernestin has an
                     opportunity of observing this effect in the three distinguished-looking girls
                     who are descending the street, escorted by their brothers. It is their first
                     appearance since their mother's death; and it is the Sabbath; and the sun
                     shines bright. The lover, notwithstanding his sense of delicacy, cannot resist
                     his longing, and he goes out in time to cross their path. He has himself put on
                     a full suit of black (fortunately in his power), that there may be nothing in
                     his appearance out of harmony with their feelings. The sense of propriety is
                     not however wholly stifled by his passion, and, though his heart beats thick,
                     he walks gravely with his head bent down, and ventures not to look across the
                     road. Nay, he becomes, as he walks, ashamed of his procedure, which appears a
                     sacrilege to the dead and a want of respect to the living. His face burning, he crosses behind
                     them to their side of the street. And now they leave it, to pass to his. He
                     cannot distinguish, through the thick and ample veil, which is Agnes, but, as
                     he looks after the party, he sees one of them turn her head timidly up the
                     street to the side where he had been. It is the slightest motion in the world,
                     and it is but instantaneous; but it is enough. And under the frill of her
                     bonnet, as her head is bent down, he sees a little curl, which, in the sunlight
                     and beside the crape, looks fair as an infant's. The neck itself is very
                     youthful, and the curl makes it seem still more so. Ernestin presses it to the
                     lips of his heart, and is very happy. Poor Mrs. Elphinstone! that thy death,
                     which had grieved him deeply, and, for Agnes' sake, which grieves him still,
                     should be the aiding cause of so much pleasure! But is it not so with joy and
                     sorrow, death and life, at all times, in all human things? Let us not moralize;
                     there is danger that in the analysis all the finer elements, that give its
                     value to the substance examined, evaporate and leave nothing but a
                     caput-mortuum.
                  If the lover, whose excited and now happy heart did not suffer him to proceed
                     to church, sought again his closet, and watched in delicious revery for his
                     mistress's return, I need not say. It is the high privilege of the poet to make
                     immortal in this world those whom he loves. Conscious of his destiny,â€”certain,
                     as of death, that after death his fame would rise into existence, as the soul
                     from out the body's ashes, and live, despite of obloquy, the eternal life of
                     the great on earth, an angel in the heaven of his country's glory,â€”Ernestin, as
                     he looked upon the unconscious girl, and knew what she had gained by mere
                     contact, as it were, with his more ethereal nature, felt that unutterable
                     satisfaction which is often the sole remuneration neration of the obscure great
                     man, who feels that he walks as in a cloud amidst unrecognizing strangers, and
                     waits, with mingled resignation and pride, till the maternal hand of Nature
                     shall disperse it and reveal him in his true attributesâ€”super aethera notum.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  THE WALK.
                  IT is the fifth week since the death of Mrs. Elphinstone. Ernestin's family are
                     already removing to their new residence, and his brother the practitioner has
                     been for some days established in his new office, leaving the entire
                     ground-floor of the old dwelling to Ernestin's transient use. At all times fond
                     of a variety of rooms, the poet will have now a nearer view of Agnes, should
                     she pass. But what are all these huge and iron-bound boxes which cover the
                     otherwise empty floor? They are for the student's books. He will not let any
                     hand pack them but his own. Yet, though there are but three days left him, and,
                     with the various implements of his study, there is work enough, if done as he
                     intends it, to occupy all his morning hours, he has not yet commenced. It is a
                     new worry, this procrastination; butâ€”his books! he would not miss, he could
                     not, a single moment's gaze on Agnes, not for twice their number. Indeed, why
                     regard the substance, when their essence, all that gives them value to any body
                     but the book-seller, or the book-madman, or the book-coxcomb, is neglected?
                  It is the fifth week since the death of Mrs. Elphinstone. It is a charming
                     afternoon. Ernestin feels sure that Agnes will be out, as sure she will receive
                     him kindly. A magnetizer perhaps would have christened this persuasion
                     sympathy; but Ernestin Fitzherbert was not of the kind of men of which are made
                     magnetizers. He judges from the weather,â€”from her being all alone (every other
                     member of her family having already passed),â€”from the fact that, by her own
                     departure from the neighborhood (as the house she lived in he had noticed was
                     to rent), if not by his, they must soon be separated; from these and other data
                     of the kind the lover drew his conclusion, of which he is so certain that he
                     changes his study-robe for a coat, and makes himself otherwise ready for the
                     coming meeting. And behold, there is Agnes now! and all her manner speaks of
                     expectation. But experience has made the lover wary; she is a woman. If she
                     stop as she did before, it shall not be before the house. He waits awhile, his
                     heart beating like a clock the eventful minutes, and when the lady is a little
                     way removed, he sallies after. She has heard the door shut to, and nature for
                     her hoists a signal, which the chasing frigate does not fail to read. He tacks;
                     he is in her wake; he is abeam; and their yards almost lock.
                  "Miss Elphinstoneâ€”Miss Agnes Elphinstone," says Ernestin, in a voice not
                     exactly firm, while his head is bent down almost under her graceful
                     mourning-bonnet.
                  The sweet face the bonnet covers looks up, within the heavy veil that cannot
                     hide its beauty, looks up without embarrassment, and, with a smile that was
                     such as might have welcomed an every-day acquaintance she was glad to meet and
                     while she continues to walk with the same gentle step, the sweet voice answers,
                     "Yes." She had not given him time to finish. Could she suppose that he was
                     doubtful of her identity, and had asked her of it by her name?
                  "Are you going to leave Chelsea?" continues Ernestin tin: and how very soft his voice has become!
                     while it is no longer broken. It may be that Agnes felt the change, for she
                     looks down. And again, the simple "Yes," in a tone that made musical one of the
                     most inharmonious sounds in the language.
                  "To live inâ€”?" asked Ernestin, naming the place of her father's family as he
                     had learned it from the newspaper.
                  "No," said the sweet voice, and still sweetly. But the gentle speaker looked up
                     in her lover's face with surprise. She did not know how utterly ignorant he was
                     of all knowledge of her family save what he had gathered from the public
                     print.
                  "And you will not tell me where you are going?"
                  Why is Agnes silent? Does she fear he means to follow her? How little does she
                     know him, his considerateness and his pride! considerateness for her, pride for
                     himself. The romantic, foolish fellow only wants to have another place upon the
                     map to love, and to fancy, when the breeze is blowing from that direction, that
                     it has just kissed her cheek, or wantoned with the tresses he is dying to press
                     to his lips and entwine about his fingers. He follow her! Did she invite him
                     indeed, it were another matter.
                  How long was she to be absent? "Only for the season." And when does she leave?
                     "In a week or so."
                  And now the lady seems to grow impatient at these questions, which are not
                     perhaps the kind of talk she expected from him, and she makes a motion, as if
                     to stop.
                  Ernestin's temper, which, notwithstanding his self-discipline, rarely brooked
                     opposition, especially when he felt it was injustice, is a little ruffled at
                     this unlooked-for demonstration.
                  "Miss Elphinstone," he saysâ€”Nay, I am not sure he did not call her "Madam," in
                     his slight displeasure, although she was so young and maiden. The worst hand in
                     the world to deal with women, he quarreled always with their very nature,
                     though he knew he could not change it, any more than he could conquer in
                     himself his repugnance to its want of candor, its remorseless vanity, which
                     sacrifices all things rather than betray itself, and its constant vacillation
                     under circumstances like the present. Yet you will see he will appeal to her
                     reason, as if she were a man! And perhaps he will succeed; for she is a good
                     and docile girl, this little Agnes, more than he is yet aware. "Miss
                     Elphinstone, I ask your good sense, if this is right? Had I seen you at the
                     Evelyns' that night, the mere ceremony of being named to you by another person
                     would have entitled me to all the privileges of an acquaintance. I might then
                     have talked with you for an hour, had there been opportunity; yet I should not
                     have been better known to you than I am now, when, after an acquaintanceâ€”for it
                     is such, of nearly a year, you will not hear me speak ten words without showing
                     impatience."
                  Agnes walks on submissively; and although she presently, hesitating a moment,
                     turns round and retraces her steps, she does not object to Ernestin's turning
                     too and continuing to walk with her, and he, though he is grieved that the
                     interview is to be thus brief, is not displeased, for he supposes Agnes fears
                     to meet her relatives returning, and it would have sore distressed him to put
                     her to the blush.
                  "You cannot doubt," he proceeds to say, "that had it depended on me, I should,
                     if only for my own sake, have obtained the introduction which you will persist
                     in requiring. This hasty and broken intercourse permits neither of us to gain that knowledge of the
                     other's disposition which alone can save us from perhaps a lamentable mistake.
                     But is it in my power?"
                  Agnes does not answer him directly, but she answers him. "Miss Sumner says she
                     has no knowledge of you whatever." Her tone is irritable, if not pettish, her
                     head is jerked upward, her pace is accelerated, her whole manner is offensive.
                     Ernestin is taken completely aback, and for a moment, in his indignation, feels
                     tempted not to speak at all; but there is his character for truth at stake; and
                     what does he value more?
                  "I ought not perhaps to answer you; but my veracity is in question; and I
                     assert distinctly, that Miss Margaret Evelyn told me with her own lips, Miss
                     Sumner had of her own accord mentioned to her she had seen me at the church."
                     Ernestin had no time or temper to reflect, that Agnes had more than probably
                     mistaken Miss Sumner's meaning, which was to deny any knowledge of his
                     character or of his standing in society; for so very slight was the
                     acquaintance, that he himself had failed to recognize that lady when he passed
                     her in the porch on the day in question. He proceeds. "And you will pardon me
                     if I add, that insinuating what you do, I am surprised that a lady of Miss
                     Agnes Elphinstone's birth, breeding"â€”
                  It was well perhaps for both of them that Agnes did not let him finish. And was
                     it the dread of what he was about to say, or in an honorable regret for having
                     hurt his pride, or in the apprehension of losing him as a suitor, in which
                     light alone the girl cared any thing about him, that she hastened to interrupt
                     him?
                  "I do not mean to insinuate any thing," she exclaimed, eagerly and
                     deprecatingly; "I only thought it very strange."
                  She certainly had a marvellous enunciation; for the way she uttered that one
                     word "strange," took our poet, who was half musician, literally by the ears.
                     Thus not guarded against the siren, and being besides no Ulysses, his
                     displeasure melted away, and he resumed, with more softness:
                  "It was foolish in me to mention Miss Sumner's name at all; but I was so
                     fearful of offending you, so anxious to convince you it was by misfortune, not
                     by any negligence on my part, I had not made your acquaintance in the usual
                     wayâ€” Indeed, did you but know how I have suffered, what I have doneâ€” Let me
                     give you, Miss Agnes,â€”for you should know me,â€”a brief history of my passion,
                     since first"â€”Though looking down, as Agnes was, Ernestin was instantly aware of
                     a movement of impatience on her part,â€”the head jerked pettishly, as before, and
                     her pace accelerated; and quick to read the pages of the soul, he saw at once
                     in this new leaf another proof, if such were needed, that Agnes loved herself
                     alone, not him. "You will not understand me," he said; and the bitterness of
                     his heart gives asperity to his tone: "If I speak of myself, and what I have
                     done for you, borne for you, Miss Agnes Elphinstone, it is because I wish to
                     secure your esteem, and to make you certain of the seriousness of my purpose.
                     None but a boy or fool would take a wife without knowing her; and I would not
                     have you think me either."
                  Agnes is softened, and, as if to apologize for her impatience, and perhaps with
                     an anxious wish of kindred to his own, that he may not think she admits this
                     kind of intercourse without reluctance, she remarks, "But it seems so strange
                     to have a gentleman speak to me in the street! nobody ever did so before."
                  
                  How very girlish! how simple! Yet in what dulcet accents! And there is that
                     "strange" again, which would have ravished the soul of Walker with delight.
                     Surely nobody ever did talk so sweetly! But this time Ernestin is proof against
                     the fascination; for the devil of experience, the sootiest of all fiends, is
                     knocking at his heart, as he shall knock again, often after, and cries to him,
                     with a shrillness full of significance, 'Do you hear that?
                     Unhappy Ernestin! this is the fruit of the tree of good and evil, whose root is
                     in the soil of the universal human heart! Thy teeth shall be set on edge with
                     its acerbity, and the roof of thy mouth retain its bitterness, which has no
                     aromatic savor! Do you hear that? Agnes is a pure and guileless
                     maiden, if there ever was one, and, in the very innocence of her nature, she
                     speaks what the craft of a maturer womanhood would have taught her to suppress.
                     In fact, she talks but as Ernestin himself does, what is uppermost in her heart
                     at the time. But the simplicity seems unnatural in a girl of her condition,
                     especially as he is unwilling to believe she is a fool. It seems
                     so strange. How often shall those sounds tingle with delicious music in his
                     memory! But to them shall succeed, each time, Nobody ever did so
                     before; and the sweetness of its cadence will be lost in the crash of doubt,
                     which, like a noisy and ambitious orchestra, shall fill the mind, instead, with
                     its own unintelligible confusion.
                  "Nobody ever did so before," said Agnes,â€”having no thought but to remove the
                     idea of her accessibility, if such should have occurred to him, and thereby
                     putting it into his head, where otherwise it would have been the last of all
                     ideas to enter: "Nobody ever did so before."
                  "If I thought there had," said Ernestin, directly, "most certainly
                        I never should." And there is silence for a moment; which
                     Ernestin is the first to break, commencing and completing, but very
                     hurriedlyâ€”for Agnes became again restless, the story of his efforts to obtain
                     knowledge of her, his visit to the tavern, and so forth, as we have already
                     read.
                  What further he said; how he told herâ€”provoked by her impatience, that she had
                     been hitherto next to Heaven in his heart, that her name had mingled with his
                     prayers, that it should do so no longer,â€”whereupon Agnes said something
                     indistinctly, but with an air of alarm, and with a gentleness that seemed to
                     deprecate his displeasure; how, avowing himself to be "of that unhappy class of
                     men known as authors and artists," he said (having in mind the series of
                     sonnets of which we have given the only ones he wrote), "The next book I may
                     publish, no matter what its nature, get it, and you will there see,â€”you alone,
                     for nobody will understand it but yourself,â€”how wellâ€”forgive meâ€”[smorzando-affetuoso] I have loved you;" and how
                     Agnes, thereupon, looked suddenly up in his face, as if to read there if he
                     lied,â€”a motion which was a new and most striking evidence of her total want of
                     any feeling of sympathy with him, of even common respect for him as a man,â€”the
                     more so, that there was a slight expression of mockery in her brows and on her
                     lips; and how Fitzherbert, chilled to the soul, if not frightened, went
                     onâ€”because he was beside her for no other purposeâ€”to tell her of his
                     sufferings; at which the gentle Elphinstone says gently, in such a tone as she
                     might have spoken of a crushed grasshopper, "She should be sorry to be the
                     cause of misery to any body;" whereupon Ernestin colors to the brow, and
                     hastily begs her not to think he alludes to the lover's sentimental wo (he
                     speaks contemptuously) they talk of in novels, that he had no such feelings,
                        and was incapable of them (he
                     speaks haughtily); but that the uncertainty, the anxiety, the expectation, the
                     disappointment, etcetera, etcetera, which he had undergone or had indulged in
                     on her account, had wrought upon his already weakened nerves to that degree
                     that he was in actual danger; that he had been so ill as to be obliged even to
                     shave the back of his headâ€”which, he says, by way of parenthesis but not
                     without an object, was only anticipating time a very littleâ€”and to blister
                     himself behind the ears (the vain devil is afraid she will see the
                     decortication of his mastoid processes, which is no beauty) and to apply
                     leeches: all this, and more, with sundry brief remarks about his own family and
                     his satisfaction with hers, because, as he says, while Agnes listens
                     charmingly, "His wife and the mother of his children must not be a common
                     woman," it would be but wearisome to tell, if even our memory served; and who
                     could read without a yawn, what would be written with the interruption of so
                     many?
                  Enough for our ethic theme to add what follows.
                  Had he had any personal defect, he would have told it her; but he had none,
                     other than what was common to almost all men at his time of lifeâ€”the coming of
                     gray hair and threatened baldness; so he told her that. She must have thought
                     him very odd. And it was odd at such a moment; but, as usual with him, his
                     purpose got the better of both time and place. Having made up his mind to
                     dispel directly any illusion she might labor under, and abhorring deceit more
                     than deformity, and, as became a man of good sense and knowledge of his kind,
                     preferring to lose her now, rather than she should tire of him when too late,
                     he enumerated all the personal disadvantages he knew of, adding his fear of
                     there being too great a difference in their ages, and then he asked her own.
                     "She never told her age to any body."
                  Was it possible it was the idol of his heart that spoke any thing so vulgar?
                     Such a sentiment, such a folly, such an expression, from the mouth of one of
                     his plebeian loves had not disgusted him; but what an idea it conveyed to him
                     of the intellect, the education, the very breeding of this well-born and most
                     gentle lady!
                  He merely answered her, that, had she known why he asked, she would not have
                     thought his question either curious or impertinent; that she had at times
                     appeared so very youthful, that he thought with dread of the difference which
                     twenty years would make between them, when she, were she indeed so young as she
                     appeared, would be still young, and he should be old. It was indeed calculating
                     very far ahead for twenty years, when both perhaps, and one most probably,
                     would be dead. But Ernestin always lived in the future, and, like the ant,
                     provided for the long drear winter in the glad summer which he knew so
                     brief.
                  What had she said, this little Agnes, had she known, that at the assembly where
                     he thought to meet her he had, with set purpose and on sought occasion, told
                     his exact age twice over to two different relations of the lady who had invited
                     him, that getting to her ears, as he supposed, it would have a chance to reach
                     to Agnes! Could she have appreciated such romantic honor, or such refined
                     prudence?
                  But the short walk is near its close. Already they have turned the corner of
                     the street where Agnes dwells; and she looks round, in her half abrupt, half
                     doubtful way, to hint that he must stop. But on he goes. Who would not, in like
                     circumstances? And he had this hope, in addition to the present pleasure, that
                     she would ask him in. But she listens to his madnessâ€”what was it else, to a
                     woman of whose soul he as yet knew nothing?â€”or was it to his self-denial, or his refined
                     circumspection? when he told, how, could she love him, though a fire blazed
                     between them, did she hold her hand beyond it, and bid him take it, he would,
                     through all the blaze, without a moment's hesitation (and so he would); but
                     that, could she not, he would not court her, though she had ten times her
                     beauty, with all the graces that adorn the loveliest of her sex, all the
                     virtues of his sisters united and doubled; and so on, and so on. And here too
                     he spoke the truth. When did he otherwise?
                  Ernestin through all this scene did not talk well; neither well nor wisely; and
                     well or ill, he would rather have walked beside her silent, musing on delicious
                     thoughts, or listening to her. But he durst not pause, lest she should be
                     reminded of their strangeness to each other (as she chose to consider it). And
                     now they have reached the house where Agnes dwells, and her little foot is laid
                     upon the step; but, ere she ascends it, she turns about, and facing her
                     companion, seems to solicit him to leave her; and her look is gentle and
                     considerate. But Ernestin begs to be allowed to ring the bell; and so they
                     approach the sill together. Here Agnes with her back towards the railing looks
                     full in Ernestin's eyes, while he, close to her and before her, gazes tenderly
                     on hers. She raises her hand to her veil to draw it aside, but drops it again,
                     and seems to inquire in her lover's eyes what he thinks of such a change of
                     purpose. Perhaps she was afraid the light might be unfavorable. If so, she was
                     unwise. Perhaps she feared the action, though a natural one at the time and in
                     the place, would put them more on a footing of familiarity than she desired or
                     thought proper. It was but a fold of crape; yet it separated them as
                     completely, and in much the same manner, as had done the grate of a cloister
                     ter. She does not mean to invite Ernestin to enter the house, and Ernestin can
                     read it in her look, yet he stands before her, and gazes with delight upon her
                     brows, which are, or appear at the hour and through the veil, of a singularly
                     beautiful color that has something of the hue of steel, and of which the hairs
                     are planted smoothly, regularly, and ( so to say) with finish,â€”bespeaking
                     order, gentleness, and feminine grace of character.
                  Ernestin, as he pulls the bell, asks Agnes again, as he had done during the
                     walk, if she will authorize him to say to Miss Margaret Evelyn, that she, Miss
                     Agnes Elphinstone, would not be averse to see him; and Agnes repeats, with the
                     same feminine dissimulation she had then used, that "she is always happy to see
                     any gentleman," meaning who should come to her properly presented. The door is
                     opened by a maid-servant, and Ernestin, who in his respectful passionâ€”or was it
                     in his pride? had not been able to bring himself to entreat Agnes to ask him
                     in, now seeing she does not intend to bid him good-b'ye, touches his hat in the
                     stiffest and most ungracious, as ungraceful way in the world, while Agnes,
                     continuing to regard him, does not so much as smile in return; and he leaves
                     the door,â€”leaves itâ€”as afterwards ha said to himself bitterlyâ€”leaves it as a
                     lacquey, who had approached it an accepted lover.
                  As he turned his back, he was aware that the servant-girl darted forward to
                     look at him, precisely in such a manner as if Agnes had said to her, That
                        is he! It was just such an action as Ernestin himself would have
                     expelled a servant for, could any servant venture such with him towards any
                     person. Had Agnes then made this hireling her confidant, or, more likely,
                     spoken of him indiscreetly if not indelicately before her? The thought almost shook him to pieces. Or was
                     this young gentlewoman guilty of so habitual familiarity with a servant as
                     would warrant the latter to take such a liberty in any circumstances? And, with
                     a pang that was death itself, Fitzherbert,â€”who thought that such leveling of
                     conditions in domestic life, especially where the superior was a female, was in
                     itself degrading, and, considering its consequences, positively
                     criminal,â€”remembered what he had seen one evening in the holydays, in the case
                     of the youngest sister,â€”and he felt as if the whole foundation of his love had
                     suddenly crumbled under him, and left him to the unsubstantiality of a dusty
                     and stifling air.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XII.
                  CLOUDS.
                  DOUBTFUL whether to think himself fortunate or wretchedâ€”fortunate in the
                     discovery of a fault so monstrous, or wretched in this violent awaking from a
                     blissful dream,â€”still in loveâ€”in love with Agnes' eyes, in love with Agnes'
                     mouth, in love with Agnes' voice, in love, in fact, with the idol of his
                     imagination, but displeased, indignant, shocked, at what he feared were the
                     inborn or ingrafted moral imperfections of the reality,â€”Ernestin returns home
                     to find his perilous pains of brain and body, from which with sore trouble and
                     some sacrifice he had partially recovered, renewed, with increased violence and
                     with extension. His very hands and feet now thrill, every nerve in his body is
                     under the most intense excitement, and, as a necessary consequence, the blood
                     is frightfully accelerated, and the heart makes audible efforts for the more
                     rapid performance of its functions. It is a state of excitation that often
                     recurring would destroy the system which gives these unmistakable warnings of
                     its danger. As the sufferer reclined on the sofa in the front drawing-room,
                     endeavoring to alleviate sensations whose peril he recognized, and with a
                     desperateness that without religious resignation had been defiance of his fate,
                     but which with that resignation had something in it ennoblingâ€”for he felt
                     himself exalted, and filled with a sense of moral dignity nity, if not grandeur, that made his condition
                     to be not without its recompense,â€”endeavoring, but in vainâ€”since he could not
                     prevent himself from retracing again and again the whole scene with Agnes, and
                     from examining in every possible light, both favorable to her and unfavorable,
                     all her conduct and all her expressions,â€”as the hermit lay thus in his unshared
                     misery, he overheard in the next room what, recalling former doubts to add to
                     his perplexity, made his prospect of happiness with Agnes, already dimmed,
                     vanish almost entirely, in fog if not in storm.
                  It was his mother delighting herself in the society of his brother Henry. What
                     a tone of happiness, of health, of youth even, is in her voice! You would think
                     her a woman of twenty; but you would not think very highly of her judgment or
                     her taste; for Henry is almost the direct opposite of Ernestin in moral and
                     intellectual as in physical character. But when did Mrs. Fitzherbert show
                     herself so satisfied in the latter's company? Restless, impatient, indocile,
                     her whole study seemed then to be, to get away. Now, she is evidently perfectly
                     content with her companion, and eager to make the most of his unusual
                     good-nature; and the ready assent she gives to every thing he says, however
                     false or irrational, contrasts strikingly with the spirit of opposition she
                     manifests to Ernestin, talk he never so wisely or truthfully.
                  Ernestin was too sagacious not to see that this partiality for the bad and
                     indifference to the good is a necessary result of natural causes, and in his
                     solitude he was too reasonable to complain of it; but at the moment of its
                     display it fretted him exceedingly, and he would often give vent to expressions
                     of his dissatisfaction, which, though perfectly just in themselves, were
                     nevertheless out of place, unfilial, and futile. What a prophetic warning did
                     he receive in this dissatisfactionâ€”this torture, as it often was, of his
                     affectionate heartâ€”against his longed-for union! And he received it, conscious
                     to all its truth; but to what avail? Will the heart follow where the head shall
                     dictate? Is it so rare a thing, to see one's self struggling towards the rapids
                     of a moral Niagara, to feel their powerful action draw him into their eddies,
                     and yet be unable to make one stroke towards the shore of safety, till at last,
                     subdued by the very despair of rescue, he resigns himself to the waters, which
                     give him one moment more to see and ponder all the horror of his fate, then
                     plunge him, covered with and concealed by their foam, over the roaring
                     precipice, into a gulf which boils ever and ever though a thousand like him
                     were swept daily into its abyss?
                  Well did Ernestin Fitzherbert see all his peril. He saw himself the father of
                     children, of whom some were virtuous and others vicious. The mother, kept ever
                     anxious by her vicious sons, has their images forever present to her
                     imagination, and, like a fickle gallant, they are loved for the very trouble
                     which they give and which proves they are unworthy to be loved, while the
                     virtuous, awaking no solicitude, like the constant lover, suffer the heart to
                     slumber over its possession, and are by and by, by sure degrees, forgotten
                     altogether. In vain does the father remonstrate, and the proud hearts of the
                     virtuous rebel against the injustice. What avails it? He, Ernestin, is
                     singularly endowed with justice,â€”rare gift, which brings man nearer to the gods
                     than any other, and which has been denied to woman, I may say wholly, since the
                     exceptions are so few and far between they scarcely catch the sight, and can be
                     distinguished but at intervals, one in a lifetime, or in an age. Creature of
                     impulse, self-willed, with more of imagination than reason, and with more of vanity than either, blind to discern
                     and obstinate to instruction, what can she know of justice? What cares she for
                     so lofty a possession, when her mind is too contracted to contain it? And Agnes
                     Elphinstone is but a woman. Is she to prove the lone exception, the small stray
                     flower floating feebly upward in the calm and desolate flood of years? Make her
                     Agnes Fitzherbert, shall she, by that change of name, change attributes, and be
                     like her who bore that name, his sister, a woman small like her in person,
                     noble like her in feature, but with a mind, a soul, a reason more than all,
                     that were not like to any other woman's? Alas! Hope leans over him, and
                     beckoning Memory to her aid, they whisper in his ear,â€”Agnes, thy sister, was
                     molded by thee, as the very clay thou shapest with thy fingers. What prevents
                     thy plastic touch from modeling, in like manner, the Agnes that should fill her
                     place? And Ernestin thought of her youth which had frightened him when, looking
                     forward to the lapse of years, he considered her passions in connection with
                     his greater age, and he thought on the tenderness and ductility of the clay,
                     and how readily it would yield to his fashioning fingers, which, left to itself
                     a few years longer, till all the moisture of its newness had evaporated, would
                     crumble into pieces rather than take form.
                  Perhaps all this while is Ernestin forgetting, that he is following the natural
                     example of his mother, and is loving Agnes but for the very trouble that she
                     gives him and the anxiety she awakens in his heart. And perhaps when he shall
                     begin to give her in return like trouble, and make her feel the doubts, the
                     fears, the jealousies, the distrusts, in a word the rack of the heart on which
                     he is now stretched, she will begin to love him, and, as she is woman, love him
                     with a love exceeding his; not because she is tenderer, as the silly or crafty
                     flatterers of the sex would hold,â€”not that she is tendererâ€”that is
                     impossible,â€”but because, as woman, she never will take counsel of that reason
                     which, though often disobeyed, is in all things and at all times the guide of
                     Ernestin, the man.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XIII.
                  SUNSHINE.
                  FOR all heart-sickness there is no relief like the consolations of religion;
                     and to the desolate there is none other. Where shall Ernestin look for solace
                     in his affliction, where for counsel in his perplexity, save from his Creator?
                     The twilight is now fast deepening into darkness. On the mat of his apartment
                     kneels the student, and prays the Incommunicable
                        Name.12 He prays not only for his own but Agnes' sake, that he
                     may have power to obey the voice of reason, nor sacrifice to present happiness
                     the entire future of both their lives; and designing to try Agnes the ensuing
                     day, he supplicates, that if worthy of his love he may not misjudge her, but
                     otherwise, that he may have strength to subdue his ill-placed passion; and
                     concluding as at other times, with preferring, so Heaven were pleased, the path
                     of glory and of public usefulness to the felicity of domestic reposeâ€”must one
                     or the other be abandoned, Ernestin rises, as all sincere men rise from the
                     homage of prayer or of confession, solaced, purified, refreshed.
                  The next day is the Sabbath; and with the intent to see if Agnes will
                     acknowledge him or not, and the fixed resolve to be governed, for or against
                     his passion, by her manner in either case, he goes out so as to cross her path
                     on the way to church. She is on her brother's arm. As Ernestin comes directly
                     towards her, moving as near to her as he can, and with a look and action that
                     showed he expected her to speak to him, Agnes looks down with an air of
                     distress that seemed to be on his account rather than her own, yet dashed with
                     a sly humor, not offensive, but in such degree as he might himself have
                     betrayed in like circumstances, while her eyes, curtained by their broad lids,
                     look timidly aside in his direction, as if to observe him, but without doing
                     so. Probably, it was with a view to avert the displeasure she was conscious he
                     had a right to feel, rather than from any of that anxiety of tenderness which
                     maidens in their first love are apt to betray, and which is one of their most
                     fascinating and graceful characteristics. Her lips are apart, and her brows
                     elevated, but unequally, at the inner edge; a manner indicative of pain of
                     mind, but which is also the readiest mode of avoiding a laugh.13 All
                     this is seen by the lover in an instant, and in the same instant her uncommon
                     beauty, which had never appeared to him to such advantage. Indeed, he thought
                     he had never before beheld a face so lovely; for, besides the regularity of the
                     features and the contour of the visage, all favored by the inclination of the
                     head, and the complexion tinged deliciously with the rose-hue of her feelings,
                     her mouth, being partly open as I have said, showed that formation of the lips
                     which, with their perfect color, almost drove the artist-lover wild with
                     delight. Yet, as he had expected, and reasonably, after the interview of
                     yesterday, which had been of her own inviting, that Agnes would acknowledge
                     him, he is in the next moment stung with disappointment and with shame, and in
                     his hurt pride turns rapidly round, and hurries home.
                  But a lover, if not quite equal to the extracting of sunbeams from cucumbers,
                     will make the most of any scattered
                     tered rays the clouded heaven of his love may spare him, concentrating them
                     through the lens of his imagination into a focus more or less ardent to suit
                     his wishes. Ernestin has not reached the door before he discovers that he has
                     more reason to be happy than otherwise. Had the lady raised her head haughtily,
                     or had she even regarded him with coldness, he would have forsworn her forever;
                     but this gentleness, this timidity, this distress, assumed or real, had a touch
                     of romance in it that was quite in harmony with the tone of his own feelings,
                     and though an open acknowledgment of his acquaintance would have better suited
                     the frankness and sincerity of his nature, yet he readily admitted the
                     influence which fashion, feminine habits, a false education, and the
                     remonstrances of friends must have upon a mind too young to be
                     self-disciplined. Whether the recollection of the eminent beauty of Agnes had
                     any thing to do in forwarding this comfortable conclusion, I pretend not to
                     affirm; but it is certain that a pair of parted and delicious lips was still
                     before the eyes of his spirit, and fired his blood with a passion which the
                     doubtful circumstances of his amour had not yet permitted him to feel.
                  In this excited but most happy mood, Ernestin ascended to his room, and
                     shutting the door knelt down, and thanked the Author of all Good that he had
                     found Agnes neither cold nor dissembling.â€”In his expanded heart, he could not
                     punish her with the uneasiness she must feel at his abrupt and angry return,
                     though he well knew to keep her under that impression would be for his
                     advantage. So he descended to his brother's deserted office and sat at the
                     window; and when, through the purposely well-opened blinds, he saw Agnes
                     returning alone with her youngest sister, who was plainly her favorite, and the
                     latter, at her inquiry (which he read instantly, though the girl's lips
                     scarcely moved and her eyes made the least possible inclination towards her
                     companion,) look upward to the usual spot, then down to the place where he
                     actually was, and say something to Agnes, who bridled prettily, and looked so
                     proud and happy! which was in itself a compliment, Ernestin, notwithstanding
                     the want of discretion, perhaps of delicacy in this manÅ“uvre, felt as a man
                     feels when the long-impeded current of his love at length runs smooth.
                  In the height of Heaven, sat the lone Archangel, and, foreseeing what was even
                     then about to fall, looked with the melancholy of his divine and companionless
                     nature on this little scene of hope, this respit of the insect in the momentary
                     pauses of the shower, that is sweeping him, struggling with downbeaten wings
                     and crippled feet, into the current of eternity. And the guardian angel,
                     prescient too of coming peril, prepared himself to watch with added vigilance
                     over the fate of the mortal in whom his benevolence, through the will of their
                     common Maker, had become interested. While in the hearts of both was heard the
                     Immutable Word: "Man's blindness is often his felicity, or the remedy of ills
                     which from his nature are inevitable. His hopes attained would be to him
                     destruction; and to foresee it would entail despair."
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XIV.
                  THE CARD.
                  IN the hours of the nights ere midnight, for the days are all for Agnes, the
                     enamored student, dreaming all the while the waking dream of happy love, packs
                     up, case after case, his still precious though superseded books; and, by the
                     time he is utterly alone in all the house, he is prepared to follow the rest of
                     the family to their new residence.
                  It is morning, of the last day. He is waiting for his carriers and porters,
                     when Agnes suddenly passes. Her step is hurried, her dress is unusual, like the
                     costume of travel, and she is going towards her own home. She looks narrowly at
                     the office-window. But Ernestin is above in his closet, where he has, with a
                     sigh of regret and a lingering reluctant touch, been defacing his
                     pencil-drawing on the window-frame, that other eyes than his might not profane
                     the image of the deity he has heart-enshrined. A few minutes given to the
                     flutter of his pulse, Ernestin turns the key in the house-door, and takes his
                     way, but slowly, towards the street of Agnes' home. He knows she is about to
                     leave it; and he supposes it is now.
                  Just as he comes within a gunshot of the place, a carriage piled with the usual
                     equipage of travel rolls from the door, and lo! Agnes herself, putting out her
                     beautiful head, looks up the street and sees him. He hurries down; he knows not
                     why; it is but an impulse to be near her; and the next minute he sees a little
                     hand thrust out of the same coach-window. It holds by the edge a card with a
                     string attached, such as is tied to carpet bags to indicate the ownership, and,
                     playing with it, knocks it delicately against the panel as if in absence of
                     mind. Ernestin now almost runs; and presently, the card is dropped, and the
                     beautiful head looks out after it with a pretty start, then is drawn in again;
                     but first it has looked once more up the road.
                  To walk hurriedly still on, and to pick up the card, requires, I need not say,
                     no hesitation. How eagerly he reads it, while his eyes sparkle! Mad. de Beauvais, Paris,â€”Ã  l'HÃ´tel de Helder. The
                     name and Paris are in ink; but it is in pencil, and in a
                     different and less decided hand, the rest of the address is written, as if an
                     afterthought. Was it done in the carriage, and the string that attached the
                     card untied for the purpose? Perhaps it is to discover this in some mysterious
                     way, that the finder holds it up so close to his eyes. I would wagerâ€”Why, see
                     there now! He has put the end of the ribbon between his teeth (cunning child!)
                     as in absence of mind; and so he brings the card against his lips, and presses
                     it there very amorously. I did not think he was such a fool. But perhaps the
                     string was scented.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XV.
                  THE RENCOUNTER.
                  IT is a week since the incident of the last chapter, and Fitzherbert is in
                     Paris. A sensible depletion of his bookshelves, and the auctioneer's ledger,
                     might tell how he got there. Those precious books! But love is still more
                     precious; and he who would have thrust his arm through a fire to obtain its
                     object, would hardly stop at a sacrifice that was not irremediable.
                  Now it so happened, that the very lady through whom alone he could obtain an
                     introduction to Agnes' family was likewise at this time in Paris. I know not
                     that Agnes knew it. Probably not. But Ernestin did; he had already called on
                     her; and he pondered his implied promise. But the more he pondered it, the more
                     impossible it seemed that he could bring himself to fulfil it, and the more
                     improbable that any good could come of it if he did.
                  It is a week since the incident of the card. Ernestin is seated, in his little
                     room in the HÃ´tel de Bristol, at his
                     casement, which overlooks the Place VendÃ´me.
                     lie has found the Rue du Helder, and has
                     palpitated at the walls of the HÃ´tel; but
                     what other advantage he is to derive from his proximity to Agnes, save the
                     satisfaction of being near, he has yet to see. The Straits might as well be
                     between them still; for he cannot expect her to go out here as in Chelsea, and
                     he will not bring himself to solicit Miss Evelyn's good offices. He would write
                     to Agnes, and tell her so; but he is morally certain she would betray the
                     letter, and his proud heart revolts at the thought. He is actually revolving
                     the rather desperate purpose of taking an apartment in her very neighborhood,
                     and there watching till he should see her go out, with the determination of
                     telling her his difficulty and throwing himself upon her generosity, when
                     fortune seems to favor him with an occasion to his wish. Behold Agnes herself,
                     attended closely by her waiting-maid, walking on the opposite side of the
                     Place! His hat is on in a minute, and he is in pursuit.
                  As he nears her, the young lady reaches the Rue de la
                        Paix, and turning to enter a shop there, sees him. She looks
                     neither pleased nor surprised, but cold and collected; for Ernestin on his part
                     showed confidence and joy,â€”which piqued her pride. This he did not fail to see;
                     but incapable as in all his life, because of the fixedness of his will, of
                     profiting by his observation and his knowledge, instead of turning back, which
                     would at once have changed their relative positions, he crosses the street and
                     awaits her at a decent distance on the opposite side.
                  Now this very act had an air of intrigue about it that displeased even Ernestin
                     himself, and the shame of his own conduct, or rather of its false appearance,
                     impressed itself on his countenance; so that, when Agnes issues from the shop,
                     and she sees him approach her, directly and with such a look, her proud blood
                     boils. She looks at him steadily; but she seems to have gained a head in
                     stature, her face is very pale, her eyes dilated, and her lips are set
                     haughtily and sternly. But the lover rushed upon his fate: and it is curious,
                     that the very moment, that showed
                     Agnes to be of a spirit congenial to his own, should be the one which was to
                     sever them.
                  He is now behind her. He is at her shoulder. "Have I not undergone enough of
                     mortification?"â€” Agnes cut short what was intended for a gentle reproach.
                     "Leave me, sir!" she exclaimed, turning on him sharply, and speaking in a tone
                     loud and stern, evincing no affected anger. Fitzherbert was not the man to
                     brook such imperative language from any one, least of all where he felt it to
                     be unmerited. In a voice as loud, and a tone still more stern and passionate
                     than her own, he replied instantly. "You shall hear from me, Miss Elphinstone,
                     immediately." Agnes made her way into a shop at her right hand, and Ernestin
                     moving forward in the same moment,â€”for it was all the work of a single
                     minute,â€”encountered two gentlemen, one of whom laughed.
                  "It seems to amuse you," said Ernestin, in French.
                  "Folly usually does," was the reply.
                  "One must pay for one's amusement," rejoined Ernestin; and with his glove he
                     struck the stranger across the face.
                  Without even an exclamation, but with his teeth set, the man raised his arm
                     instantly; but the blow was arrested by his own companion, who, seizing the
                     uplifted arm, said, in a deep, earnest, and low voice, with a decided English
                     accent, "Think where you are."
                  "To-morrow then," said the Frenchman, his face distorted with rage, and his arm
                     still struggling in his companion's hand. "Your address."
                  "To-morrow," repeated Ernestin, eagerly; "now."
                  "Now then be it. Come on."
                  "No, to-morrow," interposed the Englishman. "Give me your card, sir," he said,
                     more gravely, to Ernestin. "I take upon me the management of the whole affair
                     for Monsieur d'Aubusson. Let us part, quickly."
                  Ernestin, receiving for his own the Frenchman's card, on which he read Vicomte d'Aubusson, moved off slowly, pausing
                     occasionally, till he had reached the door of his hotel, where, looking round
                     upon the party, he entered.
                  "You thwart me every way," said the Viscount fiercely to his friend and
                     volunteer second, as Ernestin turned away. "You prevented my returning that
                     blow, and now you delay my revenge. Explain yourself."
                  "It is easy. To-morrow, you may prove his courage. Now, he would face the
                     devil. Besides, you could not give him that advantage, if you would. Look
                     around you. With all these eyes upon you, think you, you could be
                     uninterrupted? Thwart you in every way, Monsieur d'Aubusson? I wish I had done
                     so in one thing; when you laughed at a misfortune that any gallant man may meet
                     at the hands of a lady. Had I checked you then, I had spared you the shame of a
                     duel in which you are unequivocally the aggressor."
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XVI.
                  TUTTO Ãˆ SCIOLTO.
                  "IT is all over now," said Agnes, as, throwing herself down in an arm-chair,
                     she attempted to untie the strings of her bonnet. But her fingers seemed to be
                     singularly awkward; for, though she pulled at both sides, she only mistook the
                     bow for the end, and when the end was reached it was too short to draw.
                  "Why, what is the matter?" said both her sisters at once, while the aunt looked
                     at her steadily, and with some uneasiness.
                  "O nothing! nothing at all!" replied Agnes, pulling at the bow again: "I have
                     done as you told me, and"â€”the bow becomes a tight knotâ€”"and I hope you are
                     satisfied." Her pale face is now in a glow. She jerks violently at the string.
                     But the crape was too strong, and her wrist was delicate.
                  Agnes," said her aunt, "compose yourself. You will bring the cap out, if you
                     pull at the strings so. Let me help you."
                  "I wish it was all pulled out! I wish I had no hat to go out in!" said Agnes,
                     catching at the string again, which only drew the knot tighter, and made the
                     blood deepen still more the hue of her beautiful face.
                  "My dear," said her aunt, gravely, "you forget the color of your hat, and why
                     you wear it. It will not be decent, to say the least of it, to tumble it as you
                     seem bent on doing." The good aunt examines the difficulty. "Why, bless me,
                     child! how have you made this knot?" And she endeavors to loosen it.
                  "You would have me do it," said Agnes. "You see what has come of it."
                  "See what has come of it? and would have you do it? Are you in your senses? Did
                     I, or either of your sisters, tell you to pull your hat-strings in this way?
                     Any one might tell that a knot would come of it, without seeing."
                  "O, I don't mean that! Don't plague me, aunt! I wish I was dead!"
                  "That explains why you were endeavoring to choke yourself. But happily this
                     prevents it." The hat is taken off. "And now, my dear, a little more coolly:
                     where have you been?"
                  "To the Rue de la Paixâ€”where I saw him."
                  "Him? So I have been suspecting all this while. And what then? He approached
                     you, of course."
                  "I tried to avoid him."
                  "What was that for?"
                  "Did you not tell me to do so? But I should not for all that"â€”
                  "No, I dare say not," said Eldon, who had just come in.
                  "Eldon, I am not talking to you. I wish, sir, you would be quiet, or go about
                     your own business."â€”Passion always brings the most refined women to vulgarity,
                     or to its verge.
                  "Fy, fy!" said the aunt. "But Eldon, be so good as not to interfere. Proceed,
                     my love."
                  "I don't know why I should. I am sorry I ever told any thing. I would not, I tell you, have avoided
                     him; for I should have been glad to have him come up. He is not a man to be
                     ashamed of, I think, among a set of shriveled, yellow Frenchmen."
                  Eldon whistled very provokingly, and drew up his cravat before the glass. Agnes
                     was dumb.
                  "Do go on, Agnes!" said her eldest sister. "Don't stop in the most interesting
                     part of your story. Did he join you?" Agnes would not speak.
                  The aunt made a sign to Eldon to be silent, and said soothingly to her niece,
                     "Agnes, it were better indeed not to have told us any thing than to be silent
                     now. I trust you will finish, nor leave us perplexed and anxious because your
                     brother chooses to have his jest."
                  Agnes did not speak, but sat biting the end of her glove, till, at last,
                     tearing down the whole of one side, she became somewhat mollified. The aunt
                     made signs to the sisters and brother to be silent, knowing well that Agnes'
                     eagerness to communicate her news would very soon re-open her lips, and the
                     sooner if they ceased to urge her to it. Her sagacity was not deceived. In a
                     few moments, Agnes, drawing together the edges of the rent, as if to see how
                     they fitted, and with her eyes fixed upon the operation, continued thus,
                     pressing all the time the doubled kid together with great assiduity:
                  "He came up to me with a look of triumphâ€”I thought it such, at least. He looked
                     so sure of my receiving him kindly, that I felt provoked, and made efforts, and
                     sincere ones, to avoid him." (The aunt again, unseen of Agnes, held up her
                     finger to Eldon, who was evidently on the point of saying something very
                     facetious.) "He was so stupid that he would not understand me; and that put me
                     in a rage; and so"â€”Agnes drew her breathâ€” "and so, when he did join me, and
                     said something, I don't know what,"â€”
                  "Very foolish, I dare say," said the brother. Agnes looked at him, without
                     remark, and continued:
                  â€”"I ordered him to leave me. I spoke loudly and passionately. And"â€” She drew
                     her breath again, and tore the glove through and through. No one interrupted
                     her this time; and in a few minutes she went on:
                  "I said, 'Leave me, sir!' and he instantly exclaimed, quite as loudly and quite
                     as passionately, following me a step, 'You shall hear from me, Miss
                     Elphinstone, immediately.'"
                  "And I suppose you will," said the elder sister. "It will be a
                     declaration."
                  "Do you take him for a fool, as Eldon does?" said Agnes harshly.
                  "Eldon does no such thing. He takes him for a very impudent fellow, as he
                     is."
                  "As he is not so to you, sir, at all events, you had better reserve that
                     epithet, until you have a right to confer it. Aunt," she added quickly, "nobody
                     here understands Mr.â€”â€” understands him, but you; and I wish I had never said
                     any thing to any body but you, save mamma, as indeed he begged meâ€”and so
                     earnestly!" Agnes was about to cry, but stifled the emotion from pride. "Aunt,
                     Gertrude talks as if he were a child, and not the most passionate, headlong man
                     I ever met with. If you had but heard his voice, as he flung away from me!â€”No,
                     he never will speak to me again! And I am sure I don't want him to." (Her
                     sisters exchanged looks, smiling very quietly.) "Only he will think I am so
                     capricious, and deceitful, andâ€”and vulgar."
                  "My dear," said her aunt, "it is after all but a lover's quarrel,â€”at least on his part, as you declare
                     you do not care for him. You will see that he will soon cool down, forgive you,
                     and be more in love with you than ever." (Agnes shook her head, though rather
                     faintly.) "Was it not so before? And has he not come on to Paris, merely to
                     follow you?"
                  Agnes' conscience now smote her violently; for these words instantly brought to
                     mind that she herself had induced him to come on; and the full extent of her
                     cruelty was now manifest to her, and mingled with it the just reflection, that
                     if he did look sure of her receiving him kindly, and so happy in that
                     certainty, he had reason, and she had acted with most unpardonable and
                     uncalled-for severity.
                  She smote her hands together, as these thoughts struck her; but she kept her
                     own secret, only saying as she rose from the chair, to retire where she might
                     give way to her feelings without shame.
                  "You know not, aunt, what reason he had to be angry. He was not before in a
                     passion when he left meâ€”never spoke to me in such a tone; and the letter, if he
                     write one, will be only to reproach me, as"â€”Agnes was about to say, "I
                     deserve." But she was not Ernestin; she was a woman; and she only added, "as
                     you made me give him occasion."
                  "And add a new item, to the account of insolence for which our family are
                     indebted to him."
                  "You are not asked to pay it, sir," said Agnes, haughtily, as she took up her
                     bonnet, and moved to the door.
                  "Perhaps I may be," said Eldon, provoked in turn. "If he continue to go on in
                     this manner, and you to permit him, there is no saying what he may do."
                  Agnes turned about and faced him, looking like a Medusa dusa,â€”as beautiful, as
                     haughty, as stern. Just so she had appeared, but alas! with less reason, to
                     Ernestin in the Place VendÃ´me.
                  "You may look as bitter as you please, Agnes," said her brother; "but you
                     cannot deny his presumption, or you would not have resented it. He takes upon
                     him as if he were a lord at least, and treats you as if you were a chambermaid.
                     A pitiful fellow like him! a dauber, I dare say; and a poetâ€”hum! for Poet's Corner."
                  The Medusa changed its stony look. The beautiful face colored up to the roots
                     of the hair, and the large eyes gleamed with a fire that looked rather
                     earthly.
                  "He may be a bad poet, and a bad painter, sir; but he is as good a gentleman as
                     yourself, and, if you talk thus, better. His family is quite equal to our
                     own."
                  "That I deny. It may be as old; and so is Adam's, if you can find it anywhere,
                     rather older. But it is not so respectable. It has no connections, no
                     influence, is never heard of anywhere."
                  "I am justly punished," said Agnes, crying bitterly; "I ought to have kept my
                     own secret, and not exposed a man who loved me to the ridicule of boys and
                     envious women."
                  Agnes was right in her self-reproach. But she knew not the extent of her
                     punishment; for she had forfeited a heart, which, though its owner had been
                     born in a hovel, and were the most neglected scribbler that ever wrote, would
                     have made him more than her equal.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XVII.
                  THE CHALLENGE.
                  IN a little room, on the third floor front, of the HÃ´tel de Bristol, there is a scene of equal excitement, but more
                     momentous.
                  The angry flush is still on Ernestin's brow, the card of the Vicomte still in his hand, and he is pacing
                     hurriedly the scanty length of his apartment, when a knock is heard at the
                     door, and a servant hands a card of the Hon. Mr. Buckhurst, which
                     is almost immediately followed by the appearance of the Viscount's English
                     companion, who, declining in silence the seat to which Ernestin silently
                     motions him, looks a moment in the latter's face as if expecting he should
                     speak first. Ernestin accordingly commences.
                  "You expect, sir, that I should refer you to some friend."
                  His visitor bows.
                  "I have none; neither here, nor in England. Where should a poet and artist find
                     any, except he be of note? which I am not." Though speaking under the
                     bitterness of the scene with Agnes,â€”for of the quarrel he recks not, not
                     now,â€”the student's tone is not sarcastic, but lofty, yet polite; and his manner
                     is accordant.
                  In spite of his noble blood, Mr. Buckhurst does not look disappointed; neither
                     does he betray surprise; and accordingly he wins directly Ernestin's esteem,
                     who sees into his soulâ€”which is the soul of a gentleman.
                  "I am sorry for the difficulty you mention," says the visitor, slowly and
                     gravely,â€”looking on Ernestin's card which he holds in his hand, as Ernestin
                     still holds the Viscount's and his own; "but it is what may happen to any man
                     in a strange country. If you will trust me, I will furnish you a second in a
                     friend of my own, who will act truly by you."
                  "Willingly, sir, and gratefully."
                  "I do not think that Major De Coucy will refuse, when he learns your dilemma.
                     He will call on youâ€”will it suit you immediately?"
                  "Say, in an hour. And receive again my grateful acknowledgments."
                  "I but render what is due to a countryman in your embarrassed position. In like
                     perplexity, you would have afforded me the same assistance. I only regret that
                     the circumstances of this affair will not let me dare to hope it will be
                     unnecessary; except "â€” He paused.
                  "Spare me. There can be no apology that shall not begin with your
                     principal."
                  And they parted,â€”with grave ceremony, as became the occasion and their relative
                     position, but mutually satisfied.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XVIII.
                  THE SECOND.
                  THERE is no time to spare. Ernestin had told Agnes she should hear from him
                     immediately. His thought, in that moment of passion, had been to write her a
                     letter of explanation and reproach, bidding her farewell forever. But he sees
                     before him the letter handed from relative to relative and from friend to
                     friend, and his gorge rises. He has as yet no idea of any other motive for
                     Agnes' capricious and violent conduct, than his delay to make her acquaintance
                     formallyâ€”as he had left her to suppose he would, and her belief that he was
                     false and had imposed on her throughout. False and an impostor! He recalls what
                     she had thrown in his teeth so pettishly, "Miss Sumner says she has no
                     knowledge of you whatever;" and, with freshened and increased resentment, he
                     rapidly resolves to appeal to Miss Margaret Evelyn as a friend, to induce her
                     to take him directly to the Rue du Helder,
                     and there, in her presence, and with her to confirm his truth and testify to
                     his honor, to bid Agnes an indignant farewell.
                  He hurries to the HÃ´tel Meurice, where the
                     Evelyns resided. It is but a few minutes distant. Miss Margaret was passing the
                     day at a friend's villa, and would not return to town till night. As he stops,
                     confounded at this mischance, Margaret's father happened to come to the door of
                     the antechamber of their apartments. Ernestin tells him of his anxiety to see
                     his daughter on a matter of emergency and to him (Ernestin) of the last
                     importance. Mr. Evelyn read something strange in his excited and earnest
                     manner, but, after a moment's hesitation, promised for Margaret that she should
                     be at home at the same hour to-morrow and receive him.
                  In the interval that remains before the appointed visit of his second, Ernestin
                     regains his composure; and when Major De Coucy enters the room, he receives him
                     with a quiet and dignified courtesy that is not without its good effect.
                  The Major is a man about his own years, with an air decidedly military, yet
                     relieved from habitual severity by the pleasantness of a well-formed and
                     amiable mouth, and large blue eyes, which, open, steady, and fearless in their
                     ordinary expression, sparkled at times with perfect good-humor. A fine straight
                     nose, and a bold, broad forehead, shaded by large, round, and dark curls,
                     already streaked with gray; whiskers, whose military trim did not prevent their
                     short, close-growing, and silky ringlets from having a most elegant appearance;
                     and a clear, but not florid complexion; completed a head that was at all times
                     handsome and very often commanding. The shaft that bore this capital was of the
                     middle height, compact and somewhat thick-set, but not vulgar, giving, with the
                     broad, full, and rather high shoulders, tokens of strength rather than
                     activity.
                  Ernestin, prone to friendship as to love, especially where the object was
                     handsome,â€”a propensity, by the way, which often led him into folly and trouble,
                     with men as with women,â€”fell almost immediately in love (if we may say so in
                     the present case) with his new visitor. Placing a seat for him,
                  
                  "I know not how I shall be able to repay this obligation to an entire
                     stranger," he said, with more than courtesy,â€”for his soul found its way into
                     his voice.
                  "Simply, by using it as if it were none at all," said the Major, prepossessed
                     in turn,â€”not the less that he saw the effect he had made. "I shall be glad to
                     assist you in this matter, Mr. Fitzherbert; but much more so, if you will
                     permit me to adjust it peaceably."
                  "With all my heart, if you can bring Monsieur d'Aubusson to make me an
                     apology," said Ernestin, with a smile; "but of that I imagine there is not much
                     chance."
                  "Oh dear, no!" said the Major. "Indeed, Buckhurst is directed to insist
                     peremptorily uponâ€”But I see," he continued, with his courageous eyes on
                     Ernestin's, "there is no need of saying any thing on that point to you. And,
                     'faith! I am glad of it; for the case is one that admits of no concessions,
                     especially on our part. I only hope you will punish the jackanapes as he
                     deserves. And now, are you ready?"
                  "Not in any thing."
                  The second-elect looked grave; an expression which his military habits made him
                     assume with ease, and often; and whose effect, as it alternated with his
                     smiles, was precisely that of passing shadows on a sunny landscape.
                  "I am sorry," continued Ernestin, "but it is an accident, and unforeseen. In
                     short, sir,â€”for I need have no secret from you in this matterâ€”you already know
                     the cause of the quarrel,â€”I must and will see that lady. The sole person who
                     can enable me to do so is unfortunately from home, and will be so till night. I
                     have made an appointment for to-morrow; rashly perhaps, but I must keep
                     it."
                  The Major stared in great astonishment. But the expression pression passed from
                     his face; and he simply said, "Can you not write, Mr. Fitzherbert?"
                  Fitzherbert's nostrils swelled outward, his eyes sparkled. "And have her show
                     the letter? No, sir. No!" He took one rapid stride up and down the room, and
                     stopping suddenly, looked full in the Major's face.
                  The Major's large and steady eyes were riveted on him for a moment. There was
                     no mistaking the student's sincerity. So his second said cheerfully, "You are
                     right, sir. The meeting shall not be till the day after to-morrow."
                  "But the cause, Major De Coucy, rests solely with you."
                  "Certainly. There are enough reasons for deferring such a meeting for
                     twenty-four hours,â€”though it is unusual. He shall suppose your affairs need
                     winding up, or any thing he pleases. I shall simply pronounce it impossible for
                     to-morrow."
                  How greatly the soldier rose in the poet's estimation, by this unwillingness to
                     tell a falsehood! "That will best please me," he replied.â€”"I am greatly your
                     debtor, sir."
                  "You would be more so, could we put it off forever, and your honor saved.
                     Adieu, Mr. Fitzherbert. I will call in again, on special business,
                     inâ€”-when?"
                  "In an hour, if you please; or sooner; or later; any time. Will you dine with
                     me?"
                  "With pleasure."
                  "At five, then."
                  "At five." The Major bowed low; and Ernestin, bowing lower, saw him to the head
                     of the staircase. There was evident admiration on one side, and the germ of
                     respect on the other.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XIX.
                  AFTER DINNER.
                  AT a few minutes before five, Ernestin, who had passed the interval in setting
                     his affairs in order,â€”which was nothing more than disposing of his literary
                     remains by will, and writing several letters, to be delivered in case of his
                     death, one of which was to Agnes,â€”Ernestin, in a handsome parlor of the hotel
                     received his guest, who entered followed by a servant bearing a rosewood box,
                     of a shape that spoke decidedly for its contents. This the Major took from the
                     manâ€”who then left the room, and, setting it on a table, replied to
                     Fitzherbert's natural observation, as his eye rested on the case, "You put me
                     under great obligations, Major De Coucy,"â€”"After dinner you shall judge of
                     that. Till then, let us lose sight of an unpleasant business."
                  And lose it they did. The Major, who was a good talker, found little difficulty
                     in amusing Ernestin, who, in addition to his natural vivacity, was so rarely in
                     society that it had for him always all the zest of a new thing. Admiring too De
                     Coucy more and more, and gazing with satisfaction on his features, and with
                     delight upon his hair and beard, as much so as if they were of his own
                     creation, the artist actually forgot Agnes, and even the occasion to which he
                     owed his company, till the Major himself, when, the dessert removed, they sat
                     over their wine and sweet biscuit, seeing that Ernestin only trifled with his
                     glass, and too polite to allow him to do violence to his inclinations, said:
                     "Before it grows too dark, let us attend to the special business I alluded
                     to."
                  So saying, he moved, followed by Ernestin, to the table where stood the
                     pistol-case, and drew from his pocket the key.
                  "You shall now," he said, proceeding to open the box, "see, as I promised you,
                     whether you have reason to be obliged to me.â€”Your adversary, Mr. Fitzherbert,
                     considering himself the aggrieved party, insists upon the choice of weapons,
                     and selects fire-arms. If you have any preference, however, for the
                     small-sword," continued the Major, taking out, and with evident satisfaction,
                     one of a pair of superb pistols, "I think we might arrange the matter. Have you
                     any practice?"
                  "None with either weapon."
                  "So I feared; and it is therefore that I have brought these; for I cannot teach
                     you the small-sword in a few hours, but I can make you sufficiently familiar
                     with this weapon.â€”Observe me, Mr. Fitzherbert. It is habit only, practice, that
                     makes us adroit in the use of any implement; natural adaptation and dexterity
                     can only give us an advantage over others, where practice is on both sides
                     equal. A man whose hand has never clasped the stock of a pistol, though he were
                     the coolest fellow in the world, and with the best eye, will use it awkwardly;
                     but, when the hand and weapon are no longer strangers, he will do, as if it
                     were naturally, what, done naturally and like an act of simple instinct, cannot
                     but be done well. Let me see," looking around him. "This room will answer the
                     purpose very well." The Major stepped out, pistol in hand.
                  
                  "But it will hardly be"â€”
                  "Admissible?" quoth the Major, laughing, as he saw Ernestin's mistake and
                     embarrassment. "Oh, we are not going to fire in this room. All you
                     can expect to learn here, is to pull trigger at a fixed object in a given time.
                     It is not practice, but it is the best substitute we can have just now, and it
                     will make your hand and eye familiar with the instrument. See!" De Coucy fitted
                     a cap to the weapon he held, and, aiming at his own image in the glass, snapped
                     it. "There; that is all. I will lock the door, that we may not be interrupted."
                     Ernestin did it for him. "And now, you shall begin. So. The elbow a little
                     closer to the side. Very well. It is a little awkward at first; but you will
                     soon get into position. Now, snap away, the moment I give the word. Aim well,
                     if you can; but, no matter how you aim, don't stop; let your finger touch the
                     hair at the very instant."
                  Fitzherbert, not over pleased, (a man with his pride and his sense of the
                     ludicrous could not well be,) yet acknowledging in his reason the necessity of
                     the performance, and bound by the Major's very kindness to be docile, stood in
                     place, sidewise before the glass; and when De Coucy had got his arm and body to
                     his satisfaction, he began.
                  "One, two, three, fire!â€”One, two, three, fire!â€”Quicker! One, two, three, fire!
                     Pretty well.â€”One, two, three, fire!â€”one, two, three, fire! You are quick
                     already.â€”One, two, three, fire! one, two, three, fire! one, two, three, fire!
                     Bravo! Men like you learn every thing with so much facility! Now you must
                     promise, when I am gone you will crack a cap or two at yourself in the glass.
                     Come, no demurring; you have much practice to take in a little while, and it is
                     too late just now to go to a gallery."
                  "Well, if it prove not too ridiculous."
                  "O, never think of it! What you have to guard against, my dear fellow, is
                     surprise. You are a man of high spirit, and, I dare say, actually brave; you
                     certainly have the higher kind of courage, I see that plainly; but men of your
                     temper have to guard against starting, against being thrown off their guard. I
                     have known such a man to behave like a coward, and that too in the face of real
                     cowards, when, behind their backs, and with none but his adversary, (which
                     tries men's mettle most; for few fight well, or suffer well, without
                     spectators,) he came up to the mark most handsomely, as his foe was forced to
                     admit. In the Peninsular war, when I was but an ensign, I remember, at the
                     first crack of the musketry and roar of the cannon, I felt very much as if I
                     should like to run awayâ€”would no one see me; but finding dead men fall about
                     me, while I stood as if invulnerable, I began to act as if I were so, and soon,
                     may God forgive me! took real pleasure in massacring, or aiding the massacre of
                     His creatures. It is all habit" (putting on his gloves); "and you must make
                     your ear grow Irish, as Byron says, and less nice.
                     Shrewd fellow, that Byron! so much common-sense! Good b'ye. Now remember, touch
                     trigger as you level, and snap at your hostess's mirror.â€”And hark you," he
                     added, (coming back,) "don't think too much on this affair; no more than if
                     itâ€”don't think on it at all. I won't trust the imagination of any man. In that
                     respect, your fellows of no brains have a prodigious advantage, especially if
                     they have dull nerves. Besides, a fine man like you, an artist too, will be
                     sure to think of mutilation and disfigurement."
                  "You are of the thinking of CÃ¦sar, Major De Coucy." But Ernestin spoke without
                     a smile.
                  
                  "CÃ¦sar? Great man! With firmer principles, or less ambition, Omnis Gallia had been the best fellow in the world.
                     No reflection, remember." [Going.]
                  "I shall have no time for it." Ernestin still speaks seriously, and, for some
                     reason, has his eyes fixed coldly on the Major.
                  "Ah, pardon me! Nay, no apology; I know you did not mean it for a hint; but I
                     must take it for such."
                  "Major De Coucy," said Ernestin, as his guest, thus speaking and saluting him,
                     turned his back,â€”"one moment." De Coucy returned; and Ernestin shut the door,
                     which he was holding open. "I see, sir," he said, "you distrust me, because of
                     my profession. You have no cause. Life and health I value only as they bring me
                     honor. Since, without I bear myself as the world expects me in this affair, I
                     must lose honor, the certainty of death itself could not make me falter. When
                     the hour comes, I shall not disgrace your favor."
                  "I believe it, sir," replied the Major, gravely; "I have not doubted it. Men of
                     your mettle never are backward where there is a question of honor or of good
                     name. I but assumed that gaiety as my duty, and in all other points have but
                     acted as I would have you do to me, were I in your position and equally
                     unexperienced. Good day, once more, Mr. Fitzherbert. The hour you speak of will
                     not cut short our acquaintance."
                  Bowing with an air in which respect and esteem were both mingled in the most
                     flattering manner with a warmer interest, Major De Coucy left the room.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XX.
                  THE VISIT.
                  THE next day, at the time appointed for his visit, Ernestin repairs in a
                     carriage to the HÃ´tel Meurice. Miss Margaret
                     Evelyn has again left town. No apology is offered on her part by the servant,
                     who seems to enjoy his astonishment. Mortified even that a menial should be
                     conscious of the slight put upon him, Ernestin turned away without a word. "Out
                     again," he said to himself, as he descended the stairs, "when her own father
                     made the appointment! when I had said that my object was of the last
                     importance! And no excuse sent to me; no apology left even with the servant.
                     Why did I not do yesterday what I must now do after all!â€”HÃ´tel de Helder," he said aloud, to the coachman:
                     "Drive slowly."
                  Now Ernestin had been the victim in former years of a most unexampled
                     treachery. A man who was almost the last on earth at whose hands he could have
                     expected such an injury, but who had secretly nourished hatred and envy of
                     Ernestin all the time he was professing attachment, had endeavored by means of
                     anonymous letters to destroy his literary reputation nor only that but to
                     undermine his personal character. The excess of his malignity had defeated its
                     object, and Ernestin, discovering the plot, had in the moment of indignation
                     reproached its author in no measured
                     terms. Conscious that he had thereby added venom to the man's malice, yet
                     incapable of caution however sensible of his danger, Ernestin, the most
                     forgiving person in the world, swept the whole affair from his thoughts, nay,
                     in time, although distrusting his repentance, admitted the party again to his
                     personal intercourse if not his friendship, until circumstances made him
                     certain that his enemy had got the servants of the family, being women,
                     completely in his power, and was employing them as spies about him. Detecting
                     more than once the waiting-maid examining his papers, and listening behind the
                     doors when he was in conversation, he would have had her dismissed at once; but
                     he was less than a unit in his mother's house, and his hints to that effect
                     were all in vain. He even tried to make his mother sensible of the girl's
                     debauchery; but his mother's habitual opposition to his wishes and her natural
                     self-will made her blind to signs that were grossly palpable. On one occasion,
                     when Ernestin in the joy of his heart was talking of Agnes to his mother, the
                     latter, respecting his secret, suddenly exclaimed that somebody was listening
                     behind the door. Ernestin paused for a moment; but his blood was warmed, and he
                     returned immediately to the untiring theme. Soon afterward however, he had
                     occasion to see that his dearest secret, or at least a clue to it, was in the
                     hands of the very person from whom he was most desirous of keeping it
                     concealed. Malignant people are very apt, in the supposed triumph of their
                     malice, to betray themselves to the very objects of that malice, especially
                     when the latter are frank-hearted and ingenuous. Knowing no sagacity but the
                     cunning of their own nature, whose observation is usually limited to the
                     knowledge of their own hearts, by which they measure all others, persons of
                     this character are apt to overrate the simplicity of noble spirits. They see
                     them practising no disguise and too lofty to stoop to artifice, and finding in
                     their own hearts no clue to such a conduct, they ascribe it to a want of
                     practical wisdom and of moral perspicacity, and think they may impose on them
                     with ease; whereas I am well convinced there is no depth in the human heart so
                     unfathomable as that of an upright and generous nature. To the bad, it is a
                     perfect mystery. The lightning and the thunder-cloud we scan with ease; but the
                     deeps of the blue serene, who has measured them? Ernestin finding, more than
                     once, the party in question unskillfully introduce the name of Elphinstone when he was by, and, when he did so, bend his dark eyes on
                     Ernestin with an expression both impertinent and malicious, was satisfied of
                     the motive. He betrayed no emotion as was expected; for "the snare is spread in
                     vain in the sight of any bird;" but he remembered; and when he thought of his
                     perplexed position with Agnes, he almost trembled.
                  Now it is not wonderful, that meeting with so strange behavior on the part of a
                     lady amiable and uniformly polite like Margaret Evelyn, one too with whom he
                     knew himself to be somewhat of a favorite, and coupling it in his mind with the
                     fatal encounter with Agnes and the latter's haughty and indignant carriage, he
                     should revert to his apprehensions of treachery, and, having been once the
                     subject of anonymous aspersions, should fear that the same contemptible
                     practices had been resorted to, to defeat his love as his ambition.
                  In a state of mind more easily to be conceived than described, he is driven to
                     the Rue du Helder, and to the hotel.
                     Inquiring if Madame de Beauvais resided there, the portress replied, "Yes,
                     monsieur; but you are just in time;
                     the family are leaving for the country. Second floor, first door to your right,
                     No. 30. Be so good as to go up."
                  On the landing of the second floor were indications of an immediate removal;
                     and at the first door on the right stood Eldon Elphinstone, overlooking the
                     porters. Ernestin had prepared one of his cards so that it read, "Will Miss Elphinstone do Mr. Ernestin Fitzherbert the honor of seeing
                     him for a few moments in company with her aunt?" Not knowing the name of the
                     eldest sister, he had underscored the word Miss, that there might
                     be no mistake in the person. Handing the card to Eldon, and repeating the wish
                     he had expressed thereon, he said, "If your sister cannot see me, perhaps you
                     will yourself do me that favor."
                  Eldon, who has taken the card gravely but courteously, looked a little
                     surprised at this, but merely begged him civilly to wait a moment in the
                     antechamber, while he made inquiry. In a few moments, the youth returned and
                     led him into the parlor, and inviting him to be seated left him,â€”behaving in
                     all respects, notwithstanding his prejudice, politely; but with a gravity and
                     steadiness beyond his years, and which under the circumstances raised him
                     greatly in Ernestin's good opinion.
                  But Ernestin did not sit down. He came uninvited, and with no amicable
                     intentions, and there was a feeling in his breast that would not let him. So he
                     remained standing, and leaned upon the mantlepiece, hat in hand, awaiting with
                     a swollen heart the coming of Agnes' sister. But first it was amusing to
                     observe, that this really indignant and proud man, who was rendered still more
                     lofty than usual by that elevation which comes from a sense of sustained
                     injustice, went before an old convex mirror that hung high in the chamber, to
                     see if his hair were displaced, and caughtâ€”I hope to his satisfactionâ€”the
                     reflection of a head the size and shape of a pippin.
                  He had full time to make himself uncomfortable; for, like most delicate-minded
                     men, who are at once proud and unselfish, he had a great dislike of giving
                     people trouble, and remembering the tokens of departure in the anteroom, he
                     felt sorry, more even than annoyed, that he had thought himself obliged to
                     defer this visit to a moment that happened to be so unsuitable. He had full
                     time; for it seemed to him that he was kept in waiting nearly half an hour;
                     when behold Madame de Beauvais entered the parlor, and with her, not Miss
                     Elphinstone, but Agnes!
                  It has been said,15 that a woman who takes time to prepare herself
                     to see her lover, and one who hurries precipitately to meet him, afford him
                     equal grounds to believe himself beloved. I am apt to think that in the former
                     case it betrays rather a love of self; for, though it does indeed betoken
                     anxiety to please, yet the same will in a vain woman arise on every occasion
                     and be shown in favor of every visitant. I have heard of a lady in real life,
                     who was so impatient to see her lover, returned unexpectedly from travel, that,
                     being in the bath at the time he called, she jumped out of it instantly, and
                     could scarcely be prevented from running to him wet as she was and in her
                     shift. Perhaps she appeared to most advantage thus; but, at all events, I would
                     rather my heart's mistress should be so eager, than that she should wait to
                     deck herself; not that I might see her en
                        chemise,â€”I beg to be understood as having no such idea; but
                     because it would persuade me that she was eager to see me, while,
                     in the other case, I should feel assured she cared only that I should see
                        her. A woman that is excessively vain will often take as
                        much time to prepare to see a
                     man's mother, as she would to see himself, though she loved him. This I have
                     known.
                  Since it was Agnes that now appeared, Ernestin in her delay might see a new
                     proof of the real feelings with which the girl regarded him. She was solicitous
                     to appear well in his eyes; but it was merely to secure him; whereas,
                     Fitzherbert was to be secured only by loving him, and loving him she would less
                     have thought of herself.
                  In the sincerity of his own nature, never believing that Agnes, after her late
                     violent repulse of him, would care to look on him againâ€”though his experience
                     in women should have told him there was therefore all the better chance of it,
                     Ernestin is so confounded as for an instant to be struck dumb; but in the next,
                     when he sees her gliding towards him with an air of triumph and a smile of
                     perfect self-complacency, he is filled with indignation and disgust.
                  That credulous vanity which he had found in other women, never to doubt the
                     power of their charms, or to suppose for one moment the possibility that
                     ill-treatment on their part might change affection into indifference or hatred,
                     and esteem into disdain,16 that vanity which had led poor Agnes,
                     deceived by the equivocal designation on his card, to believe that he was come,
                     as her sisters suggested, to make proposals, was not to be shaken by the
                     disappointment of her mistake.
                  "I begged permission," said Ernestin, opening his eyes in great astonishment,
                     and speaking not very amiably, "to see Miss Elphinstone, not Miss
                        Agnes Elphinstone."
                  "If you wish to see my sister," said Agnes, "I will call her." And she turned
                     to leave the room.
                  It was not the woman that had repulsed him so haughtily the day before, not the
                     beautiful Medusa, but the flippant pant girl who "never told her age to any
                     body," that now spoke, and speaking in that manner, with that tone, she was not
                     likely to soothe a man justly irritated against her, one moreover, in his
                     calmest moments, not easily satisfied. But that man was habitually tender of
                     the feelings of others; and besides, as a gentleman, he could not add to the
                     mortification of her mistake the indignity of sending her from him.
                  "No," he said, hastily; "since you have done me this honor, I pray you to
                     remain."
                  Now, had Agnes persisted in going, had she retired with dignity and in silence,
                     all the bitterness of his feelings had yielded to respect and admiration, and
                     the charity of his gentler nature had filled him with pity and remorse. But the
                     student's prayers had been heard; and a higher power was directing him
                     insensibly to the sacrifice of the temporal to secure the eternal. Agnes
                     returned, and resumed her self-complacency, and Ernestin, as a natural
                     consequence, his resentment. In fact, he was, though unconsciously, meting out
                     to her in her own measure her own grain: in other phrase, he had completely
                     turned the tables upon her,â€”and from the operation of a like cause, the smart
                     of wounded self-love.
                  Mad. de Beauvais saw clearly the false position of her niece, and its effect;
                     and her looks revealed so much to Ernestin,â€”whom she now requested, gravely and
                     with dignity, to be seated.
                  "I cannot sit in this house," said Ernestin, bowing, and with like gravity;
                     "but permit me to place chairs for you." So saying, he arranged seats for them
                     both, and stood up before them. Had he been in their place, the visitor
                     afterwards thought, he would have said, "Unless you sit down, sir, you will
                     oblige us to stand up;" but he
                     remembered, and with bitterness, that he carried his ideas of courtesy further
                     than most people.
                  "The wrong that has been done me here," he proceeded, pressing his hand
                     closely, but with a slow movement, on his heart, "will not let me rest. I have
                     come"â€”He went on to state why it was not on the instant, as he had promised (he
                     might have said threatened) yesterday, and the unaccountable
                     conduct of Miss Margaret Evelyn, which he rashly characterized as premeditated
                        insult. His hearers looked surprised; and with reason: he
                     should have said affront, or slight; but, impetuous
                     at all times, Ernestin was not now in the mood to weigh his words.
                  He entered on the scene of yesterday. "Was there no other means of driving me
                     away than that? In the midst, too, of a group of people? when my prosperity, my
                     life I may say, depends upon my reputation."
                  Again they looked surprised; but this time with small reason; for he was
                     perfectly right. He judged her by himself. In her place, he would have said in
                     an under tone, "Unless you leave me, sir, you will force me to take refuge in
                     some shop." Spoken sincerely, such an intimation could not have been mistaken.
                     But do as she had done, he could not, did his life depend on it. But Ernestin
                     knew not one thingâ€”not then,â€”that Agnes was irritated, put beside herself in
                     fact, by what she thought his impertinent confidence of success.
                  It was a natural step to allude to their first interview; and he said, that,
                     knowing his hesitation to approach, Miss Agnes Elphinstone ought to have
                     accorded him a better reception when he did so, as she could not but have
                     expected it.
                  "I did not know who it was," returned Agnes; "I thought you said your name was
                     Fitzurse."
                  She had turned away her eyes from Ernestin, and spoke as if addressing her
                     aunt, who seemed surprised. But Ernestinâ€”how coldly he looked on the averted
                     head! with what displeased surprise! Fitzurse! a name so rare as
                     to be almost singular; and his brother's name was on the door of the house, and
                     met her eyes whenever she had passed! How cold he looked, and how severe!
                  Poor Agnes! it is thy fate to be mistaken. As good as Ernestin, as affectionate
                     perhaps, if less impassioned, as noble in nature, though of less enlightenment
                     and spoiled by education, as truthful for thy years and sex, he is destined to
                     misjudge thee always and to see thee only by thy faults. Thy
                     faults! Sweet Agnes! has he then none? Look at this Ernestin! this
                     sensitive and high-souled man, who thinks he could more easily die than tell a
                     falsehood, and who detests equivocation even in a woman; yet, in the walk from
                     the church at Chelsea, he took care to lay an emphasis on his intention to have
                     gone to town that night, and his change of purpose to hear the preacher at St.
                     Luke's, lest Agnes should suppose he had come there to catch a glimpse of her,
                     though in his secret soul he knew he had gone thither for little else! And what
                     was his deceit? how would he have designated that?
                     Hers was no greater; she did indeed know his name, but she had really thought
                     he said Fitzurse, and in her jealousy, lest he should think she
                     had interested herself too much about him, insists upon it. If this pretense is
                     falsehood, so was the other; and they were both of one family,â€”the prolific one
                     of Love and Self-love, a pair that jar incessantly, yet propagate in perfect
                        harmony.17
                  
                  So cold and so severe he looked, the aunt, in the good-natured desire of
                     preventing these silly children, this big boy and this little girl, from
                     putting out their own eyes, remarked
                     graciously, addressing him by his name, that all that Agnes objected to was his
                     joining her in the street.
                  Fitzherbert was certainly a very ungrateful fellow, for instead of looking
                     gratified by this piece of information, which Agnes heard on her part without
                     dismay, he looked absolutely astounded. There was then no sinister motive for
                     repelling him! she had not been indignant at his delay to make the acquaintance
                     of her family! Had she then concealed from Madame de Beauvais her encouragement
                     of Ernestin, while she told her all the rest? His displeasure augmented,â€”not
                     the less so that Agnes' manner contradicted what the aunt would seem to
                     intimate; for a woman conscious of partiality for a man would have been
                     troubled by this betrayal of it in his presence.
                  "What could I do, madam?" said Ernestin. "I have told Miss Agnes" (and he faced
                     the latter) "that I had no acquaintances; I have been out of society for many
                     years. I was in hopes she might have known the Savilles; and I have sought once
                     in vain for an introduction from Miss Margaret Evelyn. I promised that if you
                     would sanction the use of your name as willing to receive me, I would again
                     request it at her hands"â€”
                  "I told you," said Agnes, "I should be always happy to receive any gentleman."
                     This quasi-disclaimer, though not put in impatiently, did not help the matter,
                     not with Ernestin. Besides, the "said" and "told," bandied between the parties,
                     boded no good.
                  "And I," returned Fitzherbert, "when I went out to meet you yesterday, had no
                     other motive, I call Heaven to witness, than to tell you I could not bring
                     myself to keep my word. I might perhaps have applied to my sister, who among
                     her acquaintances has probably some who may know you."
                  "Yes," said Agnes, interposing her delicious voice, and looking amiable. But
                     there was too much self-complacency in her smile. She meant to encourage
                     Ernestin, and thereby offended him, who could be shaken from his purpose only
                     by timidity and deference, not by assumption.
                  "But," he continued, "I should then have had to reveal a secret which I have
                     kept sacred from all but my mother; and even to her I have repented of
                     revealing it. Nor has it been my least annoyance to find that you have acted so
                     differently, and that I have been made the laughing-stock of all your
                     acquaintance."
                  "I have never," said Agnes,â€”but she spoke with embarrassment and turned to her
                     aunt as if for confirmation of her statement,â€”"I have never spoken of you
                     except to our own family."
                  "And our immediate friends," added Madame de Beauvais.
                  Perhaps he did not hear the aunt's qualification, or in the romantic haste to
                     make atonement where he thought he had been unjust, which distinguished him,
                     and which exposed him continually to bitter disappointment and
                        disgust,18 he overlooked it; for he answered: "Then I have done
                     you gross injustice; and I ask your pardon."
                  There was a pause; and Ernestin, remembering it was not for this parley he had
                     come, abruptly entered on his purpose.
                  "I have now to beg you, Miss Elphinstone, to ask Miss Margaret Evelyn, if I was
                     indeed dreaming, when I supposed that I had met Miss Sumner at her house and
                     conversed with her, and that she promised to give me an occasion of renewing
                     the acquaintance."
                  "I am not very intimate with Miss Evelyn," said the imperturbable Agnes.
                  
                  "Perhaps, madam," (turning to the aunt,) "you will do me that favorâ€”that
                     justice?"
                  "Indeed sir," said Madame de Beauvais, with some embarrassment, and looking at
                     her niece as if to say, What a strange animal!â€”for she did not
                     know what could make the inquiry of so much moment to Ernestinâ€”"Indeed sir, I
                     have scarcely any acquaintance with the lady you speak of."
                  "Then," said Ernestin, "I can but repeat what I have already said to Miss
                     Agnes. It was I think Miss Constance Sumner." (Agnes bowed.) "We lived at that
                     timeâ€”about six years agoâ€”nearly opposite the Evelyns, and I returned home to
                     get some of my own music for Miss Sumner"â€”Agnes' eyebrows rose and her lips
                     assumed a corresponding expression of mockery, although she was at the moment
                     looking full at Ernestin! There needed but that to finish her work.
                  Without ceasing to speak, though he observed and pondered all the while, he
                     continued in his natural tone. "I remember the piece distinctly. It was the
                        Deh! non voler of Donizetti."â€”
                  "Yes," assentingly, and in the sweet way she always said yes, "Yes," said
                     Agnes, as he paused a breathing while. And Ernestin went on:
                  â€”"But, as I possessed the score, it was set too high for Miss Sumner's voice,
                     and she promised that one day, should she see me again, she would sing it from
                     her own copy."
                  "As you say it was six years ago, she might well have forgotten," observed
                     Agnes.
                  "And so I suppose. Indeed I could hardly expect a lady to remember me, whom I
                     did not fully recognize myself. As I have told you, it was the transient
                     intercourse of a single evening. I had no idea that the acquaintance of any
                     lady," continued Ernestin, drawing himself erect and speaking scornfully, while
                     Agnes, who was looking full on him, again assumed an expression of mockery and
                     amusement, "I had no idea that the acquaintance of any lady could do me so much
                     honor"â€”The expression changes, and in its stead the beautiful lips show pain
                     and uneasiness. She imagines he refers to her, and dreads the conclusion. But
                     he addsâ€”"that I should be thought to boast of it;" and the sky of that sweet
                     face, that was obscuring, grows perfectly cloudless. It is not for long; for he
                     whom they had thought they admitted as a suppliant added, with bitter emphasis:
                     "But you have been mistaken in me, as I have been in you."
                  Agnes made no reply, not even with her face, whose unresisting and subdued
                     expression was not without effect on a temper which retort would have
                     exasperated. Madame de Beauvais' gravity grew deeper. There was a pause. Agnes
                     cast down her eyes, and seemed to be considering the cut of Ernestin's boot,
                     while from some secret cause, probably the sense of humiliation she could not
                     help but feel, a deep red spot appeared in her cheek and spread rapidly. Madame
                     de Beauvais regards the sign with uneasiness for her niece and severity for
                     Ernestin. And Ernestin himself became embarrassed. He had come there to unravel
                     a plot of treachery and to vindicate his honor, but found no plot, and his
                     honor not in question; he had come to talk seriously with Agnes' sister, but
                     had met instead Agnes herself, who had already heard all he had to plead. His
                     own eyes are on the floor. Without raising them, he said abruptly, "However, I
                     will not detain you any longer," and bowing repeatedly, as he retreated
                     backward from the room, while neither Madame de Beauvais nor Agnes rose, nor inclined their headsâ€”a want of
                     courtesy which not even resentment could justify and only surprise
                     excuse,â€”withdrew,â€”forgetting, himself, in the embarrassment of the moment, that
                     there was a courtesy due on his part, and that was to thank Madame de Beauvais
                     for the favor she had done him, and to apologize for the inconvenience he had
                     put her to at such a time.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXI.
                  BEHIND THE SCENES.
                  WHEN their visitor was gone, the two ladies looked at one another, and Madame
                     de Beauvais was the first to speak.
                  "It is indeed 'all over now,' I am afraid."
                  "Afraid?" said Agnes briskly. "I am sure, I am very glad of it, aunt. I have
                     got rid of a tyrant!" This last sentence was uttered with a burst of emotion;
                     anger and disappointment having, like contrary winds, blown up a gust for the
                     moment.
                  "I am not so sure of that, my dear. I have had the experience of two husbands,
                     and should know something about these lords of ours. My first was very much
                     such a man as Mr. Fitzherbert,â€”I mean in temper; for he was younger and a much
                     handsomer man;â€”and I found him any thing but a tyrant, after I had ceased to be
                     a rebel."
                  "What! you did then"â€”
                  "Act like a fool, my dear. I did at first. It was a very few weeks after our
                     marriage, when taking it upon me to resist his authority in some trifling
                     matter or other, Mr. O'Neil became perfectly furious. He put his hand upon my
                     arm. I do not think he meant to hurt me. But he was a tall man, like your
                     lover, and my little bones were not of iron. 'You hurt me, sir,' I said,
                     drawing away from him pettishly; and, as I spoke, I turned down my glove, hoping, wickedly, to find a blue mark
                     on my skin: but it was only red. 'I wish,' I said, encouraged by his silence,
                     'I wish, Mr. O'Neil, you would not paw me so violently. I am not your cub.'
                     Now, if any thing O'Neil detested, Irishman though he was, it was
                     vulgarity,â€”especially in women; and both my language and my manner were any
                     thing but ladylike. I saw my error in an instant, for his passion seemed to be
                     swallowed up in astonishment and disgust; but instead of throwing my arms about
                     his neck, like a woman of sense and feeling, and crying him into forgiveness, I
                     merely threw up my head, and stalked by him out of the room,â€”which with my
                     little figure must have looked very ridiculous."
                  "And did he laugh?"
                  "Laugh? O'Neil laugh? Laugh at his wife's impertinence? Your true lovers,
                     Agnes, are always serious; and O'Neil loved meâ€”better far than I deserved.
                     Really, I am crying only at the thought of it."
                  "Dear aunt!"
                  "The weakness only of a moment, my child. We cannot think of Paradise without
                     emotion, when its walls are shut on us forever. You see I can be poetical as
                     well asâ€”other folk.â€”You asked me if my husband laughed. I heard not a sound. I
                     did not dare to look at him. He never stirred, where he stood near the door, as
                     I swept by him to my chamber. But I made noise enough for us both, as I shut
                     the door so that it echoed over the whole house.â€”It was near the hour of
                     dinner. When that time had come, I was already in a fair way of repentance; for
                     my husband's silence had something of more serious displeasure in it than if he
                     had followed me in a fury. As I lounged on the bed, my maid knocks, and on
                     entering tells me that Mr. O'Neil is waiting. 'Tell your master,' said I, 'that
                     I shall not come down.'â€”'Ma'am!' said the girl, in great surprise. I felt I was
                     going too far. 'I mean, say to him that I am too unwell to come down.'
                     Presently the girl returns, looking very serious. 'Ma'am, master bade me tell
                     youâ€”it was his orders, ma'am,â€”that he expects you to descend immediately. For
                     heaven's sake! ma'am, don't say any thing, but go; do go!'â€”'What ails the girl?
                     Is he in such a passion?'â€”-O no, ma'am; he was as cool as a cowcumber, and
                     spoke very quiet; but his eyes looked awful, and his voice sounded as if it
                     came right up from the bottom of his heart.' There was a struggle in my breast.
                     But the girl's evident fright added to my own disturbance, and pride would back
                     my folly no longer. I set the girl at my hair, which she arranged very quickly,
                     and descended to the dining-room. My husband signed to the waiter to quit the
                     room. 'You have kept me too long waiting, madam,' he said, coldly, and
                     resolutely, but not sternly. 'I desire that this conduct will not be repeated.'
                     I burst into tears. 'Fanny,' said my husband, without the least emotion, 'the
                     tears of a petulant temper are not those I wish to see you shed. Ask
                     forgiveness of your Maker in private, and when you weep before me, not from
                     wounded pride, but in sorrow at your misconduct, you will not fail to touch
                     me.'â€”'I don't want to touch you, sir. I know that is impossible, now, though it
                     was not so before marriage;' and I really believe I put the tablecloth to my
                     eyes; for I was now quite blind with spite if not with weeping. 'Mrs. O'Neil,'
                     said my husband, 'drop that cloth, and look at me.' There was something so
                     terrific in his voice, though it was not loud, that I obeyed in spite of
                     myself. His eyes were enlarged, and had a look in them, that I could not take
                     my own off, though they frightened me. 'You have this day evinced a temper, madam, that I never
                     supposed you possessed. Change it, or conceal it henceforth. While we are in
                     harmony, there is no disparity between us; but, once discordant, we cease to be
                     equals, and I, madam, am your master. This I would have you observe. In my own
                     house, I will be obeyed by every body that is of my household, and by you first
                     of all.â€”What shall I serve you with?' There was no use of resisting. And I
                     never pouted afterward."
                  "And you could live with such a man?"
                  "Don't put up that pretty lip so high, my dear. I tell you, I would to God it
                     were to do again. Live with O'Neil! He was a man that a woman might die for,
                     though she had fifty lives and as many souls to answer for. My other husband,
                     the Frenchman, was a perfect icicle. He did not even shrug his shoulders, nor
                     take snuff, if I was out of humor, but let me have my way in all things."
                  "How delightful!"
                  "Are you mad? Would you marry a block, or a lover? Monsieur de Beauvais would
                     not have denied himself a minute's ease to procure me an age of pleasure;
                     O'Neil would have ventured his neck but to get me a trifle I had set my heart
                     on. Nay, he never waited for that. He seemed to see into my wishes by
                     intuition. Every desire was anticipated. I used to wonder that, having so much
                     else to think of, he could find time to be forever occupied as he seemed to be
                     with consideration for my good. Once I was taken ill in the night. But I needed
                     no doctor, when I saw this tyrant as you would call him spring out of my bed,
                     his face wild with anxiety, and a few moments after, despite my remonstrances,
                     heard him mount his horse (our only man-servant having left us that morning)
                     and ride off to Dublin, seven miles, of a winter's night, for the physician.
                     Agnes, I tell you what I did: I fell on my knees and prayed God to make me
                     worthy such a man."
                  "It is a good story, aunt; but I do not see its application toâ€”to this person's
                     impertinence."
                  "Fy, fy!" (the exclamation was meant for the last energetic expression.) "You
                     mean, you will not. Yet it has both application and moral. And they are these.
                     First,â€”I am not so sure that you will suit Mr. Fitzherbert, as that Mr.
                     Fitzherbert will suit you: secondly,â€”Too much love, or indeed too much of any
                     thing very good in men, is apt to make us women ungrateful."
                  Agnes went to her room, and wept.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXII.
                  THE EYES.
                  AGNES went to her room to weep; but not from wounded love. She had none to
                     suffer injury.
                  "That he should dare to treat me so! I could cry my eyes out! I wish I had no
                     eyes!"
                  With a natural action, Agnes rose and looked in a mirror. Her eyes were
                     beautiful as a new-created angel's.
                  So Agnes thought better of it, and kept them in.
                  Let us leave her to a repentance that does not equal what Ernestin himself will
                     one day feel, and to a hope which haply may not ever know fulfilment, and
                     follow the seeker of the unattainable, who returns to his lodgings with a
                     feeling of desperateness that may be likened to that of the mariner who sees
                     his ship go down in middle ocean, and finds he is alone upon a plank.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIII.
                  THE SHOOTING-GALLERY.
                  MAJOR DE COUCY was in the parlor which Ernestin had taken care to reserve, and
                     where he had left word that he should await him. The Major was examining the
                     locks of his pistols, when the student entered.
                  "I am now fit for any thing," said Ernestin, drawing off his gloves, and
                     folding them in one another and unfolding them, two or three times, with great
                     rapidity, while he walked with tremendous strides up and down the room, then
                     flinging them forcibly on the table and coming to a halt,â€”"I am now fit for any
                     thingâ€”except to go to the devil."
                  "Then you are in the very mood for this business of ours," said De Coucy, "and
                     for a brief rehearsal I propose to give you, since we cannot have the act
                     itself." And without a second look at him, the Major disposed the weapons, and
                     prepared to close the box.
                  This absence of all inquisitiveness, or perfect suppression of it, was after
                     Ernestin's own heart. With a feeling of admiration, of love even, dashed with a
                     sense of bitterness, as he rapidly contrasted with this thorough-bred delicacy,
                     the utter indifference to his feelings which had been manifested on all
                     occasions by Agnes, and of which the last exhibition was to cost him perhaps
                     his life, Ernestin laid his hand
                     softly on the right arm of the Major, as the latter was turning the key of the
                     box, and said:
                  "Major De Coucy, do you believe that women have as much delicacy as men?"
                  "It's an odd question," said the Major, as he drew out the key. "And 'faith, I
                     know not how I can answer it, Mr. Fitzherbert, except by reminding you that the
                     world says they have."
                  "The world's a common liar."
                  "Very true," said the Major, as he tucked the key in his vest pocket.
                  "To question you more closely then. Did you ever meet a woman, whom you found
                     on intimate acquaintance as delicate as yourself?"
                  "Yes, my mother. But she is very romantic."
                  "And without romance there is no high virtue of any kind."
                  "Certainly not. That is the reason why romance is so scouted by your
                     commonplace people; it twits their self-love with the consciousness of moral
                     inferiority."
                  "You must be very fond of your mother," said Ernestin pensively.
                  "Fond of her, my dear fellow! She was an heiress, and has promised to settle
                     all her estate, a very large one, on my second boy, or to divide it between the
                     second and third, if there be so many, so that I marry to please herâ€”which you
                     may be sure I shall do."
                  "Not for the estate," said Ernestin, seriously and firmly, and with an
                     expression in his eyes which made unmistakable this sincere compliment.
                  "You are right, Fitzherbert," said the Major, clasping his hand warmly; "I
                     shall marry to please her, because she who cannot please my mother is no wife
                     for her only son."
                  The tears actually stood in Ernestin's eyes, and he folded his unengaged hand
                     over the Major's which still clasped his own, and in that act, which De Coucy's
                     own noble nature comprehended intuitively, seemed to pledge his friendship
                     forever. How familiar indeed they had already become by the mere mutual
                     recognition of congeniality of sentiment! If Ernestin does not at once drop the
                     military title from De Coucy's name, it is because Ernestin is perhaps
                     naturally shyer, and, in his way, prouder, and certainly is not in that
                     position in society to permit him to meet half-way an advance to intimacy in
                     one so much more fortunate.
                  "And now you are ready to go with me?" asked the Major, as he gently slid his
                     hand away.
                  "Whither?"
                  "To a shooting-gallery. Don't look so cross, Fitzherbert. This cap-snapping you
                     have been toying with is very well, where there is no time to burn common
                     powder, but an actual shot or two will do you no harm. Nay, I must insist upon
                     it, as you are so green a hand."
                  "But"â€”
                  "Now see how well I penetrate your thoughts. You think it will look like
                     murder. I'll wager you any thing you would find the Vicomte, at this very moment, blazing away with as much
                     earnestness as if he did not do the thing regularly half a dozen times a week.
                     Besides, nobody shall see us. I will send away my own cab and tigerâ€”that is,
                     those I use here habitually, and we will drive out in a hired thing to the
                     Tivoli Garden. There is a place there, and nobody is likely to frequent it of
                     any note; and if the Vicomte himself should
                     pass, or his friend Buckhurst, they
                     would be wizards indeed to guess by the cab that we were there. Allow me,"
                     moving to the bell-pull, as he spoke.
                  The servant who answered the summons was directed to send up the Major's man;
                     and when the latter appeared,
                  "David," said his master, "take the cab back and remain with it, first sending
                     me one from the stand. See that it be a nice one now, and the man to match.â€”No
                     great difficulty by the by, in Paris," he added to Fitzherbert, "where they do
                     not keep the beastly and rickety vehicles, and fellows that smell as musty as
                     their straw, that suffocate the coachless in London."
                  It was an easy drive to Tivoli. Entering a gate significantly labeled Tir au pistolet, the two friends, the Major leading
                     with his pistol-case, presently found themselves in a long hall or gallery,
                     partitioned off into several chambers, in one of which a party of Frenchmen
                     were at the moment practising. Pausing briefly to give Ernestin an opportunity
                     of observing the manner and skill of these men, who fired at great distances,
                     the Major advanced to an unoccupied division of the gallery, where an attendant
                     briskly approached, and bowing to the Major, offered him a long black-looking
                     pistol. De Coucy for answer drew out his own weapons, and desired the man to
                     load them. French lacqueys generally mingle with their obsequiousness a
                     familiarity that is unknown to the English. Instead of going about his business
                     at once, the waiter, laying on a dingy table the loaded weapon he held, turned
                     over and over in his hands De Coucy's pistols, clutching them by the stock as
                     if to assure himself of their hold, scrutinizing barrel, and sight, and bore,
                     then holding them sideways and reading their inscription, all with an
                     affectionate admiration and a tenderness of touch that was very significant.
                     Indeed there was something in their severe English simplicity, so different
                     from the elaborate ornaments of the French weapon, that, with the exquisite
                     grain of their barrels and the finish of their bore, they might well excite the
                     rapture of so practiced a connoisseur.
                  "You are right, garÃ§on," said the major, in
                     French, replying to his manner, "they are Mantons. Therefore be
                     particular."
                  "I will, sir," said the man. "But I ought to have four sous for these."
                  "Yes, yes," returned the Major; "six. Only be careful."
                  "Careful!" cried the garÃ§on in a
                     transport,â€”"Ha!"
                  One of the pieces is loaded, and presented with a deep reverence to De
                     Coucy.
                  "I will take this shot, and show you how," said the Major to Fitzherbert. He
                     fired almost as he spoke; and the plaster bust spun on its pivot.
                  De Coucy was not above being vain of his skill. No man would be; we are so
                     little, the sublimest of us. "There!" he said, motioning the attendant to hand
                     the other piece to Ernestin; "you must rival that. And we sha'n't go until you
                     do."
                  Ernestin took the weapon. What is he thinking of? The muzzle gradually inclines
                     downwards; his head follows its direction; he sighs. Instantly, "You are in
                     public," said the voice of his second, in English. Ernestin started, and
                     colored, pained for the moment; but in the next he looked gratefully to the
                     Major, and said in the same tongue, "Thank you." He saw two Frenchmen were
                     gazing on him, as well as the attendant, which latter seemed to have an air of
                     contempt very different from his respectful manner to De Coucy.
                  
                  "Now," said the Major, still in English. "For the same reason that I suppressed
                     your name, I shall not give you the word; but say it to yourself, without
                     moving your lips, and fire instantly."
                  Ernestin did so, and struck the iron behind the plaster. The next discharge is
                     no better; and rapidly as the attendant loaded, which was quite marvellous to
                     one who did not reflect that it was his only and hourly business, Ernestin
                     fired. At last he began to grow ashamed and nervous; but shaking off the
                     feeling at the eighth shot, and recalling his knowledge of projectiles, he hit
                     the bust in the very centre of the head.
                  "Bravo!" cried the Major. "We will now go.â€”Can you clean as fast as you load?"
                     (to the garÃ§on). "A franc for that; but be
                     careful.â€”I do not inconvenience you, I hope, Messieurs?" (to the
                        Frenchmen).â€”"Pardon!" said one of them:
                     "We are in no hurry." And they too watched, with a longing eye, as the garÃ§on, under the unusual stimulus, worked with the
                     rapidity yet nicety of an engine.
                  "VoilÃ , monsieur!"
                  "Tenez," said the Major. "Nine times six are
                     fifty-four; and twenty make seventy-four. There are four francs."
                  Never was pistol-loader so happy. With many deep and sincere thanks, and a
                     profound reverence, bearing the case, he followed our couple to the gateâ€”after
                     a slight Excusez to the two Frenchmen, and
                     even put the box into the cab. His face said, "I shall be happy to serve you
                     again, sir," to the Major; but he durst not be familiar, and only bowed.
                  "No doubt of it,"â€”said the Major, again understanding him. "But I don't think
                     we shall trouble you again.Allons!" The whip
                     touches lightly the hackney's flank. The cabriolet leaves the Rue de Clichy, but, for variety, by the way of the
                        BarriÃ¨re.
                  "I am going to drive you to my own lodgings," said the Major; "for you must
                     dine with me to-day. Now, no denial! We must have some more cap-breaking, and I
                     cannot trust you. If I let you go home with these things, I know you will never
                     open the case; you will think it ridiculous. But with meâ€”I shall see, as your
                     second, that your hand is made more pliant. Here is this cursed Octroi! What an abominable country, with its
                     pass-ports and city-tolls! But where there is less liberty, there is often more
                     license; and that is why our hot-bloods waste their gold and constitution here,
                     instead of nursing both in England. Woh!â€”Must we get up?â€”Now you will see,
                     Fitzherbert, that this fellow with mustashes, having nothing else to do, will
                     gratify the curiosity of his idleness, and his spleen against his betters and
                     John Bull, by searching my powder-flask for wine, since there is none stowed in
                     the carriage-seat. I ask his pardon; he is more civil than I thought."
                  If De Coucy, in taking his companion home with him, had another object than
                     that of exercising his unready arm and unaccustomed eye, the latter did not
                     fail to see into it; but he could not quarrel with a motive that was veiled so
                     delicately. Besides, in this unusual attention and solicitude for his interest
                     in a mere stranger, there was evidence of a sudden and growing partiality,
                     which fell on the heart of the desolate student like rain upon a parched but
                     fertile soil. As his heart softened and expanded with the shower, and gave
                     forth all its bloom and all its fragrance, while De Coucy, who, more used to
                     men of the world than of the closet, had never met perhaps with any thing so frank, impetuous, and ardent,
                     received back half the freshness which he lent, and grew himself still brighter
                     and more youthful, Agnes was for the time forgotten, and her lover almost
                     blessed the quarrel that had led to a friendship, which, nevertheless, it was
                     more than probable would have a speedy termination.
                  When it was time to part, the Major communicated to his principal the
                     arrangements which had been made for the morrow; and now Ernestin, rising,
                     said,
                  "I have a request to prefer. But you will think meâ€”romanticâ€”or foolish."
                  "Never mind. You know I have an hereditary respect for romance; and as for
                     follyâ€”hum!" (shrugging his shoulders) "don't be so foolish as to apologize for
                     it to one who never was accounted wise."
                  "To-morrow," said Ernestin, a little embarrassed, "I shall have a letter upon
                     my person, which I should wish you to deliver with your own hand, according to
                     the address that is on it."
                  "And is that all? How could you doubt me?"
                  "But firstâ€”Don't think me mad, De Coucy!" he continued, taking the Major's hand
                     in both his: "I am perhaps about to sacrifice my life on her account; andâ€”In
                     short,â€”if I fall, promise me you will dip the letter in my blood, and deliver
                     it, enveloped if you will, but still, into her own hands."
                  "I will," said his second, gravely. And then smiling, he added gayly, while he
                     wrung Ernestin's hand; "But I trust you will not be in a hurry to remind me of
                     my promise. And that is almost good Irish.â€”This way: you are not yet familiar
                     with my lair.â€”To-morrow morning at six, Fitzherbert. Good b'ye."
                  That night, Ernestin destroyed the letter he had already ready written to
                     Agnes, and in its stead wrote another. As neither of them is extant, it is
                     impossible to say in what they differed. But we may conjecture, from the
                     cause.
                  Kneeling then, the student said his evening prayer. Nor did he hesitate. He was
                     not going on the morrow to attempt another's life, but to expose his own. He
                     had been guilty of rashness. It was right he should be ready with the penalty.
                     If conscience suggested to him, that there was an easier atonement more
                     consonant with religious duty, the answer that he found, to satisfy the
                     monitor, may be gathered from his language to his second, as recorded in the
                     sequent chapter.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXIV.
                  THE DUEL.
                  AWAKING at daybreak, after a refreshing sleep, Ernestin made his devotions, in
                     which, committing his own life to the will of Him who gave it, he prayed to be
                     supported in his resolution not to attempt the life of his adversary, and was
                     ready at the instant his second called.
                  They are on their way to the Bois de
                     Boulogne, followed in another vehicle by a French surgeon. De Coucy,
                     seeing his companion pensive, is about to rally him, when the student
                     begins:
                  "Major De Coucy, do you believe in the soul?"
                  The Major looked at him quickly, sharply, and with a displeased brow; and
                     Ernestin was conscious of it, though he had his eyes thoughtfully cast down.
                     "Do I believe in my own existence, you mean," said the Major.
                  "No. I mean, do you believe that the soul survives this perishable body?"
                  "As fully as I believe that this body perishes. And that I see,"
                     answered his second, with an energy in which there was a tone of increased
                     displeasure, if not of severity.
                  "Pardon me: that you do not see," said Ernestin.â€”"Why then do you
                     take a part in this duel?"
                  "It is frankly questioned," said the Major, rather coldly. "I am like other
                     men, Mr. Fitzherbert; my belief does not always regulate my practice; but my
                     practice is no argument against my belief. Besides, sir, I have lived too much
                     in the fashions of the world to pretend to scruples in this one point, while
                     little rigid in others where I can scarce reconcile my conduct with either
                     religious or moral duty. Nor must you forget that I was ready, were you
                     willing, to prevent this meeting.â€”And now let me ask you, sir, in one breath;
                     for I do not like this talk; why do you engage in it? Do you not believe then
                     in a soul?"
                  "As truly, I think, as yourself," said Ernestin. As he spoke gravely, with his
                     eyes on De Coucy, the latter's brow relaxed. "That I engage in this duel, I can
                     plead partly your own reason. Living as I have done, to scruple here would not
                     be morality, but cowardice. Add to this, I should be disgraced forever, did I
                     not fight; and I know no law of God's that commands me for the sake of
                     existence to trample under foot all that to a man like me can render that
                     existence of any use either to myself or others." The Major, as he touched his
                     horse, bowed approvingly. "When I do an injury, I must make atonement: it is
                     eternal justice. I would not consent to do it in one way, for that had been a
                     lie; so I shall do it in the sole other." The Major, transferring his whip,
                     gave Ernestin his right hand, who continued: "You asked if I believed. I said,
                     as truly I think as you do; for you of course, like the best believers, have at
                     times, or have had, doubts."19
                  
                  "Never!" said the Major. "Have you?" And he once more looked, as if he thought
                     he had fallen into bad company.
                  "I haveâ€”at times. At one time, I was an absolute disbeliever."
                  "Horrible!" said the Major, giving his companion rather more room on the seat. Ernestin felt the
                     movement; but he did not smile.
                  "What would you say then, if I told you that when I was but twenty-two I wrote
                     a poem in which my disbelief was avowed in full,â€”and sought to publish it?"
                  "I would say, if you had published it, you deserved to be impaled: but you are
                     so sincere a man, and I believe, despite your talk, so good a man, I will
                     simply ask you, Mr. Fitzherbert, if you never heard of the youth who committed
                     suicide in consequence of having read Cain?"
                  "Yes. He was probably of weak intellect and melancholy temperament. But I would
                     not have the accident of one such death upon my soul, for a greater fame than
                        Byron's."20
                  
                  "But you burnt this poem?"
                  "In my better judgment, if not changed opinions, I would have done so, though
                     it is of my best, but that I ought I should do more good by publishing it; and
                     I think so still." The Major, for rejoinder, faced about and stared at him.
                     "The refutation of its false conclusions is so easy, and so absolute I deem,
                     that, by avowing the change which Heaven has permitted me to live to experience
                     in my convictions, I shall do more to establish belief with those who have
                     fallen by similar reasoning into like error, than were I to advance a thousand
                     arguments for that belief without showing the reasoning by which I was
                     supported in the unbelief; because my reasoning, narrowly examined, affords its
                     own refutation. The unbelief, Major De Coucy, was the presumption of my yet
                     green age, the belief is the judgment of my matured manhood. Which is the more
                     likely to be respected?"
                  De Coucy saw that the topic was diverting his companion's mind quite as well as
                     any lighter one, and rather seasonably. Therefore, and not from any interest
                     which he took in the subject, now that he was satisfied of Ernestin's correct
                     thinking, he asked:
                  "And what is that refutation?"
                  "It is this. The life is in the blood. Very well. The soul is in the
                     brain."â€”
                  "Not so well," interrupted the Major, with a very positive cut on his horse's
                     left flank.
                  "But we will allow it, as these are the premises in the poem. And my meaning is
                     that its seat is there, which you will not oblige me to argue. I said to you,
                     you did not see the body perish. Brain and muscle, bone, blood and
                     nerve, it is but changed and dissipated, and, so far as our knowledge is
                     competent to ascertain, is incapable of destruction. Now, if you admit
                     this,â€”and you will not deny what is demonstrable by experiment,â€”if you know
                     that there are gases which not even a wall, unless it be of glass and utterly
                     impervious, can confine, you must by analogy allow that the incomprehensible
                     and undiscoverable motive-principles of our life and soul may be equally
                     imperishable and, when their connection with the flesh is loosened, find no
                     more difficulty in taking their new places and combining with other elements,
                     than any other invisible, and if you choose to say so (but it is a
                     contradiction) immaterial particles of our composition. Chemistry, I may say,
                     is the whole fashioning, changing, and redintegrating principle of the
                     universe; all is chemical: and so is our being. Do not mistake me now," seeing
                     De Coucy about to remonstrate; "I use the word, not lightly, but with an awful
                     reverence and submissiveness and with an adoring admiration, as the most
                     applicable that I know to the operations of the Deity, as we are permitted to
                     scrutinize them in this world."
                  
                  "And was this all?"
                  "No. I saw one sister die, an angel though unwinged. I had known"â€”He gathered
                     his breath with an effort and compressed lipsâ€”"I had known anotherâ€”Ask no more.
                     Enough for you, De Coucy, that seeing what I have seen, suffering what I have
                     suffered, feeling what I do feel, I believe as truly and as firmly in the
                     immortality of the soul as I do in its present existence; and as my prayer is
                     nightly for the spirits of those who loved me and who have gone before me, my
                     sisters and my father, so it is my humble supplication, that, if man can have a
                     choice, I may be permitted one day to join them. I ask no better destination,
                     though there are doubtless higher ones."
                  "Ernestin Fitzherbert," said De Coucy, solemnly, and affectionately, while he
                     laid his hand gently on his companion's,â€”an action and a tone which touched
                     Fitzherbert to the heart,â€”"What could induce a man like you to doubt his own
                     soul?"
                  "The souls of animals?"
                  "How!"
                  "I never doubted my own soul, De Coucy, any more than the existence of my God;
                     I but feared that it perished, because I saw the same affections, the same
                     passions, the same good and the same evil, in other creatures, and all
                     proceeding from the same source."
                  "Yet you must allow that our intellect and feelings are different from
                     theirs?"
                  "Yes, in their superiority; otherwise, in their extent, diversity, and
                     capability of improvement; but therein alone. Were it not so, superior beings
                     could not have sympathy with the race of man, and we pray in vain; or no, not
                     absolutely in vain (for the influence of prayer on our spirit is positive and
                        direct21)â€”but our prayers would be delusion.â€”In short, I see no
                     reason why the spirit of man should not by its own appointed energies ascend to
                     a higher sphere of being, taking another and a brighter form. As we purify our
                     natures, as we elevate them, so are they changed in substance (if I may so
                     speak of what is spiritual and invisible22), and changing they might
                     take by their own power, through the preordinance of the Almighty, a new place
                     in the creation. But, for all this, I cannot deny that I have an abiding faith,
                     which I think nothing can ever seriously shake, and which I often pray may not
                     be shakenâ€”for it is my solace, my supporting counsel, and my
                     encouragement,â€”that the Creator does sometimes intervene, though indirectly and
                     in the course of nature, in the affairs of men, and that, sinful though I have
                     been, I have myself often experienced His guiding and preserving power."
                  As Ernestin spoke, with solemn slowness and in a subdued tone, as if communing
                     with his own spirit, the angel, who through the Unalterable Will controlled his
                     destiny, was hovering over the pair, but without the atmosphere of Earth, and
                     at the concluding words he stooped to lower air; and the soul of Ernestin, and
                     with it that of his second in a less degreeâ€”according to his nature, were
                     conscious of an elevation that made them feel above the things of this world,
                     and purified as well as exalted.
                  Under this feeling, De Coucy touched the hand of his companion, and said, "I
                     know not how it is, Fitzherbert, but your language has had a strange influence
                     on me. I believe you might make me, with little more ado, unbelt my sword and
                     don the cowl."
                  "That would be a pity," said Ernestin with a soft smile, as he let his hand be
                     taken by the Major and returned his
                     pressure, "were it only for your hair. But seriously, I too, De Coucy, feel
                     singularly relieved and refreshed by this conversation; and I am glad that it
                     has taken place, for now we know one another better. And in time, there is the
                     spot I believe," catching a glimpse of his antagonist and Buckhurst, who were
                     already on the ground. "Drive quicker, De Coucy. And don't forget," said
                     Ernestin in a whisper, though they were out of hearing, "the letter in my
                     pocket. Do with it as I desired, if I fall, and deliver it with your own
                     hands."
                  "I will," said De Coucy. "But you are not going to fall."
                  The vehicle stopped; and getting out, the party exchanged the usual grave
                     salute with the opposite.
                  The ground was an open space, or glade, surrounded on all sides by scanty trees
                     and an undergrowth of copse. Over the nearest of the trees, and now within the
                     atmosphere of Earthâ€”but farther off than seems the highest and dimmest star at
                     midnight, hovered the guardian Spirit, and saw the Archfiend close by the
                     Viscount, but invisible, inspiring him by the mere contagion of his presence
                     with intenser passion of vindictive malice. But the angel looked serene.
                  The preparations are soon made. The seconds withdraw, the Major saying to
                     Fitzherbert in an under tone, but impressively, "Your own life is at stake,
                     sir. Shoot, and save it."
                  At that instant, the guardian Spirit swooped downward, a single pennon-stroke;
                     a wind arose in the forest and swept through the trees that fenced the glade,
                     and, when the Frenchman fired, a leaf shaken from the nearest was borne rapidly
                     before his eyes. Ernestin fired at the same moment, but, as he intended,
                     without effect, while the ball of his adversary, grazing the barrel of his
                     pistol at the under side, splintered the stock and passed through his wrist,
                     breaking the larger bone, but doing no further damage.
                  Scarcely had De Coucy with the surgeon made up to Ernestin, when the Viscount's
                     second, who might have been seen for an instant remonstrating energetically
                     with his principal, approached with manifest reluctance, and bowing, said
                     gravely to De Coucy, but with emphasis,
                  "Monsieur d'Aubusson desires to know if the change be correct,"
                     (alluding to Ernestin's expression in the Rue de la
                        Paix.) Ernestin answered directly, ere De Coucy could
                     interfere:
                  "I have not yet had time to count it."
                  "If you find it over-paid," exclaimed the Viscount himself, "I shall be ready
                     to receive what you refund."
                  "And how if it be too little, sir?"
                  The Frenchman's dark cheeks grew dusky red. His answer was prompt, though the
                     seconds had already got between, and with animation and severity protested,
                     both, against the continuance of this unusual talk. "When you are able to
                     ascertain," he said, "I shall be ready with the deficit."
                  Perhaps Ernestin, who never had learned the art to bite his lips, and who,
                     though slow at sarcasm, was rapid in retort, would have made rejoinder,
                     accepting what was in fact a virtual challenge to a second encounter, for his
                     own cheeks grew scarlet as the blood that was trickling from the arm, which in
                     his excitement he had snatched from the surgeon; but De Coucy in a peremptory
                     manner led him off, while Buckhurst did the same for the Viscount.
                  "That tongue of yours," said De Coucy, after he had helped Ernestin, his arm now set, into the
                     vehicle, "is a more dangerous weapon than my Manton."
                  â€”"In my hand," said Ernestin. "Yet to that Manton I owe my life. Dear De Coucy,
                     how shall I repay my obligation?"
                  "What! to my Manton?" quoth the Major, in high spirits. "That you have done
                     alreadyâ€”and left your 'change,'"â€”tapping the box between them.
                  "To be deducted;â€”for you must let me have the piece repaired, or replace it
                     with a new one."
                  "That you sha'n't! I would not part with it for a brace; it has now a history.
                     But we must be brisk," touching his horse smartly, "before the affair takes
                     wind. And now it is all over, Fitzherbert, I vow to you, I thought you were a
                     dead man; for the Viscount shoots like the devil; and but for that leaf, which
                     some good angel must have blown in his face, his ball would have gone through
                     your brain,â€”for I am sure he meant to kill you. I shall take care he never
                     meets you again. And in return for his good intentions, if he ever fall out
                     with me, he shall clear the account with small-swords, when I am determined I
                     will run mine into him up to the hilt."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXV.
                  THE FRIENDS.
                  "Do you love to shoot?" said the Major to his new friend. They are now at
                     breakfast, at De Coucy's lodgings; and it is settled between them, that they
                     are to return to England in company. In fact, their passports are already sent
                     to the proper office, and David, the Major's servant, has gone to the Place VendÃ´me to bring off Ernestin's effects. "Do
                     you love to shoot? I suspect not; at least not since you were a poet. Nor fish?
                     No. I'll swear you do not play at billiards. And in fact, with that poor arm of
                     yours, you would not be ready in some time for any of those sports. But you
                     love horses? Your eyes sparkle. Come, you shall home with me. I will introduce
                     you to the finest old gentleman in the world, and that is my father; and my
                     mother, she will love you almost as well as I am going to do." Poor Ernestin!
                     he looked sad. "I have no sister, unfortunately, orâ€”But that is touching on a
                     sore point. Forgive me; I should have known it would not heal at once. Only for
                     a month, if you willâ€”or for a fortnight! At least till you have thrown off that
                     sling! Well then, a week?"
                  There was no resisting such unaffected warmth. Ernestin, whose pride rarely let
                     him accept any invitation from men which he could not return, yielded, with the
                        only hand he had at liberty,
                     which put invisibly his heart into the Major's.
                  "How my mother will love you!" cried the Major, his soul running over with
                     delight. "She is just such a romantic creature as yourself. But hark you, my
                     boy! if you ramble together in the woods, don't take it into your head to run
                     off with her; for, though she is sixty, my father is not yet tired of her."
                  "What a happy creature you are, De Coucy!"
                  "Not happier than yourself. I am of your very make and mettle; only you are now
                     a little downcast."
                  "You are right, De Coucy. I was ungrateful."
                  "I read your meaning, Fitzherbert. We are all ungrateful in this world. If it
                     rain, we curse the clouds because we cannot go out, and if it shine, we murmur
                     that our fields are parched, and pray for rain."
                  "De Coucyâ€” Why did I not know you earlier!"
                  "Because it would have spoiled both of usâ€”and prevented your figuring in the
                     gazette."
                  Ernestin laughed, but not the less admired the Major, and, as usual with him,
                     gave up his whole soul to the fascination of his new affection, even almost to
                     entire forgetfulness of Agnes. But, this time, his affections were not
                     misplaced.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXVI.
                  A MONTH OF HAPPINESS.
                  THE week was prolonged to a fortnight, and the fortnight doubled to a month.
                     But, at the end of that time, Ernestin would not be persuaded to stay longer,
                     where, if he had proved agreeable to others, they had made a perfect paradise
                     for him. They exacted from him, however, the promise of another visit to
                     Holmhurst in the Christmas holydays.
                  "Don't forget your promise, Mr. Fitzherbert. But we shall remind you of it,"
                     said the old Baronet, shaking hands for the twentieth time.
                  "I shall be at his ear, father," said the Major, as they stepped into the
                     carriage that was to convey Ernestin to the nearest post-town. "Don't pine,
                     mamma; there is a chance for you yet. That good Menelaus there, Sir Coucy, will
                     tell you about Helen."
                  "Was ever such a crackbrain!" said the old lady. "I wish, Mr. Fitzherbert, you
                     would make Harry a little like yourself."
                  "There! I told you so," cried De Coucy. "Papa, take care of her! And hark you,
                     good mother: Ernestin is quite as great a crackbrain as myself. Ask him else.
                     Only, you see, he is here on his good behavior."
                  The door is closed. "Good b'ye. Good b'ye." And Ernestin, with his gay companion, takes his
                     leave of the house he is destined never to revisit.
                  As the carriage passes through the old stone gateway, he sees leaning against
                     the porter's lodge, at the outer wall, a delicate and even effeminate-looking
                     man, whose face, fixed on his own with an earnest and melancholy gaze, riveted
                     his attention. He had seen it elsewhere. Whyâ€”Surelyâ€”It is the face of his
                     neighbor, the Venus of Arles!
                  He puts his head out at the window. The stranger has turned round, yet leans in
                     a similar posture, so that his face is still towards the carriage; but they are
                     now so far apart, its expression cannot be distinguished.
                  "A very extraordinary likeness!" exclaimed Ernestin, musingly, as he resumed
                     his seat. And he felt strangely worried.
                  "To whom?" asked the Major.
                  "Did you see that young man at the gate?"
                  "Yes; rather a gentlemanly, and very handsome fellow, though badly dressed.
                     Probably some artist or poet, that has heard of you by reputation."
                  "Me by reputation! That would be wonderful indeed. But I never saw so striking
                     a likeness to a very fine woman who lived opposite me in Chelsea."
                  "What if it should be one disguised, eh! following her recreant admirer? as I
                     suppose you to be." Ernestin laughed, and shook off the impression.
                  But it returned again and again, and seemed to haunt him; and when they got to
                     High Wycombe, he actually looked to see if the wo-begone countenance were not
                     at the door of the Red Lion watching him.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXVII.
                  THE OUTSIDE PASSENGER.
                  "GOOD b'ye, Fitzherbert! and remember the Christmas holydays. I shall be down
                     upon you, in a day or two, in Chelsea." And the friends parted, gazing and
                     nodding at one another, Ernestin from the interior of the mailcoach, and De
                     Coucy from his carriage, till the latter, rounding the corner of a cross-road,
                     disappeared. Then the student, leaning back in the corner of his seat,
                     abandoned himself to his reflections, until the coach, which was waiting the
                     arrival of another, should start.
                  He was roused from a day-dream, that was bitter-sweet, by the usual noise that
                     attends the transfer of passengers and their luggage, when raising his eyes, he
                     saw the handsome and slender stranger in the very act of clambering to the top
                     of the vehicle. His foot was upon the ladder, and the driver was at his
                     shoulder aiding his ascent, when his eye caught Ernestin's. He colored, then
                     turned pale, almost in the same instant, and, not dexterous before, became so
                     disconcerted that he dropped the foot, and stood confused and irresolute.
                  "What ails you?" said the coachman. "I never seed a houtside so awk'ard. Try
                     agin."
                  "Not used to climbing, I guess," quoth the guard, exchanging a knowing wink and
                     shrug with the whip-man.
                  "No, I'm blest if he is! Why a voman couldn't be stiffer! Look at the coach, not up the road, if
                     you wants to git up. And do be lively, will you! I'm losing time."
                  The awkward passenger had his foot again upon the ladder; but, at this last
                     remonstrance, which was spoken roughly and accompanied by a rude push at the
                     shoulder, amid the unrestrained laughter of the guard, chorused by the
                     stableboys of the Red Lion and sundry idlers, his distress and confusion
                     completely overcame him, and the foot was set down again, and he seemed by his
                     motions to be about to give up the attempt. Ernestin, already excited and
                     indignant, now put his head out of the window, and said, in a decided
                     manner,
                  "Let the young gentleman come in here. Don't you see he is too feeble to go on
                     top?"
                  "That's his own look-out," said the coachman with a sneer. "Besides, he's not
                     booked for a hinside, I'm thinking." And as he spoke, with a positive shake of
                     the head, he took the waybill from his hat as if in evidence,â€”though he
                     reserved it for his own satisfaction.
                  "But how if I choose it?" said Ernestin sternly. "Open the door."
                  "Not unless you stand cost," said the fellow rudely. And he looked about, as
                     much as to say, "That's a poser! He won't toe that mark!"
                  "And that I mean to," rejoined Fitzherbert, "not forgetting yourself, if you be
                     civil."
                  "O, that's another case," quoth the coachman mollified, but not less impudent.
                     "Git in here, my gemman what couldn't climb." This hit is received with great
                     hilarity by the guard and stableboys aforesaid, and encourages him to another.
                     "Why you're gitting worser! Don't you see the"â€”
                  His impertinence was cut short by Fitzherbert, who, the door now open, and
                     seeing the stranger, instead of taking the hand he put out to him, turned away
                     and appeared ready to drop, sprang out, and thrusting aside the coachman took
                     the outside passenger's hand, which trembled as he touched it, and said softly,
                     while he urged him forward with a gentle but resolute movement, "Do not
                     hesitate!" The young man, his head cast down, gets in by Ernestin's help, yet
                     stumbling as if he were blind; and the door is shut.
                  "I'm blest," said the coachman, with a wink to the guard, that was meant
                     generously to have a reflective significance for the stableboys, "if that a'n't
                     a rum un! or I never seed one." The guard shrugged his shoulders, and mounted
                     to his post. "All right!"â€”"One and a half inside, and six out." And amid a roar
                     of laughter, and a double energy of both whip and bugle, the coach started from
                     the Red Lion, on the journey to Tyburn.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXVIII.
                  THE STRUGGLE.
                  FOR a few moments, all was silent in the interior of the vehicle. The face of
                     Ernestin's strange companion was bent down, and could not besides be well
                     distinguished because of the twilight, which had now thickened almost into
                     night; but Ernestin perceived that he shivered continually, and kept shrinking
                     timidly, as if to get as far from his protector as the limits of the seat on
                     which they both sat would let him. Ernestin laid his handâ€”slowly, that the
                     stranger might be prepared for the movementâ€”on the latter's hand. Slender it
                     was and silky, with smooth and delicate joints, like the hand of a woman. It
                     shrunk from him at first, then lay unresisting in his own, but with a pulse
                     that made it quiver.
                  "Am I right?" whispered Ernestin, not himself without emotion. "You are"â€”He
                     paused. The stranger sobbed. "Hush!" said Ernestin, in alarm, yet in an
                     undertone, and very softly; "hush! Do not betray yourself! Already perhaps,
                     they half suspect you." In the eagerness of his appeal, he drew quite close to
                     his companion. The contact at once convinced him of the sex of the latter; and
                     when, soothingly and encouragingly, and with a gentle touch, he put his arm
                     about her waist just above the hips, its formation left him without a
                     doubt.â€”"My neighbor at Chelsea?" he continued inquiringly. But his voice, still
                     subdued, betokened agitationâ€”which was not lessened when he felt the tears of
                     his companion on his hand. How hot they were! They were her only answer.
                  Poor Ernestin! and unfortunate, were it not his fault! His month with De Coucy
                     had, to all appearance, completely restored him. A minute's heart-ache has
                     undone it all. Nor is the work yet over.
                  "What does this mean?" His voice is firmer; but the tones are still
                     compassionate and soft. "Why are you here? and in this garb?â€”How shall I call
                     you? I mean, by what name?"
                  "Joannaâ€”Joanna Bradley, if you will. But that is my husband's name, and I no
                     more deserve to bear it." Her voice, naturally grand, like her beauty, but,
                     like it, perfectly feminine,â€”a voice that would have fit a queen, as might her
                     person,â€”was now rendered exquisitely touching by her emotion, her distress, her
                     shame; and as the rounded accents struck an ear that was singularly sensitive
                     to such excellence, especially in women, Ernestin, frightened at the thrill
                     they gave him, was silent, so that Joanna, mistrusting the cause, resumed with
                     still more pathos, while the tears which had burst forth in a shower at the
                     mention of her husband's name, rained with a steady but more silent fall: "Do
                     not despise me! I am not badâ€”indeed I am not! at least I never was so before."
                     The tears gave place to suffocating sobs.
                  "Hush!" said Ernestin, but scarcely able to contain himself, nay, restraining
                     only with an effort his own tears, and the very natural impulse that would have
                     made him throw his arm about his dangerous companion, and endeavor to soothe
                     her in the usual manner with voice and hand. "Hush!" He did not even touch her.
                        "Hush! if not for your own
                     sakeâ€”then for mine." The more violent expression of her passion was subdued at
                     once, like the sobs of a child that is weary of wailing, and, murmuring with
                     low and intermitted ejulation, falls to sleep upon the mother's breast. "And
                     now, tell me. Why are you here?"
                  Have mercy on me!" she said; "forâ€”you must know."
                  "And have Iâ€”has my folly, brought you to this? Alas I looked on you but as an
                     artistâ€”know you, Joanna, what that is?â€”a painter, I mean. I admired you as what
                     the painter calls a noble model."
                  "Oh! oh! oh!" exclaimed, in the very accents of a mortal despair, the poor
                     creature; but, with a sense of her position, and probably from an instinctive
                     wish to obey him, it was in a low and subdued tone.
                  "Do not groan," said Ernestin; "I do not mean to say, that that was all." How
                     suddenly she ceased! He perceived it, and checking what his compassion prompted
                     him to say, added merely: "One thing, Joanna, led on to another, till I forgot
                     the model in the woman."
                  It was rather fine language for a person of her condition to hear; but women
                     are shrewd; and in her or similar circumstances, what so quick! But she is
                     stillâ€”all save the beating of her heart, which seems to shake the seat.
                  Ernestin felt that he must rouse himself. With a painful effort, he said:
                  "Joannaâ€”hear me. What you have promised yourself by this step"â€”
                  "O nothing, nothing! I don't know why I came. I readâ€”I mean I heard"â€”She
                     paused, affrighted at her own boldness.
                  "What did you read or hear?" said Ernestin, softly. Alas for Joanna! alas for
                     him, but that his better angel is upon the watch!
                  Reassured, inspired even with a kind of hope, which yet she did not understand,
                     she continued, though with a broken and bashful voice:
                  "I sometimes walkedâ€”I mean, I thought you still was where you had removed. But
                     one day, being in the saddler's under where we live, talking with his wife, he
                     had a newspaper in his hand, and he said, all of a sudden: 'Look here,
                     Annie'â€”to his wifeâ€”'D'you remember the tall, showy gentleman that lived
                     opposite usâ€”Dr. Fitzherbert's brother?'â€”'What of him?' said she, while I was
                     ready to drop. Iâ€”I don't know why it scared me. 'Well,' he said, 'he has got
                     nicely winged, it seems.' O, sir! I felt as if I should dieâ€”But you will
                     despise me." Ernestin is still as death; but he presses her hand. Even angels
                     could not but pity, while they condemned the weakness.â€”"I should have dropped,
                     but they were by. Yet I did not know what he meant. 'How winged?' said Annie.
                     'Why, he has got his arm broke to be sure, fighting with some Viscount
                     Parleyvouâ€”in Paris thereâ€”and he has now come homeâ€”andâ€”let's seeâ€”Set off
                     immediately with the gallant Major on a visit to Holmhurst, the seat of Sir
                     Coucy de Coucy, Bart., near Prince Risborough, Bucks.'â€”Nothing but shame kept
                     me from falling down before himâ€”though I lost not a word. But I managed to get
                     to my roomâ€”and when I had cried myself more easyâ€”Iâ€”I"â€”Ernestin again pressed
                     her hand. It said, Go on. Alas for Joanna! and again alas for
                     Ernestin! but that his better angel is upon the watch; this dear delight of
                     knowing he is loved is making him forget his duty, is making him forget what is
                     that love.
                  
                  Joanna, encouraged, yet still timidly, continues:
                  "You will think me very brazenâ€”You must forgive me: but Iâ€”I worried so
                     muchâ€”about youâ€”when too nothing more was said, week after week, in the paper,
                     though I went where I could read it every dayâ€”that at last I thought you must
                     be dying; and so"â€”
                  The voice of duty is at length heard. Almost with a sigh, Ernestin said
                     quickly, "And so, you came to find if I were well. It was a terrible step to
                     take, Joanna! How long have you been away?"
                  "Only since this morning."
                  "If your husband miss you?"
                  "I went to my sister's," said Joanna, weeping.
                  "Hush, hush!â€”And there you put on thisâ€”improper dress. Does she then know
                     wherefore?" asked Ernestin, anxiously.
                  "Oh no!"
                  "No, truly? Joanna, if there were no other reason for truth, there is this,
                     that it is the only safeguard in difficulty. If you conceal any thing, I shall
                     not know how to save you; and besides," he added with emphasis, "I should then
                     indeed 'despise' youâ€”perhaps detest you. Your sister does not know
                     whither, and for whom you went?"
                  "No, as God shall judge me! No, sir!" There was more than the common woman in
                     this No, sir. It was lofty. Ernestin believed her instantly.
                  "Then all is safe. Joanna, hear me. We must part at once. Do not cry! Would you
                     be ruined? Would you make yourself contemptible in my eyes? Go back to your
                     husband."
                  "I will, I will," she said. But she wept, though softly; and he was conscious,
                     from her manner, that she wrung her hands.
                  "But first,â€”how came your sister to let you go, and in this dress? And where is
                     your child?"
                  "I left it with her. She did all she could, sir, to prevent me; she even locked
                     the door upon me; do not blame her. But I told her I would"â€”
                  "Would what?"
                  "Don't despise me, sirâ€”would throw myself out of the window;â€”and I was so
                     frantic, she let me go. She will not tell of me. She loves me dearly, and was
                     ever a good girlâ€”O, a better girl than I!"
                  "No, no; you are weak only, not bad, Joanna. But you would be so, did this go
                     on. Go back to your sister, and resume your own dress. Conceal what you
                     willâ€”the more the better; but tell no falsehood. Your husband will think,
                     what?"
                  "That I have only been with her. He is a very easy man."
                  The ideas of a man of quick perceptions and extended mind, who is continually a
                     thinker, are often crossed by strange counter-currents. Ernestin is not so
                     absorbed by the mingled pain and pleasure of his situation, as not to feel
                     inclined to smile; but on the instant, reproaching himself as for an immoral
                     sentiment, he said, gravely,
                  "The more reason why you should not wrong him."
                  "I will notâ€”I will do as you bid me. I would onlyâ€”if I durst"â€”
                  "What is it then? Speak quickly," he said in a gentle whisper. "Any thing, not
                     wrong, I will grant or do for you."
                  "Onlyâ€”do not forget, sir, poor Joanna!"
                  Fast and heavy fell the tears on the hand that clasped the woman's; and their
                     spirit, which was the dew of affection, passed into the soul of the
                     student.
                  
                  "Forget you!" he said. "Is that possible? I will remember you, dear
                     Joanna"â€”(the word is out; it is too late to recall itâ€”) "dear
                     Joanna! with gratitude for what you have borne for me, and in my prayers. Good
                     b'ye."
                  "Then you are afraid to sit by me! I knew it! You despise me."
                  "I do not; I pity you; Iâ€”I respect you, Joanna. But I should despise myself,
                     did I stay. Do not hold me! O, there!" (pressing her hand.) "Now, maintain your
                     disguise as boldly as you may till you are in your sister's house; and God's
                     forgiveness, and His blessing, go with you, Joannaâ€”as I pray that His
                     forgiveness for this step may come to me."
                  "One word more!" She held his hand. Its pulsation made it madness to linger
                     there.
                  "Not one word more," he said: "I go, Joanna, for both our
                     sakes."
                  "Bless you!" said Joanna, crying bitterly.
                  "Hush! hush! let not the people hear you." He pulled the check. "Driver, stop,
                     and make room for me there outside. I shall consider your new trouble."
                  "With all my 'eart, sir. Woh, Bessy!â€”This side, sir. Your honor's rather
                     nimbler than the t'other hinside, though he's but a boy. How is he, sir? Davy,
                     set more up, you 'og! the gemman has no room. Get up!" (crack! crack!) "A fine
                     night, your honorâ€”wondered if you hadn't better come out for the hair.â€”How far,
                     did you ask, sir? Fifteen miles; that is Uxbridge, yonder."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIX.
                  THE HARD CONQUEST.
                  FORGET her! Had she ever been forgotten? Love cannot, any more than other
                     iterated impressions on the mind, be ever effaced. There it lies, unobserved it
                     may be or obscured like them, till the recurrence of circumstances similar to
                     those which created it makes it reappear, in like, unmistakable,
                     characters.
                  The love indeed of most men, as of most women, is but simple passion,â€”however
                     refined, by percolation through the "certain strainers" of which the poet
                     speaks with such sarcastic shrewdness. It has no preference for its object; it
                     is a wandering desire, transferable from one to another, and to any one in
                     turn; like the attachment of the cat, which, when the creature is full-grown,
                     is never, or with singular rarity, displayed for persons, but for
                        places.23 Whereas Ernestin's was like that of the dog. And as
                     that generous animal, however ready to love many masters in turn, or even
                     several at once, still retains the impression of each in his brain, which, when
                     the object of his past attachment reappears, at however long an interval, is
                     instantly revived, with not more suddenness and vividness than force, so
                     Ernestin, loving as I have elsewhere intimated many women in succession, and
                     loving truly,â€”with a poet's love, the love that clings to the object, not the
                     animal appetite that but seeks its animal satisfaction and satisfied gives over,â€”Ernestin, loving many
                     women, forgot not one. His fancy for Joanna, it is true, had not been of the
                     exalted nature of his love for Agnes;â€”love for a married woman never can be of
                     such spiritual kind; the same circumstances which make it criminal render it
                     sensual (by the very nature of the ideas they necessarily suggest);â€”moreover,
                     reason, religion, and a pure affection, had kept it from development. Yet
                     imperfect as it was, a predilection not a passion, it was there for all, a
                     history written on his brain, an image of pleasure often contemplated, ere laid
                     aside like others to await another hour and a new occasion for its
                     reappearance.
                  That hour had now come, and that occasion. And what hour, what occasion, I may
                     add what place, could have been more favorableâ€”favorable to the passion, but
                     full of hazard to the man? His month with the De Coucies had indeed restored
                     his mind to its equipoise; the sting of disappointment and resentment had lost
                     all its smart; he had begun to do justice to Agnes' character, and to admit
                     that he had been as much to blame as she; nay, he was even approaching that
                     period when he shall acknowledge he was greatly more so, and shall think with
                     bitterness upon his loss; nevertheless his cooler judgment had confirmed his
                     observation, and he was satisfied that Agnes did not love him, and that her
                     disposition, however gentle, was deficient in considerateness for the feelings
                     and interests of others. Whereas Joanna loved him more than well, and her
                     romantic indifference to self and devotedness to the object of her passion was
                     too congenial to his own natureâ€”a nature moreover that was ever longing, ever
                     pining for such sympathyâ€”not to be fascinating in itself, apart from the
                     dangerous memory of her beauty and the re-awakened thrill of his own desires.
                     She was there, not to further her own interests; in pure alarm for him, she had
                     rushed upon her ruin. Thereâ€”aloneâ€”and in that guiseâ€”and at that hour! Well was
                     it for Ernestin, a power mightier than his own will was there to save him!
                     Pondering on his outside seat, the whole way into town, all that had passed in
                     the little scene in the interiorâ€”recalling with a perilous exactness the
                     undoubted proofs he had previously had of Joanna's modesty and timidity,â€”shaken
                     too by the revival of old habits, and tempted by all the sophistry wherewith
                     the devil could ply him, who kept reminding him of the just claim Joanna had
                     upon his pity, her need of consolation, and the good his sound advice might do
                     her,â€”his virtue never yet had been in so great peril. But when the coach
                     stopped for the relay, Ernestin merely went to the door, for appearance' sake,
                     and whispering the inside traveler not to speak a word lest her voice should
                     betray her, got up again to his place beneath the stars; and at the close of
                     the journey, putting Joanna into a separate vehicle, though their route to
                     Chelsea was the same, he settled with the driver, and left her, to pursue his
                     own way in another. So the devil was disappointed.
                  Poor Joanna had not calculated on this severity, and when Ernestin withdrew his
                     hand from hers, and left her once more by herself, and she bade God bless him,
                     it was not the sense of her own situation, but of his, and her loving deference
                     to his wishes, that alone prevented her voice from breaking into sobs.
                  "I'm blest!" said the coachman, as he buttoned his breeches' pocket upon
                     Ernestin's bounty, and shook his head knowingly toward the receding carriages,
                     "I'm blest if ever I heerd a voice so like a voman's as that 'ere chap's what
                     couldn't climb."
                  
                  "Well, p'rhaps it was a woman's," said the guard. "I s'pose it wasn't for
                     nothing that chap, what wouldn't climb, was so afeerd his hat
                     would come off. And who ever see a man's side-locks without any end to
                     'em?"
                  "Yes, butâ€”hold the lantern nearer, Jimmyâ€”would that other cove have left him
                     all alone there, and in the darkâ€”and he a man what knows what's what?" patting
                     with affectionate emphasis the pocket he had just buttoned. "And didn't he go
                     off all alone?â€”Whose trunk 's that?" kicking a portmanteau at his feet.
                  "All gammon!" returned the guard.â€”"But the tall chap may be a Joseph."
                  "Whe-ew!" whistled the coachman, with a prolongation of sound that announced
                     enlightenment. "And t'other one, Pottiper's wife! I never thought of that."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXX.
                  THE SISTERS.
                  IN a small and poorly furnished room of a mean house in Chelsea sits a tall
                     woman in widow's weeds, with a sickly-looking child in her lap. The woman is
                     not handsome; at least, not physically so; for she is deeply pitted with the
                     smallpox, which moreover has dimmed forever the lustre of her large eyes, and
                     left that changeless ghastliness of complexion, which is perhaps its most
                     frightful consequent. She is not handsome; but there is that in her still young
                     though matronly visage, which makes you almost forget its irremediable
                     disfigurementâ€”that, namely, which makes her seem the personification of the
                     Christian virtues of patience, meekness, and charity; and as you mark the
                     melancholy smile which accompanies the words she addresses to the childâ€”which
                     those words tell you to be not her own, and the inflection of her voice as she
                     utters them, the sadness of her well-shaped brow, and the anxiety, full of
                     tenderness, with which from time to time she turns her head to the door as if
                     expecting it to open,â€”displaying in the act a rather fine profile that is even
                     stately in its outline,â€”or to the windows as if to help her listen to the
                     sounds without, which she hears or hopes to hear,â€”you forget that her parted
                     lips are colorless, and that her cheeks and forehead are cold in tone as marble
                     and far more dead of hue.
                  
                  "Ma-ma!" cried the child in that fretful, painful, broken yet prolonged accent,
                     which showed it to be both drowsy and wakeful: "Mum-ma-h! naughty ma-ma!" Then
                     its cry became mere murmuring, while little bubbles of froth rose and broke
                     upon its pouted lips; and its weary eyelids, dropping languidly, opened every
                     time more feebly and with more exertion.
                  The woman, as she watched eagerly these signs of coming sleep, said nothing;
                     but a strange expression gathered in her features. You might believe the
                     unconsidered reproaches of the child have wakened in her heart a very painful
                     feeling. But the little one breaks out afresh, though she opens not her eyes;
                     and still half-asleep, her cry is for "Mum-ma-h!"â€”"Oh my mum-mah!"
                  "Hush, my dear!" says the woman, soothingly and softly, "Hush, Joey! Try to
                     sleep, now, for aunty! Mamma will soon be here." Yet she looks around, with
                     mournful brow, as if to say, I would she may! "Mamma will come for
                     her darling. Hush! There!â€”there!â€”there!" The pleasant voice of the nurse
                     breaks, itself, into inarticulate murmurs, as she presses the child against her
                     bosom, and rocks backward and forward in her chair.
                  Suddenly, there is deep silence. The nurse waits a momentâ€”looking at the
                     child,â€”then rises softly, and bearing it into an adjoining room which is dark,
                     and whose door is open, deposits it upon her own bed, and returns on tiptoe to
                     the humble parlor, where she removes the single gloomy dip-candle to a distant
                     corner. But ere she does this, she presses her hands together very earnestly,
                     and lifts her eyes with an expression of gratitude and of mental relief.
                  Scarcely has she resumed her seat, before a noise of wheels is heard. She
                     starts, but without rising. The wheels are heard to grate against the curbstone
                     nigh the house, and the carriage-steps are let down quickly. The woman rises,
                     and her lustreless eyes for one moment almost flash with delight and for
                     another with terror, and her first movement is to the door that leads to the
                     entry; but she returns; and rapidly, but noiselessly and with finger on lip,
                     closes the door that opens on the bed-chamber,-but dares not shut it tight. She
                     turns, and is confronted the next minute by a tall figure in man's attire,
                     which, though the door to the entry is now open, seems to have dropped into the
                     room, so light and rapid has been its tread; and accordingly, the woman for the
                     instant is startled.
                  With a laugh that was not loud, but strangely mournful and full of a bitter
                     self-mockery, the visitor takes off his hat; and a mass of silky tresses which
                     appeared black in the imperfect light, loosened by the actionâ€”which had a dash
                     of desperateness in it, for he flung the hat to the groundâ€”fell around the coat
                     in singular contrast with its masculine character. So long they were, these
                     tresses which betrayed at once the sex of their owner, that though her figure
                     was taller much than the ordinary stature of women, they actually reached to
                     the bend of the knee behind.
                  "Do you know me now, Mary?" said a voice naturally full and rich, but whose
                     tone was unpleasantly modified by the same feeling that had embittered her
                     laugh. And without waiting a reply, the disguised woman burst into tears,
                     mingled with sobbing violent and unrestrained, while she gathered her beautiful
                     hair in her hands and pressed them passionately to her eyes, to staunch the
                     shower which rained down upon her dress and to the floor.
                  "Hush! for pity's sake," said the widow in an anxious undertone, while hurriedly she threw her arms
                     about her visitor, and drew her to her bosom; "Joey has but just fell asleep.
                     If she should see you so!â€”Know you, dear Joanna? my own,
                     beautiful, darling, dear, dear Joanna!"â€”lifting her from her bosom, to kiss her
                     on the forehead through her shadowing hairâ€”"Is there anywhere then, and any
                     dress I shouldn't know you in?"
                  "Yes," said Joanna, bitterly,â€”throwing back her tresses, while her strikingly
                     curved lips took easily an expression of infinite scorn, which was not however
                     for her sister,â€”"Yes, yes, your own, beautiful, darling, dear, dear Joanna, you
                     know her well enough; but you didn't know your good Joanna, your innocent
                     sister, in your husband's clothes, worn not about her husband's
                     business!" She laughed a laugh so bitter, that the gentle Mary felt her blood
                     curdle in her veins.
                  "O hush!" she said, with tears in her own eyes: "it is bad enough already. If
                     you wake the child, to see you and to talk of you to her papa"â€”
                  "To her papa!" cried Joanna, with another laugh. But instantly changing her
                     tone, she said gloomily, "And if she did, as well now as ever! And better for
                        him. What should he do with a bad woman that has disgraced
                     him!"
                  "Joanna!" said the widow, drawing her sister to the remotest corner of the room
                     where burned the sooty candle and making her sit down,â€”"Are you beside
                     yourself? You don't meanâ€”-You haven'tâ€”You didn't dare"â€”
                  "What?" said Joanna coldly, seeing she hesitated.
                  "You haven't been?â€”O, what have you done?"
                  "Nothing."
                  "What then makes you bad?"
                  "My wicked heartâ€”and my wicked deed. But no! I am not bad: he said I wasn't.
                        No, no; you are weak only, not bad, Joanna."
                  The manner in which her sister repeated these words of Ernestin's, speaking
                     thoughtfully, with her eyes down, as if her mind were retracing some loved
                     scene, while her rich voice had a new and delicious sweetness in its lowered
                     tone, left no doubt in Mary's mind as to their source. It was then with
                     indignation she replied.
                  "He said so! You have been then?â€”I thought so! Who is this
                     manâ€”this?"â€”
                  "Stop!" cried Joanna; "call him no names. And ask me no more questions; for I
                     will not answer them."
                  "No! And I suppose he said that too, the villain!"
                  "Mary," said Joanna, half-rising, and looking with so much sternness, that her
                     long hair alone rendered now her dress equivocal,â€”"take care what you do. I
                     will not hear him abusedâ€”not even by you."
                  "And it was for this," exclaimed the widow no longer gentle, while she left her
                     seat, and stooped to gather up the hat Joanna had thrown down, and her cheeks
                     and eyes almost colored and gave light,â€”"for this I helped you, and wronged my
                     husband's memory! He little thought, that in little more than a twelvemonth,
                     his best suit, and best hat, all but his shoes, would serve for such a purpose!
                     I deserve it: but you, Joanna, you are"â€”
                  "An ungrateful, wicked creature, Mary," said Joanna, taking the hat from her
                     caressingly, and smoothing the fur with her hand ere she put it on a chair.
                     "Forgive me,"â€”kissing her: "I told him you were a better girl than I; and so
                     you are."
                  "And it wasn't saying much for me, if you're bad as you say you be. But you
                     talked to him of me, and I cannot
                     not even ask the least question about this man, who has made you so unhappy,
                     and wheedled you away from"â€”
                  "Mary, Mary, I say!" cried Joanna passionately, while her delicate foot, in its
                     boy's-shoe, lightly stamped the ground. "If we 're to have peace, this talk
                     must have an end. I tell you once for all, you wrong him! It was I that tried
                     to wheedle him, not he me, this villain, as you have called him.
                     You needn't stare, sister! If I am unhappy, it is because he wouldn't wrong me,
                     though in my wicked heart I hoped it. Had he been a villain, I should now be
                     happy and"â€”
                  "Ruined," said Mary, with an emphasis that was full of terror.
                  "Yesâ€”and ruined." Joanna flung herself on her sister's neck, who however for
                     the moment seemed to recoil from her. "Do not throw me off, Mary,â€”you who are
                     gentle and good; I am not wicked, not as you think, or I could not hug you
                     else: I am only bad in this naughty heart, that will beat hot in spite of me
                     when I think ofâ€”Oh! oh! Why was I born!"
                  "Hush now, dear Joanna,â€”since all is right, as you say it is, and I will
                     believe. And now put off theseâ€”Hush! there is Joey stirring! Make haste, while
                     I go in to her, and be yourself once more."
                  The widow entered the dark bedchamber, and, drawing after her the door again as
                     softly as she had unclosed it, busied herself with lulling the child, as her
                     voice from within gave indication, while Joanna began to arrange her hair.
                     Presently the door of the bedroom was opened and Mary put softly out Joanna's
                     own clothes, which she had secreted somewhere within, and then closed again the
                     door.
                  And now it was curious to see Joanna, ere she changed her habiliments, put
                     carefully on her head the man's hat, and taking up the dim candleâ€”which she
                     snuffed, go deliberately to the pieced mirror which hung between the windows,
                     and look at herself from head to foot. There is an air of satisfaction, but not
                     untinged with sorrow, in the glance she gives; and you may, by that index, read
                     her motive. And from the same motive she goes to the door that shuts in her
                     sister, and, tapping softly, calls her to come out. Mary appears with surprise
                     in her pallid features; to which Joanna responds by saying,
                  "Mary, dear,â€”do not be vexed!â€”tell me; do I look handsome so?"
                  "Not as I love to see you. But, as a man"â€”
                  "Yes, yes,â€”as a man."
                  "Why then, Joanna, I never saw any thing handsomer! Now, be a good girl and
                     make haste."
                  But Joanna, without noticing this instancy, looked thoughtfully down, and
                     murmured, as if conscious of Mary's hearing her, and yet as speaking only to
                     herself, "Yet he would not stay by me." She sighed.
                  "Is that so, indeed so? on your honor, Joey?" said Mary.
                  "As true, as that I tried to make him; and I did try. O, I would have given my
                     life but to keep him near me one little hour!"
                  "Hush then, now, dear Joanna! And lose no time."
                  The widow slid within the sleeping-room, to keep the child from waking; and
                     when she reappeared, Joanna was once more in her customary dress. Then the
                     widow, kissing her, restored her deceased husband's clothes to a bureau in the
                     lighted room, put the hat away in a bandbox in a cupboard, and once more
                     approaching Joanna, who had stood in thoughtful silence the whole time, said
                     affectionately, yet anxiously,
                  
                  "And now, Joanna,â€”it is late, and Bradley will be uneasy; put on your bonnet,
                     while I wake up Joey."
                  "I am not going home," said Joanna gloomily.
                  "Not"â€”
                  "Going home. Not to-night." She seized her sister's wrist, and her eyes looked
                     into hers so intensely and with such fire, that the gentle widow shrunk back,
                     though from her misfortune she could not look more pallid. "Do you know what
                     you ask me, Mary? Lie by his side to-night! He or I would be dead
                     before the morning, or both of us."
                  The widow opened her mouth, and stood thus fixed, without the power of a
                     word.
                  "You think me mad," said Joanna. "O, I wish I were mad! I wish I had no
                     husband, no child!" She wrung her hands, and ground her teeth.
                  "Joanna!" said the sister, with a gasp: "This is the mood that makes
                     murderesses."
                  "Perhaps so," said Joanna. "But it would not make me soâ€”of none at least but
                     myself. And what good would it do me? It would not win him."
                  "Joanna!" cried Mary, indignantly, "I cannot hold any longer. If you will
                     mention that"â€”
                  "Stop yet," said Joanna, laying her hand on her sister's mouth, and speaking
                     quite imperiously. "If you knew of what kind of man you speakâ€”It was he himself
                     that bade me go home to my husband; and I promised him I would."
                  "Come then," said the widow eagerly,â€”making for the bedroom.
                  "No," returned Joanna, "don't wake her yet. I tell you, Mary, I can not go home
                     to-night. I will obey him; but not to-night, not to-night, not to-night." She
                     buried her face in her hands a moment, and rocked backward and forward,
                     standing as she was upon the floor, while her sister, in deep distress, uttered
                     not a word. "I tell you," resumed the unhappy woman hastily, and with a harsh
                     intonation, "I should be dead before the morning. O no, no, no!" She shuddered
                     as with an ague.
                  "O dear, O dear!" cried the widow, wringing her hands in turn. "What can be
                     done!â€”I will go to Bradley," she added hastily, "and tell him you are taken
                     sick. Don't stay me, Joanna; if he comes here, you are ruined."
                  But Joanna held her back, as she unlocked the drawer for her shawl and bonnet.
                     "You must not tell John that," she said. "He, he told me I must
                     tell no falsehood. And I will obey him too in that."
                  "This is too much!" exclaimed her sister, meek though she was and charitable.
                     "Here is a man who has made you do as you shouldn't do, and has all but set you
                     crazy; and he preaches to you, as if he was one of the saints! If he's not a
                     hypocrite"â€”
                  Joanna had listened so far with eyes wide open, and a paleness of cheek that
                     should have made her sister sooner pause, and might have terrified her, had she
                     not been excited in an unusual degree; but now she spoke, loudly, solemnly,
                     almost fiercely.
                  "Mary Ledyard, you know our father said of us two, that if you was the
                     prudenter, I had but to be warmed a little to see much further and to do much
                     wiser; and more, he said, 'When Joanna says she will do a thing, and she is
                     roused up, she will do it, cost what it will.' Have you forgot it?" Mary is
                     silent, and pale in spirit as she is ever in her disfigured cheeks. "Now then
                     hear me. I vow, by the Great and Good One Who sees us both, and Who knows, if I had no right to love
                     this gentleman"â€”Mary started, not unobserved of Joanna, who repeated,-"this
                        gentleman," and her sister's spirit grew paler still,â€”"I have
                     every reason in the world to respect him and to honor him,â€”I vow, if ever there
                     pass againâ€”now remember! if ever there pass again, one syllable against him
                     from your lips, or if ever you put to me even a single question about him, I
                     will from that day never utter word to you againâ€”never, never! until one of us
                     be on her death-bed. So help me God!"
                  So loud was her tone as she concluded, that the child in the back room woke up,
                     and began to cry. Mary, speechless before looks and under language she could
                     not have thought possible in Joannaâ€”Joanna her younger sister, whom she had so
                     petted and whom she still so loved, was struck to the heart; and it was Joanna
                     herself, not she, that now observed the cry.
                  "Hush, dear; mamma is coming."
                  "Naughty mamma!" cried the child, "naughty mamma, to leave Joey!"
                  Joanna looked to her sister.
                  "I never told her that," said Mary, meekly.
                  "No, dear Mary," exclaimed Joanna, while the child cried on, unattended to,
                     "No, you are good.â€”O, don't turn from me! I am wretched enough, and need your
                     love." Joanna hugged her, till the widow wept. "Dear Mary, forgive me, that God
                     may! And now, go, and tell John I cannot come to-night. He won't ask why."
                  "And if he does?"
                  "Hush, Joey!â€”Tell him"â€”
                  Mum-ma-h!"
                  "Mamma will be there directly.â€”Tell himâ€”No! tell him nothing," added Joanna
                     proudly, (even in their absence have men such influence over women who love
                     them truly:24)â€”"tell him I want to stay here to-night." Joanna
                     entered the dark room, and Mary, gazing on her with a sort of awe, yet, a
                     moment after, sighing sadly, put hastily on her shawl and bonnet, and hurried
                     from the house.
                  The child, in its impatience, had let itself down from the bed, and now ran to
                     meet the mother. "Ma-ma!" it said, with its imperfect articulation, "where 'as
                     'ou been so long?" And it threw its puny arms about Joanna's knees, who took it
                     up, and, returning to the front room, sat down with it in her lap; but she
                     neither answered it, nor kissed it, nor even looked at it. She had fallen into
                     that dreamy state, which almost invariably follows the first scene of a nature
                     like that of hers with Ernestin, (I mean not in its peculiar circumstances, but
                     as a love-scene following long expectation and momentous in its result,) and
                     her ardent imagination, now fairly kindled for perhaps the first time, was
                     recurring to that transitory paradise whose forbidden fruit had proved so
                     bitter and whose fall so desolating. Her head bends over the child, which gazes
                     up wondering, almost frightened, in its mother's eyes, which it sees look
                     straight before her, and whose expression, though the child cannot know its
                     unearthly beauty, is so strange it fascinates her little heart with a mingled
                     charm and fear.
                  "Dear Joanna!" murmurs the mother.
                  "Why don't 'ou kiss me den, mamma?"
                  "Yes," pursues Joanna, in a voice like a whisper, but with an intonation that
                     was exquisitely sweet, so full indeed of a transcendent happiness and
                     tenderness, that the wondering child was soothed, and wondering was pleased:
                     "Yes, yes! He did call me so." In a sudden rapture she hugs the child,â€”but only with partial
                     consciousness, for her eyes still fix on vacancy, and she does not kiss her.
                        "Forget you?" (Her voice, still low, how musically clear! and
                     with what delicious sweetness the soul vibrates in it!) "Is that
                     possible? I will remember you, dear Joanna, with gratitude for what you have
                     borne for me, and in my prayers. Good b'ye."
                  "O mamma! don't go 'way 'gain! don't 'ou f'om Joey!" The child began to cry,
                     and Joanna was for a moment roused.
                  "Hush," she said. "Go to sleep, my dear." But she did not kiss it.
                  "I don't want to sleep, mamma; I want 'ou tell me where 'ou been so long. Kiss
                     me, my mamma."
                  "My dear," said Joanna, "before I kiss you, I must tell you never to ask mamma
                     again where she has been. Will you mind?"
                  "But 'ou won't go 'way 'gain, mamma?"
                  "No, my dear." Joanna sighed, and suddenly drew the child to her lips and
                     kissed it long and passionately. Was it partly to hide her gushing tears from
                     the child? for the little creature, when released, exclaimed affectionately,
                     putting up its small hands to Joanna's cheeks, "Don't cry, mamma; don't 'ou;
                     and Joey won't ask, any more."
                  "No, truly?" said Joanna, lapsing, while the applicability of the
                     remembered words gave a tinge of madness to her abstraction.
                  "No, mamma."
                  "Then all is safe," resumed the absent mother, like a lunatic or
                     sleep-talker. "Joanna, hear me. We must part at once. Don't cry!"
                     The child began to whimper. "Would you be ruined? Would you make
                     yourself self contemptible in my eyes? Go back to your husband. O God!"
                     exclaimed the poor visionary, starting with the pang of memory. And then she
                     added, with a burst of tears, "It is a bitter dream for all."
                  "Was 'ou dreaming, mamma?" asked the little one.
                  "Yes, my dear, a dream I pray you never will dream like me. And now, will you
                     go to sleep, Joey? or will you wait till Aunt Mary comes home? Mamma cannot
                     hear you say your prayers to-night."
                  Poor Joanna! with the intellect wakes conscience, and while thy lips speak
                     eloquently a simple language, yet not unrefinedâ€”because thy love is elevated,
                     and thy soul, in that brief interview with Ernestin, has caught a gleam of
                     radiance whose light no moral cloud shall ever lessen,â€”thy ears have lost all
                     relish for the sweet orisons of childhood, and duty finds no room in thy
                     o'ercrowded heart.
                  "A'n't we going home to pa'? I don't want to stay no more, here, with
                     Aunty."
                  "But you must, my dear; mamma is not going home."
                  The child began to cry, and being sickly, and irritable from its broken
                     slumber, fretted, until, with the mother's efforts to lull it, it fell asleep
                     in her lap.
                  Then Joanna relapsed into her waking dream of pleasure and of pain; now
                     motionless and still, with fixed but not vacant eyes, then sighing softly, or
                     murmuring Ernestin's few words again, or thrilling perceptibly, while a burning
                     blush suffused all her face, and her broad eyelids quivered. With that
                     imperfect consciousness of outward things which is often felt at morning when
                     our sleep is about to end, or during brief slumber in the day, she heard her
                     sister return, ascend the stairs, approach her, yet she stirred not: and it was
                     with wonderment the widow, who caught the murmur Dear Joanna! and
                     thought it meant for the sleeping
                     child, saw the day-dreamer lift her own hand to her own lips and kiss it
                     rapturously.
                  "Why, Joanna! Are you awake?" said Mary, touching her shoulder.
                  "Yes," answered Joanna, seriously, and without confusion. "What said John?"
                  "Oh, he laughed, and said we were all used to sleep double, but, as there was
                     odds now on our side, I ought to have brought home Joey, to make it even."
                  "And never asked if I was sick?"
                  "Not a word."
                  "Just like him. He takes every thing so easily!"
                  "The more reason why"â€”Mary stopped.
                  "I should not wrong him? Those were the very words whichâ€”which
                        he said to me."
                  "And"â€”The widow, who looked both surprised and pleased, stopped again, and,
                     with great self-command, turned away.
                  Joanna's imagination was not alone exalted; her perspicacity, naturally keen,
                     and which seemed to paint itself in the profound look of her mysteriously
                     beautiful eyes, shared too the excitement of that eventful night; and, looking
                     after her melancholy sister, she said:
                  "Mary, I am very cruel as ungrateful. I know what you would say; but you love
                     me too well to speak it, after my wicked oath. Come sit by me. I will tell you
                     all I dare, because it will please you to know I did not go to meet him." Mary
                     took her sister's hand, in silence. "I did not, on my honor." Mary pressed it.
                     "It was an accident I did not hope for, and heâ€”he was sorry for." Joanna wept.
                     Mary took both her hands, and pressed them in both of hers. "O yes, you are
                     pleased. But if youâ€”if it was your case, Maryâ€”Never mind. It is all over now."
                     Joanna wiped her eyes; and collecting her thoughts a moment, that she might not
                     tell more than she should, repeating even half-aloud Fitzherbert's caution,â€”Conceal what you will,â€”the more the better,â€”but tell no falsehood,â€”she began her story.
                  "I was coming home, no matter from what or whereâ€”I must not tell you: it was
                     merely to learn something, which I did learn, and was content: I was climbing
                     to the top of the coach, when I chanced to seeâ€”himâ€”himself in the inside, with
                     his eyes upon me. O, Mary! my heart stopped, as if it was shot through, and I
                     grew so blind I stumbled, and the driver abused me, and everybody laughed,
                     which made me worse, whenâ€”he got out, and telling the driver I was too feeble
                     to go on top, made me take a place inside. O Mary, his voice was so gentle, and
                     so soft; and his hand"â€”Joanna paused, palpitating, while her sister's face
                     assumed rapidly an expression of uneasiness and pain.â€”"He suspected me; he told
                     me who I was; and Iâ€”I was so happy, yet so wretched to be with him! and his
                     voice was so gentle and so soothing, and his way so tender, yet so respectful,
                     as if I had done nothing shameful and was not beneath him, I could not help but
                     tell him all." Joanna, putting one arm before her sleeping child, threw the
                     other around her sister's neck, and sobbing said, "Do not despise me, Mary, no
                     more than he did; O do not! do not!"
                  "Despise you, dear!" exclaimed Mary softly, while she pressed her sister's
                     beautiful head closer to the shoulder it leaned on, "I am sorry for you, sorry
                     to deathâ€”with a sorrow sadder than when Ledyard died."
                  It is interesting to observe, how the widow's language became too, under the
                     inspiration of the occasion, and the involuntary example of her sister, neater
                     than usual, if not absolutely
                     refined. Its eloquence and its pathos flowed, whence alone they could flow,
                     from the source that never dries - a tender and loving heart.
                  Presently Joanna resumes, but without raising her head. She seems to feel that
                     position less embarrassing, while it soothes her and encourages to confidence.
                     Scrupulously suppressing all that might implicate Fitzherbert, or furnish even
                     the slightest clue to his personality, curbing even the longing she had to
                     picture him to her sister with the pencil of her passion, she told all her
                     disappointment, all her wishes, all his good counsels, and his final triumph
                     over her temptation and that of his own soul, whose weakness she had not failed
                     to discover. "Don't sigh with so much satisfaction, Mary," said poor Joanna.
                     "You are happy to find him better than you feared, while it kills me only to
                     remember what agony I suffered, when the door shut on me all alone in the
                     darkness, and I was choking with my tears but did not dare to cry aloud. But
                     what will you say, when you hear all! This cruelâ€”this dearâ€”this angel of a
                     manâ€”O that he were an angel, and that I were an angel with him! and nobody else
                     but us two together in the broad blue sky!" Joanna had raised her superb head;
                     and her sister gazed on her with a sort of mingled stupefaction and admiration,
                     as she saw, even in that dim light, the splendor of her lifted eyes and the
                     fire of her cheeks, and for the moment feared that she was mad. "Is there
                     another man like him in all the world? when too he knew I would have given away
                     my soul to have him with me once more? When the coach stopped, I made so sure
                     that he would join me again! if it was but a little while; but he put me into a
                     carriage by myself, though he felt how my hand clung to his own, that it was
                     killing me to part thus, and left me to come home all alone, not trusting
                     himself with me even for one moment. Is there such another, say? Are you not
                     satisfied now, Mary?"
                  "O yes, happy, Joanna!"
                  "And I?â€”To lose him forever! to watch no more his stately head! to look no more
                     into his thoughtful eyes! to"â€”Joanna stopped even in the midst of her sorrow
                     and her enthusiasm. "And to go home to my husbandâ€”who is so different! to see
                     his mean little face, and his silly eyes which only laugh! his clumsy,
                     ill-dressed figure! to feel his hard hands, and"â€”
                  "My dearâ€”those hands maintain youâ€”and"â€”
                  "O yesâ€”I know itâ€”I know my dutyâ€”I should and will submitâ€”it was
                        his will. And in time perhapsâ€”But never to see him again!"
                     (gazing on vacancy) "never Mary, do you hear that?" (her eyes grew
                     singularly wild)â€”"when I would give my life but to hear him tell me once again,
                     in that voice of his, he dares not stay! to hear him say he does not forget me!
                     And he did say it! "Forget you? Is that possible?" (she repeats
                     the words in a low sweet voice that thrilled the sister, who watched in
                     admiration and alarm Joanna's eyes fixed on the air before her, but full of
                     infinite tenderness:) "I will remember you, dear Joanna, with
                     gratitude for what you have borne for me, and in my prayers." Bless him for
                     that, God! bless him! ever!â€”O to have him once more with his soft hand press my
                     fingers, as he then pressed them!" (she raised her right hand to her lips, and
                     again kissed it rapturously, as her sister had before observed her
                     do:)â€”"toâ€”toâ€”Mary, I shall go mad! I must, I will see him! I cannot"â€”
                  "Joanna! you will kill the child!" exclaimed in terror the widow, who saw
                     Joanna starting up with clasped hands, and her burden about to roll to the
                     floor.
                  
                  "Kill it?" said Joanna wildlyâ€”yet putting her arm before the child to save it:
                     "I tell you, Mary, I would strangle it in my lap as it lies, but to make him
                     love me as I now love him!"25
                  
                  "Then God help you, and forgive you, Joanna!"
                  "Amen!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXI.
                  REPENTANCE.
                  AS the light of heaven is nothing without the shadows of earth, and the shadows
                     of earth are nothing without the light of heaven, nay, but for it could not
                     exist, so are man's virtue and his frailty. His frailty is marked but by the
                     light of virtue, and his virtue would have no relief were it not for the
                     earth-shadows of his frailty, which intercepts that effluence of the soul which
                     renders him immortal.
                  It were idle to say that Ernestin did not more than once feel an undefinable
                     regret, at having rejected the occasion which an evil fortune had put in his
                     way, and left Joanna disconsolate, and left her, as he meant, forever. When the
                     image of her beauty came before him, as for many weeks it often did, he
                     resisted it, if not always successfully, yet manfully; but her tenderness, her
                     devotion, her distress even, which was a part and consequence of these
                     qualities or feelings, the traces which he thought he had discovered of an
                     intelligent and noble mind and of an elevated imagination, the memory of these
                     particulars battled with his virtue fearfully; and had he continued the
                     conflict, it is probable, considering the depth of Joanna's passion, the fatal
                     contempt she had conceived for her husband, the convenience of her neighborhood
                     and Ernestin's knowledge of her domestic habits, which gave him a thousand opportunities of meeting with
                     her, it is probable, I say, that the contest had ended, as it too often does in
                     such cases, in the ruin of both man and woman. But, frightened at his weakness,
                     he took with a determined effort to his studies, and, when he found that he
                     could not sufficiently abstract his thoughts for these, he waited not, trusting
                     not himself one moment, but turned resolutely to his art, and, blessing God who
                     had given him these varied means of occupation, completed to his mother's great
                     delight his portrait of Ilda, began, finished, and cast a bust of his father,
                     and finding he had made it too large for life, and that, molding it in pieces
                     for the sake of multiplying copies for the family, he had in his want of
                     practice committed an oversight, whereby in the mold one half of the face fell
                     below the other, began from the broken clay a new model, and worked on it
                     simultaneously with a bust of his sister Agnes. Rewarded for his resolution by
                     a real victory over himself, he worked with fresh delight and unremittedly, and
                     reaped thereby a new reward in the respit his exertion gave his brain, and the
                     consequent restoration of his health; a restoration which, had he but continued
                     in the same pursuits, might have been complete, and, as it was, seemed to his
                     grateful fancy almost providential.
                  And now in the evenings, when his labor was suspended, and often during the
                     merely mechanical part of his work, came the repentance we have alluded to in a
                     previous chapter, and the image of Agnes Elphinstone rose up before him fresh
                     and with new light, to help do battle for his soul against the seductive memory
                     of her rival. A cloud seemed to drop from his eyes, or from between them and
                     the person he contemplated. No longer under the high excitement of his passion,
                     and having no disappointment to encounter from his imagination, he began to do
                     her justice. He recalled her youth, and what may seem odd for us to say, her
                     sex; for really Ernestin in his resentment had forgotten that Agnes was a
                     woman, and that, open dealing could not be expected of her, especially under
                     circumstances in which, even were she not influenced by her relatives, she
                     might feel that some equivocation was necessary to save her from a suspicion of
                     being too frank and too ready. And though she had been over-communicative to
                     her friends, and thereby exposed him to certain ridiculeâ€”for in love it is as
                     with a dance, they who stand at a distance, and hear not the music, find its
                     movements merely antics, and did they not know the occasion by experience,
                     might reasonably deem the dancers mad,â€”yet there was an apology to be found for
                     her in the nature, the education, and the social habits of her sex.
                  I do not mean to say that Agnes was right. On the contrary, when Ernestin made
                     love to her he put a trust in her honor which should not have been violated.
                     Deaf to his remonstrances, and uncompassionate of his sensitiveness, she had
                     subjected him to ridicule without compunction, but without malice, thoughtless
                     of his wounds, and incredulous perhaps when he told her of their smart. It was
                     as children torture flies and men shoot snipes, without reflection and for the
                     passing gratification.26 But this argued no want of principle, and
                     Ernestin's instruction would have opened her eyes. Still, how could he be sure
                     what part of this inconsiderateness was owing to a false or defective
                     education, how much was the result of natural insensibility? And the poet's
                     hopes and wishes, which had dawned again, and promised perfect day, were
                     clouded over.
                  Another apprehension that tormented the regretful lover was the fear that she
                     had not the mind to sympathize thize
                     with him. It was the curse of his life, the counterpoise to his immense
                     advantages of intellect, that he found none to comprehend him and to think with
                     him. If a woman of his mother's superior mind was, he found, unable to
                     understand and to appreciate him, what was he to expect from Agnes, the
                     formation of whose forehead did not promise so much (he forgot the difference
                     of his mother's age and Agnes'), and whose sentiments, so far as he could
                     discover them, already disappointed him? Alas! where are men like Ernestin to
                     look for companionship? He thought on his sister Agnes. But her, a girl of her
                     extraordinary qualities, whose very face made her the gaze of even the vulgar,
                     and whose manners and speech the wonder of the young and the delight of the
                     aged! He sighed. In all of Agnes Elphinstone's face, noble and beautiful as it
                     was, was not a feature that reminded him of his sister Agnes. He uncovered the
                     bust he had modeled of her from memory. 'Twas a goddess! a poetess! a
                     personification of the double immateriality of heart and head! He brought his
                     lips nigh the moist forehead of the yet unfinished clay; and for an instant the
                     soul of Ernestin was with his sister, in the farther stars.
                  But these were transient feelings, spasms as it were, not steady pains; and
                     when the smart was over the relief from its sensation was in itself a pleasure,
                     and the pleasure of the after-thought was ecstasy. Then rose above the horizon
                     of his fancy the star of Agnes' beauty, and its mellow rays, undimmed by any
                     brighter planet, woke adoration that was not idolatry, and stirred his pulses
                     with a ravishment that was not sin. He recalled the virginal freshness and the
                     innocent expression of her lips, the unmistakable purity of her eyes, the
                     chaste outline of her brows, the character so full of nobleness, so completely
                     void of meanness, that was in the remaining features of her face; he thought on
                     the advantages of her birth which must encourage in her any native nobleness of
                     sentiments; and he dwelt with satisfaction on her youth, which promised him
                     docility. In fact and briefly, there was no defect in her character and her
                     disposition, as he judged them, that might not be corrected, could he marry her
                     thus early, though at a later day it would be difficult, if not impossible. But
                     as yet he had not made her acquaintance in the formal way required of him, and
                     every monthâ€”month? every week, every day, was taking something from the
                     pliability of her temper; for, a formed woman, to attempt to mold the character
                     of such! you might as well go about to lay the wind.
                  He was actually revolving whether he should not make a confidant of his married
                     sister, and leave it to her to find means of making the acquaintance of Agnes,
                     when an event occurred which scattered all his plans at once and forever.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXXII.
                  THE MINIATURE.
                  IT was now about seven months since the affair which had acquired Ernestin the
                     friendship of De Coucy. The latter had often called to see him, leaving the
                     solitary always happier and younger both in looks and heart; so that he was, as
                     Ernestin himself assured him, the medicine of his life. For the last three
                     months, however, De Coucy was away in France. They corresponded. But latterly
                     the Major's letters, which had been both numerous and long, became briefer and
                     less frequent, though not less friendly in their tone. Ernestin suspected the
                     cause; and he smiled a happy smile, when the last letter which he received
                     confirmed his conjecture by the following passage.
                  "By the by, my dear fellow, I am going to be married. I am, by Jove! I have
                     found me such a girl! But you sha'n't know any thing about her, nor shall she
                     about you, till you meet. I am determined you shall fall in love with one
                     another at first sightâ€”but always in a modest way, mind you! and therefore have
                     not trusted my lips with either about eitherâ€”to keep your respective
                     imaginations from fermenting,â€”the only way to save them from brewing
                     disappointment. I may however trust you with one secret, which yet you may
                     believe is more than I shall, just at present, confide to her. My second
                     boyâ€”who, you know, is to have half my mother's fortune â€”is to be named Ernestin
                     Fitzherbert. The first is to be called Coucy. It would break papa's heart, if
                     it were not. He has not, it is true, bespoken itâ€”perhaps not being so apt to
                     reckon unhatched chickens; but I know what he expects in the event; so that
                     point is settled. Look for me now every day until you see me; and, do you mind,
                     Fitzherbert? keep yourself in readiness for Christmas, Holmhurst, and my
                     mother."
                  This letter, read a dozen times, as was usual with Ernestin, was yet fresh in
                     his unenvious heart, where it had called into active being a thousand
                     delightful anticipations, when one morning in his study he heard a knock at the
                     street-door, and a step on the staircase which made him bound up from his
                     chair; but none too soon; for, the next moment, De Coucy, unannounced, rushed
                     into the room, and almost sprang into his arms, exclaiming,
                  "Well, my dear Fitzherbert! How are you? how are you? At your eternal books,
                     incorrigible! but not dull, I am glad to see."
                  "And how bright you are, De Coucy!" said Ernestin, returning with both hands
                     the warm pressure of both the Major's, and gazing with delight in his handsome,
                     manly, and brave face.
                  "Bright, my dear fellow? I am going to be married, did I not tell you? And my
                     first visit on my return is to you, to invite you to see my bride. Now, don't
                     look so sad! I am selfish, I know, to talk of it to you; but you know I must
                     sooner or later; and so must you sooner or later see her;â€”and, by the by, she
                     shall sit to you, by Jove! There, look at that; and then go up and rig yourself
                     to come with me."
                  De Coucy took from his breast-pocket a miniature in a case, and, sitting down
                     before Ernestin, prepared himself to
                     enjoy his friend's admiration of his choice, as the latter, with a happy and
                     yet withal a pensive smile, undid the clasps.
                  Suddenly, Ernestin turned pale as death, not unobserved of De Coucy, who had
                     his bright eyes fixed upon him eagerly, to watch the effect of the picture on
                     one of whose taste he thought highly.
                  "What is the matter?"
                  There was no answer; but Fitzherbert's hands trembled as with palsy.
                  De Coucy was a man of much perspicacity. He passed his hand over his brow. The
                     whole truth flashed over him in a moment.
                  "I see it!" he cried. "It was Agnes Elphinstone because of whom you fought.â€”I
                     need no answer. It is given me in your emotion at the name." De Coucy pressed
                     the hand Fitzherbert, too much moved to speak, held out to him in silence. "I
                     will not have her."
                  "Why not?" said Ernestin, drawing his hand away in displeasure.
                  "Becauseâ€”but I will not imitate your toneâ€”I pardon youâ€”Because, Fitzherbert,
                     she who could jilt a man like you, will not answer for a man like me. Enough,
                     that I owe to her folly, or wickedness, your friendship."
                  "Henry De Coucy," said Ernestin, "sit down again, and listen to meâ€”calmly and
                     patiently. Agnes never jilted me. Could such a word be applied to the conduct
                     of either of us, it would rather fit mine than hers. But for this accident, you
                     had never discovered a secret, which I have not even now betrayed. If I tell
                     you all my history, and all of hers in connection with me, it is to do her
                     right, to clear De Coucy's wifeâ€”do not shake your head, nor try to frown; she
                     must be so; I believe most religiously she deserves to beâ€”to clear, I say, De
                     Coucy, your wife, that will be, in the eyes of her husband, for whom she should
                     be white as snow."
                  Ernestin put his arm about the waist of De Coucy, and told him all,â€”all he had
                     a right to tell. And now came the struggle. De Coucy, generous himself, though
                     perhaps not to such romantic excess as Ernestin, insisted upon taking the
                     latter to visit Agnes, since he was sure that she loved him, or would.
                     Ernestin, positively and even sternly declining, (though, poor wretch! how his
                     heart quivered all the while, and how very pale his lips grew! not because he
                     had compressed them,) assured him of his mistake. "That she might have loved
                     me, I will not deny that I believe; for I should have tried, fervently, to make
                     her; but as innocent as she is of all wrong intended toward me, so is her heart
                     void of all attachment,â€”I would say, unspotted by any love, at least for
                     meâ€”because you should receive her virginal in soul as in body. Marry her,
                     Henry, and God bless you! Now, no more. Go, goâ€”to her. I will call on you in
                     the afternoon."
                  Ernestin put the Major, with gentle violence, from the room; and, when he was
                     gone!â€”
                  Where was then his angel?
                  Down from Heaven gazed the guardian Spirit, and saw the poor poet fall on his
                     knees, and with locked hands, whose palms turned outward, as he stretched them
                     out before his body, pray for endurance of this new anguish.
                  Over all Heaven were heard the sounds; and the melancholy sweetness deepened on
                     the lips of the lone Archangel as he listened.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXXIII.
                  THE DREAM.
                  THAT night into the chamber of Ernestin flew the loving angel. Ernestin slept;
                     but he looked pale, and his lips quivered as in a troubled dream. Over the
                     restless body the angel leaned, and his wings, opening half-way, covered and
                     shadowed the poet, and seemed to lull him into quiet rest. Then the angel,
                     stooping, put his beautiful lips near the mouth, that seemed no more to suffer,
                     of the poet, and drew in the gently-heaving breath. He raised his effulgent
                     head. The child of Earth appeared to breathe no longer. And the angel put his
                     lips to the left arm, which lay outside the coverlet; and when he drew them
                     away, the light from the immortal's face, beaming on the mortal's flesh, showed
                     a suffusion, as if blood had been taken.
                  And now flew back the angel, until he came to the chamber of the sisters in the
                     distant and great world of translated spirits. With a like act, both on the
                     lips and arm, though here the spot that followed was a purer red, the angel
                     left them likewise. Then hovering a moment over the valley, where again the
                     moon poured down its glory and the great mountain spread its awful shadow, he
                     ascended to the summit of the mountain, and, folding his beneficent pinions,
                     looked down, well-pleased, into the valley.
                  And behold, what seemed the form of Ernestin and those of his sisters walked
                     together in the valley. But the forms were all of Earth, and all were youthful;
                     such, namely, as Ernestin had been in earlier days, and such as his sisters
                     were before death had severed them. "And tell me," said the voice of Ernestin,
                     "tell me, Ilda,â€”art thou happy?"
                  "Not perfectly so," answered the elder sister; "the king of the country where
                     we live is cruel, and his people suffer."
                  "Then you have kings! Is there no change in the universe?"
                  "All things are much the same as in the world where I lived and loved you,
                     brother; only we seem a greater and nobler people, our passions more elevated,
                     and our senses more refined."
                  "And do you remember then the Earth? Speak, Agnes."
                  And the younger sister, who had loved him even more than the elderâ€”with a more
                     passionate love, as suited her nature, blushed very red, as he had seen her
                     often on the Earth, but with a livelier flush. She sighed too as she answered,
                     and her very noble features looked classic as a Greek statue's. "But dimly,
                     brother. It seems, as does now this valley, which I know is the valley of our
                     new home, veiled in a mist; but there is a consciousness that we have once
                     lived elsewhere; and of thee, O my brother, the remembrance is as noonday."
                  Then the noble Agnes kissed her brother's hand, and the beautiful and stately
                     Ilda fell on his neck.
                  "And are you married?" said Ernestin, kissing them. And he wept as he kissed
                     them; and the kiss, though it had nothing in it sensuous, yet awoke a thrill
                        of rapture such as never had kiss
                     of woman given him before; and the sisters too seemed to quiver through all
                     their frame; and they grew transcendently beautiful,â€”so that even the angel
                     thrilled as he gazed on them. But Ilda murmured,
                  "No, not yet. Our mother"â€”
                  "Mother?" cried Ernestin: "But our mother, noble creature, lives yet on
                     Earth."
                  And the sisters looked one to another, surprised; and Agnes said, "O no, we
                     have our mother here, and father, and other brothers, and a sister."
                  The wings of the angel were heard as the rushing wind; and the forms of the
                     sisters seemed to fade, as, ceasing to speak, they stretched their yet longing
                     arms to Ernestin.
                  "One question, O answer me," said Ernestin, "before you go! What is it to die?
                     How were you thus translated? and have you in your new home other forms?"
                  Immediately, he awoke in his own chamber.
                  It was broad day. He was happy, with a thrilling joy, like the blood of youth
                     in rapturous motion in his veins; but his pillow was wet with tears.
                  "The king of the country?" murmured Ernestin.â€”"What a strange but
                     blissful dream!" And he looked upon his arm, where there was a faint mark as of
                     a puncture made by some very small and sharp instrument. "Blessed sisters!
                     visit me again; and let me once more dream ofâ€”was it Heaven?" And, rising, his
                     ablutions done, he made his prayers, in the freshness of the morning, with new
                     thankfulness and a happiness exceeding great.
                  But, months afterward, his dream, which now was indistinct distinct in his
                     memory, the valley having gone and nothing but the forms of his sisters and
                     their words remaining, would recur to his imagination; and, pondering it with a
                     melancholy pleasure, he told it at last to his mother and his friend; and
                     neither smiled.

                  CHAPTER I.
                  THE FRUITS OF AFFLICTION PUT FORTH, AND PROMISE LARGELY.
                  "No, De Coucy," said Ernestin, resisting, for the hundredth time, the Major's
                     entreaties to visit Agnes; "it is better thus. I never will visit her. Good
                     b'ye."
                  "Had I known this, Ernestin"â€”
                  "You would have forfeited your honor? Say not so, Henry De Coucy. Redeem your
                     pledge; take your wife. You do not lose your friend. Why should I visit her,
                     more than you my brothers, and my sister? You know them not, yet we are still
                     friends. And so we shall be ever, I trust in God. Good b'yeâ€”good b'ye, De
                     Coucy; write to me often,â€”every weekâ€”after the honeymoon" (with a sad smile):
                     "it will be too much till then. Heaven bless you, and yours." And they parted,
                     the Major, with an unquiet heart, to prepare for his nuptials, which very soon
                     took place, and the artist-poet, for whom now there were to be no Christmas
                     Holydays, no paradise at Holmhurst, to sit down to his endless tasks with a
                     passionate energy that was meant to exclude all foreign thought, shutting tight
                     as it were the teeth of his spirit in an obstinancy of determination he had
                     never yet displayed, and which, long continued, lent at last a melancholy
                     sternness to his visage, deepening the traces of years while it added to the
                     manliness of his features, and gave him, with the moral exaltation of his
                     labors, a loftier step and majesty of mien.
                  There was now no pause, no window-loitering, no desultory and vague musing.
                     When his brain warned him to lay aside the pen, it was but to take in hand the
                     pencil, or the chisel, or to finger the plastic clay, or to resume his
                     experiments on the materials of paintingâ€”a research in which at once he took a
                     keen interest and found a source of pleasing relaxation. Then it was that his
                     coloring, which hitherto had not been the same in any two pictures, and
                     frequently was changed a dozen times in one, became fixed to one mode from
                     which he never after sought to deviate, and, becoming fixed, grew rapid and
                     decided; then that, obeying what he deemed an obligation of his nature as a
                     member of the family of man, he laid down in writing, for the benefit of
                     posterity, the results of his practice and of his experiments in the art; and
                     then that on his modeling-stands were seen to arise three little figures, of
                     uniform dimensions,â€”busts; two of which his mother acknowledged to be happy
                     miniatures of his departed sisters, while for the otherâ€”which was a Gorgon head
                     of a severe and haughty beauty, full of pride and wrathâ€”memory brought the
                     model from the Rue de la Paix.
                  Memory? Ah, he never forgot that model! Every thing in his art, that admitted
                     of such license, bore traces of the image which had passedâ€”had passed? which
                     was passing, despite of all this effort, daily, more or less often, before his
                     mental vision. It was seen in the long, sinuous, and heavy, yet fine and pliant
                     hair, in the full, large lids of the perfectly formed eyes, in the innocent
                     expression of the virginal lips (and for this one charm, so purely classic, he deemed himself at times repaid
                     for all his troubles), in the oval contour of the visage. Everywhere in short,
                     in his statues and his paintings, where truth required not the sacrifice of her
                     remembrance, was Agnes Elphinstone, and Agnes, the protagonist of other scenes
                     than the melodramatic rencounter of the Rue de la
                        Paix.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE HARVEST RIPENS.
                  IT was at this time that Ernestin put in practice a long-meditated purpose, and
                     removed from a home where, in the midst of relatives, he must live by himself
                     or eat the bread of bitterness.
                  It is idle to rail at jealousy. Not to be jealous, or rather, not to feel that
                     torture of the heart which goes by the name, but which does not necessarily
                     suppose those passionate demonstrations which are so often its concomitants,
                     much less those criminal acts which in a malignant or a violent and
                     unscrupulous nature, and in such only,27 are at times its frightful
                     consequence, not to be jealous one must be well-satisfied, self-satisfied, or
                     indifferent. It is impossible that any one who loves can see the object of his
                     affections cold to him, ungrateful, nay insensible to all his devotion and
                     self-sacrifice, while animated, joyous, and lavish of tenderness to another,
                     who shows not even affection and whose cares are all concentred in himself, and
                     not feel wounded. This is heart-sickness in the gentle and submissive, but in
                     the passionate and high-spirited is the bitterness of death. Ernestin's very
                     safety required a departure from the maternal home; for the anguish, his
                     affectionate and sensitive nature was daily made to endure, was helping in no
                     small degree to aggravate the malady that was destroying him.
                  
                  Making an arrangement with the estate by which he could at once enter on a
                     portion of his rights, Fitzherbert took apartments in town, in
                     Sackville-street, plain, but respectable, and, for the location, at a moderate
                     rent, and determined now to devote himself wholly to ambition. "She shall
                     regret me," he said to himself, with compressed lips and flashing eyes, and
                     meaning, not his mother but Agnes. "When I rise into fame,â€”perhaps!"â€”He would
                     not trust himself with the thought; for his bosom throbbed, and he recollected
                     she was De Coucy's wife, the wife of a man to whom he was under great
                     obligations, and who loved him equally as he was by him loved. "And then she
                     will read my booksâ€”and in them read, for the first time, me." It was in itself
                     a prize, this prospect to be realized; and Ernestin sat down, heart and
                     soul.
                  It was the tide of his affairs; and his destiny directed him to take it at the
                     flood. It so happened that the ministry then in power had not come up to the
                     expectations of the country, and murmurs were beginning to be heard and echoed
                     through the public journals. More than once, the division in the House was such
                     as nearly to bring them to that pass when they would have been forced to
                     resign. Now Ernestin, easily fired at injustice, and strongly republican in his
                     political sentiments, could not read these evidences of mismanagement, and of
                     evasion of pledges or implied engagements, without burning to assail the party
                     with his pen. And at last, abandoning for a single week his immediate task, he
                     gave forth his thoughts and suggestions in a pamphlet, which, havingâ€”like most
                     productions of an energetic and passionate temper, where written as it were at
                     one heat, a kind of eloquence that could not but command attention, even if its
                     close and accumulated arguments failed to convince the reason, found readily a
                     publisher.
                  The paper was written not to satisfy ambition,â€”nay, he had abandoned for awhile
                     ambition, in order to compose it; but, as sometimes happens, it proved the very
                     means of obtaining what his more elaborate productions, on which he toiled with
                     a heart full of hope, would perhaps alone have failed to win him, certainly in
                     so brief a time. In a word, the pamphlet took; and Ernestin saw,
                     to his own astonishment, though perhaps not without a vague hope of some such
                     result,â€”for when, whatever the motives of the writer, does an author abandon
                        that? he saw, if I may so express myself, the stone which he
                     had flung carelessly down, if not rejected, become the very head of the
                     corner.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER III.
                  IT IS GATHERED, A THOUSAND FOLD.
                  IT is the second week after Ernestin's elated heart has been again and again
                     dangerously excited by the continual and increasing praises of the opposition
                     press, which, assigning his production to various eminent names in turn, some
                     of which made him smile, and others frown, called upon the unknown writer to
                     reveal himself.
                  With a throbbing pulse, which all his philosophy, and all his shame at his own
                     emotion, could not subdue, the poet-pamphleteer put on his hat, and strolled to
                     Waterloo-place.
                  His bookseller received him with a smile and a deal of profound bowing, which
                     told Ernestin as plainly as the newspapers, that his pamphlet was making a
                     great sensation in the politico-literary world.
                  "I am very glad to see you, Mr. Fitzherbert. Will you trouble yourself to walk
                     this way?"
                  Mr. Hammond led the way to his official parlor, and drawing very politely a
                     stuffed arm-chair for his favored visitor, saw him seated, then took a seat
                     opposite to him, with an air of benevolent satisfaction. It is a humanity, an
                     apostolic charity, a paternal amenity, for which publishers are remarkable
                     towards successful writers.
                  "You are in the very tide of success, sir," pursued Mr. Hammond, rubbing his
                     hands together. "His grace ofâ€”â€”, who is at the head of the party whose views
                     you have put forth with so much energy"â€”
                  "My own views, sir. I am in the interest of no party," interposed the
                     essayist.
                  Hammond wriggled. "I mean, the party whose views are in harmony with yours. His
                     grace inquired particularly about the author of the pamphlet which had made so
                     much noise."â€” The author felt pleased, as was natural, and, as he never took
                     pains to conceal his emotions, the smile that gave all their former youth to
                     his lips reassured Mr. Hammond, who proceeded. "As you had not desired secrecy,
                     Mr. Fitzherbert, I took the liberty to tell him who you were." Ernestin bowed.
                     "Whereupon his grace was pleased to say, that it depended entirely upon
                     yourself to become the most rising man of the day, and that it would give him
                     much pleasure to promote your advancement." Ernestin looked grave. The
                     publisher saw he had made a false step; and, as his listener gave symptoms of
                     an intention to rise, hastened to add, "He expressed a wish to have an
                     interview."
                  "Well, what prevents him?" said Ernestin: "you have my address."
                  Hammond made another vermicular movement in his chair, and looked as if he
                     would have given much for a pinch of snuff. "But"â€”he began, with his eyes on
                     the Turkey carpet, whose tufty pile the great toe of his right foot seemed to
                     be coaxing to stand up,â€”"But you know, Mr. Fitzherbert"â€” He got no further.
                     Ernestin, whose eyes were fixed upon his face, the under lid drawn up and the
                     brows brought down over the upper, interrupted him with more energy than
                     graciousness.
                  "I divine your thoughts, sir. You shall hear how well. 'Ernestin Fitzherbert,'
                     they would say, 'you are a fellow
                     who gets his living by scribbling, and would by daubing if you were not too
                     proud to paint baboons and idiots. His grace of â€”â€” is a great noble, who has
                     been prime-minister, and would like to be again. He wants to put his hand upon
                     your shoulders while he mounts, and when he gets up he will pay you handsomely
                     for the prop.'"â€”
                  "O Mr. Fitzherbert!" interposed the bookseller, deprecatingly, and now indeed
                     raising his eyes with a very candid expression.
                  "Hear me out," said Ernestin. "You will find I do not go before your meaning.
                     'Now, Mr. Fitzherbert,' you would say, 'this is a very great condescension in
                     so great a man as his grace, and you must not expect that he will call on you
                     to beg you for the fulcrum of your shoulders. You must go to him, and bowing
                     very low before him, that he may see the full extent of your clavicles, you
                     must say, My lord duke, I have understood that your grace finds some trifling
                     momentum from the prop of these poor shoulders. I pray your grace to set your
                     hand on them as heavily as you will, and if you put your gracious foot on them
                     as well, I shall only be the more grateful to your grace. Thereupon you bow
                     again gracefully, and wait till his grace is graciously pleased to show you how
                     to present arms.' You smile, Mr. Hammond. I am happy to amuse you: but let me
                     ask you seriously,â€”Did not the Duke of â€”â€” tell you he would be glad to see me
                     at â€”â€” House? Now answer plainly."
                  "He did, certainly; but"â€”
                  "If the King were to send for me," said Ernestin, rising, "I might go to him,
                     though not willingly; but the King's ex-minister must come to me." Ernestin
                     took his hat, and bowing past Hammond, was about to go.
                  "One moment, Mr. Fitzherbert, I do beseech you," said his publisher, stepping
                     before him. Ernestin stopped, but rather stiffly.
                  "There is no occasion," continued Mr. Hammond, respectfully, "that either
                     should make advances. What prevents, sir, your meeting here?"
                  "Nothing, if that be his desire. I am not so destitute of ambition, Mr.
                     Hammond, as not to see that such an interview might profit me greatly, and I am
                     not so weak as to be ashamed to own it. But observe, I will have no proposition
                     to come from me. The suggestion must be his, or your own."
                  "Mine let it be, sir." As he spoke, a carriage drove up in front of the shop;
                     and his quick eye saw in an instant, through the door of the room, which was
                     wide open, the liveries. "It is the Duke's self. Stop there one moment, Mr.
                     Fitzherbert," said Hammond, hurrying out.
                  "No," said Ernestin. "Good morning to you."
                  "For heaven's sake!â€”Excuse the liberty, my dear sir, but this is reallyâ€”I
                     promise you"â€”
                  "What?" said Ernestin, seriously.
                  "That I will merely say that you are here, as you are, by accident."â€”
                  "And let his grace do his pleasure. I will wait." Ernestin put down his hat;
                     and as he did so, a footman entered, and asked at the counter for Mr.
                     Hammond.
                  "I will wait on his grace directly," said Hammond himself. The footman
                     disappeared. "Now, do be a little"â€”began soothingly the bookseller; for he was
                     really interested, there was something so unusual in this humble author's
                     pride.
                  "A little patient, is it?" said Ernestin, smiling. "I will be a good deal so,
                     Mr. Hammond, though that I suspect
                     pect was not to be your word. Only observe"â€”and the smile was gone: "my name
                     must not be used, as soliciting, or even suggesting such an interview. If you
                     do, I leave the shop directly."
                  Hammond bowed, and went out, and was presently seen conversing through the
                     carriage-door with a gentleman, who at last descended, using the bookseller's
                     arm; and, in a few minutes, Ernestin, rising, was presented to the Duke of â€”â€”
                     as Mr. Fitzherbert, the author of the famous tract on the State of the
                     Country.
                  "Mr. Hammond," said his grace, "I think you may trust Mr. Fitzherbert and
                     myself with your Elzevirs." Hammond bowed, and, retiring backward, shut the
                     door after him.
                  The noble drew his chair near to Ernestin. "Mr. Fitzherbert," he said, "I
                     esteem it a particular good fortune to make your acquaintance thus early in a
                     career which, I sincerely hope, will be a long and great one." Ernestin bowed
                     gravely, yet not unflattered. "You have so keen a perception of the true
                     interests of our common country, and wield so vigorous a pen in expounding and
                     maintaining them, that I am anxious to see you follow up your advantage by new
                     efforts, that shall make the victory which now perches on your helm fold her
                     wings and sit there forever." The Duke was not unambitious of shining himself
                     in the eyes of the literary man.â€”Well satisfied with his own touch of art, he
                     proceeded with still more suavity. "The party which now directs the government
                     totters in its seat. The country, roused to an indignant sense of its inertness
                     and incapacity, is moving everywhere to ensure its downfall. With such a lever
                     as you are able to apply to the unsteady massâ€”nay, as you have already set
                     under it and need only ply with a continuous exertion of your great
                     strength,â€”with so powerful appliance, united to the common efforts of our great
                     party, the incumbent ruin, shaken to its centre, must speedily give way in all
                     directions, and, in the dust of its overthrow, amid the plaudits of a grateful
                     people, we ascend to power."
                  "My lord," said Ernestin, taking advantage of this pause in the oration, "I am
                     afraid you mistake me. I am not combating under your banners." The noble
                     smiled; and Ernestin abruptly added: "I see that Mr. Hammond has prepared your
                     grace for this interview. I trust he has not done me the injustice to say that
                     I solicited it?"
                  "No, sir, no. I was desirous of seeing you for the purpose I have now
                     intimated, and Hammond telling me at the door that you were now here, I eagerly
                     embraced the occasion of making so important an acquaintance. For I trust, Mr.
                     Fitzherbert, you will not let any mistaken pride prevent your enlisting your
                     services where, I can assure you, they will be appreciated and not
                     unremembered."
                  "My lord," said Ernestin, "I see you will not understand me. In writing that
                     essay which has the good fortune to be approved of by your grace, I had no idea
                     of obliging your party; and I have no thought to do so now. I have but combated
                     for the common principles of truth and liberty such as I comprehend them." The
                     Duke's eyebrow rose; but it lost its arch immediately, when Ernestin, with
                     flashing eyes, resumed thus, and arose: "My lord, this interview must be a
                     brief one. I am a poor man, but you cannot bribe me, an ambitious man, but you
                     cannot seduce me."
                  "Mr. Fitzherbert," said the ex-minister, laying his hand on Ernestin's wrist,
                     and gently forcing him to resume his
                     seat; "you are a little peculiar. Pray, do not be offended! I mean but to say,
                     that you carry your independence to an excess that, if not romantic, is at
                     least quite unusual. You are still a young man, a mere youth in comparison with
                     myself, and in the tortuous ways of politics I suspect totally inexperienced."
                     Ernestin looked impatient. "Suffer me," said his grace, raising his hand: "you
                     will see that I mean not any thing that, proposed, should give offence to an
                     honor the nicest or a delicacy the most sensitive. What were I to ask you to
                     enlist your services in the cause of our common country?"
                  "I should bid you use them. But was that your grace's proposition? I think
                     not."
                  "I have made no proposition, Mr. Fitzherbert. You will pardon me, if I
                     pronounce you a little unreasonable. You are ambitious, you say. I might read
                     it in your very features. You confess to me, you are not rich. It does not
                     concern me. For you do me wrong, if you suppose that I have any desire either
                     to bribe or to seduce you. Shall I be believed, if I say, that did I think it
                     were easy to do either, Mr. Fitzherbert would not now have had it in his power
                     to cavil at my good intentions?"
                  There was something in Ernestin's heart, and something in his head, that bade
                     him distrust the sincerity of the speaker; but he could not resist his winning
                     courtesy, which, aided by a manner that long usage in court and cabinet had
                     given him, made him exercise a sort of fascination over a man so susceptible to
                     both these influences as Ernestin.
                  "Will your grace," he said, seeing that the Duke rested here, as waiting for
                     him to rejoin, "permit me to ask you very plainly, what do you desire of
                     me?"
                  Perhaps in all his political experience, the ex-minister had never been so
                     staggered. But he knew how to meet real frankness with a counterfeit, whose
                     stamp could not be called in question, however it might be suspected.
                  "Plainly then, Mr. Fitzherbert. I see in you a man capable of rendering a cause
                     in which I am deeply interested immense service. It is simply by continuing to
                     use your pen as you have recently done. I hope that is not against your
                     principles?" And his grace again smiled; but, this time, his smile was not
                     offensive.
                  "If they square with those of your party, my lord, I am most happy, and I shall
                     be proud, if, by continuing to maintain them in the way I have done, I can so
                     far serve that party; but further than that I cannot go, nor must you, where I
                     differ from your grace, expect me to conform my principles to your rule of
                     action. They are not so pliable as my pen. In a word, my lord, to use your own
                     figure: I am your volunteer, not your recruit. While the service suits me, I
                     will remain in your ranks; but I will not enlist with you for the whole
                     campaign."
                  His grace winced a little, but said, "Well, sir, let us first look over the
                     plan. Perhaps you will find nothing therein opposed to your own tactics, and
                     your good sword may be ours for the entire warâ€”and after," he added with a
                     slight significance that he meant should have effect. But, having had a touch
                     of Ernestin's impatience under such applications, he did not give him time to
                     ponder the hint, but continued, rising from his seat: "And to judge of that,
                     Mr. Fitzherbert, we must have a longer talk. Take your breakfast with me
                     to-morrow, at â€”â€” House. I will then unfold my views, so far as I expect you to
                     be interested in them; and you can decide accordingly. To-morrow, at eleven
                     o'clock."
                  "I will wait upon your grace, with pleasure."
                  
                  "Good morning, Mr. Fitzherbert."
                  "Good morning, my lord."
                  Ernestin, who, as well as the Duke, had taken his hat, opened the door of the
                     room, and bowed for the latter to pass before him. But the Duke, bowing in
                     turn, motioned for Ernestin to precede. Whereupon, with a second and lower bow,
                     Ernestin passed first. As the ex-minister followed, he raised his shoulders a
                     little nigher to his noble ears, and then smiled quietly, with a very slight
                     but very self-complacent smile. Hammond, who under his eyelids watched his
                     motions without appearing to notice any thing, interpreted the shrugâ€”A headstrong, hardmouthed nag, though of some mettle,â€”and the
                        smileâ€”But I know the bit will break him in.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  THE MANEGE.
                  THE nag proved more untractable than was perhaps expected. But the Duke had
                     great confidence in his own skill as a horseman, and was a thorough master of
                     the manÃ¨ge. He attempted nothing with the
                     whip or spur,â€”knowing that the result would be but to make the creature
                     mischievous, if not dangerous. Riding him with an easy rein,â€”sometimes perhaps
                     shortening it a little, left or right, while pressing with his heel on the same
                     side, according as he wanted him to lead with the off or the near
                     foreleg,â€”stopping him when cantering false,â€”never, like an ignorant jockey,
                     causing him when in full gallop to bear upon the hand in order that he might be
                     steadier himself, for he well knew that he should deaden his mouth and thereby
                     lose command of him, and make him bolt perhaps in the very critical moment of
                     the race,â€”the Duke brought him into almost perfect training. Almost; for there
                     was one thing he could not teach him, and that was the unnatural pace known as
                     the passage, to which the Duke, who had been
                     in his youth a cavalry-officer, was, it must be confessed, rather partial. Push
                     him at any fence, he would have cleared it, or broken his own and his rider's
                     neck; but progression sideways, head or tail to the wall, that was out of the
                     question; as it was likewise to trot
                     him forward with his hinder quarters crouching and his foreparts lifted. Once,
                     when the Duke, thinking he had brought him to the movement, attempted it, the
                     impatient creature nearly flung him; and it required all the coaxing and
                     caresses of his rider, continued and for a long time, to make him quiet.
                  We naturally love what has cost us trouble, especially when the object does us
                     credit; and the Duke, who owed his success assuredly as much to his own
                     imperturbable temper and perfect patience, as to the blood and fibre of the
                     animal, became quite fond of him. He would dilate, with great animation, on his
                     compactness and elasticity of muscle and consequent powerful and facile action,
                     point out his length of quarters and breadth of stifle, his full and capacious
                     chest, gracefully set neck, bold forehead, prominent eyes, thin and distended
                     nostrils, and deep mouth; then, smoothing, with an almost paternal
                     satisfaction, his fine skin and silky coat, and stroking down his elegant
                     limbs, he would pat his big windpipe, and, mounting him, to show his paces, put
                     him slily on his mettle; and as the creature, with its tremendous darting trot,
                     its horizontal gallop, and its lofty leaps, his eyes flashing fire, and every
                     nerve in tension, cleared every thing before him and stopped at
                     nothing,â€”changing his leading legs in perfect harmony and with a dazzling
                     rapidity, whether by his own volition or at some imperceptible impulsion of his
                     rider,â€”and at last came in with his free and firm yet light walk, his head
                     elevated, and his bold features animated with the delight of conscious power,
                     not a hair on his body disturbed,â€”the Duke, as he descended, looked about him
                     with a knowing and triumphant air, that seemed to say, This is
                     all my training,â€”though he had broke the creature into nothing but his walk,
                     and all his powers had been practised long before his rider had used him to the
                     saddle.
                  But, to drop this long-drawn image, the ex-minister obtained all that he really
                     needed from Ernestin, and even moreâ€”for the latter, with his proneness to love,
                     very soon began to return real affection for the Duke's equivocal
                     attachment,â€”while Ernestin still retained all that it was necessary he should
                     retain; for, though he sacrificed his independence, being in spite of himself,
                     as he might himself have foretold; soon embodied and identified with the Duke's
                     party,â€”as, but for his real magnitude and the centrifugal force of his haughty
                     spirit, he would have been absorbed and lost in it,â€”he never departed from his
                     principles of truth and honor, which, in his untainted solitude, had become
                     unalterable habits of his life. The Duke had learned to dread his excitable
                     pride so much as no more even to hint at recompense. Nor in a pecuniary sense
                     was it now needed; for the celebrity of his pamphlets, increased not a little
                     by the influence of the Duke's party, whose favorite he was easily seen to be,
                     rendered their sale so enormous, that the publisher voluntarily (to avoid of
                     course the risk of his applying elsewhere) stipulated to give him, for each
                     essay, what to him so unused to money was a little fortune.
                  Received with cordiality, with eagerness, into the highest society of the
                     Duke's friends,â€”where his excitable spirits and his facile manners made him as
                     much admired and liked, as his colloquial talent and the ardor and vigor of his
                     language at the Duke's table, when his grace, as we have shown in a metaphor
                     drawn from the manege, with the pride of a successful trainer, purposely led
                     him out to show his paces and slily put him on his mettle,â€”Ernestin to outward
                     appearance was happy; and he had been, notwithstanding one sad memory, sufficiently so but for the state of his
                     nerves, which the excitement of his new life and his unremitting labor were
                     bringing to a fearful state of susceptibility. And they who smiled at his
                     repartee, or applauded his eloquence, little knew that the very vivacity which
                     made him so agreeable was drying up, as it were, the sources of his life, and
                     corroding silently the very powers which it brightened.
                  As evil fortune rarely comes single, so good fortune is usually followed by a
                     long train of kindred. Men trample on the wretched of their fellows, and strip
                     without remorse its last vestment from shivering destitution, but they
                     prostrate themselves in dust and mire to ease the foot of him who is on the
                     highway to prosperity, and heap raiment after raiment on the back that is
                     already sweating with a weight of superfluous apparel. Under the Duke's
                     auspices, Ernestin's tragedy was instantly accepted when offered. And, without
                     his auspices, it must have succeeded: for the same spirit of truth which guided
                     Ernestin in all things else made him shrink, as at sin, from any violation of
                     probability in the plot, shaped his characters with consistency and exactness,
                     and rendered impossible a want of nature in the dialogue; while the energy,
                     impetuosity, and fire of his disposition, which in every thing he undertook was
                     ever driving him to the end by the straightest and shortest road and without
                     abatement of speed, saved him from irrelevance of incident and superfluousness
                     of persons, shut out all narrative that was not unavoidable, and made his
                     action and his style rapid, vehement, and nervous.
                  The piece was received with an actual storm of plaudits,â€”to the delight of his
                     grace; who, as he whispered to the pale authorâ€”when, after being obliged to
                     present himself to the gaze of the audience, he resumed his seat beside
                     himâ€”"Did I not say so?" took to himself the credit of his success; as in part
                     he well might; for without the noble's influence the dramatist had waited long,
                     and probably been rejected at last without a hearing.
                  Nothing difficult was it now to have his other pieces made public. And when
                     tragedy followed tragedy, with like success, and comedy after comedy met with
                     still more general favorâ€”partly because of the audience, who are more capable
                     of appreciating that form of drama, partly of the actors, who are better able
                     to perform it,â€”the whole town was in amaze; and but for the author's voluntary
                     sad and half-reproachful avowal that they were the gathered harvests of many
                     seasons, and had every one been over and over again rejected by various
                     theatrical managements, his rapidity of pen would have been thought as
                     wonderful as its variety. Then came the publishers and besieged him for new
                     editions of his neglected works. And Ernestin smiled a bitter and proud smile,
                     when he found what none could be induced to read before was now emulously
                     bought up as fast as copies could be furnished, and not only every quality he
                     had ever thought himself possessed of was awarded to him in overflowing
                     measure, but many that he never had aspired to, and which he knew were totally
                     incompatible with the rest. Next followed, in rapid succession, his yet
                     unpublished works in prose and verse. And, had he been so weak as to propose
                     them, they would have leaped at his juvenile pieces.
                  Under these circumstances, money poured in upon the once poor author so fast
                     and in such floods, that were he even avaricious he must have been satisfiedâ€”if
                     avarice ever knows that feeling, and, as he was luxurious, scarcely a taste
                     remained ungratified.
                  
                  It needed now but one more triumph; and when Ernestin, in pure gratitude,
                     though not without presension of its effect, executed in marble a statue of the
                     Duke, and on canvas simultaneously a half-length portrait of his youngest
                     daughter, the Lady Georgiana â€”â€”, which he painted with peculiar zest, because
                     of the lady's thick yet light, long and loose ringlets of pale brown, his
                     reputation knew no bounds. Courted, idolized almost,â€”run down by visitors and
                     overwhelmed with cards of invitation,â€”his picture and his bust, copied from
                     those he had himself painted and carved at the Duke's solicitation for his
                     gallery at â€”â€”, staring him out of countenance in every shop-window,â€”Ernestin,
                     in his matinal and nocturnal prayer, thanked his Maker that he had not attained
                     to this success till it had no power to turn his brain. And when he turned to
                     the glass, and saw his sunken temples, and his forehead almost bare of hair, he
                     thought of Agnes, and of his wifeless and childless, his loveless and still
                     desolate state, desolate in the midst of crowds of hollow flatterers and
                     ephemeral friends; and, wringing his hands, this now envied man, whose
                     greatness was the birth of an hour and the conception of many years, who, when
                     he had health and youth, could find none to regard him, wept silently scalding
                     tears of the heart's anguish, and, as they slowly trickled down the thin cheeks
                     which they seemed to him to wither up and waste, exclaimed, "Vanity of
                     vanities! I have seen now all I longed to see, and have attained to all I have
                     aspired to attain to. If my sphere of usefulness be circumscribed to what I
                     have now done for empty glory, take me to my sisters, O my Creator! for I,
                     still, am all alone!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  THE TEMPTATION.
                  ERNESTIN'S mournful prayer was not without presagement of an early death. This
                     eminence to which he had attained so suddenly, though reaching towards it so
                     long,â€”as if he had been straining every nerve to gain the shore of an ocean,
                     without ever coming nearer, when unexpectedly some billow larger than the rest
                     had thrown him thither, exhausted and shivering, perhaps so to die,â€”this
                     success was in reality destroying him. Excitable even in his strongest day, his
                     nerves could hardly stand the constant shocks, though joyful ones, whereto they
                     were now exposed; and every new triumph was loosening more and more the
                     delicate though well-laid foundation of his life.
                  Strange, that out of all the crowd of admirers which pressed upon him, only one
                     man should suspect that they were shutting out the air, and smothering him with
                     their incense! That man was the Duke himself; who at last insisted, with real
                     anxiety, that Ernestin should retire for a season to one of his seats. Ernestin
                     gratefully yielded.
                  A day or two were needful for preparation.
                  He had returned from taking leave of his mother,â€”who dazzled by his prospects
                     was quite blind to his actual condition, though, with his usual
                     communicativeness, he spoke of it without disguise. But his eyes looked so
                     bright, and his manner was so
                     animated! How should she doubt of danger that lay hidden in his brain? And it
                     was her happiness that she did not.
                  He was seated in the inmost room of his now spacious study. It was a warm day
                     in August; and, in that passion for fresh air whose indulgence had become a
                     necessity of his life even in midwinter, the doors throughout as well as
                     windows were all open, even to those of the antechamber where his valet usually
                     attended. Ernestin's head was leaning pensively on his left hand, the elbow
                     which supported it resting on an arm of the ample leathern armchair where he
                     sat reclined, his legs stretched out and crossed at the ankles. His thoughts
                     were painting him the past; and from Agnes, De Coucy, and the woods of
                     Holmhurst, they bore him to the coach where sat Joanna by his side, disguised
                     in dress and in the dim twilight, but revealed to the minutest fibre of her
                     heart by the tearful agony of her despairing passion. He was at that moment of
                     the scene when he tells her he had admired her as an artist. Joanna, struck to
                     the soul, gives vent to her anguish in sobs, whose remembered accents of
                     immeasurable wo ring in his ears with such distinctness, that, filled anew with
                     more than sorrow, he drops his arm, and turns in his seatâ€”to see the very
                     object of his thoughts, standingâ€”as if arrested while retiringâ€”in the doorway.
                     She had glided through the rooms unheard on the thick carpets, but, the moment
                     she saw him, frightened at her own boldness, had paused, stepping backwards,
                     when Ernestin faced her, and took from her instantly all power either of
                     advance or retreat.
                  "Joanna?" Se said, directly going to her, and taking her trembling hand: "I was
                     just thinking of you!"
                  Joanna's pale face, which had at first become very red, then paler than before,
                     was now suffused again, as she answered tremulously, without looking up, "Then
                     you are not angry, that I have come?"
                  "Angry? Could that be, Joanna?â€”No," he added, recollecting himself; "but I may
                     be very sorry."
                  "O do not say so! And forgive me! forâ€”indeed I could not help it."
                  "Are you then in trouble? Can I be of use to you? You are in mourning,"â€”looking
                     at her dress.
                  "I have lost my little girl," said Joanna, still afraid to lift her eyes.
                  "Poor little thing! But if I remember, she was but delicate. The loss is not
                     for her, but you. You must be very lonely."
                  "O yes, sir! I have none now to loveâ€”that can love me." Her voice faltered, and
                     a tear found its silent way under the lashes of her large eyelids.
                  Ernestin is touched. How could he be else, who reads so well her meaning? But
                     awake to his danger, he does not ask her to sit down. Yet he cannot hint to her
                     to leave.
                  "How did you find me out?" he asked, looking uneasily through the doors of the
                     whole apartment, where he saw no one waiting. Joanna mistook the question, and
                     answered that the porter had directed her to go up stairs, where she would find
                     at the first door Mr. Fitzherbert's servant, who would show her in; but,
                     finding no one and the doors all open, she had walked timidly forward, till he
                     saw her.
                  "O no," said Ernestin, "I did not mean that.â€”But excuse me one moment."
                     Anticipating some such violence or distress of scene as he had passed through
                        already with Joanna, Ernestin
                     shut carefully all the doors, including that of the waiting-room. Observing on
                     his return that Joanna, who had watched his movements, blushed and betrayed
                     agitation, he remarked, "It is better thus,â€”though it is not well. Besides,
                     Joanna," he added, with a faint smile, "you know I am an artist. You will be
                     thought to sit to meâ€”to be my model."
                  Joanna started, and raising to his face her eyes, which flashed as if some
                     welcome idea had suddenly occurred to her, put out her arm with an eager
                     gesture and opened her lips to speak, but, suddenly turning pale, said
                     nothing.
                  Ernestin took the extended hand, and led her to a seat, into which, with
                     unaffected timidity and deference, she suffered herself to be placed, rather
                     than sat down, and then, sitting by her, said to her, "You mistook me, Joanna.
                     I meant to ask you, how you found out my present home; for you live yet in
                     Chelsea, I suppose?"
                  "Yes," replied Joanna diffidently. "But it was not hard to find you out,
                     whomâ€”every body now talks of." Ernestin is silent. His visitor proceeds. "I
                     cannot go anywhere but I hear ofâ€”hear of you, or read your name. All the
                     papers, and all the shops, every thing is full of you. It makes me so happy
                     toâ€”to"â€”
                  "To what?" asked Ernestin, smiling, but the next moment sorry that he pressed
                     the question; for he read her meaning in the blush, which spread over cheeks
                     and brow, and made her fearfully beautiful in his eyes who was the cause of her
                     emotion.
                  "Toâ€”to be the wretch I am," said Joanna, with downcast eyes, and in a voice
                     that trembled. "Oh!" she added hurriedly, as if she feared to let him think, or
                     felt ashamed of her boldness, "my heart is so full, that I must have come here
                     now, or it would have burst!" She pressed her folded hands upon her left
                     breast, and, turning her eyes imploringly on Ernestin, seemed to await her
                     sentence.
                  Ernestin knew too well the heart of woman, not to know what fervor is added to
                     love by the exaltation of its object.28 If, before, Joanna loved
                     him, whom no one seemed to know but her, what must be her passion for him now
                     whom every body contended to admire. Yes, he believed her; it
                     made her happy to love a man whom the world assured her, however idly, was so
                     worthy to be loved.
                  "Poor Joanna!" he exclaimed, "how have I wronged you! So glorious a creature,
                     as you must have been in other circumstances"â€”
                  "O no, no! don't say so. You have not wronged me; I was only very foolish. If
                     there is any thing in me that is really good, as you are pleased to say, it is
                     all of you it comes." Ernestin looks at her with surprise, but with deep
                     interest, perhaps not unmixed with admiration; and Joanna, excited by her own
                     readiness, and encouraged by his attention, does not pause. "I feel I am so
                     different to what I was; I seem to see every thing with clearer eyes, and to
                     feel with a better heart. O sirâ€” But you will laugh at me."
                  "Go on, Joanna," said Ernestin softly. His eyes said, Laugh at
                     you, Joanna? And Joanna's heart beating high, she continued.
                  "I was longing to hear that fine play of yours, the tragedy, which the papers
                     talked so much about, when, one day, Bradley said the saddler had proposed that
                     we should make a party and go together, with Mary, to see it at the playhouse.
                     It was very wicked in me, who was so deceiving poor Bradley, to let him take
                     me; but I could not resist my
                     longing." (You had not loved me, or were more than woman, if you had,â€”thought
                     Ernestin.) "O sir, when I heard that poor young creature, who is so innocent in
                     the play yet so unhappy, speak such noble things, and suffer so much injustice,
                     never losing her faith in God and blessing Him for all His trials, it seemed to
                     me,â€”though I am not innocent like her, alas," (Ernestin, who is struck by
                     Joanna's untaught criticism, which appeared to him the truest he had heard, and
                     who is filled with admiration to hear this simple woman in her enthusiastic
                     passion speak so well, will not console her, lest he break the thread of her
                     reflections,) "and though I dare not think on God save to pray he may not
                     punish me as I deserve,â€”it seemed to meâ€”do not be displeased, sir!â€”that it was
                     I myself that was there upon the stage; and I became so excited, that the
                     people around us began to notice it, and Mary threatened she would go unless I
                     behaved better. I tried very hard to do so, and to keep down my heart, which
                     kept rising in my throat every minute, while my eyes seemed all on fire, or
                     were so blind with my tears that the lights looked one great flame; but, when
                     it came to the last, where the unhappy girl dies so miserably to save him who
                     did not love her"â€”
                  "No, who did not dare to love her," murmured Ernestin.
                  "Perhaps it is so," sighed Joanna, who lost not a word. "O, sir, when I saw her
                     fall so miserably yet so happy, I could contain myself no longer, butâ€”it was
                     very childish! butâ€”repeating her dying words aloud, I"â€”
                  "What! it was you, you, Joanna, who the papers told me fainted in the upper
                     boxes from pure emotion?"
                  "Forgive me!"
                  "Forgive you? O my Joanna!" (Ernestin! Ernestin nestin! And he takes her hand
                     too, and for the moment seems to be about to put it to his lips, but only
                     presses it): "it is my greatest victory, though too dearly purchased."
                  "No, do not think so! for I am too happy to know you are so great and good, so
                     like a god."â€”
                  "Hush, Joanna! You have not come to turn my head, I hope?"
                  "Alas, no! What could poor Joanna's praises be to him whom every body flatters,
                     and dukes and princes love to talk with? I would never have come; I could still
                     have borne to think of you in silence,â€”to read about you,â€”to stop in the
                     streets to gaze at your picture and your images, and long to have one, though I
                     did not dare lest I should betray you," (Ernestin's heart is filling fast: does
                     Joanna see it in his eyes?)â€”"and to hope sometimes that Mary, who loves to
                     read, would one day bring home one of your books; still you were not away,
                     though you was not near me and had forbid me to see you again: but when I read
                     this morning that you were going to spend so long a time at the great duke's
                     house, I struggled to resist, but could not; and if I had not come I feel I
                     must have died. O pray, forgive me! I did try to obey you; and I will, I will
                     indeed; but say you are not angry!"
                  "O God!" The poet, contrasting in an instant the indifference and irreverence
                     of Agnes with this deep affection and respect, this loving considerateness
                     which no temptation of vanity or of suffering could turn aside to his betrayal,
                     smote passionately his hands together and lifted his eyes one moment toward
                     heaven with a look of singular anguish, then, sinking his head, unfolded his
                     clasped hands and spread them before his face. A moment afterward, he was
                     conscious that Joanna knelt beside him; and he felt her thin but soft fingers
                        touch timidly his own, as she
                     said in a voice of touching tremulousness,
                  "O sir, do not grieve! I had no thought to worry you."
                  "Nor have you," he said, endeavoring to raise her; "I but bewailed my
                     destiny.â€”You cannot understand me, Joanna; nor is it right I should explain
                     myself. Only, this believe, dear Joanna," (with a look and gesture full of
                     gratitude and love, she pressed to her lips the fingers which she still
                     retained in hers, kneeling as she was still beside him)â€”"if you have suffered,
                     I have not been at ease. Now rise. But do not sit again. We must, we
                        must part. Restrain your tears, for pity's sake, and think,
                     Joanna, where you are. Now, quickly, is there any thing I can do for
                     you?â€”Joanna," he stammered,â€”"do not be offended by what I propose;â€”I am now
                     rich, far beyond my needs, and you, you are not well provided for in all your
                     little wants"â€”
                  "Yes, yesâ€”I thank youâ€”I want for nothing."
                  "But there are tastes to gratify, and the charities of your heart to indulge,
                     and"â€”
                  "No, no, sir; there is nothing, nothing that I needâ€”I mean, that I could take
                     from you."
                  "From me, Joanna? Is there any one on earth then, save your husband"â€”
                  "My husband!"â€”Joanna burst into tears and hid her face.
                  "What is the matter?" said Ernestin, drawing near to her, but not daring to
                     touch her waist. "Why should that name distress you?"
                  "Weâ€”we do not live together." Ernestin staggered back, as if struck to the
                     heart. This was another fruit of his folly, of his crime!
                  "My fault! my accursed fault!" he cried, with passionate self-reproach.
                  "No, no," said Joanna, drying her eyes, and stretching out her hands to him, as
                     if to adjure him not to do himself that wrong, "it is no fault of yours.
                     Bradley never loved any body but himself; and when our little girl was dead,
                     his selfish ways grew so ugly to me, that it was making me daily wicked to live
                     with him; and I told him so; and he laughed, and said I was crazy,
                     andâ€”and"â€”
                  "Do not fear," said Ernestin, uneasily; "go on."
                  "After what happened at the theatre, he told so many people I was light-headed,
                     that my friends have begun to believe it; and I was so angry, that I said I
                     would live with Mary, and not trouble him any longer. He then said, without any
                     anger (he never gets out of temper,) that perhaps it would be best. And I did
                     go."
                  Ernestin walked up and down the room. "Joanna," he said, returning,â€”"I am, deny
                     it as you will, the true cause of this separation. I cannot bid you go back to
                     your husband"â€”
                  "No, no, not that! any thing but that!"
                  Ernestin felt in his heart her reasons; and it were difficult to say, if his
                     admiration and sympathy did not equal his sorrow and self-reproach.
                  "But now you must let me be to you as a brother,"â€”he took her hand, which
                     trembled,â€”"as your true friend and protector, Joanna,â€”because I have deprived
                     you of him who was both by right. You cannot live upon your sister."
                  "Mercy! do not so misjudge me, sir. I am quite as able and as willing as she to
                     maintain myself."
                  "But may not always have the strength or facility."
                  
                  He went to a kind of bureau, and, from a drawer in the open writing-desk which
                     formed a part of it, took out a large purse filled apparently with gold. But
                     Joanna followed him, and put her hand resolutely on his arm.
                  "No, no! Do not think so basely of me!"
                  "And me? have you so little regard for me? Did you love me, Joanna, you would
                     take, what I meant not for your"â€” Joanna fairly cried; and Ernestin, flinging
                     back the purse, laid his hands on her arms, as she covered her face, and
                     attempted to soothe her. "Let us say no more about it, dear Joanna. But you are
                     unduly proud."
                  "O no, I am not indeedâ€”not at least for you."
                  "But is there nothing I may do for you, nothing for your sister? She would be
                     content to know your means were got at honorably; you would not need to name
                     the source."
                  "It is not that; I could convince her; she believes me now in all things. Oh,
                     oh!" exclaimed Joanna, struck suddenly with some conviction: "if she knew I had
                     sought this meeting, of my own selfâ€”when I made her think I never would be so
                     guilty!"â€”
                  "Do not cry, Joanna. As yet, she will not miss you. And you have done no wrong,
                     but only favored me. I would that in return I might show you too some kindness,
                     bestow some favor that you might remember me by."
                  This Ernestin said half seriously, half smilingly, in the endeavor to cheer
                     her. And Joanna, with a sudden flush over all her face, and with eyes which
                     first threw out a singular light, then were cast down bashfully, said with
                     hesitation, "Is that needed? Yet there is perhaps"â€”
                  "Speak. Any thing."
                  "You will grant it?" (still bashfully.)
                  "Any thing that shall do to you no injury, Joanna."
                  "People say"â€”(she speaks with difficulty) "you are as greatâ€”aâ€”painter as a
                     poet; and you told me when you first"-(Her embarrassment increases. Ernestin
                     lays one hand lightly on her shoulder, and with the other takes one of hers, on
                     whose fingers, perfect as all the rest of her wonderful person, he looks down
                     with more than pleasure, while Joanna's eyes follow the movement. A light
                     pressure of her taper fingers bids Joanna continue)â€”"first condescended to look
                     at me, it was because"â€”Joanna pauses.
                  "Silly child!" says Ernestin caressingly. "Because I saw in you a noble modelâ€”a
                     resemblance in fact to those lovely heads which the world calls classicâ€”and to
                     one in particular, which I still think, Joanna, you are wonderfully like; yes,
                     wonderfully!" he repeats with an imprudent enthusiasm, for the position of
                     Joanna's head, as she still watched his fingers, made indeed the likeness
                     singular.
                  "Would you not then?"â€”
                  "What?"
                  "I would sit very quiet." Joanna's fingers tremble in Ernestin's, and her
                     blushes deepen.
                  "O! I understand. But is it so much to ask, that you should be so bashful? You
                     would sit to me, and have me paint you as the Venus of
                     Arles?"
                  Joanna looked up inquiringly; and in the act Ernestin failed not to note the
                     animation of her face, which was actually resplendent with a happiness that he
                     could not then analyze. "By the Venus of Arles," he said,
                     replying to her look, "I mean the head which yours resembles; and which is so
                     called to distinguish it from those of other Venuses,â€”who, perhaps you have
                     heard, Joanna, are representations, idols, of beauty in its most perfect
                     formâ€”its goddesses, in short. But to paint you thus would be to favor me not you; and, to use your own words,
                     have I need of that to remember you by?"
                  "No matter; it will please me, because"â€”Ernestin looked in turn inquiringly;
                     but Joanna, blushing again, merely put her hand to the strings of her black
                     straw bonnet, and added, "Will it do now?"
                  "Perfectly," said Ernestin, helping her to remove the hat. But between them
                     they managed so awkwardly, that Joanna's comb became entangled in the lining,
                     and, when the hat came off, her superb hair, in all its amazing length, fell
                     down to her knees, filling the artist with a rapturous surprise which actually
                     deprived him of utterance. And when Joanna, gathering up its heavy masses,
                     looked through their shadowing tresses with eyes that seemed to dart a subtle
                     yet soft fire from under their lids, while the roses of her blushing cheeks
                     bloomed through that matchless foliage with a vivid beauty which Ernestin
                     almost fancied fragrant,â€”when Joanna saw his stupefaction, and saw him, as she
                     looked, put his hands before his face, fairly frightened by his own sensations,
                     and staggering lean upon the leaf of his writing-desk for support,â€”trembling
                     herself, yet transported with her triumph, her hands refused their office, and
                     she sunk upon a chair; and her unrivaled locks rained in a glistering shower
                     over all her person, and lay in billowy masses on the cushion on either side of
                     her.
                  It was a scene to awaken fear and pity in the virtuous and friendly, but in the
                     hostile and malignant exultation and disdain. Unseen who had entered with
                     Joanna, the Devil looked upward through the walls, through the atmosphere,
                     between the farther stars, and met the eyes of Ernestin's good angel gazing
                     mournfully down; and the Devil's eyes blazed and his lips parted, as, glancing
                     quickly towards Ernestin, he looked again askance at the far-up angel. It was
                     such a smile of triumph as bad and cunning men display, when they fancy they
                     have gained an advantage over a good man whom because of his superiority they
                     hate, or whose weak point they think they have discovered in the midst of
                     virtues that humiliate them and gnaw their vitals with envy. But, like the bad
                     man with the good, the fallen Spirit, in the exultation of that moment, made
                     bare his side to his celestial adversary, and by betraying his malignancy
                     defeated its purpose.
                  Rousing himself, and with an inward prayer, Fitzherbert turned to his dangerous
                     visitor, and sees her gathering up the treasures of her hair, into a knot
                     behind her head, with both hands; but her eyes are fixed on him, not on the
                     large mirror which hung directly before the chair in which she sat.
                  "Shall I now arrange my hair?" she said, rather tremulously, as she fastened
                     the knot with her comb,â€”"Or no; you will want to arrange it in some fancy way
                     yourself."
                  "No, you can do it, Joanna. I will direct you."
                  "No, no, I should spoil all. Dress it as you will. See!" With a single action,
                     lifting up the comb, she let down all her hair once more, which fell as before
                     all over her shoulders and partly hid her face, She sat perfectly still:
                     Ernestin irresolutely put his hand to the hair. A single tress filled all his
                     folded palm. How softâ€”and silky; yet how heavy! What was it sent the blood in
                     torrents to his heart, which filled and swelled? Ernestin trembled. And now the
                     blood deserts his heart and suffuses all his face. With a stifled sigh, he
                     dropped his hand.
                  "Joanna, I cannot."
                  
                  "Not paint me?" said Joanna, looking up. He was behind her; her head turned
                     back to look, the full power of her large hazel eyes, which were rolled upward,
                     was directed on his own. "Not paint me!" And with such a gaze, with such an
                     expression, such a tone! She was seducing him; not indeed meretriciously, but
                     with the involuntary evidence of her own overmastering passion. He saw it, he
                     felt it; in every nerve of his body he felt, that he was not proof against the
                     tempter. And Agnes rose to his vision, and murmuring, but not audibly, her
                     name, he left the chair.
                  "It is better, Joanna, that I should not."
                  "And why?"
                  "Becauseâ€” Plainly, because I dare not. Tie up your hair again, and leave
                     me."
                  She burst into tears; she began to sob: but she spoke not. And Ernestin,
                     touched, forgets his resolution. He returns to her, puts back her hair, which
                     had now fallen over her eyes, and with his own handkerchief dries her tears, as
                     if she were a child, and speaks soothingly to her. He even dares to touch her
                     hand; but, when her fingers close upon it, he withdraws it.
                  "Joanna, hear me. If you mean to tempt me, I know not. But this I know; you do
                     so; and I dread it." Imprudent Ernestin! ever too candid. Joanna receives the
                     confession in her heart, and is not disposed to give up the contest because she
                     learns that it is easy. "Joanna, you cannot have forgotten what I have said to
                     you. I will not be so wicked as to plunge you deeper into folly and wrong
                     doing, and add to my own sin its completion. I need not put you to the pain to
                     sit; I can paint you only too well from memory."
                  "I knew it! I knew it!" Uttering this in a tone of despair, and wringing her
                     hands, the beautiful creature began to weep again.
                  "Knew what? For Heaven's sake, moderate this transport. What is it you
                     knew?"
                  "That you had turned to despise me, that you had found me to be too ugly"â€”
                  "Joanna!"
                  "And that was why you would no more look at me in Chelsea"â€”
                  "Joanna! Joanna!
                  "And why you cannot bear to touch my hair"â€”
                  "Dear Joanna!"
                  "And why you do not want my picture. I knew it! Oh, I knew it too well! I wish
                     it was all withered or gray! It shall not tease you any more." She springs up
                     from the seat, darts to a table that is before her under the glass; but there
                     is no scissors there, only a palette-knife. As she takes it, Ernestin relieves
                     her of the incapable instrument, and leads her back to the seat.
                  "Compose yourself, Joanna. And if you will be quiet, I will try. Your picture"â€”
                     And the artist wakes in the soul of Ernestin, his eyes kindle. "'T will be a
                     gem of art!"
                  Still as a lamb sits Joanna, yet watching with a beating heart his movements.
                     And first he takes a slip of paper which is lying on the writing-desk, and a
                     lead-pencil, and puts the paper on a book which he rests upon his knee, sitting
                     down before her. "I will show you first," he says, his pencil already on the
                     paper, and his eyes governing the movement of his hand, "how the hair is
                     dressed on the classic head I named to you. Perhaps you may not like it."
                  "Yet it will be your choice. How could I not like it?" This was said with so much tenderness, in
                     the most musical of voices, that Ernestin's pencil made an undulation in the
                     outline. Fortunately, he was busy with the hair.
                  As he lifted his eyes from the completed sketch, he saw Joanna leaning on her
                     elbow, as she used to sit in the window at Chelsea, and with her head turned
                     pensively aside, looking intently on his face with an expression in her long
                     dark eyes that almost staggered his better resolution. Trembling, confused, his
                     face burning and his step uncertain, he rose, and, with a sigh that told the
                     unhappy woman her second brief and perhaps unsought-for triumph, laid the paper
                     on her lap, and turning away walked up and down the apartment.
                  "It is very pretty," said Joanna, after a deep and prolonged sigh, followed by
                     a moment or two of silence; "and I think I should like it much. But I never so
                     dressed my hair; and it does not curl like this."
                  "Probably the sculptor's model's did not either; but, it being more easy to
                     give life to hair when waved and thick, the artist altered the character of it
                     to suit his occasion. Flat hair never looks well in marble. Yours, Joanna, done
                     in paint will present no difficulty, and will suit your face still better than
                     hair thus crisp and waved. Andâ€”and"â€” Ernestin stopped in perplexity.
                  Perhaps it was the prompting of her heart that gave Joanna intuition; for,
                     divining his unuttered meaning, she eagerly rejoined,
                  "And what? Speak!"
                  "It is no matter. I have said enough for my purpose."
                  "And you would not like it so well if the picture was not exactly like me? Is
                     that what you meant to say?"
                  He could not deny it. Perhaps he had not the heart to disappoint her.
                  "It is."
                  Joanna caught his hand, and, ere he could prevent it, pressed it passionately
                     and gratefully to her lips. There was a tear in Ernestin's eye, which he turned
                     away to hide. Did Joanna divine that too? She sprang up from the seat,
                     emboldened by her previous action, and throwing her arms about his body looked
                     aside and up into his face, so beseechingly, so tenderly, so lovingly, yet so
                     modestly withal! He had been a devil, or something higher and better, could he
                     have reproached her. Ernestin was human, and had no malice nor cruelty in his
                     nature.
                  "Joanna," he said with a voice that spoke an emotion it was not in his
                     character to hide,â€”"this will not do. By that Awful Being that made us both,
                     and Who visits with never-failing punishment all departure from the way He has
                     enjoined us, I adjure you leave me."
                  He loosed her arms. She did not struggle, but, sobbing as if her heart would
                     break, cried to him piteously, as her head, with its loosened hair that swept
                     his feet, rested on his breast with the face bent to the earth, "Only say you
                     do not hate me! only that!"
                  "I will do more, Joanna. There." He lifted her head, and pressed his lips to
                     her forehead. Then, ere she could reveal what passed in her sorrowful heart at
                     this act of affection, it may be of love not wholly extinct, ere perhaps she
                     could recover from her delightful surprise, he led her back to the chair.
                  "See!" he said, "you will make a sorry picture with those swollen eyes. Compose
                     yourself." He took her hair, and dried her eyes. But the tears gushed out
                     afresh. "Joanna, dear Joanna!"
                  
                  "No, no, no!" (It was this time Joanna's deprecation.) "Do not speak to me so
                     sweetly, or call me dear; I shall only be naughty again. Wait but
                     a minute; I shall soon have stopped crying. But it does me so much good!"
                  A woman of cultivated mind might have said, It is such joy to
                     weep! or It is so sweet to weep! but she would not have expressed
                     herself more happily to Ernestin's taste than did this poor creature, whose
                     every gentle word, in her pleasant yet grand voice, went like a keen reproach
                     directly to his heart who had done her so much mischief.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  THE VICTORY.
                  "I AM ready now," said Joanna, after a few moments' interval, which Ernestin
                     spent in walking up and down in great perturbation. "But I never so dressed my
                     hair. I should be very awkward. You must do it for me."
                  "No, no; try."
                  "It would tease you to death, I should be so long. You are used to these
                     things. I know you can."
                  Ernestin's spirit of truth would not permit him to deny it; and his habit of
                     perfect candor never suggested to him evasion. Joanna placed her head in the
                     posture indicated, but immediately lifted it to ask him, if it was right; and
                     when he answered, "Yes,â€”but you have lost it now," she was so out of the way,
                     that he was obliged reluctantly to lay his hand upon her head and dispose it
                     himself. How quietly she obeyed his touch! And now his fingers go through the
                     silky hair, and his lips murmur prayers against temptation; for he sees by the
                     motion of Joanna's dress that her heart is beating high. "How very beautiful!"
                     exclaimed the artist involuntarily, as he drew the long tresses through his
                     hands, and gathered them up into a mass behind. Joanna burst into tears.
                     Ernestin in silence and deep pain clasped his hands together; and the whole
                     arrangement was destroyed.
                  "You must excuse me," said the poor creature, composing posing herself again: "I could not help it; for
                     I thoughtâ€”I thought"â€”
                  "No matter, dearâ€”No matter, Joanna; try again. There: a little that way; a
                     little more; so." Ernestin once more put his hand to the hair. "If you move
                     again," (it went against Fitzherbert's kind heart to speak so decidedly,) "I
                     shall have to abandon the design altogether."
                  Joanna sat stiller than a child that is promised some dear delight, so it be
                     quiet: save the throbbing of her breast, there was nothing about her, if you
                     count not heat and color, that seemed to be alive. And Ernestin, no more in
                     danger, for the artist is now busy, arranges the pliant hair so as to mark the
                     oval of her face, and gathering it up in bunches over the ears, looks about him
                     for a ribbon. Joanna ascertains the want, and removing, spite of his
                     remonstrances, a cape that is upon her shoulders, draws out the string that is
                     inserted in the collar; and he proceeds to fasten a twofold tie upon the hair.
                     As he does so, he looks repeatedly in the glass before him, as he has through
                     all the work, and Joanna, looking too, fastens her eyes upon his reflected
                     face. Hitherto, he has observed her little, or would not. But now, the dazzling
                     effect of her bare shoulders in their black dress, which is lower in the neck
                     than usual, strikes the artist even more than their form, and impulsively he
                     again gives utterance to his admiration; and, as he does so, their eyes
                     encounter in the mirror. He draws his breath, as if to struggle against his
                     senses, and from that time looks no more till he has secured the knot; and the
                     task is completed.
                  "How do you like it?" asks Ernestin, and really with an air of triumph. Joanna
                     looks in the glass, and at herself; for now Ernestin is before her and beside
                     her, and she can only see him looking at her, but cannot meet his eyes
                     reflected.
                  "It is well enough," says the beautiful sitter; and she smiles. Ernestin is for
                     one single instant forgotten. But the next, she adds: "There is something
                     wanting, isn't there? Does the image, you say I am like, wear such a dress? It
                     looks so odd!"
                  "True. But all I want is your head; I can paint the bust without you."
                  "But that would not be me," says Joanna archly, and yet not without
                     bashfulness, nor without confusion; for, in the consciousness of her heart, the
                     blood is mounting to her cheeks. "How low shall I put it?" And she actually
                     unhooks the collar of her dress.
                  "Stop, stop! Really, I do not want it! Joanna! What are you about? I tell you,
                     it is unnecessary to expose yourself in this manner." He throws the cape upon
                     her shoulders.
                  "But I will not have any body's bust but my own painted, with my neck and face.
                     I see, you think it is not well made."
                  "It is, it is! Oh, only too well made!"
                  "Is it? Then you shall paint it all. Yes, yes," as he struggles to restrain
                     her, "all or none. There; fold down the dress to suit you."
                  She has seized the artist's fingers. But Ernestin bursts from her. Flinging up
                     his hands, and passionately clasping them, "My God! my God! do not desert me!"
                     he exclaims in a tone of suffering and despair, and, rushing from the room,
                     finds his way into an adjoining closet, and falling on his knees prays for aid
                     in this new trial.
                  "O my Creator!" (such are his words) "let me not fall back into the abyss of
                     error! Let the wings of thy mercy
                     bear me steadily upward and over"â€” He stops; for a dull and heavy sound, as of
                     a falling body, is heard from the study, and human terror overcomes
                     devotion.
                  It was a horrid sight that met the eyes of the man, the lover almost, as he
                     bounded into the room. In her fit of disappointment and shame, Joanna had
                     seized the palette-knifeâ€”which was an old one and worn sharp by use, and cut
                     her throat.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  GREATER DANGER.
                  EVEN in the wo and terror of that moment, Ernestin forgot not the danger of
                     surprise, but turned the key softly in the door, ere he knelt by Joanna and
                     raised her senseless body. With that coolness and clearness of mind which is
                     often displayed in scenes of danger by men of his ardent nature, where of noble
                     soul, though death was at his heart and his cheeks and lips were pale as those
                     before him, he first examined the wound, wiping away the blood with his
                     handkerchief. Though frightful to look at, and bleeding constantly, it was not
                     deep, and nowise dangerous. For the same thinness of blade which had given the
                     weapon an edge, had added to its original elasticity and deprived it of
                     force.
                  Happy to find that the horror of the needle might be avoided, although resolute
                     to use it had it been necessary, Ernestin, whose surgical studies had prepared
                     him to act efficiently in this extremity, drew the thick cushion from the chair
                     at whose feet Joanna lay, and putting it under her head, rose quickly, and
                     taking from one of his drawers a package of simple courtplaster, and from his
                     color-box some of the strips of linen which were kept ready for his pencils,
                     knelt again beside the hapless woman, and staunching anew the blood, drew
                     carefully together the lips of the wound and secured them with several sheets
                     of the gummed silk; then folding the
                     linen into a compress, he unloosed the ribbon from her hair and therewith
                     fastened down the compress over the plaster, then sewed together the ribbon,
                     which fortunately went twice about her neck.
                  Hardly was this done, and it was done rapidly, when Joanna came to, of herself.
                     And now the calmness of the man forsook him; and as he took her in his arms,
                     and assisted her efforts to recover, his tears rained down in a perfect shower
                     on her cheeks.
                  Then Joanna, opening languidly her melancholy eyes, finds herself in the arms
                     of him whom she loved better than life, sees him weeping, sees in his face,
                     which bends over her, a look of more than pity, feels the bandage which
                     constricts her throat, and the smart of the recent wound, and says in a tone of
                     exquisite tenderness, while her curved lips and her immortal eyes smile
                     pensively a smile of so sweet mournfulness, so full of the best of that
                     lovingness which in our natures is undying and divine, that Ernestin's spirit
                     for the moment seems to leave him to unite with hers,
                  "Why did you not let me die? Thus folded in your armsâ€”it is to be so
                     happy!"
                  Ernestin's tears rain down afresh; he presses her gently, but unreluctantly to
                     his breast, he is lost to all thought but the tenderness of the moment; for he
                     feels, for that moment, that he loves Joanna dearly. Could he otherwise?
                     "Hush!" he says softly, as his arms close tight around her; "your wound will
                     bleed afresh."
                  Joanna felt the hot tears dropping, felt through her uncovered shoulder, which
                     her hair, now loosed from the fillet, shaded modestly in front, his heart beat
                     full and high, felt his bearded cheek touch her own cheek, felt his very breath
                     commingling with hers, and finally his warm lips press her forehead with a kiss
                     that was not a brother's kiss, and the deluded woman sighed, a sigh of such
                     perfect happiness that Ernestin's soul trembled in him.
                  "Let it bleed!" she said murmuringly, looking with intensest love into the eyes
                     which seemed to hover o'er her own, as if to drink from them their
                     passion,â€”"And if I should die of it, I should die like the princess in your
                     play, who dies"â€”
                  "But not to ruin him she loves," said Ernestin, startled into perfect
                     consciousness by the allusion. But even yet perhaps, swayed by his pity and
                     Joanna's devotion, and fascinated by her wondrous beauty, he would have
                     relapsed, but for Joanna's own generosity. Starting up, herself, almost tearing
                     herself from his embrace, she sunk on her knees before him, and folding her
                     arms about his limbs, she said,
                  "O no, no! forgive me! I am such a wretch! I should indeed have ruined you, to
                     die here, and in this way. No! let me cling thus, do not lift me,"â€”she let her
                     head fall against his person, while her long hair fell around her,â€”"I ought to
                     cry so, and to pray to you; for I am the wickedest and most shameless of women,
                     and I was near to ruin you for ever, for whose glory and whose good I would
                     gladly die a thousand deaths every hour."
                  "Riseâ€”dear, dear Joanna! whom Iâ€”No, no! whom I would love, did I
                     dare."
                  "Yes, yes! it is that! I know it! I am ungrateful! you ought not to love meâ€”and
                     you must not. O forgive me! I should not stay here; but let me hold you thus a
                     little longerâ€”I will not cry loud: let meâ€”I will be very quietâ€”my heartâ€”is
                     breakingâ€”andâ€”andâ€”and"â€”
                  
                  "Joanna!" cried Ernestin, seriously frightened,â€”for her sobs, which had seemed
                     to strangle her, they had become so quick and convulsive, threatened to end in
                     hysterics. He lifted her head as he spoke; and, the next moment, she fell
                     senseless in his arms, and the blood gushed from the ribbon on her wound.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  BUT IT IS OVERCOME.
                  IT was well for Ernestin Fitzherbert, that his tender heart and his love for
                     Joanna made him forget, in the distress and danger of her situation, his own
                     danger, which was increasing with every minute of her stay, from without in
                     regard to his reputation, and within to his honor and, far more, his
                     obligations unto God.
                  His first care was now to her wound. Merely putting back her hair, that it
                     might not dabble in the oozing blood, he tied his already soaked handkerchief
                     loosely about her neck, and exerted himself with all appliances that were at
                     hand to bring her back to her senses. And it was a long while ere he succeeded.
                     But in the effort he had time to ponder his situation, and to come to a set
                     purpose of action.
                  "Joanna,"â€”he said, drawing a chair near to the arm-chair in which she lay, and
                     taking quietly her hand. Her fingers immediately closed upon it. "O no, Joanna,
                     do not, do not any more indulge in this mistaken, this, for both of us,
                     criminal tenderness!" He withdrew his hand gently, and seeing Joanna was about
                     to weep, continued hastily: "Hush, for my sake. Call up all your strength of
                     mindâ€”I know you have much, if you would exert it." She looked at him gratefully
                     and mournfully, not with an expression of pleased vanity; and he saw he had but given her her due. "It is so, is
                     it not? You can be brave, if you will?"
                  "For you," said Joanna, "I will dare and do any thing."
                  "For me, then: yes, it is for me. Look! the door is locked. If my servant
                     should knockâ€”and how can I be sure he is not now listening? for the porter must
                     have told him what visitor I haveâ€”I should not dare to open the door. This
                     bloodâ€”your tearsâ€”my own distressâ€”O, Joanna! summon up all your courage, the
                     courage of your heart, which I see is noble as a queen's, and"â€”
                  "Leave you? I will," she added mournfully; "I will instantly." She rose; but
                     staggered, and sat down again. "I fear I am very weak. But let me remove these
                     stains." She looked down at her neck, and seeing its exposure,â€”though Ernestin
                     regarded it not, nor feared it now,â€”blushed, and said unaffectedly, with
                     downcast eyes, as she hooked the collar, "I seeâ€”I remember, I have been very
                     shamelessâ€”but you will pardon my"â€”
                  "Distraction. O Joanna, it is mine that is to be forgiven! But do not speak.
                     You look for your cape? Here it is. But first let me see again to your wound;
                     and then, if you will go into that closet, you will find the means to remove
                     these spots."
                  Ernestin, with great dispatch, yet tenderly, dresses again in the same simple
                     way Joanna's wound, while, gazing on his anxious face unchecked, she appears to
                     find a happiness in the misery of her situation; for it is his hands that touch
                     her, and she is near him, she gazes on him unreproved, she has a moment more to
                     stay.
                  "And now," said Ernestin, "speak as little as possibleâ€”here and at home. I must
                     command it," he added, with a smile that was meant to cheer her, "as your
                     surgeon."
                  "And I will obey you," she said, " asâ€”as ever."
                  Fearing to reply, lest Joanna should rejoin, whose almost every word had a
                     sense so full of soul that he could not listen to it without danger, Ernestin
                     led her in silence to the door of the closet, poured out water for her into a
                     basin, set fresh towels on the stand, and showed her on a toilet-table where
                     she would find pins, as there was no longer a ribbon to attach her cape, and
                     retired, receiving, as he shut the door upon her, a look from Joanna so
                     grateful, so tearful, that he murmured, as he threw himself into a chair in the
                     study, "O that she were Agnes! or that she were other than she is! Fatal
                     destiny! to love who cannot love me, and to be loved to desperation where I
                     must not love!"
                  When Joanna appeared, it was with hair arranged, with the cape about her neck;
                     and, the moment she entered the room, she put on her bonnet. Her face was very
                     pale, her eyes, darkened under by her emotions and her tears, had a soft but
                     serious expression, her very lips seemed to be firmly set together. She looked
                     noble, resolute; and Ernestin, reading her soul which was so worthy of him,
                     again muttered, "Fatal destiny!"
                  She put out her hand, and with so sweet and sad an expression in her face, that
                     Ernestin did not dread to take it, nor to hold it. What was it made her so
                     prompt, who was yet so timid, and to him? Had the suffering she had endured for
                     him leveled their conditions? or was it the sense of his awakened love? or had
                     she found a sudden elevation in her soul, the offspring of her own generous
                     resolve and of her brief communion with him? Perhaps it was all these impulses
                     together moved her; yet I believe the last was most the incentive. Certain it
                     is, no lady thoroughbred could have stepped with more dignity, looked more noble, or offered her hand with
                     greater grace than did Joanna Bradley then; and Fitzherbert, who had lately
                     seen of that class some of the very best in England, Fitzherbert, a slave to
                     the beauty of manner as I have before intimated, was so vividly impressed that
                     he said, with the emphasis of truth, "Joanna, you are a noble creature!"
                  "How kind!" murmured Joanna, lifting gratefully his hand to her lips.â€” There
                     was a moment of silence; their hands are still locked, Joanna's throbbing
                     wildly; Joanna's eyes are down: she speaks again, and her voice is tremulous,
                     faltering. "I am going," she said, "happy to feel that you do not despise me
                     for myâ€”immodesty. Do not stop me!" she added hastily, as Ernestin was about to
                     assure her, "or I shall not have the boldness to say what I want to." Her
                     breath fluttered. She is compelled to pause.
                  "What is it, Joanna?"
                  "How very softly you speak to me! It is much more than I deserve. O if I
                     couldâ€”if I could only"â€”She gathered breath; but her face under her bonnet was
                     burning. "I shall never, never perhaps see you again, though you will always be
                     before my eyes, andâ€”and in my heart. O sir, if I could only think that youâ€”that
                     you areâ€”are sorry to part with me"â€” She hid her face in her hands, and
                     sobbed.
                  "Dear Joanna! dear, beautiful and good Joanna! look into your own heart, and
                     judge by it what beats in mine; and if it makes you happy, be it so, and God
                     forgive me! But ask me not to say more."
                  With a sob of joy, she threw herself upon his shoulder; she wept there long;
                     and Ernestin said not a word, but putting his arm soothingly and tenderly about
                     her waist, pressed her to his breast. Then Joanna, suddenly lifting her head,
                     said,
                  "Now, now, I will take what you offered me. Bring it quickly, lest I should
                     repent and be too proud."
                  Eagerly Ernestin brought the purse, and putting it in her hand, he said with a
                     natural curiosity, which all the circumstances made reasonable,
                  "And what is it for, Joanna?"
                  "To make me worthy of you," she said, looking on him with sublime eyes. "You
                     have called me nobleâ€”and I feel I have a soul that is not base, because it has
                     grown so big within the hour, and because"â€” She blushed. After a brief pauseâ€”"I
                     wish," she continued, once more with an elevated and enthusiastic look, "to be
                     able to understand you, to read all your books, and to know all the languages
                     that you know."
                  "Alas, Joanna!" said Ernestin, with a smile that if not encouraging had nothing
                     in it disparaging,â€”"it would be an ungrateful and a lifelong toil for
                     some."
                  "I ought not to have said, all; I mean, all that a woman who is better born
                     than poor Joanna, has a right to know. O sir, I will work so bravely!"
                  "And your sister?" said Ernestin, looking at her steadily, but with not less
                     admiration, perhaps with more; for she filled him with continually increasing
                     wonder.
                  "Mary must know how I got this money, for I must tell no
                     falsehood,"â€”Ernestin pressed her hand warmlyâ€”"but she will not know where nor
                     from whom. I have swornâ€”it was very wickedâ€”very cruel in meâ€”I have sworn I
                     would never speak to her again till one of us was on her death-bed, if she ever
                     asked me any question, on any account, about you;â€”and she knows that I will
                     keep my word," added Joanna firmly.
                  
                  Ernestin's eyes watered. But praise seemed to be too little for such a woman;
                     and he merely said, again pressing her hand,
                  "And the wound?"
                  "I will tell all I should tell. And it will please her better to know that it
                     is the punishment of myâ€”immodesty" (poor Joanna, despite her spirit, hung her
                     head)â€”"than to see and fear about it."
                  This time, Ernestin kissed Joanna's hands, and exclaiming to himself,
                     "Admirable creature!" turned the key softly in the door, and then rung a small
                     silver hand-bell. "Send to Stifle's for a coachâ€”immediately," he said to the
                     valet who answered the summons. The door closed upon the servant. Ernestin
                     walked quickly to his writing-desk, and took from the secret drawer a rouleau
                     of gold.
                  "Joanna," he said, as she drew back in a kind of alarm, "I know that
                        you will never spend it in frippery, nor spend it
                        dangerously. I put into your hand this money as a trust,â€”in
                     trust for your talents, in trust for charity. A heart like yours can never be
                     silent to the voice of the poor. Give with discernment and with discretion when
                     you can, but give always. And how many gentle wishes are there, dear Joanna,
                     that may well be gratified, and not only innocently, but to the improvement of
                     our hearts, how many wishes that money only can enable us to gratify! Indulge
                     all of them, so far as this will go; and let your sister, who will know the
                     means are come by not only honestly, but to your honor, share in your comforts.
                     You will not refuse, you cannot have the heart to so hurt me,â€”me, Ernestin
                     Fitzherbert, whom you honor with your affection, who am in turn your brother,
                     your father if you will (my head is growing bald, Joanna), who am in short all
                     that I dare be to you, most dear Joanna,â€”me who have a right, by your
                     affection, and by all that I bear you, to provide for your well-being, and who
                     now bless you forever, Joanna, with this kiss."
                  Gently he lifted Joanna's head, and, undoing the strings of her bonnet,
                     imprinted on her blushing forehead a single kiss. But now, it was
                     a brother's kiss. And Joanna, who had perhaps anticipated a warmer caress, and
                     elsewhere than on her brow, sighed from the depths of her heart,â€”not audibly,
                     for her melancholy lips were closed; but the long-drawn inspiration and the
                     heavy expiration, which heaved her chest, testified the pleasurable pang that
                     shook her.
                  "Now remember," he continued, "Joanna, my sister, the purse is for your studies
                     (would I were your teacher! if it but might be!)â€”the roll, for your good heart,
                     your gentle tastes, your charities of all sort."
                  "And this?" said Joanna gravely, lifting the handkerchief that was all crimson
                     with her blood: "may I keep it?"
                  "For what?"
                  "To force me to my dutyâ€”by reminding me of my shame."
                  "It is well expressed. And indeed, my sweet scholar, you do not know how well
                     you talk already! But is it neededâ€”this remembrance? Think but that, before God
                     and by the laws of man, you are still your husband's; that, by permitting you
                     at your own desire to live apart from him, he has not forfeited any of his
                     rights; think of that"â€”Joanna trembled,â€”"and that I can only love you so far as
                     you are honorable, and you will not do amiss; study as you propose, fill up all
                     your time in any way, and you will not have the thoughts to do amiss."
                        Joanna sighed. "But, to tell you
                     all, this handkerchief has my name, and it would peril your secret; and
                     moreover, I want it, as a memorial of my cruelty."
                  "No, no; of your virtue, of your resistance to the devil."
                  "It is truly said, Joanna, and, again, well said. But if I had not invoked the
                     devil, tempted him to me, he could not have been at my shoulder. I
                        have wronged you, generous creature, and most cruelly. I pray,
                     from the bottom of my soul I pray you to forgive me."
                  "Forgive you! I bless you for it. If it was all to do again, I would not have
                     it undone. I bless you now and forever!" And, as enthusiastically she repeated
                     his phrase, with a like enthusiasm imitating his action, she leaned forward,
                     putting up her scalloped lips; and Ernestin, who comprehended her directly,
                     inclined solemnly his foreheadâ€”and Joanna kissed it; and the act, which to
                     stranger eyes perhaps had seemed whimsical if not ridiculous, was in
                     Ernestin's, who understood her, beautiful.
                  "And now," he said, "farewell, Joanna; I have made you talk too much already
                     for your hurt: do not speak much at home; and do not remove the ribbon till
                     your wound is healed."
                  "And then!"â€”said Joanna, with sparkling eyes. "Ah! I shall not need the
                     handkerchief.â€” Farewell, andâ€”andâ€”do not forget me, sir!"
                  This was said in the most touching tone of sorrowful tenderness; and Ernestin,
                     greatly moved, responded, in a like spirit, "Forget you?" then aloud, as the
                     valet at that moment re-entered to announce the coach, "Your picture shall be
                     painted the first thing on my return, and finished without another sitting."'
                     Joanna pressed his hand gratefully.
                  He leads her out, still by the hand, held ceremoniously. "And by the by," he
                     adds, "would you do me the favor to send me by the post the smallest tress of
                     your hair, it would make the coloring all the easier."
                  Joanna would not trust herself to answer; but her hand in his trembled with
                     joy, and she looked up to him under her bonnetâ€”for the servant was now behind
                     themâ€”so gratefully!
                  Ernestin, with a grave respect, led her, happy though sorrowful, all the way
                     down stairs, placed her in the coach with a fervent pressure of the hand, nor
                     left the door till the vehicle had driven off.
                  Joanna's beauty was, I have said, of a strikingly classic order; and one of the
                     noblest characteristics of classic art is the air of birth and thorough
                     breeding which reigns in the heads, and forms indeed, of its ideal
                        statues.29 It is not wonderful therefore, considering too the
                     majesty of her figure and her noble step, that this deference in the artist was
                     mistaken, notwithstanding his sitter's simple mourning and the absence of
                     either carriage or servant to attend her, for the ceremonious courtesy rendered
                     to a lady of rank, where in fact it was an instinctive homage paid to Joanna's
                     merit, and addressed to Joanna's heart.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  THE FLOWER OF TRUE LOVE GIVES OUT ITS CELESTIAL FRAGRANCE.
                  "BLOOD!" muttered Ernestin, as, returned to his study, he looked at the stains
                     upon the breast and sleeves of his dressing-robe: "Will it be the last?" And he
                     shuddered, with a strange sentiment, so vague (for he thought not of Joanna's
                     committing suicide) that it seemed a foreboding.
                  It was easy to throw off the dressing-robe; the bloody handkerchief, and the
                     palette-knife, whose stain he meant never to remove, laid aside in penitential
                     memory of the scene, pained not now his eyes; but the wound! it was deeper in
                     the body of his spirit than in the flesh of Joanna's throat.
                  He had not told Joanna of the perilous condition of his nerves; though could he
                     have had the selfishness to even hint his danger, it would not have occurred to
                     him; for until her departure, until he had changed his robe, and thrown himself
                     upon another chair than that which she had sat in, and which for the moment
                     seemed as it would torture him if he should press it, he felt not the full
                     distress, the peril of his situation. We need not dilate upon it. He was
                     carried to the country more dead than alive. But Joanna lovely and loving,
                     Joanna suffering and self-sacrificing, Joanna desperate and all but dying for
                     his sake, Joanna went with him. For many weeks he could not shut out her image.
                     A passionate regret, that had a tinge of disappointed passion, boiled in his
                     blood, and heated him at times almost to madness.
                  Were Ernestin an angel, I might lament with pity the sinking of his better
                     nature, the sorrow of his virtue, in such moments, over her own sacrifices; but
                     Ernestin was man, and of that kind of men, to whose spirit love is as essential
                     as the breath is to their body, and beauty a necessity to be sought for
                     eternally, with the same continually renewed craving as the food without which
                     they die.
                  Not now alone Joanna's soul, her sorrows and her passion, rise to his
                     remembrance; but Joanna's face, Joanna's person, Joanna's graces, heightened by
                     his imagination, paint themselves in the seducing attitudes and gestures of the
                     late scene, and no longer real meet no substantive resistance. He hears the
                     melting tones of her pathetic voice, he feels the tremulous touch of her soft
                     fingers, his forehead burns under her lingering kiss, and her silky hair sweeps
                     over his flushed cheek: his heart swells to the upheaving of her bosom as she
                     clings to his neck, he feels under his arm her pliant and round waist, which no
                     stays had stiffened into hardness and deformity;30 the flesh of her
                     mobile loins rises over the indenting pressure of his fingers; he clasps her
                     closer to him: and every nerve in the poet-artist's body quivers at the vision.
                     Satan marks the mortal's hours wasting in the inglorious languor of voluptuous
                     day-dreams, and his pillow restless with the tumult of his veins; and the
                     demon's lip curls upward with its sneer of anticipated triumph.
                  But the mind that has made itself a habit of self-denial, the soul that in
                     moral danger consults, in the sanctuary of its own recesses, the oracles of
                     God, is only by spasms delinquent against duty. Ernestin calls up the image of Agnes, though Agnes is lost
                     to him forever and Agnes is married, to battle with the more unlawful image of
                     married Joanna; and though his stay in the country has, under the fever of his
                     spirit, recruited him but little, he regains perfectly his composure, and ere
                     his return to town has so far forgotten his forbidden longings and his criminal
                     regrets, that the tress of Joanna's hair, which, handed to him at the moment he
                     was setting out, he had carried with him, moves him now with little more than
                     pity, and the pathos of the note which enveloped it has, notwithstanding the
                     excellent simplicity which unaffected feeling and the unostentatious impulse of
                     a sincere heart had given its expressions, no power to blind him to the
                     unpracticed and awkward handwriting, which reminds him who Joanna is, and of
                     the bar that destiny had stretched between them.
                  These were the words, whose letters were blotted and separated by the stains of
                     tears, which mottled the entire page.
                  "It is my tears which stain the paper. I have tried again and again to write as
                     I ought to; but they will drop, do all I can. You will not be angry that I send
                     it. I could not rest if I did not tell you how grateful I am for all your
                     goodness, and that I will ever obey you, and love youâ€”if you will let me say
                     so, and will strive to make myself worthy of your kindness, though we are never
                     to meet again. God bless you, sir, ever and ever! But do not, O do not forget
                     me! on my knees I beg you, and with a heart all but breaking."
                  As for Joanna herself, her surgeon had had no need to enjoin upon her silence.
                     For the rest of that eventful day and all the next, she sat like Niobe, turned
                     to stone by excess of grief,31 tearless, speechless save by
                     monosyllables, motionless except by necessity, tasting no food until her
                     sister, in the extremity of distress and terror, threw herself on her knees,
                     and weeping adjured her to eat something for her sake. At the close of that
                     second day, Joanna bethought herself of Ernestin's request, and retiring to her
                     chamber cut off, in its full length, a tress of her magnificent hair, which,
                     simply coiling it up into a ring, she tied with a black ribbon. Then flowed her
                     tears, and in such stream as if they were the store of all her sorrow gathered
                     in those silent hours. So fast and so incessant fell the noiseless shower, that
                     it was with far more difficulty than she pleaded that Joanna, half-blinded,
                     finished with a long effort the rugged scrawl that invoked the artist to be
                     faithful to her memory. With her tears were loosed the floodgates of her
                     speech, and Joanna told her widowed sister why she wore the ribbon on her neck,
                     but told it so as not to endanger her secret by betraying any of Ernestin's
                     occupations; simply avowing, that in a moment of shame and despair, at seeing
                     him she loved resist all her importunities and fly to save them both from
                     criminality, she had seized a knife and attempted to put an end to her
                     existence.
                  Mary, though filled with painful wonder, was indeed relieved, as Joanna had
                     foreseen, to know of her sister's rescue from dishonor, however she had owed
                     her safety, not to her own virtue, but to the continence of her admirer; but
                     when Joanna, taking heart, displayed the money, it required all the widow's
                     faith in her sister, all her own affection, which her childless and friendless
                     state and her anxiety for Joanna had greatly increased, to make her rest
                     tranquil. So incredulous, so indignant she seemed, that at last the younger
                     sister, whom the other's excessive love had in the usual way made sometimes
                     imperious, suddenly exclaimed with
                     the tone and manner of a superior mind resentful of injustice,
                  "Mary, look me in the face. Do you see there any guilt? or any falsehood?" Mary
                     looked, and saw nothing but a magnanimity that awed her, and a spirit of
                     outraged truth which it had been blasphemy any longer to incense. "How I got
                     this money," pursued Joanna, "I shall not tell you; but I got it honestly for
                     honest purposes, and I mean so to spend it."
                  "And for what purposes, dear sister?"
                  "To make me worthy of him," said Joanna, with an eye that kindled and expanded
                     like a poet's in his loftiest meditation.
                  "But of what use will that be, Joanna, if you are no longer to meet him in this
                     world?"
                  "To make me fit for Heaven."
                  And with this sublime truth, whose doctrine in all its extent the excited fancy
                     of the speaker did not itself comprehend,32 Joanna rested her
                     defence.
                  Nor was there any delay in giving proof of her sincerity. She found out a
                     capable teacher of French and put herself under his charge; and when in a short
                     time she had made herself sufficiently familiar with that foreign tongue to
                     pursue her studies therein unaided, she visited daily an Italian teacher; and
                     then, in like succession, a teacher of Spanish; and, mastering the elements of
                     that tongue in turn, studied indefatigably day and night upon all three
                     languages.
                  And now,â€”as the lapwing, to conceal her young from the fowler, busies herself
                     at a distance from the nest, and the further she is off displays the more
                     anxiety, while when she is really near she is hushed before him and outwardly
                     at ease.â€”Joanna brought in, from day to day, various books of various English
                     poets, till at last, with a heart wild with expectation, she had given Ernestin
                     a place upon her shelves. Then all the rest were neglected. And then, after she
                     had purchased at separate times a plaster bust of Shakspeare and one of Milton,
                     she procured, her true object, a cast of Ernestin, and put it on the
                     mantle-shelf of her sister's humble parlor, between the other two. She would
                     have taken it to her own room at once, but durst not, lest she should
                     compromise her secret, which was his.
                  What would not even an ordinary woman under the omnipotent incentive of
                     ambitious love? With then Joanna's really great capacities, and her lofty
                     though still gentle and docile spirit, to labor was to have sure success, and
                     ere a little while had elapsed, Mary, to her admiration, to her stupefaction
                     almost, if not awe, beheld Joanna changed, though the same,â€”changed in
                     language, in demeanor, in look; for to all that was noble, nay, majestic even,
                     in her mien and carriage, were now added the dignity and the grace and the
                     expression which nothing else can give but education. In short, Joanna Bradley,
                     the beautiful and the stately, was now, besides, Joanna the intellectual, the
                     accomplished,â€”her natural contemplative expression changed to a look of
                     touching mournfulness, and her superb voice become at times so melting in its
                     accents, that Mary, now every way her inferior, but with a still unaltered love
                     that could not know envy and was too often stimulated to feel decay, would
                     actually weep, and say, "Joanna, what is the matter with you? You make me cry
                     to hear you; and yet I had rather hear you speak than music. As you look and
                     talk I could almost fancy angels talk and look in Heaven."
                  Then Joanna would say, smilingâ€”not complacently, but with a sweetly mournful look that made her
                     sister's eyes pour out anew their sad but not unpleasurable rain,â€”
                  "It is, Mary dear, because the soul of Heaven is doubtless undying love; and
                     love which makes music of the angels' speech, as you suppose it, has sadly
                     melodized my own."
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  PAIRED, NOT MATCHED.
                  IT is about eight months since Joanna's attempted suicide. The ribbon yet
                     surrounds her shapely neck; for, notwithstanding the lover-surgeon's care,
                     there is in the white skin a slender line still whiter, which she will carry to
                     her grave. She is seated in Mary's little parlor, bending over the
                        Filippo of Alfieri; which with other pieces of a kindred
                     theme she has a marked predilection for, and has read in special passages very
                     many times.
                  The door opens; but she does not heed it, nor does she hear the voice of Mary
                     which welcomes the incomer; who approaches Joanna quite unperceived, until by
                     standing before her he obstructs the light and rouses her from her
                     abstraction.
                  She raises her eyes to see a plain, goodnatured-looking little man, who,
                     saluting her by her Christian name, holds out to her in a friendly manner a
                     coarse and dingy hand. Joanna does not touch it, but, turning very pale,
                     exclaims faintly, "Bradley!" and shuts her book.
                  "Why Joanna, if I 'd ha' thought you wouldn't be glad to see me, I wouldn't
                     'ave come."
                  "You took me by surprise," answered Joanna, slowly. "I am pleased to see that
                     you look well."
                  "Pleased to see that I look well!" echoed Bradley in great
                     surprise; "and with an air as if she was a princess cess!" (said appealingly to Mary,â€”who begins to
                     look uneasy.)
                  "I am sorry to have displeased you," resumed Joanna mildly. "I had no thought
                     to pick my words."
                  "Had no thought to pick her words, and sorry to!â€” Did
                     ever any body hear the like? Why, what has come over the woman? And
                     books?"â€”looking about him,â€”"and images? You are getting high! I wonder who pays
                     the piper?"
                  This was said rather vulgarly than with ill-nature: yet Joanna colored. But
                     instantly remembering Ernestin's counsel and her duty, she repressed her
                     resentment, and, while recoiling with disgust at a manner, voice and language
                     that contrasted so unpleasantly with his, and of themselves were repugnant to
                     her cultivated taste, she said within herself, He has a right to
                     be inquisitive, and answered with gentleness yet firmness,
                  "I have not called upon you, Bradley, to pay for me. These things are come by
                     honestly; my sister is satisfied."
                  John looked to Mary, who nodded gravely, but said nothing. Perhaps she did not
                     feel quite satisfied.
                  "Hum! But it seems to me, your husband ought to be satisfied tooâ€”unless you've
                     given us up for good, Joanna; and that I won't believe. But you must work
                     pretty hard, and drive a good trade, to afford to play the lady in this
                     fashion."
                  "Content you. The means were come at by the sweat of my heart."
                  "Which I s'pose is something more than the sweat of the hands. I don't mean to
                     be cross, Joanna; John Bradley is no scolder, that you well know; but really
                     now it does seem to me, that you talk a little too fine for the wife of a plain
                     man like us; and you have a sort of coolish air with you that freezes one like.
                     Do you learn these things out of that book there? I should like to see it."
                  Joanna handed it. "Eh! what 's this? Some foreign lingo! You are
                     amazing clever, I always thought, Joey; and you may work like a
                     horse, now you are alone; but I don't believe you can read a word of this queer
                     stuff. Try."
                  Joanna took the bookâ€”which he handed back in perfect seriousness,â€”and at the
                     place where he held it open, which was the beginning, read aloud: 
                        
                           "Desio, timor, dubbia jd iniqua speme,
                           Fuor del mio petto omai! Consorte infida
                           Io di Filippo, un altro che Filippo
                           
                           Oso amar, io?"*â€”
                        
                     
                  
                  The ready and perfect acquirement of foreign tongues is never the reward of
                     study save by the bounty of nature. They who are thus favored gather, as it
                     were by intuition, what others labor for in vain for years. Joanna's Italian
                     teacher had told her she pronounced as a Roman; and, charmed not more by her
                     aptness than by her magnificent voice, which made it easy for her to sound the
                     Tuscan as a Roman sounds it, he had taken with her more than usual pains.
                     Therefore, and as, with the habit she had lately fallen into of abstraction,
                     she recited from the heart, her simple husband,â€”though he understood not a
                     word, though perhaps he gathered not a distinct sound of all she utteredâ€”struck
                     by the unmistakable accent of truth and of feeling, was stupefied and gazed on
                     Joanna's eloquent countenance with open mouth, while she continued: 
                        
                              *Desire and fear, false,
                                 evil-prompting hope,
                              Forth from my breast forever! Faithless spouse
                              Of Philip, do I dare another love
                              
                                 Than Philip?33â€”
                           
                     
                     
                        
                           â€”"Ma chi 'l vede, e non l'ama?
                           Ardito umano cor, nobil fierezza,
                           Sublime ingegno, e in avvenenti spoglie
                           Bellissim' alma;"*â€”
                        
                     
                  The reciter, whose voice, at first mournful and severe, and startling by its
                     energy, had subsided to a tone of pensive tenderness, while by her slow
                     enunciation and her pauses she seemed to be dwelling with a melancholy
                     satisfaction on the features of the image she had called to mind, spoke now
                     with so much sweetness that Bradley and her sister trembled,â€”trembled with
                     pleasure, moved sensuously by the mere vibration of an exquisite but
                     unintelligible music; and when Joanna, after the last and longest pause,
                     resumed, with upturned eyes, while she smote passionately the leaves of the
                     book together in her clasped hands, 
                        
                           "Ah! perchÃ¨ tal ti fero
                           Natura e il cielo?"â€ 
                        
                      they looked at one another with an admiration that had something in it of
                     awe, while the husband fell back a step, and the sister recovered herself only
                     to shed tears.
                  "Well! if this doesn't beat all!" exclaimed at last the former, when a sigh
                     from Joanna had seemed to bring her hearers and herself back to the scene
                     around them. "If it only was in English, I should say that Mrs. Siddons they
                     talk so much about, could not have held a candle, was she now alive, to our
                     Joey; for it is a play, isn't it?"
                  
                     
                           *â€”But who sees him, and not loves?
                           Courageous heart humane, right noble pride,
                           Genius sublime, and in a graceful form
                           A soul of beauty;â€”
                        
                  
                  
                     
                        â€ Ah! why did Heaven and nature
                        Make thee such?
                     
                  
                  "It is," said Joanna, very pale, and with downcast eyes: "a tragedy."
                  "So I thought. And you looked it too! You really made me feel queer, though I
                     knew it was all gammon, and couldn't understand a word. If you can only cry as
                     well as you talk and look, you'ld make a rare actress, Joanna. But I hope you
                     are not studying to be one for all that?"
                  "Oh no," said Joanna mournfully; "I have no need of acting." And again
                     abstracted, she repeated to herself in a low voice, with deep expression, these
                     other words of the character with which she had identified herself, and not for
                     the first time: 
                        
                           "Misera me! sollievo a me non resta
                           Altro che pianto; ed il pianto Ã¨ delitto."*
                        
                     
                  
                  "Now, did you ever!" exclaimed in new admiration the untutored husband, turning
                     for sympathy to his sister-in-law,â€”who however understood Joanna's meaning
                     better than he did, to whom it was well nigh as dark as her Italian. "Would any
                     one have thought that me, John Bradley, who am but a joiner, and not a rich one
                     eitherâ€”though I managed to keep her comfortable without spoiling her pretty
                     hands, and you, Mary Ledyard, who am but a seamstressâ€”though a deused honest
                     oneâ€”which is more than can be said for all of 'em, would have had between us a
                     girl of such a head as this? I don't wonder now at all, at the rumpus she
                     kicked up at the theatre, when every body in the pit got up, and all the lords
                     and ladies in the boxes under us stuck out their heads as if the King had just
                     come in. She couldn't help it; and,
                     
                        
                        
                           *Me wretched! solace is there left me none,
                           Other than tears; and tears in me are crime.
                        
                     
                     
                     when I thought she was not in her right mind, I s'pose it was because she had
                     too much mind to be right for any of us. But I say, Joey dear," he added,
                     turning with some show of interest to Joanna,â€”who in the determination not
                     again to forget herself had risen, and was listening with a thoughtful if not
                     painful smile,â€”"you really are not studying for an actress are you? though you
                     would make a brave one, no mistake! Come now, honor bright?"
                  "No," replied Joanna simply.
                  John looked puzzled. "Perhaps you will be a great author one of these odd
                     days?"
                  "I think not, Bradley; nor have I any idea of it. But I should like to be
                     worthy to become the friend of great authors."
                  "As perhaps of that Fitzherbert there, with the hair on his lip like a Scotch
                     tarrier," said John, contemptuously chucking under the nose the plaster bust of
                     the poet. "They say he is going to be made a greater man than ever, perhaps a
                     lord of."
                  Fortunately, the coarse but not ill-humored joiner had turned to Mary with this
                     information, distorted from a rumor in a morning paper; and Mary looking at him
                     in turn, they neither saw Joanna's cheek.
                  Rising, to conceal her agitation, she reached her arm to her narrow
                     book-shelves, and taking down a volume of Fitzherbert's plays, she faced again
                     her husband, and said,â€”
                  "Bradley, you are a good man, and even understand what is good in the
                     sentiments of authors, though the language may be too fine in parts for your
                     intelligence. Listen." She read some lines from one of Ernestin's tragedies.
                     "Is that good?" she inquired. "Is it"â€”enthusiastically, despite of prudence and
                     her resolveâ€”"Is it not noble? is it not to talk like a god?"
                  "It is to talk honestly," said John, "if that be to talk like a god, as you
                     call it; and he was a devilish honest as well as clever chap that wrote them
                     lines."
                  "And you esteem him?"
                  "Honor him, with all my soul."
                  "And so do I," said Joanna with a solemn fervor. "It is Mr. Fitzherbert, that
                     was our neighbor."
                  "Phe-ew!" whistled the joiner, looking, happily again, not at Joanna but at the
                     bust. "You don't say so! And that is a play too?"
                  "Is a play too."
                  "Joanna, if all the plays talked like that, we might turn our churches into
                     playhouses and make Mr. Fitzherbert Archbishop of Canterbury."
                  The smile this speech occasioned, and honest John's satisfaction at having said
                     something smart, cut short a dangerous theme, perhaps rescued Joanna from at
                     least her sister's suspicion.
                  "Well," said John, after he had enjoyed the triumph of his wit a modest while,
                     "Well, Joanna,â€”you are a little flighty still, I see: but I should be glad to
                     have you back agin for all that, if you'll only try: and in fact I came just
                     for this and nothing else, I am so lonesome."
                  "And would you be less so if I were with you, changed as I am, and having now
                     nothing in common with you? If you were sick and suffering, Bradley, I should
                     not wait for you to call me to you. Or if you even loved me so well"â€”Joanna, as
                     she spoke, turned very paleâ€”"that my absence fretted you and made you restless,
                     I should know how to sacrifice myself to duty, and so I made you happy would
                     not murmur, though my heart were breaking. But you do not really miss me; you
                     have now your niece with you, to make your home comfortable; your rest I know is not broken because of
                     me, nor your appetite destroyed."
                  "Oh dear, no!" said the easy husband, laughing; "and the fewer spoons in the
                     platter, the more there is to eat."
                  "What then do you want?" resumed Joanna, with a gravity which this
                     matter-of-fact sentiment did not tend to lessen.
                  "Why, it seems a hard case, Joey, that a man should have a handsome wife and
                     have no good of her." Joanna colored violently, then grew still paler. "If we
                     were only really parted, out and out, I might take some other nice gal that was
                     a little more like other people. But you see, we cannot be divorced because
                     there is no sufficient cause."
                  If it were possible to be paler than Joanna was at that moment, it could be
                     only with the paleness of her sister's ruined face; and her voice, as she
                     spoke, had almost the hollow and irresolute tone of conscious guilt.
                  "No, not legally; but here"â€”she pressed her hand, firmly, heavily, upon her
                     breast, as if it pained herâ€”"here, in my heart, there is a cause; and God knows
                     it is sufficient. John Bradley, for me to live with you would beâ€”what I cannot
                     name; for my body only would be with you. Ask no more."
                  John shrugged his shoulders carelessly. "Well, Joanna, I see you're grown too
                     high for me; though you always was an inch or two above my rule." Nobody
                     laughed at this joke but himself; for Mary was uneasily watching Joanna, and
                     Joanna was busy with her conscience. "No matter," he continued, clapping on his
                     hat, "I am content to let you have your own way; and that's being very
                     good-natured you can't deny. Good b'ye. Perhaps by 'nd by you'll change your
                     mind, and we shall yet sleep in one bed again."
                  "Never!" murmured from her chest Joanna, as the door closed upon him, "Never
                     till the churchyard is our chamber."
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  THE AMBASSADOR.
                  ABOUT the same time with the preceding scene, on a very different stage, with
                     more important personages, another scene was acted, whose conclusion led to
                     most momentous consequences to the chief characters in both.
                  It was the last month of the winter following Ernestin's rustication. The
                     Duke's efforts had been crowned with complete success. The ministry, defeated
                     on every question by overwhelming majorities, saw themselves compelled to
                     resign; and his Majesty had ordered the ex-minister to assemble a new cabinet:
                     which had been done.
                  Ernestin was not forgotten. On the morning that we speak of, the Duke summoned
                     him to â€”â€” House, ostensibly to consult him as to certain appointments which his
                     grace proposed to make among the devoted members of his party; on most of which
                     Fitzherbert had the good fortune to coincide in opinion with the minister,
                     while in those instances where he was compelled to differ he advanced such
                     subtle reasons, that the great man smiling said with an approving nod, "You
                     have not misused your opportunities, Mr. Fitzherbert. With a little more
                     training, you will make in time as good a judge of men as myself." Ernestin had
                     the forbearance not to smile, and the courtesy to bow; which in another man
                     might have been considered a justification of the premier's good opinion, but
                     in him was purely the result of an habitual regard for others' feelings and,
                     where they were concerned, the sacrifice of his own self-love. He would have
                     had the same forbearance with the Duke's meanest servant.
                  "But," resumed the ministerâ€”who, mindful of the rumors in the morning prints,
                     had vainly watched for expectation in Fitzherbert's eyes,â€”"you have asked
                     nothing for yourself."
                  "I have nothing to ask for, my lord. I have done my duty. Let that be my
                     reward."
                  "For yourself, Mr. Fitzherbert, that may answer; but it will satisfy neither
                     the country nor me."
                  "Then plainly, my lord,â€”nor think me disrespectful,â€”there is nothing you could
                     offer that I would accept. Suffer me to take my leave."
                  "I think there is," said the minister, with a smile, laying his hand upon
                     Ernestin's arm to detain him.
                  "It is nothing then political," said Ernestin, gravely.
                  "What say you to an embassy?" said the minister.
                  Ernestin colored to the eyes. He was evidently moved. He was silent.
                  "I knew that it would suit you," continued his grace. "And the air of Spain,
                     and sojourn in that most poetical of countries, will do you much good. I see
                     you suffer now; you have overworked yourself, Mr. Fitzherbert." (Ernestin's
                     hand was instinctively raised to his head: he had indeed; his old complaint had
                     returned with double violence.) "It was in our service; and we have done but
                     our duty, when unanimously we gave you that appointment. And his Majesty has
                     expressed his approval in terms the most flattering. Your credentials are
                     already made out. To-morrow you must go with me to the King. After that, the sooner you are prepared to start
                     the better for yourself as for us."
                  "How shall I thank your grace!" said Ernestin, with real gratitude. "It is the
                     sole office I have ever coveted; the dream indeed of my ambitious life."
                  This was a frankness so unusual, and the acknowledgment was made with so much
                     simplicity and so much feeling, that the Duke, who, with all his knowledge of
                     men and of Ernestin in particular, had never met with the like before, was
                     completely at fault, and knew not whether most to admire the man, or to fear
                     that he was too artless for the high appointment he had conferred upon him. It
                     was a very ordinary mistake which the premier shared with other men of the
                     world, who interpret artlessness a want of tact, and see in frankness but the
                     absence of discretion. Whereas men like Ernestin, have, as I have elsewhere
                     shown, an immense advantage by reason of this very mistake; for, deceived by
                     the appearance of simplicity, the cunning and reserved, who deem themselves
                     astute and wary, are sooner or later thrown off their guard when in contact
                     with the former, and, becoming in turn communicative, lose every thing while
                     they really gain nothing, since men of the kind whereof we chronicle an
                     example, who are open as the air in matters that concern themselves
                     exclusively, because they have nothing to conceal and fear no censure where
                     there is no guile,34 are closer than the grave on all points that
                     affect the interest of othersâ€”always where confided in, and often, as with
                     Fitzherbert, through the simple charity and romantic (by which I mean,
                     high-toned) generosity of their own characters. Besides, the minister, with all
                     his own sagacity, had not sounded a bare fathom of the immensity of
                     Ernestin's,â€”who, with more directness,35 had much of the subtlety of
                     spirit and clear-sighted perspicacity, never dazzled and rarely dimmed, of that
                     statesman whose name has so unjustly, and so ignorantly, been made a byword of
                     reproach among all nations,â€”the great Machiavelli,36â€”and saw into
                     the motives of all men as if they were written on their faces,â€”and read their
                     faces, as he often said, without so much as lifting up his eyes,â€”but again,
                     like Machiavelli, disdained to practice the arts his observation and his subtle
                     reason made known to him,37â€”the minister, I say, had no idea of the
                     extent of Ernestin's sagacity, and dreaded the frankness which in diplomacy, as
                     in the intercourse of private life, would be in fact its best aid. He knew not,
                     or counted as nothing, that which was really to be distrusted in the new
                     ambassador,â€”his proneness to affection. But he, who in his own affairs might
                     run the risk of rash attachments, could easily be chary of his friendship where
                     other interests required circumspection and reserve; and Ernestin, facile to
                     all things which he undertook, and thorough in all things, was not inadequate
                     even in this particular to the duties of his new and high function.
                  "How shall I thank your grace! It is the sole office I have ever coveted; the
                     dream indeed of my ambitious life."
                  The minister, I repeat, was at first startled and embarrassed by this artless
                     expression of Fitzherbert's gratitude and delight. He had however sufficient
                     readiness to answer, with the courtesy which habit had put always at his
                     command.
                  "By discharging your duties so as to justify my good opinion.â€”It is plainly
                     said, Mr. Fitzherbert, and with your own sincerity. I am sure your excellency
                     will not be wanting now, who have never yet failed to satisfy our utmost
                     expectations. But tell me, have you any ill-will to Buckhurst for the part he took in a certain
                     affair near Paris? Don't blush, Fitzherbert," continued the Duke, laughing;
                     "that is quite undiplomatic; and though the world does condemn such scenes as I
                     allude to, it has a more than sneaking partiality for their prominent
                     actors,â€”which is why the theatre is kept always going somewhere, in spite of
                     good sense, morality and religion. I hope, I say, you bear no malice; for the
                     Cabinet would make him Secretary to the legation; but I want your tastes to be
                     consulted."
                  "Which your grace has done completely. There is no man in all England whom I
                     would sooner have chosen, none of whom, in so short acquaintance, I have a
                     higher opinion."
                  "Well, you will then harmonize admirably; for he has the very highest one of
                     you. Indeed it is by his own solicitation that the appointment has been
                     made."
                  Ernestin's eyes sparkled; this time, not amiss in the eyes of the Duke, who
                     continued:
                  "I only hope I have been as happy in another instance; for, as a mark of my
                     regard for you, Mr. Fitzherbert, I have ventured to attach to the embassy my
                     youngest son, who I am sure will, under your charge, escape those perils which
                     usually attend the like advantages."
                  "He shall be to me as my own," said Ernestin, greatly touched by this delicate
                     mark of confidence and consideration. The Duke himself was moved in turn, and
                     taking Ernestin's hand, he said,
                  "The rest of your suite you must fill up yourself, Fitzherbert. You will find
                     no difficulty. But, if you be at a loss to choose, you may consult me, as in
                     all things."
                  If Ernestin thought he saw in this offer what the Duke was always careful to
                     concealâ€”from him, though not from the world,â€”namely, that he considered himself
                     our hero's patron, he forgave him for his real kindness, and for the many
                     obligations which, whatever their motive and however repaid, he was under to
                     the minister. Indeed that his grace should feel himself a sort of protector of
                     Ernestin, whose fortunes he had built up while prosecuting through his aid his
                     own interests, was not unnatural; that he did not assume the character
                     outwardly was enough to quiet Ernestin, who, conscious of his own real
                     independence, would have revolted at the least show of patronage, and severed
                     immediately the connection. The world however took care to see no such nicety,
                     and conveniently forgot, if it knew, the origin of that connection, and
                     revenged its inferiority by calling him in secret the Duke's protÃ©gÃ© while envying him the advantages of that
                     imputed condition.
                  "But after dinner"â€”continued the Duke, without interrupting himself by any such
                     reflections. "You will dine with me to-day?"
                  Ernestin bowed acceptance, and left the room,â€”left it, to find himself indeed
                     in need of travel. He was alarmingly worse: so much so, that the thought came
                     over him of declining the office. But then, ambition,â€”Agnes, whom (pardon the
                     frailty, as the angels overlooked it) he had told, in their walk together, he
                     would seek distinction that she might regret him,â€”and the confidence, that
                     never failed him, in the recuperative power of his constitution,â€”nay, his very
                     pride in the universality of his talents; could he falter, when these urged him
                     on?
                  Yet there will come moments of despondency,â€”of disgust. And one is even now at
                     hand.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XII.
                  VANA VANITAS!
                  FOLLOW the new ambassador to his elegant rooms, with their wealth of sculpture
                     and of painting, all purchased by the sweat of his brain,â€”by the blood of his
                     life it might be said, and with melancholy truth. Is he striding up and down,
                     with chest expanded, head erect, and every feature animate with exultation? Ten
                     years before, he might have been. He is leaning against the mantlepiece. His
                     still youthful figure assumes no studied posture, betrays no consciousness or
                     desire of effect; for both his arms are on the marble shelf, and his head lies
                     heavily upon them. Notwithstanding the flush which its inverted position has
                     brought into his face, it has a strange haggardness, which can only come from
                     some mortal anguish or some sudden access of sorrow; for it wore none such an
                     hour ago. He speaks, though alone,â€”as men of his past solitary and studious
                     life will sometimes do,â€”briefly, but with perfect consciousness of the act.
                     Listen.
                  "For you, Agnes, have I sought this! for you, have I won this! You will hear of
                     it! you will regret me! But you areâ€”De Coucy's. I would I were dead!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIII.
                  THE PICTURE.
                  BUT though thus momentarily overcome, as we have seen him once before, by the
                     consciousness of the real emptiness of his honors, because there was none with
                     him to share them, Ernestin was of too elastic temper not to shake off the
                     depression, especially when, coming to himself and asking forgiveness of the
                     Most High, he awoke to a full sense of his duty, and resolved to discharge
                     it.
                  He entered his bedroom, where on either side of the mantlepiece, on marble
                     consoles, were the now sculptured busts of his two sisters; which remained with
                     him to the last. That of his father, likewise finished, he had left at his
                     mother's house. Laying his hand on the head of each in turn, he kissed the
                     impassive brow, and said, distinctly, though in a very low voice, "Not alone!
                     since you are with me, in the spirit, ever; and to your divinities I offer up
                     these honors; for you alone of all the world, with our father, have loved me
                     truly, unchangeably, and for myself."38 Immediately, Joanna rose to
                     mind, who loved him, with passion it is true, but with like disinterestedness,
                     with equal sincerity, and he feared with as unchanging constancy. Reproaching
                     himself as for ingratitude, he remembered his promise to her, and how little
                     time he now had left to fulfil it.
                  He withdrew to the painting-room of his study, where on an easel stood ready the portrait of Joanna. He
                     had worked on it, more or less, every day since his return; and it was now
                     nearly completed, and by the few whom he permitted to behold it was considered
                     already one of his best performances. The picture was a half-length, and
                     represented a woman kneeling, with hands clasped and raised, and head lifted
                     and inclined toward one shoulder, in an attitude of imploring distress, whose
                     suffering expression was tempered by an ineffable tenderness the source of
                     which could be but love. Hair of unusual length and great richness fell over
                     the folded arms, between their uncovered beauty and the veiled breast, and
                     partially hid one shoulder. The eyes, beautiful as a heifer's,39 and
                     almost as large, appeared to weep,â€”yet no tears were marked in them by the
                     painter; the classic brows, low and long were uplifted at the inner end,â€”but
                     their contraction made no furrow in the youthful forehead, save just at that
                     end; and the under lip, parted from its fellow,â€”whose remarkable narrowness
                     gave length to the bold yet straight and feminine nose,â€”you almost fancied
                     trembled; while the singularly oval contour of the face and the paleness of its
                     flesh-tints completed the effect of the expression, in a figure whose general
                     effect was made striking by the contrast with so white a skin of a black dress.
                     Black was a hue which Ernestin, as a true colorist, studiously avoided; but in
                     the parent instance there was a philosophy in the selection, which made the
                     tone of the piece in moral harmony with the melancholy sentiment of the theme.
                     It was impossible to consider it a Magdalen, because there was neither remorse
                     nor debasement in the visage. People therefore,â€”despite of the imploring
                     attitude and look, and the love, which was not a mother's love, that bathed the
                     suffering eyes,â€”despite of Ernestin's denial and explanations tions,â€”persisted
                     in considering it a Madonna at the Cross. Had they called it a female LaocoÃ¶n, they had better expressed, with the true
                     idea of that stupendous work of art, the ethic spirit of the design.
                  The painter looked at it a moment,â€”with admiration, with interest, with
                     affection,â€”but without a thrill of passion; and in the grateful feeling with
                     which he had approached it, remembering Joanna's absolute devotion, and the
                     passion that made her melancholy soul sublime, he found the corners of the
                     perfectly-formed mouth too much depressed, and assuming his pencil, made with a
                     facile touch in the still moist colors the rounded angle more open,â€”so that the
                     upper lip at that part had an imperceptible elevation, which substituted for a
                     sadness that bordered on severity a mournful sweetness that better satisfied
                     the artist, in whose heart alone was hidden forever the secret of the moment
                     and the scene; the scene and moment when Joanna kneeled to implore a pity which
                     he durst not grant,â€”when the longing of the heart in her met, confronted and
                     struggling with his heart's longing, his awakened conscience, and that better
                     wisdom whose fountain is alone the awe of God.
                  "Strange destiny!" said Ernestin internally, repeating a former thought;
                     "Joanna loves who must not love her, and I in turn can only save myself from
                     the sin of returning her passion" (his heart shook: was it with a thrill of
                     pleasure, or of pain at the idea of the ruin in which one moment's weakness
                     would involve both him and her?) "by keeping my affections fixed on one, whom
                     it is only not a sin to love because I never shall again behold her, since for
                     her sake I have lost my best and only well-loved friend."
                  It was indeed so. Resolutely refusing to visit Agnes, Ernestin had seen less and less of De Coucy,
                     until at last, for reasons to be conjectured from what will be told in the next
                     chapter, they had ceased to meet at all.
                  "Perhaps," thought Ernestin, as he still worked delicately at the speaking
                     canvas, "perhaps Buckhurst, to whom I owed De Coucy, may be to me a new De
                     Coucy.â€”A thorough gentleman, or I mistake him much.â€” And how very handsome!"
                     thought with satisfaction the idolator of beauty.
                  In that heart of his, where nothing ever was stored that was forgotten,â€”in that
                     capacious heart, where, I have said, each new affection might be welcomed
                     without crowding out the old,â€”in that poet's-heart, where even now were
                     fresh-enshrined two women, though not worshiped perhaps with an equally pure
                     devotion, yet both paramount, more equally than he durst permit himself to
                     consider,â€”in that really noble heart, which God had blessed even more perhaps
                     than its co-mate and fellow-laborer the brain, Ernestin was already preparing
                     an abode beside De Coucy for his new friend Buckhurst, should he prove worthy
                     of that title.
                  Why then should Ernestin murmur at his destiny, when too Heaven had given him
                     the wisdom to perceive, the justice and the piety to acknowledge, it was
                     ordered for the best,â€”and for Joanna even as for him? The fruition of its
                     wishes effeminates or keeps in boyhood the heart it gladdens, and the sorrow
                     which makes sublime the countenance has first lifted Heavenward the soul of
                     which it is the index.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIV.
                  THE MARBLE BUST.
                  ERNESTIN was conversing with Buckhurst,â€”who was to dine with him, along with
                     the Duke, and his son the attachÃ©, the
                     Spanish Minister, and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs; the party being a
                     quasi-official one and confined to these persons, at the premier's particular
                     request.
                  The guest had turned the subject, rather inconsiderately as Ernestin thought
                     (but he soon perceived that he did him injustice), to their first interview in
                     the Place VendÃ´me; and it was with a strange
                     mixture of pain and pleasure,â€”pleasure predominating, that the poet heard him
                     inquire after De Coucy.
                  "He has sold out, I believe," said Ernestin, "and keeps himself perfectly
                     secluded on his paternal estate. You know the old Baronet is deceased, most
                     excellent man!"
                  "Yes; but it is more from devotion to his wife, I imagine, than from love of
                     his tenantry, that his successor imitates the paternal virtue. They say he is
                     the most uxorious man in England. Your excellency has seen Lady De Coucy, of
                     course."
                  "Often," said Ernestin gravely, his eyes upon the hearth-rug; "but not since
                     her marriage." He paused a moment, then asked with sufficient firmness, though
                     without raising his eyes, "Is she still beautiful?"
                  
                  "One of the loveliest women I ever saw," replied the Secretary. "I met her
                     about a year ago at a county-ball, from which the Major could not well be
                     absent. In spite of a rather diminutive figure, she was the admiration, I may
                     say the wonder of the whole room, every body pressing to get sight of her;
                     which however did not appear particularly pleasing to her husband, who, as she
                     hung upon his arm, seemed as he would gladly put out the lights, or in any way
                     obscure the splendor of the most extraordinary eyes in the world."
                  "They must indeed be very beautiful by candlelight," said Ernestin,
                     musingly.
                  "Superb!" said Buckhurst.â€” A long pause; the Secretary himself appearing to
                     muse.
                  "Had you any conversation with her?" asked Ernestin.
                  "A little, during the pauses of a dance, in which I had the good fortune to
                     secure her as a partner; not however, I suppose, with the good will of her
                     jealous lordâ€”for no one after was so fortunate as myself. She has a most
                     delicious voice, and talks with great volubility. She asked particularly about
                     Mr. Fitzherbert,â€”who, she said, was a great favorite of Sir Harry's,â€”wanted to
                     know how you looked, and if you went much into society, and were gay there,â€”and
                     appeared to have your poetry at her fingers' ends."
                  Ernestin's poor heart beat violently; and it was with great difficulty that he
                     asked, "Have they any children?"
                  "No," said Buckhurst. Where was the poet's guardian angel then? Alas for human
                     nature! this misfortune of a man whom he respected and loved gave him almost a
                     thrill of pleasure. But it was instantly followed by remorse morse; which was
                     not diminished when his guest added, "It is the only drawback to their
                     happiness,â€”certainly to Sir Henry's."
                  They were standing, the entertainer and his guest, by the mantlepiece; and as
                     the latter concluded he turned his eyes, being a very handsome man, to the
                     large mirror which was at his elbow. "What an extraordinary resemblance!" he
                     exclaimed, caught by the reflection of a small marble bust, which stood upon a
                     console of porphyry on the wall directly opposite. The Secretary made a step
                     toward it; but it seemed as if it suddenly occurred to him that the likeness
                     could not be accidental; for he apologized, and returned to his place,â€”not
                     without embarrassment.
                  "You mean to Lady De Coucy," said Ernestin. He walked slowly to the opposite
                     side of the room, and lifting from the bracket the bust of Agnes, which, a
                     miniature, was not more than a foot in height including the plinth, brought it
                     back with him. As he held it in his hand, the light of the chandelier, pouring
                     down upon it, added greatly to its beauty. "It was done from memory," said
                     Ernestin. "I made the sketch, from which I modeled it, before her
                     marriage."
                  Buckhurst made no remark, not even of compliment, (though there was something
                     in Ernestin's look which always saved him from direct compliments, except with
                     fools;) and Ernestin saw in his silence evidence that his guest had not before
                     suspected there was any connection between Lady De Coucy and the cause of the
                     duel, and that therefore there was no indelicacy in the turn he had given to
                     the conversation.
                  "Lady De Coucy should be done on canvas," said the Secretary, relieved from his
                     embarrassment by Ernestin's frank manner.
                  
                  "Because of her eyes," said Ernestin. "True. We get the shape here, and the
                     size, but not that remarkable effect arising from the great breadth of the
                     iris, nor yet the beauty of the color. But what tints could represent
                        that!"
                  Buckhurst had no need to call upon his courtesy and the sense of his position,
                     to restrain a smile. There was so much sadness in the enthusiasm with which
                     Ernestin spoke, and so much openness in its unhesitating expression, that he
                     felt the sympathy of a friend who is honored by being chosen for a special
                     confidence. Besides, as I have said before, Buckhurst was a gentleman in the
                     best sense of the word; which is the perfection of the Christian character. He
                     had no wish to smile.
                  Ernestin went to replace the bust, declining Buckhurst's offer to assist him;
                     and ere he had finished, the Duke was announced with his son.
                  His grace had seen the action; and the first thing he did, after the usual
                     courtesies, was to go up to the wall, and examine the bust.
                  "It is, I believe, the hundredth time I have looked at it," said the premier,
                     "and always with new pleasure. By the by, Fitzherbert, you told me you should
                     sell your principal effects before your departure. Does this gem go with the
                     rest?"
                  "No, my lord," replied Ernestin. "That, and the Medusa next it,
                     are of those I reserve. That one I shall always retain; but the
                        Medusa, which had the same original,â€”you see, the eyes and nose
                     are almost facsimiles,â€”and the pannel head of Cassandra which
                     hangs over them, and which I value above all my original paintings that are of
                     purely imaginary design, I purpose sending to â€”â€” House, if your grace will do
                     me the honor to accept of them."
                  The Foreign Secretary now entered, greatly to Ernestin's relief, and was almost
                     immediately followed by the Spanish Minister.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XV.
                  THE LAST TEMPTATION.
                  IT is the day after the dinner. Ernestin, still an artist, and always under any
                     circumstances, whether opportune or contrary, the servant of his word, is busy
                     with the portrait of Joanna,â€”to which he is giving those last touches, and,
                     with his finger as much as with the pencil, that mellowness in all the flesh
                     parts, for which he was justly rated high among colorists, and whose
                     manipulation I do not think, notwithstanding his communicativeness and
                     liberality, he would have been willing to have supervised by his graphic
                        brethren.40 There is a tap at the door; and his valet, an
                     Italian, (his former body-servant having been dismissed,) enters to announce a
                     lady who will not give her name.
                  "What sort of lady, Angelo?" said the artist, without discontinuing his
                     occupation.
                  "A plain-dressed lady, Excellency,â€”but very fine, with a grand voice." As
                     Ernestin turned about without speaking, and seemed by the knitting of his brows
                     to search his memory, embarrassed by vague thoughts,â€”for he felt that he was
                     startled, without knowing why,â€”the man mistook the pause and manner for signs
                     of irritation or doubt, and continued: "She looks as if she were an actress,
                     sir, and seems in trouble. Shall I send her away, Excellency?"
                  "No; admit her instantly."
                  "An actress? and in trouble?" said the poet to himself. "She shall be
                     relieved." Yet his heart beat violently, and his thoughts, against his will,
                     were taking rapidly a most distinct shape, when the door again opened, and in
                     the tall majestic figure that entered, though closely veiled, he instantly
                     recognized Joanna.
                  The blood mounted to the artist's face. Joanna, putting her right hand before
                     her own over the veil, as if weeping, made a motion backward with the other
                     toward the servant, who was officiously putting chairs; and when the man, in
                     obedience to a sign from Ernestin, reluctantly left the room, she sank without
                     a word into the seat that was put for her, while Ernestin, silent himself from
                     conflicting emotions, gazed on the heavy veil he could not penetrate, and
                     dreaded, while he watched, to see it lifted. Suddenly, putting his hand on
                     Joanna's shoulder, while he whispered, "Hush!" he went into the adjoining room,
                     and satisfied himself that it was empty and the door closed between it and the
                     rooms beyond. Returning, he found his visitor still veiled and weeping
                     violently.
                  "Joanna!" he said, raising gently the thickly gathered crape and laying it back
                     upon her bonnet. "Is it possible?â€” Are you mad?" he added with deep emphasis
                     and in an under tone.
                  Joanna looked up. "Oh yes! mad utterly; ruined, body and mind; ruined forever!"
                     She smote her hands together: she buried her face in her hands.
                  "Ruined? What can you mean?" He put his hand to her slender fingers, and
                     drawing them gently from her face, bent his head till it was on a level with
                     her own, till it almost touched it, and gazed eagerly upon her.
                  Reassured by the tones of his voice, which spoke the anxiety, the terror of alarmed affection, Joanna
                     looked up, and met a corresponding expression in the eyes which, so close to
                     her, sent their rays into her own to penetrate the sources of her heart.
                  "Can you ask me?" she said, in that matchless voice to which education had
                     given tenfold power; and her large eyes, floating in their tears, looked, from
                     the same cause, ten times tenfold as magical in their melancholy tenderness,
                     while her curved lips, the air of her whole head, its posture, and the graceful
                     contour of her smooth neck, partook of this enhancement of beauty and
                     effect.
                  Ernestin knew, by personal experience, that nothing beautifies the eyes, the
                     whole visage so much as lofty study and the exercise of the imagination on a
                     noble theme; but he was not prepared, who knew not yet the extent and nature of
                     Joanna's self-culture, for this great change in one whose beauty and whose mien
                     had seemed to him at times to be incapable of any exaltation. The hand which
                     held hers trembled and sought to escape. Joanna felt it, and placing on it her
                     other hand, added in the same manner: "And you do not comprehend my meaning?"
                     Mastering his emotions, Ernestin with a painful mental effort withdrew his
                     hand, and stood further from her; who now resuming her first desperate manner,
                     with locked fingers, while her eyes flowed over, exclaimed, "Oh you are
                     heartless, or you would not need to ask me! Are you not going? going far away?
                     What is there else left in the world for me?"
                  "God, Joanna; and therefore your duty," answered Ernestin solemnly.
                  "O do not talk to me in that way!" she cried, wildly, "and in that cold voice;
                     or you will drive me mad indeed! make me wicked and blasphemous!"
                  "I talk to you, Joanna, seriously, not coldly; and for both our sakes. You are
                     unjust."
                  "I am, I am! forgive me. But I am so desperate with this news. Have you no word
                     to console me? no gentle act? You stand aloof as if I were the merest stranger;
                     and yet I bear on my neckâ€”No, no!" she cried, starting up, "I am wicked to
                     reproach you, who are the best of men, and who have done so much for me! And
                     that is my picture; and you were busy on it! You have not forgot me."
                  "I have not forgot my word, Joanna. I never do. Have you remembered yours? your
                     written promise?"
                  "O do not speak so severely! nor look into my eyes with that awful look! I did
                     indeed promise to obey you, as to love you, ever; and Heaven knows how I have
                     tried! And I should have still been content to read of you, to know that you
                     were grand and happy"â€”
                  "Happy, Joanna?" Ernestin smiled, not bitterly, but a sad sweet smile of
                     hopeless melancholy, that made Joanna's eyes flow out afresh. "Did I not say
                     that you should look into your own heart, and read there what beats in mine?
                     Happy! when every hour is adding to theâ€”is making you more worthy of regret?
                     And you have come to me to show it, to show how you have toiled to please
                     me"â€”
                  "No, no!"
                  â€”"And to blind me with the lustre, which even in so brief a time your wonderful
                     talent has"â€”
                  "No, no! I call Heaven to witness for me!"â€”
                  â€”"Has added to beauty already dazzling. Is this right? Is it merciful, Joanna?
                     Is it virtuous?"
                  "O in pity, do believe me! for your own honor believe me! I had no idea"â€”
                  
                  "To display what you have learned, and which I read even at a glance, in the
                     very air of your head, in all your person? I do believe; for until my accursed
                     folly had lured you from your duty, and disturbed forever your peace of mind,
                     you were modest and timidâ€”O well do I remember it!â€”" Ernestin, struck with
                     sudden remorse, smote his forehead, and paused.
                  And now Joanna in turn put her fingers timidly yet tenderly to the hand with
                     which he covered still his brow, and said, in a broken voice, which betrayed a
                     fear of presuming, "Why will you reproach yourself? A thousand times, sir, O a
                     thousand times I do declare, I only am to blame! And am I not here? here though
                     you have repulsed me? Oh I am not modestâ€”I am the most shameless of women!"
                  Joanna released the fingers she barely touched, and hid her own face with her
                     hands; and Ernestin, without changing his position or his tone, continued,â€”busy
                     with his memory:
                  "Yet I remember how you fled the window, when in my wicked curiosity, if not my
                     lust, I durst openly solicit your regards. I read your soul then, Joanna,â€”and
                     once after that,â€”and yet once again. No virgin in her teens could be more
                     guileless. And if you are no longer so, curse him who has kindled the passion
                     that withers modesty and makes reason but fuel to the heart's madness."
                  "I bless him for it! bless you ever, for ever!" The enthusiast fell upon her
                     knees, and threw up her hands and eyes as in act of prayer.
                  Ernestin, startled from his sorrow and remorse, looked down with admiration on
                     a beauty that grew transcendent under the inspiration of the moment and in that
                     attitude, looked with an admiration in which the spirit of the artist stilled
                     the pulse of the lover, and going up to her, he took her hands, and leaning
                     over her as she knelt, he said, in his softest tones,
                  "Joanna, do you know, that from that day, that day when you so fled like a
                     startled deer, I battled with the passion that was beginning to master me, and,
                     admiring you the more, sought to distract my thoughts from what your innocence
                     made tenfold wickedness, if less weakness? Alas! it was too late."
                  Joanna started. Ernestin answered the flashing of her eyes, and the flush of
                     her pale cheeks:
                  "Too late, not for me, Joanna, but, alas! for you."
                  "Yes, yes," said Joanna, weeping and leaning her head on the hands which still
                     clasped her own, "for me, for me! From that hour"â€”
                  "What was but gratified vanity became"â€” Ernestin paused in turn.
                  "Uncontrollable passion, madness!" cried Joanna, with a voice so full of
                     energy, that Ernestin's very soul trembled in him.
                  "Joanna," he said, hastily, "You have made me forget your posture and mine,
                     which should be reversed; for I should kneel to youâ€”for forgiveness." As he
                     spoke, he raised her without difficulty; for she obeyed at all times the very
                     touch of his finger;â€”and this docility, which evinced not only the amiableness
                     of her own nature but the depth of her devotion to him, was not the least among
                     her dangerous attractions. He led her to the picture. "It is like you," he
                     said. "But had I seen you then as you are now, with your intellect so
                     gloriously awakenedâ€”blush not, Joanna,â€”this is praise that will not harm you;
                     and I mean that it should stimulate you to further effortâ€”had I seen you then
                     as you are now, I had made it more
                     attractive. Look. Men call it a Mater
                        Dolorosa,â€”that is, the Saviour's Mother mourning; but I mean it,
                     Joanna, for a picture of suffering and wronged Affection."
                  "It is not finished," observed Joanna, timidly. "Shall I?"â€” She stammered,
                     looked wistful, but fearful.
                  "Sit, do you mean, Joanna? No," said Ernestin, firmly, but without
                     severity. "Let us not convert it" (his voice is low, almost to a whisper) "into
                     a picture of Remorse. A touch, you see, would do it; and the madness of a
                     moment would furnish me the model. Men would then call it," he added, in a
                     still lower voice, "a Magdalen."
                  Ernestin turned the foot of the easel: and when he faced Joanna again, her face
                     was buried in her hands, and she was weeping.
                  "Joanna," he said, kindly, "Joanna, whom I truly honor,â€”because your soul is
                     beautiful as is your body,â€”you must pardon me, if I speak too harshly and too
                     boldly: it were sin in me to conceal from you the danger and the consequence of
                     sin."
                  "O, I thank you! from my whole heart I thank you! I know it is for my good. And
                     indeedâ€”Let me lean on your shoulder; it soothes me, and hides me; it makes me
                     feel as if I were buried in your heart, where indeed I would I could live, a
                     portion of its blood, and be no more." Ernestin pressed her in silence to his
                     bosom. "Yes," said Joanna, "I know all my danger, and my wickedness. There are
                     moments when I am so desperate, at the thought that you are near me yet I dare
                     not go to you, at the recollection ofâ€”ofâ€” No, I cannot speak my shame! You know
                     too well"â€”
                  "Know it, Joanna, by my own heart. There are moments ments when the best of us
                     is given up to the tempter, when the hungry heart would satiate its desires at
                     the risk of annihilation, and pay a moment of gratification by an age of
                     torment. But this hour of longing, which is such agony yet such pleasure,
                     passes away, and the cool and serene day dawns upon us, when we bless the
                     Providence that denied us our wishes."
                  "O yes, yes," murmured Joanna.
                  "Feel then no shame, Joanna; for I too have those moments; andâ€”I dare confess
                     itâ€”they are when I think on you."
                  Joanna clung to him as if she would grow into his bosom, and, sobbing
                     convulsively, murmured, "No, no, do not tell me so! do not! Yet it is such
                     joyâ€”to hear you! O, that I might now die on your breast!"
                  "And with this fire in your blood, and in mine, would it be safe to meet,
                     Joanna? Would to God, dearest and best of women, that I could answer that
                     passion as in other circumstances it would deserve! I would bid adieu for it to
                     glory without a sigh." And, for the moment, Ernestin so thinks.
                  "O do not tell me so! It kills me."
                  "Yet I meant it for your consolation, to sustain you when I am away; for,
                     Joanna, we must part at once, and forever."
                  "O no, I cannot! Do not drive me from you! To live the long days and the long
                     nights so far from youâ€”to fancy you are sick, or dying, or, far worse, have
                     forgotten me and are happy in a happier woman's smilesâ€”O kill me at once, or
                     take me with you!"
                  "Take you with me? Joanna!" He raises her to look in her face; but she falls
                     again on his shoulder, and, clinging
                     to him with her face hidden, and sobbing as if her heart would break, she
                     speaks convulsively:
                  "Yesâ€”take me with you! your servantâ€”any thingâ€”I will do the meanest office in
                     your household, so you will but let me be near you. I will not speak to youâ€”I
                     will not seek to attract your noticeâ€”I shall be happy to see you at a distance,
                     and to know that I am living in the same air; and if it should kill me, this
                     restraint,â€”if Joanna's heart should break in the effortâ€”I should die so happy!
                     O take me with you! Despise meâ€”trample on meâ€”degrade me any way you willâ€”but
                     take me with you!"
                  Ernestin looked up to Heaven. He needed its support. But not now against
                     passion; for the very excess of Joanna's love drove from his heart all other
                     thoughts than deep commiseration and an agonizing anxiety for her as for
                     himself. Without a word, his features haggard with distress, he untwined
                     Joanna's arms; he led her all but fainting to a chair; he sat beside her, still
                     in silence. Gathering in the interval composure, and seeing that Joanna, whose
                     hand he held affectionately, had moderated her transports, he said:
                  "Joanna, are you ready to hear me speak? me, Ernestin Fitzherbert,â€”your
                     neighbor at Chelsea,â€”your brother that will never desert you,â€”though nothing
                     shall make him forget what is due both to himself and you to induce him to be
                     aught more."
                  "It is cruel," said Joanna, "but just."
                  "If it be just, Joanna, it is kind; for I save you by one keen pang long
                     agonies, and by one moment of the heart's sacrifice a lifelong time of
                     remorse."
                  "Yes, forgive me;" she raised his hand to her lips: "I was wild and
                     desperate."
                  "Joanna, you ask to go with me. Were I so mad, so inconceivably mad as to
                     consentâ€”could we both be so monstrously, so absurdly wickedâ€” I have no words to
                     express my idea of such infatuation! And was it with this wild and desperate
                     hope, blind to every duty, you came hither?"
                  "Be more gentle with me! Alas! if you were drowning, you would catch at a
                     straw."
                  "But would I throw myself into a sea where there were only straws to save me?
                     Joanna, hear me: if what you propose were not perfectly desperate, if it were
                     anyway possible, except indeed in a disguise" (Joanna's eyes sparkled through
                     their tears),â€”"and that," he added with emphasis, "would be but the disguise of
                     an hour,â€”what would it avail you? or what comfort would it give? If you were
                     near me, you would sigh to be nearer; if I suffered you at last to smooth my
                     pillow, you would long to share it. Do not try to deny it, Joanna; you are
                     sincere, but know not yourself: nor do you know me. We should, both, plunge
                     into a sea where there was no shore in reach, nothing but the sky above us,
                     which we durst not look up to, and the abyss below whose bottom we must quickly
                     find. In plain words,â€”and pardon me, Joanna,â€”you would render me a faithless
                     and ungrateful servant to my king, and a rebel and tenfold ingrate to my God.
                     The glory that has but begun for me, and which you say you delight in, you
                     would bring down suddenly to shame and the lowest contempt."â€”
                  "Oh no, no! Stop!" cried Joanna, weeping.
                  "Men would hiss me everywhere," continued Ernestin, without regarding her; "and
                     their derision would be all the stronger, for the respect which they had
                     rendered me before against their will. And if I owed this fall to you,
                        although though my own folly is
                     the first sinful cause, how long would my esteem, my affection if you will,
                     remain for you? Is that the happiness you look to?"
                  "Mercy!"
                  "Yes, Joanna," continued Ernestin, slowly and with mildness, "such is but the
                     faintest outline of what would follow the gratification of your wild wishes.
                     Yet I have not said one word to appeal to higher motives than prudence or
                     regard for me. Joanna, my sovereign has honored me with a mission that crowns
                     my highest hopes of personal ambition during this life. I undertake it with the
                     confidence, the determination, to justify the good opinion I have gathered from
                     my country after twenty years' incessant toil. Would you be willing even to
                     disappoint me, far more to have my honors wrested from me with irrecoverable
                     shame?"
                  "O God! Have mercy on me! Iâ€”I"â€”
                  "Recover yourself, Joanna," said Ernestin soothingly. "If I torture you, it is
                     not solely for my own good.â€”Now, what is it?"
                  Joanna burst into tears.
                  His kind heart painfully moved, aside from all affection, Ernestin pressed
                     Joanna's hand in silence.
                  "Bear with me," she said. "I am very weak to weepâ€”but it was your voice that
                     moved meâ€”I did not deserve that you should speak to me so softly.â€” I would give
                     my life to make you happy, or even to add to your triumphs. Butâ€”butâ€”a horrid
                     fear besets me; and it is that, O believe me! and not alone the
                     longing to be near you, that has brought me here despite of shame, of fear, of
                     conscience." Suddenly Joanna rose, and falling at his feet, while vainly he
                     endeavored to raise her, "O sir!" she continued, with clasped hands, "O Mr.
                     Fitzherbert! do not leave this country! You will never come backâ€”I feel itâ€”I
                     know not why; I feel that something is to happen to one or both of us. Last
                     night"â€”
                  "Say on, Joanna. But rise. This must not be."
                  "No, no, let me kneel; it is fittest that I should; and I would pray to you, as
                     to Heaven, to spare us both. Last nightâ€” but do not laugh at meâ€”nor despise
                     me"â€”she hid her face in her hands, which she rested on his kneesâ€”"I was alone
                     in our little parlor; I had my armsâ€”about your bust, which is on the narrow
                     mantle-shelf,â€”and I was vainly looking in the empty eyes, which would not
                     answer me, when I heard the door of the room open, and in my fright to be so
                     taken, and the fear to betray you, I drew down the figure,â€”and the head,
                     breaking off, was dashed into a hundred pieces."
                  "It is but accident, Joanna, not an omen. There are none." Ernestin did not
                     laugh.
                  "I know it. I am not superstitious; I never was. But it is vain to reason when
                     the heart admonishes; and mine tells me, in a voice I cannot silence, that
                     something is about to happen, and that I shall never again behold you. O do not
                     leave me! do not! I"â€” She sobbed, she wept piteously; still on her knees, with
                     her face buried in her hands; nor could he raise her, though ever before she
                     had so readily obeyed his least motion.
                  "Joanna," said Ernestin, "this is more than unreasonable; it is madness. I am
                     going on a charge whose very function hedges it round with safety everywhere.
                     There is a peril; but it is here; and I go to escape it,â€”to save
                     my life, not risk it. My health, I have not told you, is sorely shaken by my
                     ceaseless toil andâ€”must I say it? by such scenes as this. My head is daily
                     breaking; and if your omen mean any thing, it warns me of my danger if I stay. I go to save my
                     head,â€”which is tougher, Joanna, than plaster."
                  His pleasantry did not avail. Full of her idea, full of the thought revived of
                     his departure, which was to put a gulf between them whose width she shuddered
                     to contemplate, Joanna fell back completely into the transport from which he
                     had just recovered her with so much effort.
                  "Yes, yes," she cried, lifting her head, while her eyes, now shot with blood,
                     had a wildness which showed an intensity of grief that bordered on distraction,
                     "it is all true, what you say,â€”and I have made you suffer, well I feel from my
                     own poor head. Yet there is more than fancy in this terror which distracts me.
                     I know, I know I never shall behold you more. O sir! Ernestin
                        Fitzherbert!â€” I have never yet so dared to call you, even in my own
                     heart, and in my fondest hour; that I presume to do so now, let it speak to you
                     the depth of my conviction!â€”there isâ€”I feel it, as if the voice of Heaven spoke
                     in meâ€”danger in your going; I know not if it be to you, or to me, or to us
                     both; but I never shall behold you more! By all that is in you of affectionâ€”by
                     my long love, since I must say itâ€”O, take me with you! leave me not to
                     die!"
                  "Joanna! are you indeed mad?"
                  "Yes, yes, I am very mad! mad with despair and desolation! mad to love you so
                     desperately who have no regard for me, nor pity, nor feeling!"â€”
                  "Joanna!"
                  "O no, no! forgive me! I am indeed mad to reproach you. You give me all you can
                     give; I have no right to love you; you are so great, so"â€”
                  "Hush, Joannaâ€”for pity's sake, hear me!"
                  "So far above me. It is as if I were to love the sun."â€”
                  "Joanna! Joanna! Is this the fruit of your study? is it only to find you words
                     for?"â€”
                  "For truthâ€”for truth only. I spoke in the full sense of my unworthiness. You
                     are so great and I so little"â€”
                  "Joanna, then I must speak. It is not so. Man and woman, there is nothing in me
                     that is not equaled if not surpassed in you. Butâ€”you are
                        marriedâ€”and it is not unto me."
                  With a sob, not loud, but full of anguish, Joanna fell flat upon the floor.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XVI.
                  THE PARTING.
                  ERNESTIN raised her. She was senseless; her arms dropped deathlike beside her.
                     He untied her crushed bonnet, and, removing it, laid Joanna with her head upon
                     the seat of the chair. Then, with a sudden recollection of the former similar
                     scene, and with a like fear as then, he moved quickly to the door, opened it,
                     saw that the adjoining room was empty, then opened the room beyond, listened a
                     moment, reclosed the door, and returning rapidly but noiselessly to the door of
                     the inner study held it open, while with eyes uneasily wandering to Joanna he
                     watched a moment. Satisfied then that his servant had not heard the fall, which
                     had been deadened by the thick carpet, and that he was not eavesdropping, he
                     took the unhappy woman again in his arms, and busied himself with her
                     restoration.
                  It was not in human nature, it was not in Ernestin's nature, it was not in
                     Ernestin who really loved Joanna, to gaze upon that pale but exquisitely
                     perfect face, which the long dark hair again was shadowing and relieving with
                     picturesque effect,â€”to have this renewed proof, if any were needed where all
                     her looks, her words, her actions furnished it, that he was loved to absolute
                     distraction,â€”and not to lose for the time all sense of his imperiled duty and
                     his good name threatened, in the mingled passion and pity awakened by the
                     scene. Could Joanna have been sensible of the act, he would have kissed her on
                     the lips,â€”which would have been to take a step irretraceable toward that sea of
                     infamy he had spoken of; but there was that in him which would have made the
                     poet shudder at such a testimony and gratification of passion while she lay
                     senseless in his arms. But he sighed profoundly when Joanna, responding to his
                     cares, lifted the long straight lashes of her superb eyes, and the next moment
                     opening languidly the heavy lids looked vacantly about her. She seemed to be
                     unconscious of her situation. Presently, she sighed. Then Ernestin echoing the
                     sigh, so that the tremor of both their bodies as they touched each other
                     appeared to be but one, bent his head over hers till his lips almost touched
                     her own, and whispered
                  "Joanna!"
                  At the sound, Joanna came fully to herself; and her first actâ€”as he drew back,
                     alarmed at his own sensations when he saw the color returning to the lips he
                     was so nearly touchingâ€”was to fling her arms about his neck, and, pressing her
                     still cold cheek to his own, as her head with its long hair sweeping over him
                     sunk on his shoulder, murmur,
                  "Do not leave me!"
                  It was a giant's effort, it was a pang like the death-agony, that stifled the
                     longing which her tone of voice awakened in his quivering brain; the longing to
                     return her clasp, and, kissing her lips, to answer her, I will
                     not! I will live with thee, and die with thee! He must have added,â€”the fool's death! sacrificing, for joys that by their very nature are
                     transitory and consume the brain, the life-long paradise and after-death
                     eternity of the brain's honor. But Providence has made the recompense of a
                     painful mental struggle, when directed to self-conquest, immediate, in the
                     strength that is instantly diffused,
                     the struggle over and the conquest made, through the whole intellectual and
                     moral frame. It is a giant's effort,â€”but it gives a giant's thews; it is a pang
                     like that of death,â€”but the soul rises from the agony in a superhuman
                     resurrection, with wings that bear it to the gods.
                  Untwining her arms with an action that was full of decision, yet not
                     ungentle,
                  "Listen to me," he said, "Joanna." He drew a chair, and sat beside her, facing
                     her. "Since you are here, I have twice gone to that room, to see that my
                     servant was not listening. It is a littleness, if not a meanness, that is
                     foreign to my nature and my habits. Yet I am conscious of no present
                     criminality; I am but guilty of weakness and folly. What then would be my
                     condition, were I to consent to your wishes, guilty as I then should surely be?
                     I see the soul, obscured, degraded, yet conscious of its former excellence and
                     brightness, cowering in itself at every look, trembling at every sound,
                     restless, suspicious, gloomy, down-broken. What love could atone for the misery
                     of such a fall? if there could be love in such a soul as mine has been, so
                     covetous of honor, so jealous of its freedom? And is this all? Have
                        you no soul? It is as noble as my own, if not more noble. See
                     then yourself stealing to my embrace, in the twilight, in the darkness, by
                     retired streets, through a private gate, into a house that we dare not throw
                     open,â€”your stately and slow step sunk to a quick and sidelong glide, your
                     upright head and open innocent look to a stooping forehead, with eyes that look
                     askant and uneasy through the veil that you fear is not thick enough to hide
                     you." Joanna, whose heaving bosom had showed her emotion, now put up her hand
                     to adjure Ernestin to pause. But he took it; and, retaining it, went on. "Fancy
                     yourself returning to your sister, whose question as to your absence you cannot
                     answer as you did when without guilt you left me. You betake yourself to your
                     chamber; but in its solitude, in the darkness, through the windows, under the
                     coverlet which you have drawn over you to hide your burning cheek, the eye of
                     God penetrates, and His voice, in the deep stillness, calls unto your heart,
                        What hast thou done? Woman, where is thy husband?" Joanna had
                     nearly cried out; but a spasm seized her; she gasped, half rising in her seat.
                     Ernestin, almost terrified, looked at her one moment, then went on:
                  "What joys do you expect for this? this shame, this horror of the struck
                     conscience? Nay, even were we in another land, and free to live together, does
                     the kiss of passion never satiate? is human strength sufficient to supply
                     hourly the heart's transport? They who love lawfully have a thousand avocations
                     that fill up the long intervals of rapture, and make paradise more welcome by
                     an absence from its bowers. Jealousy too would haunt you. Your eyes would see
                     or feign to see in mine a colder return to their amorous languor, your lips
                     would breathe reproaches even while they drank my kisses, your heart would
                     tremble with distrust even while my arms were round you and my breast answered
                     to the throbbing of your own."
                  "Stop!" cried Joanna, convulsively, while she pressed her fingers to her eyes,
                     as if to shut out the picture: "you madden me! Oh, to have you press me one
                     hour to your heart with real passion, and call me once your own, I feel that I
                     could give up my immortal soul!"
                  "This is terrible!" said Ernestin, bitterly deploring his eloquenceâ€”which had
                     been carried a single point too far, and alarmed at an excess of passion that
                     might prove unmanageable. "If you give these feelings mastery over you, you will indeed be 'ruinedâ€”body
                     and soulâ€”ruined forever!' They will make a desert of your noblest faculties,
                     and plough your beauty with the furrows of a premature old age."
                  "What matters it," said Joanna, despondently, "since it has lost its
                     power."
                  Ernestin laid his hand softly on the beautiful head which hung down before him,
                     putting aside with his fingers, by the same action, the yet ungathered tresses
                     which floated over the smooth forehead, and, looking under her face, said,
                  "Joanna, do you love me best, or yourself?"
                  Joanna lifted her head, her eyes swimming in tears which did not fall, and
                     without a word, fixed their large orbs on his own, with a look so mournful, a
                     look which was not amorous yet which spoke a love unto death, a look wherein
                     was no reproach and no surprise, that he was more than answered. The woman's
                     soul, past, present, and in future, was all before him.
                  Ernestin felt a thrill of the heart that was sharp as the thrust of a knife,
                     and yet sweeter than the emotion of a blissful dream. His own eyes filled; then
                     everything appeared to swim before him: he gasped, he put his hand to his
                     breast; he was about to exclaim passionately, "O my God! why may I not love
                     her!" But it was the moment following his greatest victory, and his hard
                     self-conquest was not to be surrendered. The mist vanished from his eyes, the
                     spasm that was such delicious agony subsided.
                  "Joanna," he said gravely, yet with a voice whose agitation told of the recent
                     storm, "will you add to the remorse which I must feel, and the regret which
                     after all that has passed between us you cannot doubt will everywhere attend
                     me, the fear that I have left you miserable? Is this the courage of a mind like
                     yours, Joanna? Is it worthy of your new attainments? Is it what I have a right
                     to expect?â€” What if I were dead?"
                  "Do you think I should survive you?"
                  "I do, Joanna; because I think you neither foolish, nor wicked. You have indeed
                     once raised your hand against yourself; but it was"â€” Ernestin stopped.
                  "Under a sense of shame and dishonor. It is just. But I had no thought of
                     self-murder; I but spoke what is my conviction, that I could not live in a
                     world where when you are gone there will be nothing more to give me pleasure. I
                     should die of grief." She put both her hands to her temples, the fingers
                     meeting on her forehead, and looked forward,â€”not at Ernestin; who answered
                     mildly:
                  "Grief does not kill, not suddenly at least; such deaths are of the rarest of
                     rare occurrences; but it saps the constitution, till it is undermined. Joanna,
                     you will not indulge in such criminal excess of feeling. If I indeed die when
                     away, I shall leave a name behind me that will not die. Live for that. Be its
                     lover, faithful and passionate, ambitious because I was ambitious, thirsty
                     after knowledge because I drank of it unsated, and I shall leave you with
                     enough to live for; and my last hour will be consoled by the thought that I
                     shall live buried in your heart, where Envy will not sneer at my epitaph, nor
                     Oblivion deface the deep inscription."
                  Joanna, who had dropped her hands over her face till they hid it altogether,
                     had evidently been struggling, while he spoke, with a new access of sorrow,
                     which now threatened to master all her heart and find issue as before in tears.
                     Ernestin saw it, and hastened to add, "Who knows? perhaps you will one day
                     build me a monument, that shall last after that has crumbled like all things
                        beautiful tiful and good,â€”in
                     song, I mean, or in some noble prose."
                  Joanna was elevated by her passion and her sorrow above vanity, and she merely
                     shook her head mournfully, and, uncovering her face, wiped a tear from the
                     corner of her eye with her long hair.
                  "Nay," he continued, "I know you have not been idle; and you will not be. Come
                     now, arrange your hair, Joanna,â€”though thus disordered it makes you look more
                     like your portrait,â€”and let me question you."
                  Joanna obeyed him with the dignity that is inseparable from dejection in a
                     noble spirit, and then sat waiting, with her eyes fixed on his face with an
                     unobtrusive tenderness, and a subdued expression like that of one in the
                     decline of a consumption; a look so like to that Fitzherbert had often seen in
                     his youngest sister, who had died of that disease, that it needed not his love,
                     nor his admiration, to touch him deeply.
                  Looking on her with a look full of sympathy, but carefully suppressing any
                     other feeling, he commenced his catechism.
                  "Have you been studying the languages, as you purposed?"
                  "Yes," replied Joanna modestly.
                  "And which?"
                  "Italian, Spanish, and French." It was said without affectation, without
                     vanity, simply, modestly, nobly (if I may so add); and Ernestin, struck with
                     fresh admiration, and with respect, continues.
                  "Is that the order of your preferences, or of your studies?"
                  "Of my preferences."
                  "I should have thought so. And what do you read in Italian?"
                  "The dramatic poets." A beat of Ernestin's heart told him that this selection
                     was for his sake.
                  "Metastasio?"
                  "No, I do not like him." It was answered with perfect modesty.
                  "And why?" inquired Ernestin, with a smile.
                  Joanna pondered a moment. "I believe it is because he is not manlike. I should
                     not however speak positively; for I read only one piece, the first in the
                     collection."
                  "Artaserse?"
                  "Yes. I thought it effeminate and unimpassioned."
                  "True: and yet it is not without feeling, nor without strength. Go on," said
                     Ernestin, drawing his chair nearer to Joanna's. Joanna colored with pleasure;
                     and, with the same modesty, but her voice a little faltering, proceeded.
                  "And then"â€” She checked herself. A burning blush overspread her whole face.
                     Ernestin, again smiling, came to her aid.
                  "Its love-scenes you find?"â€”
                  "Unnatural," said Joanna, much relieved.
                  "'T is just: and yet they are unaffected, and not without tenderness. Why
                     unnatural?"
                  "Because," said Joanna, after brief reflection, "the characters all converse of
                     their affection, or proffer it, in the same set phrases, as if they were taken
                     out of a book."
                  "Go on," said Ernestin, softly.
                  "They seem not to feel what they profess, but utter it as if they were obliged
                     to, and leave off as if it cost them no pain."
                  "Excellent!" cried Ernestin. "It is the love of the actors and actresses, not
                     of the characters they represent. Such is commonly the love of the French
                     tragic stage, with whose best poets Metastasio may very often be ranked. But besides, Joanna?"â€” The
                     catechumen looked in his eyes. "Did you mark the rank of the personages? What
                     then?"
                  "You mean," said Joanna, "that their language might suit any other class of
                     educated persons."
                  "Precisely. You in your simple speech are many times more royal than
                        Mandane;41 and when you are impassioned, you make the poet frigid
                     as ice and his characters impassible as marble."
                  "It is"â€”said Joannaâ€”"May I say it?"
                  "Why not?" asked Ernestin, again smiling encouragingly,â€”though in his heart his
                     smile found a source unknown to her; which was that he saw into her thought,
                     ere she had quite begun to utter it,â€”"Why not? Am I not the most patient of
                     listeners? Yet I am the most anxious. It is?"â€”
                  "Because I speak from the heart," said Joanna, with downcast eyes.
                  "'T is only too true, Joanna; and Metastasio was incapable of real
                        passion,42 or wanted the artist-power of the true poet to
                     individualize his characters. Their love is tame, because it is his love; and
                     that was on his paper, in his pen,â€”not on his brain, nor written by his
                     heart."
                  Joanna looked admiringly on Ernestin; who said, pressing her hand, "Is that
                     what you mean, Joanna?"
                  "Oh yes! but a thousand times better expressed than I could do it."
                  "Somewhat more readily perhaps," said Ernestin, "because I am a more practiced
                     critic, but not any better. I speak sincerely.â€”And now, finally, you do not
                     like Metastasio, because?"â€” Joanna looked inquiringly. "I refer," resumed
                     Ernestin, "to the moral effect; the great object of every poem and
                     every picture,â€”without which they are but words and colors, pleasant like the
                     rainbow or a twilight heaven, and unsubstantial as a summer wind. Why have you
                     no wish to return to Metastasio, as a poet?"
                  "Because," said Joanna, unhesitatingly, "I rose from that one play neither
                     better in heart nor stronger."
                  Ernestin could almost have hugged his pupil, and indeed had almost done so; but
                     he merely laid his hand on her arm, and looked in her face, so admiringly, with
                     so much satisfaction mingled with respect, that Joanna felt over-rewarded for
                     all her pains.
                  "Joanna," said Ernestin, resuming, "we are so alike"â€”What a look Joanna gave
                     him! how grateful! and how sweetly tender, yet how mournful! Even so had looked
                     his sister on her dying-bed. "We are so alike, that I would venture to name
                     your favorite in Italian instantly; but let us go on methodically with the
                     catechism." Alas! how unwary is the heart! Ernestin did not pause to see that
                     in all this conversationâ€”conducted, with whatever zest as an author-critic, yet
                     in a purely generous spirit for her improvement, which seized, not sought for
                     that it might admire, the merits of her character, he was cementing
                     indestructibly and binding with bars of iron the deep foundation of a love like
                     hers, that was not purely passion, but had been built, however first designed,
                     in the solid material of moral esteem! He did not see; yet Satan sneered the
                     whilst, and the higher angel looked mournful, though not uneasy; while Joanna
                     sat absorbed in the dear delight of being beside him whom she loved, and
                     Ernestin was all unmindful of the time. "Let us go on methodically with our
                     catechism. But first I must remind you that Metastasio is not to be rejected
                     either as a poet or a moral teacher, and that there are other more famous
                     pieces of his which are worthy of
                     your reading. In one of them indeed in the same volume,
                     Demetrio, you will find a tender scene that will remind you of
                     our own. It is in the third act. But then it is merely tender, not impassioned;
                     milk, Joanna, not wine," he added, smiling, and desirous to give a cheerful
                     character to their discourse.
                  "You mean," said Joanna, deferentially, "we drink it without excitement."
                  "And set down the cup without any rapturous commendation, or any eager longing
                     to have more."43
                  
                  "And then," rejoined Joanna (but still with deference) as Ernestin appeared to
                     pause, "milk forms a part of our daily food; we meet it everywhere, and can get
                     it, every one, at all times; while wine is rarer, and where good is costly and
                     to be had by only the favored few."44
                  
                  "Joanna!" exclaimed Ernestin, taking both her hands in his, and looking in her
                     eyes with a satisfaction, an admiration, a pride, that thrilled Joanna with
                     delight. Ernestin's manner said, Wonderful woman! and his heart
                     whispered to him, Strange destiny! Joanna has cast down her
                     sublime eyes, and is silent. Ernestin resumes, with a tone of respect in his
                     voice that is quite marked. "You then readâ€”Goldoni, I suppose."
                  "No," answered Joanna, while conscience sent the blood into her cheeks, "I
                     asked for tragedy; and my teacher indicated Monti."
                  "And you liked Monti?"
                  "The Aristodemo and Cajo Gracco much. But
                     yet"â€”
                  "They were not enough above the grade of Metastasioâ€”not for high tragedy?"
                  "No," said Joanna,â€”"if you will not think me bold,â€”they were still not what in
                     my heart"â€”she blushed againâ€”"I wanted." Ernestin divining her motive and
                     emotion, past and present, is silent; and Joanna proceeds. "But when I came to
                     Alfieri"â€”
                  The critic is all awake in Ernestin. He brings his knees close to Joanna's, and
                     presses her hand. "But when you came to Alfieri"â€”
                  "I found I had no need of any more."
                  "And why?" asked Ernestin,â€”in the exultation of the moment, which had found for
                     him for the first time a taste, as he supposed, congenial to his own,
                     forgetting the real impulse to that taste as he had just divined it, forgetting
                     therefore that the beautiful being before him was something other than a pupil.
                     "And why?"
                  "Because," said Joanna, with lowered voice and downcast eyes,â€”"he is most like
                        you."45
                  
                  Ernestin started,â€”pained, though pleased; for now Joanna is before him as
                     herself, and he remembers their common danger. Withdrawing softly his hand, he
                     said, with a sad smile,
                  "I fear, Joanna, you have made an imprudent choice for you."
                  "O no," she answered, earnestly, yet not boldly, "I find my spirit elevated and
                     my heart made stronger when I read him. He is all a man."
                  "Most true," returned Fitzherbert, gazing with renewed wonder on Joanna's
                     perfect forehead, and with a rapid glance involuntarily surveying all her head,
                     as if to estimate its bulk of brain. "But I fear," he added gravely, "your
                     choice is still imprudent. There is Filippo"â€”Joanna colored. "I
                     knew it. That and some others but foster thoughts which I would rather you
                     would give no food to. I would recommend you, in preference, the
                        Virginia."
                  
                  "I have read it with respect," rejoined Joanna; "but I better love to read your
                     own."
                  Ernestin did not smile.
                  "Do you remember any of mine?" he asked, with a sudden purpose.
                  "All of it," replied Joanna; and her eyes shone out like stars. "Try me."
                  "Repeat me Virginia's part from the second scene of the first act.
                     I will give you the cue, as Icilius. 
                        
                           Why that mournful look?
                           Why do those eyes so sadly fix on mine,
                           And swim in tears?"
                        
                     
                  
                  Joanna, embarrassed, not by any ignorance of the part, but by Ernestin's tone,
                     which was full of expression, hesitated a moment; but, as she went over in mind
                     Virginia's answer, she took from its import and from Fitzherbert's manner a
                     sudden impulse, and identifying herself with the character, recited the words,
                     contrary to her first intention, as if they were her own. 
                        
                           "I know not; but my soul
                           Is sore disquieted; a ceaseless dread
                           Of ill impending, shadowy-vague, yet vast,
                           Weighs down my spirit. Even as I gaze,
                           'T seems as a mist rose like a veil between us
                           And shut thee from my sight, which strives in vain
                           To catch thy fading features. Do not leave me!
                           Stay by me, Lucius!"
                        
                      Obeying, not the stage-directions, but her own natural impulse, Joanna,
                     with the very act of Virginia, threw herself forward, in her chair, on
                     Ernestin's breast, and sobbed.
                  It might be thought, the poet would have been alarmed by this demonstration of
                     not acted sorrow; but his object was to inspire Joanna with the heroism and
                     self-denial of his own Virginia. Therefore, though indeed touched to the soul
                     by what he deemed the very perfection of dramatic declamation,â€”as how could it
                     be else with Joanna's voice, Joanna's now truly cultivated taste, Joanna's
                     situation and emotions so similar to what was painted in Ernestin's tragic
                     verse? though touched to the soul, he did not suspend his purpose, but, with a
                     mixed emotion, of delight as an author and admiration as a man,â€”into which,
                     too, curiously entered for no small part a keen zest for the recitation
                     itself,â€”repeated in continuationâ€”with a manner almost as natural as her own,
                     and for like reasonsâ€”and with a tenderness that made Joanna, whom he held to
                     his breast, sob anew: 
                        
                           "Will I not forever?
                           My arms encircle thee; what should'st thou fear?
                           This is some sickness that distracts the brain.
                           Thou hast look'd pale of late, and thy blue orbs
                           Are purpled underneath with heavy watching.
                           Why dost thou shake thy head? That untold tale!
                           Thou fill'st me with disquiet, and my man's-heart,
                           Though now thy pillow, trembles with a fear
                           Would mate thy own: alas! and 'tis a moment
                           Icilius needs his courage, for Rome's sake!"
                        
                     
                  
                  Joanna, pressed to Ernestin's breast, did not sob the less that his voice was
                     full of tenderness, and that the transport of her sorrow was delicious
                     pain.
                  "I see," said Ernestin, "I must repeat too Icilia's part. 
                        
                           This must not be. Cheer up, Virginia, sister!
                           Art thou Virginius' daughter, and of Rome?"
                        
                      Joanna replied directly, 
                        
                           "I am Virginius' daughter, and a Roman;
                           I try, for Lucius' sake, to look less sad;
                           
                           But the weak heart will not be school'd. Bear with me;
                           I shall be better soon. Thou wilt not leave me?
                        
                      As she repeated these last words, Joanna suddenly rose and threw herself
                     at Ernestin's feet.
                  "Joanna!" said Ernestin, gravely: "you transcend your part. 'T was not for this
                     I asked you to recite." He lifted her, and rose himself. "Go on with it," he
                     said more mildly, "and you will find the lesson I would teach you."
                  "I know it," said Joanna, with bewitching sweetness, yet with
                     mournfulness,â€”"and perfectly; but the weak heart will not be
                     school'd. Bear with me." He pressed her hand; and she resumed the part: but now
                     with downcast eyes, and as reading, not rehearsing. And she read it well. 
                        
                           "I shall be better soon. Thou wilt not leave me?
                           Not till my father comes?"
                        
                     
                  
                  Ernestin, as Icilius, follows: 
                        
                           "Unhappy chance!
                           I hadâ€” No matter: 'tis the only time
                           Icilius has broke faith. I will not leave thee.
                           No custom'd cause would move thee thus. The gods
                           Perhaps give warning"â€”
                        
                     
                  
                  Joanna. 
                        
                           "Never, to break faith.
                           If thou art promis'd elsewhere, go. My love
                           Lives in thine honor only: to love less
                           Were not to love Icilius."
                        
                     
                  
                  "Your cheek reddens, Joanna," said Ernestin, as again he kindly took her hand
                     in one of his and laid the other lightly on her shoulder: "I trust it is with
                     the awakened blood of resolution. I would have it not sleep, but be so
                     watchful, that should I, with Icilius, even wish to
                     stay,you, like Virginia, should yourself dissuade me. Let us
                        add that lesson." And he recited: 
                        
                           â€”"But should he leave thee,
                           What heart, Virginia, could Icilius have,
                           What power of judgment? Thy distress, his fears,
                           Doubt, and conjecture, would pursue him still,
                           And Rome's best interests suffer. Let me stay!
                        
                      Can you answer with Virginia, in good faith (allowing for the part)?"
                  "I think I can," replied Joanna sadly; "but it is painful. 
                        
                           "Before I knew thee, Rome had all my love.
                           When, happy in thy suit, my indulgent sire
                           Would have me listen it, he bade me note,
                           First of thy virtues, love of Rome and freedom.
                           For my love's sake, were 't well, Icilius, then,
                           To wrong that virtue which first won my love?
                           Forget my passing weakness."
                        
                     
                  
                  "Is it indeed in good faith, Joanna? Ask your heart; and if you make 'First of
                        my virtues, love of fame and honor,'
                     can you truly say the rest as if it were not recitation?"
                  "I can," said Joanna, lifting up her head, but becoming deadly pale. In the
                     next moment, she turned very red, and, casting down her eyes, said, in a lower
                     tone, 
                        
                           "Yes, it were not well
                           To wrong that virtue which first won my love.
                           Forget my passing weakness."
                        
                     
                  
                  "Be this so indeed, Joanna, and I will not fear to addâ€”nor even fear to bid you
                     ponder itâ€”what presently Icilius says: 
                        
                           "Now, the all-conscious gods,
                           Thou dear Virginia, mark thy worth and bless thee!
                           
                           Thou mak'st my passion reason, that before
                           Was happy impulse."
                        
                     
                  
                  "Oh, bless you!" said Joanna, kissing his hand, and weeping with perfect joy.
                     "I will try, with all my soul, to merit so much goodness, and Heaven's
                     blessing. I will obey you, cost what it will. Forgive my passing
                        weakness!"
                  "Joanna," said Ernestin caressingly, yet with respect in tone and manner,â€”"how
                     you must have toiled to get my piece so well by heart!"
                  "Toiled!" said Joanna, with deep expression.
                  "Let it have been then a labor of love. I may still say, with double meaning,
                     it is got well by heart. And you recite it!â€” Were it not for you, my poor
                     Joanna, so sad reality, I could in very truth call you the most consummate
                     actress I have ever heard! It were a dear delight for a poet's vanity to have
                     you read the whole. No, no!" he added, as he saw the sudden sparkling of
                     Joanna's melancholy eyes, "I do not mean to put you to such a task. But for
                     your sake, Joanna, I will call upon your wonderful memory for yet one fragment
                     more. It is of the second Scene of Act III. This is your cue: 
                        
                           "I cannot think ('t would drive me to despair!)
                           Thy bodements true. We have done nothing, thou
                           In thy most innocent heart could'st not conceive
                           The thought of any thing, should bring down on us,
                           On thee, this horrible fate."
                        
                     
                  
                  Joanna, whose incomparable voice, so full of mingled majesty and sweetness,
                     lost nothing by her sadness, replied as Virginia: 
                        
                           "Thou must not murmur.
                           To the high gods man's individual wo
                           Counts nothing, weigh'd with the common good of all.
                           When we were children, thou knowest, the parent's rule
                           Seem'd often tyranny, and our transient pains
                           Cruel, because we saw not, and seeing could not
                           Rightly discern, the aim of their infliction.
                           Are we not, Lucius, to the omniscient gods
                           As little children, and our moans and murmuring
                           Proofs that we are well car'd for?"â€”
                        
                     
                  
                  "Do you believe that, Joanna?" said Ernestin, interrupting her.
                  "I do," replied Joanna solemnly.
                  "Write it then upon your heart, with what that hapless girl goes on to say;
                     which I will now repeat instead of you; for I want to apply it to your sorrow.
                     Hear me well. 
                        
                           â€”Thou wast born
                           Not of the kind to whom life brings but pleasure,
                           And thy great soul, thus crucified to joy,
                           May from its agony gain gigantic strengthâ€”
                        
                      Joanna, I speak that with as deep meaning, as profound belief, as if I had
                     written it for you. Will you remember it? will you act up to its implied
                     precept?"
                  "Oh sir, you do me too much honor: I am not of such kind; my soul is but a
                     feeble woman's"â€”
                  "When it yields to sorrow; but noble as a brave man's when it shall remember
                     God, and use its faculties as He designed them. Thou must not
                     murmur."
                  "And you," said Joanna timidly,â€”"has it not for you some meaning? Forgive me,
                     but did not?"â€” She paused in reverence.
                  "Did I not dream of my own agonies, crucified as I must be to joy, the joys of
                     other men,â€”no wife, no children to bless my hearth, no"â€”He checked himself, and
                     for Joanna's sake, whose eyes began to swim. Joanna anna, take the example with the precept, and
                     when I tell you, that my strength, whatever it may be, comes mainly from the
                     heart's sorrow, murmur not thou, but accept thy sorrow as
                     Heaven's highest blessing."
                  "I do," said Joanna, folding her hands upon her breast. "Have you not heard me
                     say, sir, that I would not, were it all to do again, have it undone?"
                  "Yes, but mistake not, Joanna, nor confound the cause with the effect. We do
                     evil; Heaven turns it into good; but not the less is our sin, however by the
                     divine ordinance, which blesseth all things, it may result in moral advantage.
                     Solomon, the wisest of Jewish kings, was David's son by a most fearful crime.
                     Do you comprehend me?"
                  "I do, sir. And I have never thought my guilt the less, that it has raised
                     me."
                  "Raised you forever, glorious creature! made faculties appear which perhaps had
                     gone down buried with you in the dust, had you still been guiltless. Nor is
                     this all; even from your penitence, Providence blesses you. Tell me, which is
                     the nobler expression, that of the happy, cheerful countenance, or of the sad?
                     Did you ask me the question, I should point for answer to your own beauty,
                     whose sublimity, Joanna, is all of sorrow. That very smile, with which you hear
                     my compliment, owes its choice attraction to its sadness and the melancholy of
                     your eyes. Has God then so mistaken His own handiwork, that what is most
                     ennobling to human beauty should be not of His design? We find it written
                     nowhere, Jesus smiled. The Christ surrounded by the admiring multitude is but
                     man elevated, though still the Saviour; the Christ upon the cross is a god.
                     Sorrow then is the divine blessing, and Affliction is the choicest gift of the
                     Creator."
                  "I believe it, I know it," said Joanna: "I have read it in my heart."
                  "Then be the lesson for eternity; and be this our parting. Wherever I go, your
                     image will attend me, while mine will sit beside you always, here."
                  Joanna's face grew whiter than the sculptor's marble; her fingers interlocked
                     each other passionately, with a gesture of mortal anguish.
                  "So soon?" said Ernestin softly, and not without tremulousness. "It is the
                     shock, and not your want of courage. Now that the spasm is past, be my
                        Virginia, be Heaven's true servant." He reached her bonnet.
                     "There, Joanna. Smooth out the folds; it is sadly crushed: you must cover it
                     with your thick veil. To-morrow, or before I leave, I will send you a note.
                     Promise me to do whatever it shall enjoin you."
                  "If it be notâ€” No, you will not ask me to take of you more money!"
                  "Joanna!" said Ernestin, in a tone of gentle reproach: "Am I less to you now
                     than I was? Am I not still your brother? Have I not opened to you a new life,
                     whose scenes you cannot tread without my aid? Be more truly spirited. Take,
                     Joanna, because in my case you would give."
                  "I will obey you," said Joanna. "Oh, you cannot doubt the depth of my
                     affection, since I submit to this!"
                  "This what, Joanna? Simple injunction of a real duty? Are you so indocile? Does
                     it not bind me to you closer, by another chain?"
                  "I will obey you, I will without a murmur. But my wants are very few."
                  "And for the few only I would provide. I look into your soul, Joanna, through
                     my own, and offer nothing that
                     should mortify a just pride. Enough to pay your board to your sister, and
                     enough besides for books and teachers, and the simplest comforts, that is all.
                     Do you love music? Do its sounds dwell often in your ears, and do you murmur to
                     yourself aloud, or in your mind, the notes that have pleased you?"
                  "Oh very often! and some I listen to make my eyes fill and my blood run
                     cold."
                  "A shudder and a quivering of the spine!" cried Ernestin exultingly. "You have
                     it! You are the blessedest creature! To-morrow, at once, you must take lessons!
                     I shall add what will purchase you a fine instrument. It must be so, Joanna!
                     for my own delight. I shall have such joy to think you are in the same paradise
                     where I shall wander, though we do not meet!"
                  There was no opposing this enthusiasm. Joanna for answer looked in his expanded
                     face, with tears of gratitude and everlasting affection. Ernestin resumed more
                     calmly.
                  "You see, by me, you have a new madness to acquire. But take care; don't let it
                     absorb the rest, like Aaron's rod. It is very apt to. Your studies first,
                     always," he added seriously. "They may make of youâ€”I hope a great woman. They
                     will at all events make of you a wise one,â€”which music will not. It polishes
                     the soul, instructs the heart, but only aids the understanding, and that
                     chiefly as respects the other arts. Every year, Joanna, you will receive of me
                     a like sum, by order on my banker; and if I die"â€”
                  "I shall have no need of money."
                  "Ah, you must forgive me in turn," said Ernestin, quickly; "I was sorry for the
                     words before they were out. I forgot your broken cast, and black forebodings.
                     My play, you have so honored me by learning, gives you for me a lesson there
                     also. I had almost forgot it. Repeat for me, Joanna dear, the opening of Scene
                     the Second in the first Act,â€”Icilia's words; and let them be our last. Our fears"â€” He pressed Joanna's hands in both his own; and with a
                     tremor of her superb voice, caused by the thought of their immediate
                     separation, Joanna began: 
                        
                           "Our fears, I have heard my brother"â€”
                        
                      She could no more. The words, "And let them be our last," rang in her
                     ears, and shut out other sounds.
                  "Never mind," said Ernestin. "You know the lesson I would give you. You will
                     remember it when you are at home."
                  "Perhaps," said Joanna timidly, yet with a beating heart, "you would be kind
                     enough to repeat it to me." Poor Joanna! It was the criminal at the scaffold,
                     deferring by last words the final moment.
                  Ernestin recited, in a firm and impressive voice, the passage, holding both
                     Joanna's hands. 
                        
                           "Our fears, I have heard my brother say, Virginia,
                           Make omens for us, and our heart's own hue
                           Gives accidental color to these things,
                           Which in themselves are nothing. Not but Jove,
                           In matters which concern the general weal,
                           May give us warnings, which his augurs gather,
                           From the dread thunder, or from birds and beasts,
                           But that each atom of the mighty mass
                           Should for its pettiest movements need, or, needing,
                           Receive celestial guidance, staggers sense,
                           And blasphemously littles the great gods above us.
                        
                      Be that your monitor, Joanna, nor think me of enough importance for Heaven
                     to fright you by my falling bust. And nowâ€” Shall I ring?"
                  
                  "Oh, not yet! One little moment longer! Will you part with me thus?"
                  "What would you have, Joanna?"
                  With a look of melancholy wistfulness, that could not be mistaken, Joanna fell
                     upon his neck. And Ernestinâ€”who shall blame him? putting his arm about her
                     pliant waist, pressed her to his heart in silence for a brief interval, while
                     Joanna wept. Presently, he said, in a soft voice, "Now, now, Joanna!" He raised
                     her head; the lips Joanna would have died to touch with her own were laid to
                     her burning cheek. Slowly then, with a lingering and anxious look, while Joanna
                     turned ghastly pale, and large tears trickled painfully and singly from the
                     eyes which answered his with such a gaze (I mean, in expression) as the dying
                     fix upon the faces they best love, Ernestin drew down the veil upon her bonnet,
                     arranged its heavy folds so as best to hide her, pressed her again one moment
                     in his embrace,â€”and the bell was rung.
                  "I have a coach," said Joanna, in a voice utterly broken. "I took it at the
                     stand."
                  "It was wisely done. Leave it at the same place, Joanna, and take, in some
                     other quarter, another for Chelsea." The servant entered.
                  "Does the carriage for this lady wait?"
                  "I will see, Excellency."
                  "You need not return. I will conduct the lady, myself."
                  After the door had been closed a few moments, "Joanna," said Ernestin, taking
                     her hand, "I have yet a word to say to you. There is a mode of consolation
                     which perhaps you would not expect to learn from me. It isâ€”prayer. I know not,
                     Joannaâ€”no one can knowâ€”I but hope it, as others doâ€”that our prayers at all
                     times reach the ear of our Divine Father; but this I know, we never pray
                     sincerely, with the same directness of purpose and undivided zeal which we
                     apply to our interests and our passions, that we do not have the answer
                     immediate in our own souls, soothed when in anguish, counseled when in
                     difficulty, elevated when men crush us to the earth by want of sympathy. Prayer
                     is Jacob's ladder whose top is in Heaven; and the angels on it, that ascend and
                     re-descend, are the impulses of our hearts. Be these but clean, their wings are
                     never folded, and forever white.â€”This consolation too I have tried, Joanna,
                     and, believe me, it has never failed."
                  "I will pray to Heaven," said Joanna, through her veil. "And in my prayers"â€”
                     Her voice was choked with stifled sobs.
                  â€”"My name will be remembered, as yours shall ever be in mine. Come, my sister."
                     And he led her forth.

               BOOK THE FOURTH.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  THE EVIL IMPULSE.
                  "Wo, wo! ever, for ever!" "Cursed be the day when I was born! cursed be the
                     breath I breathed! Cursed be the womb that bare me and the paps that gave me
                     suck!" "Wo, wo! ever, for ever!"
                  "Fools that ye are, why not rather curse the cause of your breath, the hand
                     that formed the womb to bear ye, and made the paps to give ye nourishment that
                     you might grow complete to suffer? But ye bring to this place of your doom,
                     where fear is futile and hope makes high the heart in vain, the fears and hopes
                     that sunk and raised you in your viler home, and dare not curse, lest your woes
                     be aggravated, and for the hopes that tell you (perhaps not falsely for the
                     first time) that your doom is not eternal. But I, who have no hope, and who
                     tread beneath me fear, I, the accursed eternally, will curse for ye."
                  So spake the Archfiend, as, surging upward from the fire-ocean whose waves
                     heaved after him in vain, he listened to the sounds of agony and despair that,
                     in various tongues of the earth, rose confused and broken, yet terribly
                     distinct (could aught to him be terrible), through the smoke and thundering
                     flame,â€”listened, not with satisfactionâ€”his wo had nothing similar to
                     theirs,â€”but with scorn scarce utterable.
                  Beside him, yet behind, acres of human measurement apart, reluctant rose his
                     coadjutor, almost his compeer, shrewd confidant of plans that seemed to him but
                     aimless, and of a vengeance with whose shaftless malice he had little sympathy.
                     Unwilling to retire, yet dreading for himself what might be Heaven's notice of
                     his leader's blasphemy, albeit through countless ages he had heard the like
                     without a consequence, he listened with mingled apprehension and contempt to
                     execrations and invectives whose terribleness no human conscience may consider,
                     as no human hand would dare to lend them adequate expression. Surrounding
                     nature seemed to share in his disquietude. The vexed clouds battled together,
                     as if to smother the sound of the Archfiend's blasphemy. The wind roared like
                     gathered thunders. Thunder rolled ten thousand times as loud as that in Earth's
                     atmosphere; and the lightning which rent the veil of darkness that had now
                     gathered all around, complete and black, which nothing could penetrateâ€”save
                     where the bodies of the Hell-god and his companion gave out their immortal
                     though diminished lustre,â€”blazed with its immense and seemingly solid flashes
                     like the fires in the hell they had left behind them. The lesser fiend
                     trembled, and bent his pinions slanting to the wind, which threatened to beat
                     him backward; and his hand upraised before his eyes seemed meant to shield them
                     from a light he was well used to, and a fire which by his nature had no power
                     to consume him. But Satan spread his field-wide vans in scorn of the blast,
                     which rushed against the timber of their nerves yet bent them not; his eyes
                     flashed fire as in emulation of the lightning; and while he sneered with scorn he could not
                     utter, he stretched out his lifted arm to its length, and shouted, in a voice
                     that outroared the thunders and seemed to make them still:
                  "Fret, ye formless spirits, that are instruments of Him his creatures call
                     Almighty! Part of the elements whereof I am compounded, ye have no power over
                     me. I spit at and defy you, and hate you for that ye do His bidding. Would that
                     I might grasp you, wind and fire, wherever ye rage, all your accursed power in
                     one mass, and hurl it, with one effort, against all the universe of worlds that
                     dread you though you bless them, and consume them all in one wide
                     conflagration, or mix them up in one vast chaos of decay!"
                  He paused, as if expecting to be answered; but the elements brought to his ear
                     no angry voice, only the sullen echoes of their fury, as they ceased to clash
                     together.
                  "Despised?" he cried: "Worse than hated! more fearful than to be opposed! But I
                     have still the power to hurt, if not the ministers of His will, at least His
                     creatures, and can convert, on their account, indifference into solicitude, and
                     make disdain to cease, if it be in danger. Let it come! If it might blast me, I
                     would more than welcome it. How say'st thou?" And he turned askance to his
                     companion. "Men call thee Beelzebub, and say thou art the Prince of Liars. Thou
                     canst not give true counsel then. But, liars in their own affairs, how can they
                     speak the truth of thee? How say'st? Were 't well to welcome annihilation,
                     could it overtake us? No! by Hell our place of exile, and by Heaven our home of
                     right! that were to make our hatred but despair and change revenge into
                     submission. To do is something still. What though we labor in the doing, our
                     foes find not their ease. Onward! downward! See!"
                  One flapping of the mighty pinions,â€”a steady, gliding, but inconceivably rapid
                     movement given by that impulse,â€”another flapping of the pinions,â€”once more the
                     equal motion, as of a vessel under the steady-blowing Trades,â€”and the
                     Hell-bird, followed in scarce equal flight, came near enough to the atmosphere
                     of Earth for his impaired yet still angelic vision, and hovering over the
                     peninsula of Spain, pointed downward with outstretched forefinger, long and
                     rigid as the couched lance of some paladin of old, where, in the lists of
                     Aspramont or Roncesval, Orlando justed with his peers, before high-seated
                     Charles.
                  "See!" he said once more, in tones that were as thunder, yet in the ears of his
                     attendant and compeer were as a whisper,â€”deep, and full of import, yet a
                     whisper still,â€”"See!" The finger pointed steadily, the head looked downward nor
                     turned a moment back.
                  His follower looked in the same direction, and saw, in a little town in a hilly
                     land, a house beside a highway, which wound among the hills above it and below.
                     A knot of people stood in and about the door, and seemed busied with a carriage
                     which was just about to startâ€”for the postillions were mounted,â€”while another
                     carriage was already traveling at a brisk rate down the road.
                  "Seest thou yon petty structure?" said the Archfiend. "Among the habitations
                     which those tiny creatures raise, 'tis called an inn; a place where stop they
                     on their travel to and fro. Those smaller bodies with the four-footed beings
                     yoked to them are, thou knowest, their vehicles in their petty space. Look
                     where that group converse together. There is but one among the whole whose spirit is capable of any good, yet
                     it is that spirit which I make my instrument of evil. That slender
                     figure,â€”slender among those around, and you see how much more marked,â€”it is
                     excellent, nay lofty of its kind,â€”that figure I have, through its moving
                     spirit, lured from place to place, till here; and now, thou seestâ€”mark! the
                     hands are folded, as imploring, but not more so than the face. Better done!
                     they drop, and offer gold. But that fool who is about to mount the carriage
                     shakes his head, and points before him to the other vehicle. There are no
                     horses left: yet must the slender figure on. It must keep up with that carriage
                     in advance; I have made it think so: and it has rested neither night nor day,
                     to near it even now. It shall on; for I so will it. Mark again."
                  Satan paused; and that very instant the head of a man of gentle mien is put out
                     at the carriage-window; and the next, the slender and distinguished figure is
                     seen thanking with almost frantic gestures of gratitude both the man in the
                     vehicle and the traveler still on foot, who helps it to ascend behind the
                     carriage, and places at its feet its small valise. Then with a nod to the
                     innkeeper, amid the waving of the hands or hats of the group about the inn, who
                     all appear well-pleased, the traveler ascends to the box of the vehicle, the
                     postillions whip their steeds, and, at a full gallop, the carriage is whirled
                     after the other which is before it on the road.
                  "Ha!" cried the Archfiend, and turned short round to his companion; on whose
                     motionless visage he seemed to read surprise, perhaps contempt. "What!" he
                     added, as his terrific eyes rested on the eyes of the humbler Spirit, and, as
                     these latter dropped their lids, seemed to pierce through their moony curtains:
                     "Thou thinkest it a small thing, and perhaps unmeet for me, what I have done.
                     So shallow spirits ever judge the actions of the deeper! Behind that carriage
                     goes the destiny which rules the spirit of Heaven's favorite, and rules it to
                     destroy. Where is his guardian now?"
                  With a burst of scorn,â€”it was not like a human laugh,â€”the Fallen Archangel,
                     fallen still lower now in the thoughts of his compeer, threw up his right arm
                     triumphant and defyingly toward the farther skies, asâ€”with limbs downstretched
                     aslant, and wings that spread their vans enormous far o'er the viewless ether,
                     giving it color by their dusky contrast, and depth by their eminent reliefâ€”he
                     darted upward like the flame of his own Hell, bound it might be to other
                     worlds, the angel of despair and evil there, as to the Earth.
                  But far beyond his narrowed ken, far up in the boundless ether, floated the
                     better angel that watched and through Heaven's impulse counteracted his
                     designs; and as, with intuition of his purpose and with prescience of the
                     issue, he gazed pensively upon the vehicle that bore on Earth the fortunes of
                     the mortal who interested his benevolence, the gentle Spirit sighed profoundly,
                     but sighing said, within himself, what men in their expression term Amen! and a smile celestial threw its rosy light over the saddened
                     visage and mingled with its mournfulness, yet changed it not,â€”as on Earth the
                     sunshine glitters in the drops of April rain; even so, Amen and Amen! for this
                     is Heaven as it is the Earth, where joy is the bright reflex of sorrow, the
                     light and heat that, to be truly seen and felt, need temporary obscuration and
                     partial abatement; such being the will of Him by whose mysterious forecast the
                     sorrowfulest tragedy that Earth bewails has its blest consequence, in either
                     the prevention of a present evil or the production of a future good.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE BARRANCA.
                  THE carriages that bore the ambassador and his suite were on the way to
                     Zaragoza. The Minister and the Secretary were alone, Lord George having gone
                     upon the box at Mallen, taking with him his gaily-mounted sabre, and left the
                     front seat to the silent occupancy of two cases of pistols belonging to
                     Ernestin and Buckhurst. The two other attachÃ©s and the Minister's private secretary were in the coach
                     that followed.
                  There was silence unbroken for many minutes in the foremost vehicle.
                     Fitzherbert, since Lord George had left them, appeared to be wrapt in some
                     sober if not sombre meditation, and Buckhurst was examining the desolate
                     country through the open windows. Suddenly the former, without lifting his
                     head, said gravely,
                  "Buckhurst, have you ever thought of being married?"
                  And Buckhurst answered with corresponding gravity, "No, never seriously."
                  "And what then has prevented you?" resumed Ernestin, in the same tone,â€”his eyes
                     still pensively fixed upon the seat before him, whose inanimate burden had
                     started in his mind the train of ideas he is about to pursue in colloquy.
                  "I know not," answered the Secretary. "Perhaps it was disinclination; perhaps"â€”
                     He paused.
                  "Distrust?" said Ernestin, now looking up, and looking in his face.
                  The Secretary returned the look; was it with surprise? or rather, as I think,
                     with commiseration and regret? for he knew enough of the ambassador's past
                     history to conjecture from the question what was passing in his mind, and his
                     own affectionate and noble nature, encouraged by Fitzherbert's kindred temper,
                     had rendered him already warmly attached to his principal,â€”but, as the very
                     consequence of that nobleness of disposition, with an attachment tempered by a
                     deep respect for Ernestin's romantic yet sagacious spirit, that no occasion and
                     no familiarity could tempt him to transcend. Buckhurst, then, looked at
                     Ernestin seriously, while his fine eyes, with their loving but manly regard,
                     asked for explanation.
                  "Distrust," repeated Ernestin, once more facing the pistol-cases. "It is, with
                     every thoughtful man who has much observation and a certain share of experience
                     with the sex, it is the poisonous medicine which counteracts the sweet venom of
                     every amorous passion; counteracts it and prevents its maddening effect, but
                     does not work a cure. It is the impediment which makes men ponder ere they
                     marry. Prominent on the very edge of the gulf they are about to leap, perhaps
                     for life, it stops them on the run, and gives them time to view the depth and
                     breadth and obscure bottom of the chasm, and more than all the broken and
                     crumbly edge of the opposite side which seems to forbid all retrogression."
                     Ernestin pauses a moment, his keen eyes bent upon the rosewood case, as if he
                     saw in its keyhole the abyss he was depicting. "Oh," he continued, "to feel
                     that we may wed the body but cannot yoke the mind! to know that the arms that clasp us may
                     indeed be ours, but the heart! the eyes!"â€” He paused, and the tuft of hair that
                     jutted beneath his under lip buried itself in the arching beard of the
                     upper.
                  Buckhurst waited a few moments, then replied:
                  "But surely this is but a class of women: the virtuous are not thus false?"
                  "No, but the virtuous are thus weak: else the truly virtuous man would have no
                     trouble but to find his kindâ€”which however would be quite enough for him,"
                     added the speaker, while the arch of hair, that had seemed to descend before,
                     now rose at either corner of the mocking lip. "No, my dear Buckhurst, look
                     about you anywhere, among any women; and what do you find? The habit of the
                     virgin, whose hourly thought has been to win, whose paradise has been the daily
                     triumph of her charms, is not laid aside, not easily ever, by the matron. Men,
                     some men, strip off some habits like a glove; women rarely if ever can divest
                     themselves of theirs, particularly when pleasant. The bride is at the altar;
                     her eyes are for her lord, or on the earth: the next week they are yours, if
                     you wish, or if you don't wishâ€”especially as you are a fine man, which makes
                     the conquest precious,â€”though where conquest is the object, the invader takes
                     up small towns as well as capitals. I see you think me wicked," said Ernestin,
                     with a faint smile that was a very sad one; "they who talk unreservedly must
                     often seem so. Yet the covered body is sometimes more indecently exposed than
                     is the nude.â€” I mean not however to charge these fair Napoleons with even
                     meditated sin. Their sole object is to conquer. But you know that they who
                     stride from victory to victory, though they may begin in righteousness, that
                     is, within the bounds of what is recognized as lawful attack, come at last to
                     trample under them their early scruples, and often end in downright crime."
                  "But"â€”interposed the Secretary.
                  "Well?" said Ernestin, with the same sad smile.
                  "You do not mean to involve all women in this charge of frailty, or of
                     indiscretion?"
                  "No, Heaven forbid!" said Ernestin. "Heaven does forbid!" he added low, his
                     eyes filling, as he thought of the dead. "I have knownâ€”I have seen, where I
                     have not knownâ€”women who were incapable of such a folly, of such a sin, as I do
                     think it; and they were neither humpbacked nor pockmarked."
                  Buckhurst smiled. "You think then," he said, "that a man's best chance, who
                     wants to keep his wife's looks to himself, is to have her such a one as nobody
                     but himself will look at?"
                  "I do indeed; particularly if he be a handsome fellow, when he may have so much
                     of it, that she will prevent him from looking at any body else."46
                  
                  "Well, chacun Ã  son tour. But really and
                     seriously?"
                  "Really and seriously, Buckhurst, a man like myself has no business to think of
                     marrying, because he has before his eyes ever a preconceived image of
                     excellence, which in this world he has no right to hope to attain. And yetâ€”I
                     have seen such." He paused a moment. "I have seen," he resumed, "two married
                     women who were essentially virtuous, as they were excellently beautiful. They
                     were young, and one of them but newly married. Neither of them solicited
                     admiration. Yetâ€”one of them tempted me, and the other, God help me! I tempted."
                     Ernestin drew breath with difficulty. "It seems to me," he said, "the air is
                     very hot. But no!" he added the next minute, with a proud impatience, "that is
                     hypocrisy: I am heated; but it is
                     not for the air. I will tell you, Buckhurst. Look at me, and do not think me
                     worse for what I shall say." He laid his hand on Buckhurst's, who, clasping it
                     in both his own, looked back upon him with his serene, but now dimmed eyes,
                     with a look that said, "Say what you will, you cannot change my affection or my
                     esteem." And indeed the imprudent frankness, which would have made a meaner
                     nature sneer, only added to the admiration and the friendship with which this
                     real gentleman regarded him who indulged in it. But would Ernestin have been so
                     frank, and so imprudent, to a meaner nature?
                  "Poets and artists, Buckhurst, rarely meet with women that are after their own
                     hearts, whose enshrined deities are like the famous statue of the antique time,
                     made up of parts that are found excellent in several women, and then conjoined
                     by careful and long studied combination into one. But I have found a woman
                     excellent in soul and body as poet ever sung or painter drew; and it is, I
                     think, my greatest sin to have so found her; forâ€”I tempted her to love meâ€”and
                     she was married."
                  Buckhurst, whose happiness it had been to lead a life more chaste than
                     Ernestin's, Buckhurst, virtuous like Ernestin, looked aghast.
                  "Do not mistake me, not for a moment," said Fitzherbert. "I tempted her
                     unwittingly, lured by self-deceit, and by a dangerous habit similar to that I
                     have just condemned in women; I mean not in motive,â€”for theirs is lust of
                     conquest, and mine was but the idolatry of beauty, and the rapture perhaps of
                     voluptuousness. This woman, I say, was virtuous,â€”O innocent, I do believe it, I
                     swear it, as a girlâ€”a girl just in her teens! Yet this woman has for me
                     abandoned her husband; and for me, who have shunned her, and will shun her,
                     Buckhurst, to save us both from ruin," (Buckhurst looked relieved, looked
                     grateful, noble fellow!) "for me lives in voluntary widowhood. Yet she lives
                     not wretched; for her whole existence is changed, and, I thank God, her
                     knowledge of me, if it has resulted in the madness of passion, has not debased
                     but has exalted her, and made angelic qualities that were by nature noble." His
                     listener looked surprised, while more than pleased. "I cannot tell you more,"
                     said Ernestin. "What I have said is egotistical enough, but I have said it in
                     illustration of what I maintain to be the greatest moral danger that men or
                     women have to contend with in civilized life, which is, the fascination of, on
                     one side, the eyes of a married woman, tenfold powerful that she is so married,
                     and on the other the admiration of a man directed to that woman, and the more
                     valued that it renews for her the triumphs of her virgin days. I say there is
                     no certainty of safety, save in eschewing the temptation altogether; since,
                     though in ten thousand cases it results in nothing serious, the
                     ten-thousandth-and-one is followed by remorse and ruin, or, as with me, by
                     heartsickness and unavailing regret. Half of my soul I have left behind in
                     London."
                  "Will you pardon me?" said the Secretary, in a tone respectful, yet that
                     betrayed surprise.
                  "What is it you would say?" asked Ernestin, pensively smiling.
                  "I did not dreamâ€” But, forgive me; I have no right"â€” He stopped
                     embarrassed.
                  "Say Fitzherbert then; and you will have. Let us forget the
                     dignity of office till we reach Madrid."
                  "Will you forgive me then, Fitzherbert?" resumed the Secretary, who really
                     seemed to get on all the more smoothly for this stepping-stone to confidence:
                     "I thought that Lady De Coucyâ€” But
                     no! I really have not earned the right"â€” Buckhurst blushed like a young girl.
                     And Ernestin liked him all the better.
                  "If it take time to earn it, you have not indeed the right to talk with me on
                     such a theme; but if to deserve it wins it, you have had it long ago; and it is
                     tendered to you now, over and over again. Use it, I pray you, freely. There is
                     nothing you may not ask me, or that I will not answer unreservedly, so far as
                     it involves no other than myself. What of Lady De Coucy?"
                  "Only I had thought that your remark had reference to her."
                  "You found it applicable then?"
                  "On the contrary, I may safely say I never met a woman to whom it would be less
                     so."
                  "Very true; none to whom it would be less applicable. Yet she is a
                     woman, young, lovely, fond of admiration; and I confess to you that when I
                     dwelt with most delight upon the hope of making her my own, I thought with
                     dread on the cravings of her vanity, on her indifference to me which would not
                     lessen, and on the disparity in our ages which the lapse of a few years would
                     make remarkable. Can you wonder then, that when that box"â€”pointing to the seat
                     before him â€” brought before me your generous courtesy, Monsieur d'Aubusson, and
                     the Rue de la Paix, I should turn for relief
                     to an image where vanity had not shut up the heart's approaches, where love had
                     grown to passion, to idolatry, to madness, and the difference of years but
                     added reverence, that made devotion awe, and idolatry a heart-worship of the
                     soul as well as form? Yet, Buckhurst, where I find the ideal excellence of the
                     passion which divides with ambition ever the poet's heart, that very
                     imageâ€”alas! the devotion it reminds me of, so flattering to my self-love,
                     furnishes, even in the very ground it gives for confidence, a new argument for
                     distrust."
                  "Butâ€”if you will not think me presumingâ€”are you quite sure of Lady De Coucy's
                     indifference? Surely that quarrelâ€”I would say, the scene in the Rue de la Paix, might happen any where."
                  "Yet be no lover's quarrel after all, as you suppose it. But it was not that. I
                     had too many evidences of her disregard for me, if notâ€”I may say it to you,
                     Buckhurstâ€”of her slight appreciation, shown in a want of deference, and at
                     times in actual disrespect, if not contempt. That scene was but the natural
                     catastrophe."
                  "She must have greatly changed," said Buckhurst eagerly: "for I declare to you
                     my perfect conviction that as a man you hold the very highest place in her
                     esteem. Nay, now I rememberâ€”O, I am sure you are mistaken! very sure!â€”her
                     manner when she spoke of you, and the first tones of her voiceâ€”though then, not
                     knowing a cause, I did not put the same construction on itâ€”convince me
                     that"â€”Buckhurst stopped in confusion, conscious of his imprudence.
                  "You are right," said Ernestin, who, despite himself, had listened in a kind of
                     fascination; "such reminiscences can do no good.â€” For Heaven's sake, my dear,
                     dear Buckhurst, never again indulge me in such a theme." He pressed the
                     Secretary's hand, then added: "Let us pass to another actor in the scene. What
                     has become of your friend, Monsieur d'Aubusson?
                  "I was about to tell you. I met him in Paris. He was about to make a tour in
                     this country. And, by the by, as he was to start the very same day with
                     ourselves, and take the same route, he is either behind us or before us now. It can hardly be otherwise
                     than that you should meet in Madrid. I could only wish it were as friends; for
                     I like him much."
                  "If we meet as enemies, it will be his own fault, Buckhurst; my temper set
                     still sooner than my arm. But you must pardon me, if I express surprise that
                     there should be any common feeling between you, who are so unlike."
                  "Why really D'Aubusson is not a bad fellow. His faults are French, as are his
                     virtues. He is gallant, generous, and if somewhat presumptuous in his pride of
                     rank, he is really not ill-natured."
                  "Yet he openly laughed at a misfortune he should have had the delicacy to
                     appear not to notice; and when punished for his insolence (excuse me,) sought
                     to wash out his disgrace in my blood."
                  "Might not anger and his very pride of courage have made him insensible to the
                     criminality of an act which the world about him are used to commend? And am I
                     wrong in believing that a heedless and dissipated young man might give such a
                     provocation, without?â€” No, I fear I cannot find a palliation now for what I
                     condemned at first."
                  "No, my dear Buckhurst, because, as then, you looked into your heart. Nor do I
                     fear you will misinterpret me, if I say I think that the Viscount's habits as a
                     duelist had quite as much to do with his intent to kill me, as his anger which,
                     in a man of proper feelings, should under the circumstances have cooled.
                     However, what you say of the customs of society in Paris is certainly just, and
                     also what you began to plead in behalf of his thoughtlessness. He is young; and
                     I have seen myself men who were quite as insolent, yet the world called them
                     good-natured. Surface itself, the world contents itself with surface, which
                     even at times imposes upon men like you and me. Still, if we meet"â€”
                  He was interrupted by the report of pistols fired twice in quick succession and
                     seemingly near. The instant after, a voice in Spanish, on Buckhurst's side of
                     the coach, cried Halt! and, almost in the same moment, the voice of Lord George
                     upon the box, "Banditti!" and the coach stopped.
                  Ernestin put his head out at the window. "The Viscount himself!" he exclaimed.
                     He snatched eagerly his pistols, threw open the door, and sprung out, as did
                     Buckhurst simultaneously on the other side.
                  A sentinel, who had been placed on the road by the bandits, now advanced from
                     the head of the horses where he held his carbine at the first postillion, and
                     leveled at Buckhurst, but was met by the latter's bullet, which struck him
                     almost ere the Secretary had touched the ground. The whole party, in both the
                     coaches, including the young noble with his sabre, and the servants, who were
                     all armed, hurried after their leaders.
                  Before them, in a barranca, or broken hollow
                     in the road, made by the repeated washings of the mountain torrents in time of
                     rain, a carriage was seen, overturned. Two or three men were lying flat on the
                     ground with their faces down, and guarded at the time when Ernestin first
                     descried the scene by three others with leveled carbines, who now, on the
                     approach of the ambassador's party, turned them towards these, while at the
                     same time a fourth and fifth crept out of the coach, which they had probably
                     been searching. On foot, struggling hand to hand with a bandit, who was trying
                     to rescue his carbine from the grasp of the Frenchman, stood the Viscount. His
                     pistols were on the ground beside him, and, near by, a man writhing in the
                     agonies of death bore bloody witness of their service. At the moment Ernestin beheld him from the
                     carriage, a second ruffian, who had probably been deterred from shooting the
                     brave but rash Frenchman by fear of killing his own fellow, was shifting his
                     carbine in his hands so as to knock the former in the head with the but-end,
                     but, as Ernestin ran up, he turned it again, leveled it at the new assailant,
                     and fired. At that moment, some person rushed between, was struck by the ball
                     that would otherwise have reached its mark, and fell.
                  Without stopping to look, Fitzherbert made up to the Viscount and put his
                     pistol to the head of his adversary, who immediately relaxed his hold of the
                     carbine and faced about, only to receive in his throat the shot that had been
                     aimed at his head. At the same instant the young attachÃ©, with a blow of his sabre, brought down the brigand who
                     had fired at Ernestin; and the rest of the party achieved an easy victory over
                     the remainder of the gang.
                  Monsieur d'Aubusson, now at liberty, immediately recognized Fitzherbert, and
                     throwing his arms about him embraced him, exclaiming, "Ah, my dear enemy, how
                     much I owe you!"
                  "Nothing now," said Ernestin, with a smile, while, transferring his pistols to
                     a servant, he offered his right hand, which the Viscount took eagerly in both
                     his own: "I hope our accounts are fully balanced,"â€”alluding to the language
                     that had passed between them after the duel.
                  "But do you know," said the Frenchman with great animation, as he shook
                     repeatedly the hand he still enclosed, "that I meant to kill you? Had I done
                     so, I should this day have lost my own life. It was surely some good angel that
                     blew that leaf in my face!"
                  Ernestin turned round to look for the man who had run between him and the
                     shotâ€”and saw an object that made all others vanish.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  THE BLOOD-OFFERING.
                  RESTING on the left hip, and on the arm of the same side, his body propped by
                     coach-cushions, which Fitzherbert's secretaryâ€”the same who moved by the
                     entreaties and the appearance of the youth had suffered him to get behind the
                     carriageâ€”was arranging under his shoulders, lay the young man, so seeming, who
                     had fallen. His knees were raised and pressed together, and his feet drawn up a
                     little under him, (a position of constraint,) and as he leaned on the elbow of
                     the left arm so the hand of the same pressed a handkerchief to his right
                     breast, to stop the blood which oozed over it between his fingers, while his
                     eyes were turned on Ernestin with a fixed look wherein delight and tenderness
                     had left no room for agony, and had triumphed over all fear of death.
                  Such a look! And in that face divine, which he had recognized without it!
                     Ernestin had but one thought, if thought it were, and not rather one sensation,
                     of an agony scarce endurable. Dropping on one knee, he put his left arm under
                     the shoulders of the wounded person, and taking in his own the hand that was
                     disengaged, exclaimed:
                  "Oh Joanna! What have you done?"
                  Overcome by that voice, and by the tones of that voice, which expressed all she
                     could have wished at such a moment
                     ment, Joanna could not for the instant speak, but put his hand to her lips, and
                     kissed it passionately.
                  "Do not be angry!" she said at length: "I could not help it!"
                  "Angry? And my life"â€” Ernestin could say no more; for he saw Joanna's blood no
                     longer oozing but flowing fast, and he knew from the throbbing of her hand the
                     cause, which was in him.
                  Pale as death, his teeth set together in the desperateness of the energy he was
                     obliged to summon to his aid, he withdrew his arm gently from under her. There
                     lay beside him a felt hat which had belonged to one of the brigands. Rapidly
                     untwisting the many yards of ribbon which surrounded spirally the conical
                     crown, and tearing off the wide brim, which he bent and compressed together,
                     Ernestin lifted tenderly the beautiful fingers which were all dabbled with the
                     warm blood, and laying the felt upon the gory handkerchief, bound it down upon
                     the wound with the ribbon, which he passed under and over Joanna's shoulders,
                     while Joanna spoke not, but kept her eyes upon his face with a melancholy smile
                     that had he seen it would have rendered him incapable, for it said what was in
                     her thoughts,â€”It is of no use! Calling then aloud to Buckhurst,
                     Ernestin, lifting his eyes, saw one of his carriages moving off, while the
                     Viscount's, now righted, was about to follow it; and with them went all his
                     retinue, the Viscount's servants, and the prisoners, leaving, besides
                     Buckhurst, the young noble and the Frenchman, only the postillions for his own
                     equipage,â€”and these were already in the saddle; and, at the same time, seeing
                     the three gentlemen standing aloof, he knew to whose delicacy and forethought
                     he was again indebted.
                  "Dear Buckhurst!" said Ernestin, as his friend approached proached and received
                     in return for his look of sympathy that expression of gratitude in
                     Fitzherbert's eyes which the latter's lips could not utter.â€” "Will you have the
                     carriage made ready?" And as he spoke, he rose from his knee and put his arms
                     about Joanna, to lift her.
                  But Buckhurst hastened to tell him he had sent to Alagon, which was but a
                     little way off, for a litter, and a surgeon if one could be had there, and had
                     ordered one of the men to post with all speed to Zaragoza for surer aid.
                  "O my friend!" said Ernestin; then, turning to Joanna, "There are you see,
                     Joanna, some others in the world besides yourself, that think of others than
                     themselves. You shall live to know such."â€” And now Ernestin saw the smile,
                     which again passed over Joanna's face; and a pang, like that which seized him
                     when starting from her last slumber his dying sister Agnes called out to him by
                     name, held him a moment breathless. "Let us not wait for the litter!" he then
                     exclaimed. "Joanna, you can bear the motion of the carriage? I will hold you
                     all the way."
                  "And to be so held," said Joanna, elevated above pride and feminine shame by
                     her condition, her eyes still looking into his as if thence alone she drew her
                     life, "To be so held, it were such happiness! But I should not live through it;
                     and the litter will be but my bier. Oh, that look of sorrow! Should I not wish
                     to die? For what should I live for, when it would be but to see it changed to
                     distress and shame, if not to anger?"
                  "No, no, no! no anger! Oh, believe me!"
                  "Yes, to anger," she repeated firmly, yet gently, with a tone full of
                     mournfulness and of respect. "Yes, to anger; for it would be just. I have
                     comeâ€”and let all know it"â€” She
                     withdrew her hand from Ernestin's, and beckoned to Lord George and the Viscount
                     to approach. When they were within hearing, "I would have them," she said,
                     still addressing Ernestin, on whom again she turned her gaze, regardless of all
                     else, and as she spoke putting her hand again into his, "I would have them bear
                     witness to your innocence. I have come in defiance of your commands, in
                     violation of my own solemn promise; I have come to you who are guiltless of all
                     blame with me; and yet I come not guilty; for God has urged me hither, that I
                     might save you, for whom I would die this death a thousand times and find it
                     blissful."
                  The boy's cap which Joanna had worn had fallen from her beautiful head, and
                     they had not replaced it; for the sun had set behind the mountains, and the
                     shadows of evening were over all the scene. Gazing on her in his speechless
                     anguish, Ernestin's eyes, even in that moment, glanced upon her hair, whose
                     mutilated state could not but arrest his vision; and a new spasm convulsed his
                     features. Joanna observed it, and divined the cause. "See!" she said, drawing
                     from her bosom a mass of hair of extraordinary length and of as rare beauty.
                     "It cost me more pain to cut it off, than all else; for I knew you admired it.
                     Keep it for my sake. It is wet with the blood I shed, oh how willingly! for
                     you."
                  They held the tress between them, and Ernestin's tears fell, drop by drop, upon
                     it, and mingled with the gore.
                  "Do not weep," said the dying woman, looking into his eyes with such ineffable
                     tenderness that even the Viscount's bosom thrilled, and Buckhurst almost
                     gasped, while Lord George, affecting to dally with the knot of his sabre as he
                     leaned over it, wept like a girl. "Do not weep; for I am now so happy! dying as
                     I wished to die, and like," she added, with the smile of an angel, "your
                        princess in the play." Ernestin looked up to Heaven with the
                     expression of the LaocoÃ¶n, and his bearded lip quivered convulsively.
                  Joanna followed with her own the uplifted eyes, and when they fell again she
                     saw him put the bloody tresses to his lips and then place them in his bosom.
                     But still he spoke not, but as he closed his vest looked down the road toward
                     Zaragoza, and clenched his hand with a gesture of anguish and despair.
                  "Think not of that," said Joanna: "I am past all human aid. Only speak to me,
                     and as you forgive me tell me, tell me for the first time, thatâ€”that you love
                     me!" He took her hand again; he pressed it. "Let me hear it from your lips,
                     before I die."
                  The Viscount looked surprised that Ernestin should hesitate, and his eyes which
                     sought the Secretary's, but in vain, turned again on Ernestin with something
                     like indignation.
                  But even in this dreadful trial did not Ernestin's love of truth desert him.
                     "Joanna," he said, with deep emotion, "I never have ceased to love where I once
                     have loved; and as I most sincerely believe that I once did love you, it cannot
                     be that the agony I feel now is only that of remorse, or pity, or gratitude,
                     deep as are they all. I do, Joanna, on my soul, I do believe, that with such
                     love as I dare love you, I do love you now, and shall ever while I have
                     memory!" She looked so grateful, and her large heifer-like eyes, with their
                     long black side-lashes, swam in this suffering hour (if indeed she did or could
                     then suffer) in a flood of such bewitching passionâ€”looking into his own, as if
                     they would have gazed there ever and never closed from satiety or wearinessâ€”he
                     could not help adding with still deeper feeling,â€”it was the artist, the poet,
                     the man that spoke, not the lover of
                     Agnes: "And this, O believe, Joanna! had you been single, and had our lots been
                     cast in equal spheres, I had loved you, I feel it, beautiful and heroic and
                     devoted as you are, with a passion that no other ever equaled save your
                     own."
                  With a cry, that was not a shriekâ€”for it was of joy, yet was loud and sharp,
                     she threw her arms about his neck; and the warm blood gushed out violently from
                     her wound. "Kiss me thenâ€”quickly!" she murmured. Ernestin pressed his lips to
                     her forehead, to her cheeks. "Not so!"â€”and the beautiful mouth turned to his.
                     Ernestin's met it. And thus, her arms about his neck, her lips glued to his,
                     with a spasm in which the agony of pleasure seemed to be more than of pain,
                     Joanna expired. And when Buckhurst, seeing all was over, sought gently to
                     replace her on the cushion, he scarcely could unlock her arms.
                  Ernestin looked down upon the beautiful, the majestic face, and large tears,
                     like the big drops of a coming shower, fell singly over it.
                  The Viscount, with a feeling that was not common to him, and a delicacy he was
                     not thought to possess, put his arm gently in Fitzherbert's, and without a word
                     led him away.
                  "This world," said Ernestin, speaking, after a moment, as if to himself, and
                     without raising his head, "This world surpasses our comprehension!"
                  The Frenchman understood him not. But the o'er-looking angel did, and pitied
                     him; and the Creator heard, and forgave him.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  THE DEAD MODEL.
                  IN one of the better chambers of the inn at Alagon, lay, on a low couch, the
                     body of Joanna. The attendants, talking rather indecorously, yet in the low
                     tone which is involuntary in all such scenes, were lighting the candles they
                     had just disposed at the head and feet of the couch, when Ernestin entered.
                     Looking on the body a moment, and seeing that all was as decent as might be
                     expected, he drew from his pocket a small sketch-book and a pencil, and
                     indicating thus, and by words, his object to the people, put money into the
                     hand of one of them, and desired them to keep him from all intrusion.
                  Extinguishing the two candles at the foot, that they might not interfere with
                     his purpose, the slave of beauty and servant of love knelt on one knee before
                     the body, and resting his tablets on the other, proceeded to trace the mortal
                     image of the immortal spirit which hovered round him. His face was almost as
                     colorless as his now quiet model's; but his hand shook not, his spirit did not
                     falter.
                  The sketch was finished. He looked around him. He was still alone. Stooping
                     over the body, he put his lips reverently to the cold forehead that was so
                     majestic, and the closed eyelids under whose grand arches lay the large orbs
                     whose light had set for ever. A convulsive motion heaved Ernestin's breast as he marked the still
                     touching beauty of their form, and the length of the black lashes which
                     glistened under the tremulous flame of the candles, and whose silky softness he
                     seemed to feel upon his lips. Suddenly he observes the end of a narrow black
                     ribbon, which, in moving the body, had worked itself from under the collar of
                     the shirt and lay almost concealed in the tie of the silk cravat which the poor
                     girl wore in her disguise. Ernestin hesitated; but, summoning up resolution, as
                     he thought that something might be attached to the ribbon that ought not to
                     remain with the people of the house, and preferring besides to retain it
                     himself if of no consequence, he lifted reverently, with a look as if he
                     deprecated Joanna's anger, the tie of the cravat, and finding the knot of the
                     ribbon under the button of the collar, gently raised the string, though with a
                     shudder that crept over his whole frame like the chill of an ague. A paper,
                     folded two or three times in a square form, and tied about with the same
                     ribbon, rose from her bosom; and as he felt it, along the string, touch the
                     dead fleshâ€”the flesh of Joannaâ€”her breast, who had died for him,â€”it seemed to
                     him an act almost like murder, and a positive sacrilege, though so necessary.
                     The paper was still moist and glued together with her innocent blood. Softly
                     undoing the knot, he slid the ribbon from her neck, though not without the same
                     frightful mental effort and the same sad sense of profanation. With a trembling
                     hand he lifted the edge of the little packet. Can it be? He turns down the
                     corner as far as he may without undoing the packet; and the fact is manifest.
                     It was his own sketch of the Venus of Arles, which the poor
                     creature had taken with her and treasured thus, because it was something of his
                     hand and she had nothing else. He remembered he had missed the sketch, but, as
                     it was of no value, and supposing he had placed it somewhere without observing
                     what he did,â€”a habit with his papers which often gave him serious trouble, had
                     thought of it no more.
                  It was impossible to resist such evidence of deep affection; the more, that it
                     reminded him of his buried sisters; and Ernestin, the man, burst into a
                     passionate flood of tears.
                  This burst of sorrow, of remorse, of admiration, of re-awakened love, relieved
                     his overcharged breast, and kissing the paper and the ribbon,â€”which he put
                     about his own neck and under his vest, where their ensanguined surface touched
                     and adhered to the blood-soaked tresses which were there laid, a more precious
                     but not truer memorial of exalted passion and devotion unto death,â€”Fitzherbert
                     sunk upon his knees, even where he stood, before the corpseâ€”over which his
                     clasped hands were extendedâ€”and thus addressed the All-seeing but Unseen:
                  "Parent Omnipotent, Who didst give this woman her deep passions, as Thou didst
                     me my sense of beauty and proneness to affection, look on us both, on her the
                     victim, and on me the sacrificer! Oh, if Thou givest to her spirit another life
                     for that she offered freely here, let it be glorious and happy in recompense of
                     her rare unselfishness and her excelling magnanimity, forgiving unto her the
                     one sad error of her life whereto my folly, my wickedness, mine only, led her,
                     and visiting on me, on me whose soul is sprinkled with her innocent blood,
                     which nothing shall wipe off"â€”
                  He was thus far in this human prayerâ€”human, because, as must ever be with man,
                     it forgot the necessarily immutable essence of the Only Perfect to assign to
                     Him the impulsive nature of humanity,â€”he was thus far, when he heard a door slowly open, and, as
                     instinctively he paused, a solemn voice behind him say in Latin, "My son, thou
                     dost well to pray."
                  Springing to his feet, his devotion and his remorse all gone in shame and
                     indignation, he was about to make an angry reply, when he saw in the speaker a
                     priest of no ordinary appearance; noble, sad, respectfully reserved, yet
                     paternal withal,â€”in short, so unlike in all respects to the usual run of his
                     profession, that Ernestin, looking on him but a brief moment, said in
                     Castilian, "Father, hast thou ever known passion?"
                  "My son!" said the priest; and from under his majestic brows darted a fire, as
                     if of lightning, and of as short duration. Turning, and walking closer to the
                     body, he added, "That should have been a most beautiful woman." And he waited,
                     looking but not asking for reply.
                  "Father," said Ernestin, with his usual ready confidence, but speaking in his
                     very deepest tones, with an accent that seemed to redouble the priest's air of
                     respectâ€”the respect which a noble nature always renders to its kind, "Father,
                     had not that woman died to save my life, I had broken her heart by the very
                     virtue, through forgetfulness of which I won it."
                  "My son," said the priest, "thou hast need to pray. I leave thee."
                  "No," said Fitzherbert, in another tone, "the emotion is past. Let us hence,
                     and talk of the funeral.â€” Is it like?" he added, extending his sketch-book, as
                     he saw the priest's eye rest on it a moment, but not intently.
                  The priest looked from the body to Ernestin, and from Ernestin to the body in
                     grave surprise. He might well; for, kneeling before the corpse, the artist-poet
                     had, in his strange nature, given it life. The lips breathed; the large eyes
                     looked on the priest, and seemed to appeal tenderly against his shut heart. It
                     was Joanna Bradley, leaning from her window in the mean house in Chelsea.
                  "I understand thee now," said the padre,
                     returning the book with a deep reverence; and they turned to go.
                  Signor Ambassador," he added with a mien that had fit a prince, "I am the
                     curate of this place. To-night your excellency shall lodge with me. Perhaps
                     between the artist and the priest, the Englishman and the Catholic, there will
                     be found more congeniality than you as yet imagine."
                  That night Ernestin lodged with the curate; and the next day, before Joanna was
                     committed to her lone and long rest, a letter went by express from the curate
                     (who was no mean person) to the highest prelate in Spain; and the ambassador,
                     on his presentation at Madrid, was received with a distinction and a warmth of
                     friendly favor that for a long time put at fault even his practiced
                     penetration.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER V.
                  A YEAR. ANOTHER. AND ANOTHER.
                  IT is a year since the death of Joanna. In the interval, Ernestin has found
                     again, that good success, like evil, comes not single. The same turn in the
                     tide of his affairs which had borne him on from one desired port to another, in
                     his voyage of life, until it had brought him to the final haven of his
                     ambition, had not deserted him, but had floated him safely over the sunken
                     rocks which in that perilous harbor had threatened for a moment to shiver him
                     to pieces. With his official dispatches, the ambassador had received a friendly
                     letter from the premier, in which his grace, after remonstrating with him,
                     though gently, on the "excessive frankness and impetuosity" of his disposition,
                     addressed him thus:
                  "You will receive these hints I know in good part, my dear Fitzherbert, when I
                     venture to assure you, with your own frankness, that my surprise is only less
                     than my satisfaction that you are not utterly ruined, and that I have not been
                     obliged to consent to your recall. You must have made some powerful friends in
                     Madrid, besides Buckhurst and my boy,â€”who make you out a very Scipio, with the
                     amorous complexion of CÃ¦sar, or, if you like it better, a Bayard with the
                        bonnes fortunes of Henri Quatre. Buckhurst
                     indeed forwarded for publication an indignant article which was very
                     seasonable, (you will find it marked among your papers;) but that calm yet
                     eloquent letter in the Madrid paper, which the editor announced as from an
                     ecclesiastic 'not more eminent for his birth than for his virtues and excellent
                     talents,' did more, saving one peculiar homemade article, than all else to
                     silence the calumnies of the opposition, who, truth to say, were making a most
                     formidable missile of your unlucky story. The piece I last refer to will not
                     fail to attract your notice and interest you profoundly. How the name of that
                     ill-fated woman should have transpired and her romantic history, it is not
                     difficult to conjecture, but it surpasses my experience at least to conceive of
                     a person so generous as her sister, who comes out so publicly with her own
                     signature,â€”and more, it would seem, to justify you than Joanna, though all the
                     while condemning you as the innocent cause of the woman's misfortunes. If that
                     poor creature, who Buckhurst says was a 'miracle of beauty,' had the
                     magnanimity and the truthfulness of this Mary Ledyard, in addition to the high
                     qualities the latter in her simple narrative assigns her, she had a patent of
                     nobility from Nature that would have justified an attachment much more serious
                     than yours would appear to have been. However, since this explanation, our
                     enemies have been contented to sneer at you as a 'poetical Joseph;' a character
                     by the by which I am well contented with in the guardian of my boy. But, my
                     dear Fitzherbert, if you are so given to amativeness, be more discreet in
                     future, and, where you are at least, let it serve some purpose. In certain
                     circles, you might find it a potent aid to your diplomacy; but then it must be
                     of that kind, which plays round the head, but comes not nigh the
                     heart. No ambassador can with safety fall in love; but he may swim at his
                     pleasure on a perfect flood of intrigues, provided he keep his head out of water and his heart firm. If you
                     have a proneness to sinking, Heaven help you! I can not."
                  It is a year since the death of Joanna. The bloodstained tress is ever before
                     Fitzherbert's eyes, the dying voice is sounding in his ears. At festivals, in
                     the social circle, a sweet face, full of majesty, rises up before him, eyes
                     whose mournful tenderness no terms can picture turn on him their wistful gaze,
                     and a mouth perfect and sad as some sculptured deity's woos his first and only
                     kiss. A cold thrill runs over his face, it stirs the scalp under his hair, and
                     runs along the marrow of his spine; his eyes are dimmed with sudden tears,â€”he
                     casts them down; and when he dares look up, so profoundly sorrowful is their
                     look, so pale is his hollow cheek, and when he speaks so transient and
                     constrained his smile, that the Briton inspires sympathy even in a heartless
                     and dissipated court, and beauty is tenfold eager to attract the glance that
                     shuns her, or that meets her lures unshaken. But in vain. The arrows of her
                     archery glance from his heart as it were polished steel, nor even thrill his
                     nerves. The Duke's warning was not needed; and his unscrupulous adviceâ€”which
                     was more serious than it seemed, did not even awaken indignation, as it failed
                     to provoke a smile. Ernestin Fitzherbert was stricken to the soul.
                  In business alone he found distraction if not forgetfulness. But its toil and
                     its confinement did not lessen the frightful effect which the new shock he had
                     suffered had had upon his shattered nerves; and the ambassador would have sunk
                     under his office but for the friendship of Buckhurst and of the curate, in one
                     particular of whose romantic story he had found something similar to his
                     own,â€”to wit, in the tragic catastrophe, owing to which he had resigned to a
                     younger brother the advantages of high rank, and taken the vows of a priest,
                     and, refusing the honors even of the church, had confined himself forever to
                     his humble curacy. In this kindred spirit's society and in that of Buckhurst,
                     Ernestin, if he did not recruit his strength, found yet a resting-spot where
                     his disease stood still.
                  It is another year since the death of Joanna. In the interval, Ernestin has
                     heard of the decease by apoplexy of his once dear friend, De Coucy. It excites
                     regret; nothing more; and thoughts on the widowhood of Agnes only flush his sad
                     cheek. It is another year since the death of Joanna. Ernestin's smile is more
                     frequent, and less brief; and if the habit of his long melancholy has given a
                     permanent expression of mournfulness to his eyes, the haggardness of grief has
                     vanished, and his face, though still pale, is pensive, but not gloomy. Yet not
                     forgotten are the blood-soaked tresses, still float those wistful eyes before
                     his vision, still rings that dying voice in his ears. Night and day they call
                     to him, appeal to him, remind him of his debt for life so rescued; and he
                     starts up from his troubled slumber which is rarely sleep, to shake off the
                     visionary arms which stifle him, to tear his lips gasping from the kiss that
                     stops his breath, to put his hand to his burning chest and find it is not
                     wetted with the warm blood gushing from that breast shot through for him. His
                     old complaint is frightfully aggravated. His feet tingle, his limbs at times
                     are partially numb, his fingers are subject to painful spasms, there is often a
                     singing noise in his ears; black specks like winged insects float before his
                     eyes, rising and falling, and seeming to depart, yet ever there between them
                     and the light; and the least exertion of steady thought, or the most trivial
                     excitement, drives the blood to his brain as if it would burst its arteries.
                     Ernestin is physically little more than the wreck of himself. Yet his constitution is elastic; hope never dies
                     in his poetic heart; and time is the true physician, as the sure consoler.
                  It is the third year since the death of Joanna. In the interval his old
                     antagonist D'Aubusson has married the eldest sister of his old love Agnes, and
                     he learns, with a slight sensation of pleasure, the Viscount's intention to
                     travel and perhaps revisit Spain; for Ernestin had admired Gertrude
                     Elphinstone, whose face and manner he had justly thought betokened intelligence
                     and nobleness; and she was Agnes' sister, which was always something. But the
                     pleasure was but transient, the excitement only momentary, and when the pain
                     which followed it was over, his mind subsided into the melancholy which had now
                     become its settled habit.
                  He has serious thoughts of resigning the embassy, and returning to England by
                     sea, in hopes of benefit from the voyage; but attached to his mission, whose
                     functions he discharged to the satisfaction alike of his sovereign and of the
                     court to which he was accredited, he resolved to try first a change of
                     scene.
                  Under ordinary circumstances, the hospitality of the Castilian nobles had left
                     nothing to be desired in this respect; but every thing that was Spanish served,
                     or he fancied so, to keep before him the frightful picture of Joanna's
                     sacrifice, and the tortured day-dreamer thought to find relief beyond the
                     peninsula. So, leaving Buckhurst in charge of the embassy, Ernestin set out for
                     Italy, taking with him, by consent of the Duke,â€”who was glad of an opportunity
                     so advantageous for his son,â€”the young Lord George.
                  The change was indeed salutary. The artist was awakened; the instructor
                     everywhere found themes for eloquent discourse, for lessons in moral and
                     political science, for pleasing and improving disquisition in the fields of
                     history and letters; and, drawing from his stores of buried erudition to enrich
                     the mind of a pupil who seemed to love him with at once the fond reverence of
                     an affectionate son and the personal attachment of an admiring friend,
                     Fitzherbert found himself diverted, soothed, and, becoming partially restored,
                     was at intervals almost happy.
                  But who may avert his destiny,â€”I mean the consequences which inevitably follow,
                     at however long a distance, a certain course of conduct?
                  In Florence, at the French Minister's, the tourist met one evening Monsieur
                     d'Aubusson and his lady, together with a sister of the former, the widow of a
                     German baron, still young, and of considerable personal attractions. Madame
                     d'Aubusson he found to be, as he expected, a thorough lady, elegant in mind and
                     manners; and after the first excitement was over he conversed with her with
                     much satisfaction; but, though Agnes was continually in his thoughts, her name
                     was not once mentioned. With the gay and handsome Frenchwoman, who was witty
                     without ill-nature and well-informed without pedantry, Ernestin was equally
                     charmed, and his spirit, roused by her easy and vivacious talk, resumed almost
                     its former animation; but though she pleased his mind, and satisfied his eye,
                     she did not touch his heart.
                  The Viscount had watched them narrowly; and when the Baroness, whose figure,
                     tall and elegant, was well calculated for motion, had walked apart with Lord
                     George, looking after her a moment and then on Ernestin, whose eyes he saw
                     follow her form with simple admiration, he said, with a delightful
                     frankness:
                  "I had hopes you would like my sister; for I know you would agree, and she has a pretty fortune.
                     But I think I know a lady who will move you more."
                  Fitzherbert took his hand. "I thank you," he said, "for your good intentions;
                     but really, 
                        by
                        my
                      dear Viscount, you forget I am no more a wooer."
                  "Save of renown? We shall see." And he exchanged smiles with Madame d'Aubusson.
                     "To-morrow will you honor us?" Therewith the Viscountess explaining the
                     invitation as one to dinner, and naming the hour, the few select guests they
                     expected and the Palazzo where they resided, the ambassador accepted.
                  What was it made his heart flutter and his temples throb, as he sat silent in
                     his carriage, while Lord George beside him talked incessantly of "that charming
                        Baronne," as they were driven back to the
                     Lung'Arno? Was it the smile he had seen exchanged between the Viscount and
                     Madame d'Aubusson? Or was it the readiness with which his old habits of a
                     dramatist and romancer made him weave a plot upon the slightest circumstances
                     and with the smallest probable incident? At all events he passed a miserable
                     night, and rose the next day to deem himself a fool, to deplore the morbid
                     excitability of his system, and to meditate long and tenderlyâ€”not on Agnes, but
                     Joanna.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  AT LAST!
                  WHOEVER had seen Fitzherbert, as he took his last look at the mirror, before
                     going to the Viscount's, would have said, "That man has never known happiness,
                     or has found it but a cheat," so melancholyâ€”sweet, not bitter, was his smile,
                     as he glanced from his forehead with its now sparse hairs, to his hollow eyes
                     and sunken cheeks. His forehead, it is true, was scarcely wrinkled; and his
                     wavy beard and sinuous hair, which was still thick on the temples, had lost
                     none of their beauty, or if at all streaked with gray it was too little to be
                     detected in an ordinary light; but the top and middle of the back of the head
                     were now quite bare, and his extreme emaciation had drawn two visible furrows
                     on either side of the face from the eyes and nostrils, which heightened (or
                     lowered) the mournfulness of his visage into a severity augmented still farther
                     by the downward sweep of his mustashes. The youth of the man was gone for
                     ever.
                  But was it this which made him smile so mournfully? No; he was thinking of the
                     night some years now gone, when, in an humbler chamber, with two wax-candles
                     before a toilet-glass, instead of the half-dozen which now blazed on either
                     side of both the gigantic mirrors in his luxuriously furnished dressing-room,
                     he had spent a full hour in endeavoring to make himself fit for the eyes of
                     Agnes, who did not see him after
                     all. He is then again expecting to behold her! Will he again be disappointed?
                     It will not vex him now.
                  Deadly pale, with limbs that trembled under him, and spirits so deject and
                     still, that, contrasted with his usual animation in times past, they seemed in
                     stupor,â€”yet pallid, weak and quiet-sad not from mental agitation and
                     heart-sickness, but from absolute nervous exhaustion and the partial torpor
                     that comes from long unrest,â€”he entered with his young companion the rooms of
                     the Viscount. Agnes was not there; not then: and Ernestin again smiled, as at
                     his toilet. He missed the Baroness, but made no remark. But just before the
                     dinner was announced, she entered the reception-room; and in the small and
                     slight figure beside her, dressed in half-mourning, Fitzherbert saw the widow
                     of De Coucy.
                  And now when he was formally introduced as "His Excellency, Mr. Fitzherbert,"
                     to her as "Lady De Coucy," though Agnes was visibly agitated, turning redder
                     than the damask rose, and then again more pale than its white sister, a feeling
                     of mockery came over Ernestin, that stilled the flutter of his heart, and drove
                     back the blood that was slowly mounting to his own cheek. He thought, in that
                     one instant, of all that he had suffered for the want of those few words. He
                     bowed gravely, and silently, and entered into conversation with the
                     Baroness.
                  On going to the dining-room, Ernestin gave his arm to Madame d'Aubusson; and at
                     the table he listened chiefly to the lively talk of the Frenchwoman, who,
                     seated next him, rallied him upon his silence. Only once he looked at Agnes,
                     who was on the other side of the table, but not directly opposite. She was
                     regarding him without trouble, yet thoughtfully, with a pale cheek and a look
                     of sorrow row, as if she remarked the change in his appearance; and when their
                     eyes met she did not turn away her own directly, but for a moment fixed them
                     upon his with a melancholy tenderness, that, far surer than their beauty, went
                     direct to Ernestin's sad heart. What was it kept him silent? It was not in his
                     nature to cherish resentment, and he had long since avowed he had no cause. Did
                     he fear to speak? Madame d'Aubusson thought so, and felt, moreover, for her
                     sister's sake their first words should not be exchanged before strangers.
                     Accordingly she so managed, that at last, during the evening, Fitzherbert found
                     himself near Agnes with no one by but the Viscount and herself.
                  He approached, and took the chair beside Agnes.
                  Agnes looked up from a medallion she was examiningâ€”a profile head in miniature
                     of Alfieri, and turning very pale appeared for a moment to be about to rise,
                     but sat still, and regarding him with a look half thoughtful and half smiling,
                     which seemed at once a welcome and a reproach, blushed deeply, appearing under
                     the wax-lights transcendently beautiful.
                  "After so many years of waiting," (Ernestin was about to say "Miss Agnes," but
                     checked himself and changed the phrase,)â€”"it is permitted me to make the
                     acquaintance of Miss Agnes Elphinstone as Lady De Coucy. It is an honor I had
                     ceased to anticipate."
                  "Your excellency"â€” What was it made Agnes stop, as if suffocated, and tears
                     gather in her beautiful eyes? Was it the change in their relations, which these
                     titles intimated? or the reserve, the coldness of Fitzherbert's tone, as well
                     as the frigid formality of his manner? Gertrude drew the Viscount aside; and,
                     walking carelessly to the end of the room, they contrived to disappear. And so long was Agnes' pause, that this
                     movement was effected ere she recommenced, not unconscious of the relief:
                  "Your excellency would once have said pleasure."
                  It was the own sweet voice of Agnes, mellowed by a soul that Ernestin had once
                     felt was all that was wanting to it, and made touching by an emotion that
                     needed no faltering voice to betray it, for it was read in the appealing, the
                     tenderly reproachful look of her eyes.â€”"Your excellency would once have said
                        pleasure."
                  "It was," said Ernestin, "ere titles had marred my pleasure, or made it
                     unlawful in the society of your ladyship."
                  Agnes actually looked round for the support of her sister and the Viscount,
                     whose absence she had at first found a relief.
                  "Let us join my sister," she said in faltering tones. "I had"â€”a single break;
                     all her spirit has revived: "I had not thought to meet an enemy in Mr.
                     Fitzherbert."
                  "It would be an unjust thought," said Ernestin, not offering his arm,â€”while
                     Agnes stood up before her chair, and he had put back his own; "I cannot be the
                     enemy of Miss Agnes Elphinstone, though I may not hope to be the friend of Lady
                     De Coucy."
                  "And why not, sir?" Agnes made no movement to go.
                  "Because in becoming Lady De Coucy she slighted more than friendship that was
                     shown to Miss Agnes Elphinstone."
                  "Mr. Fitzherbert"â€”began Agnes. But she put her hand to her slender throat, and
                     the minute after added, in another tone, "We will join our friends, if your
                     excellency pleases."
                  She curtsied as she spoke, and Ernestin, bowing, put out his hand to conduct
                     her; but touching hers he stopped, and said, his own voice now faltering for
                     the first time,
                  "Lady De Coucy, this should not be. I would not have you leave me with unkindly
                     thoughts." Agnes' little hand for one moment seemed to be about to be drawn
                     from his; but she let it lie, as he held it loosely in his gloved fingers. "If
                     my reserveâ€”alas, my memory is too faithful to permit me to be cold!â€”offends
                     you, have I any reason to be frank to one"â€”
                  â€”"Who never abused your frankness," said Agnes firmly, while she withdrew her
                     hand.
                  "Miss Agnes," said Ernestin, in the manner of old days, "Miss Agnes
                     Elphinstoneâ€”O, a thousand pardons! But Lady De Coucy has forgotten all that
                     Miss Agnes Elphinstone should have remembered."
                  "Not one wordâ€”not a look. She remembers, and with forgiveness, that Mr.
                     Fitzherbert made no allowance for the levity of youth, had no consideration for
                     the exigencies of her sex; and because she was not her own mistress he has now
                     forgotten all that he once said and looked. I was humble indeed to remind
                     him!"
                  "Let me pray you to sit again one moment," said Ernestin. He put his hand to
                     his head, as he replaced the chair for Agnes,â€”who sat down with a strange
                     humility that softened him and surprised him. "I am not well. Iâ€” Give me leave
                     one minute to recover."
                  "Alas!" said Agnes, in the manner of an old and affectionate friend: "I fear
                     you overwork yourself."
                  "No, the mischief is all done; I have overworked myself. Nature
                     cannot be violated with impunity, even in noble pursuits or in generous
                     emotions.â€” Lady De Coucy, I have a question to put to youâ€”No, it is to Agnes
                     Elphinstone," he said, with his own frankness, while Agnes' eyes blazed with pleasure and her cheeks
                     glowed, "that I must put it. Will you answer it?"
                  "If it be notâ€” But you will not ask any thing it would humiliate me to answer,"
                     said Agnes, with downcast eyes. "I will answer you, Mr. Fitzherbert, with
                     sincerity, ask what you will."
                  "How much," said Ernestin, "you are changed!" He meant, in manner; but as he
                     gazed on her fair face, with the tenderness awakened by his thought, he
                     remarked that the brow had lost none of its ingenuousness, and that the mouth,
                     with its remarkable beauty of color, retained all the innocence and freshness
                     of her virgin days. Thrilling with a sweet, familiar pain, the artist-lover
                     murmured audibly, "It could not be otherwise with De Coucy."
                  Agnes' first sensation was of pleasure at the emotion of his tones; but it
                     yielded to surprise, to vexation; and looking up, she said, with somewhat of
                     offended pride,
                  "I did not expect to be reminded of my obligations to Sir Henry."
                  "Ah, you are not changed!" thought Ernestin: and he replied, gravely,
                  "Your ladyship misunderstands me. What I thought most admirable in the beauty
                     of Miss Agnes Elphinstone was that look of purity, that air of maiden innocence
                     of soul, which (pardon me!) too many of her sex lose after marriage, by
                     communion with the grossness of ours, but which I was sure the unsoiled
                     nobleness of De Coucy could not tarnish in the lady of his choice."
                  Agnes blushed with mingled gratification and displeasure; and the curve of her
                     sweet lip made a higher arch, as she answered, it might be proudly, it might be
                     sarcastically,
                  "Your excellency is a strange complimenter."
                  "Miss Agnes Elphinstone found that out, of old."
                  "But then she knew Mr. Fitzherbert only as an admirer. Since then, she has
                     studied him in his published sentiments; and she must express surprise that one
                     who claims to know so much of nature and of her sex should think over-plain
                     speaking any more acceptable to women than to men." Agnes has risen; and her
                     mien is rather lofty.
                  "It is because," said Ernestin, rising in turn, "I have never taught my heart
                     the wisdom of my head. And then, as now, I hated subterfuge, and could find no
                     excuse for dissimulation in the habits of the sex. My question is answered
                     before I had the madness to put it. I was weak indeed to think you could have
                     changed."
                  "And I," retorted Agnes, now justly indignantâ€”"And I was less than humble to
                     permit in my womanhood Mr. Fitzherbert to renew to me a language that as a
                     girl"â€”
                  She paused; for looking on Ernestin she saw his own resentment was all
                     vanished. He was leaning heavily with both hands on the little marble table
                     between them; so that his eyes were on a level with her own, into which they
                     gazed with a look so wo-begoneâ€”as if his very heart were crushed, that Agnes'
                     really good and loving nature was touched. A moment she hesitated, while tears
                     gathered in her eyes so fast they almost blinded her; but he did not offer to
                     stop her, gazing on her without motion as if he were of one piece with the
                     marble that he leaned upon; and with a swelling heart and a sense of
                     suffocation, Agnes left the room.
                  The infatuated man, the imperfect seeker of perfection, who in the tyranny of
                     his moral predilections would have shaped all characters by a rare though not
                     ideal model, Ernestin, leaning in the same posture, watched the retiring
                     figure, till another form rose up between it and his eyes, and took the same direction,â€”tall,
                     majestic, faultlessly symmetrical. It holds its hand to its side, and its long
                     hair is dabbled with blood. Staggering, he drops into the chair which Agnes had
                     quit, and again mutters audibly, though low. It was but two words:
                        "Joanna!" andâ€”"Avenged!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  BUT TOO LATE.
                  THE horrors of that night to Ernestinâ€”who shall describe them? Let the next day
                     witness to his suffering, when he lay upon his couch unable to move, yet, in
                     the very irritability of his exhaustion, finding his brain too wakeful to bring
                     on the sleep for want of which he seemed to be consuming. To think, was in his
                     situation madness; yet in that situation not to think, was impossible.
                  "There are," said to himself the seeker of the unattainableâ€”"There are natures
                     which are amiable yet with which I cannot agree. Have I not found it so indeed
                     in my mother, one of the most estimable of women, yet whose self-will and
                     spirit of opposition made my affection a source of misery, not comfort?" The
                     thought of home brought up his sisters, in whose docile temper and submissive
                     love he had found ever unalloyed delight; and from that buried portion of his
                     heart he turned to Joanna, gone like them, whose very passion was devotion,
                     whose devotion was idolatry; and he added, with swimming eyes, while his brain
                     appeared to reel under the sorrow yet excitation of these memories: "I have no
                     right to marry. To be wed to Agnes were to become the slave of her beauty, to
                     have my soul subjected to the music of her voice. Was it not so with De Coucy?
                     I should forget thee, Agnes my sister, and thee O Ilda! and thy bloody tokens,
                        poor Joanna, would appeal to me
                     in vain! To live in celibacy is but simple gratitude."
                  He was wrong; wrong in reasoning, wrong in his conclusion. To live in joyless
                     solitude for their sake could not but pain the loving spirits of the dead, were
                     they conscious of the sacrifice; and Agnes De Coucy was not self-willed, had no
                     spirit of opposition which would not yield, as is always the case with women
                     where they truly love, to the requirements of her situation and of her aim to
                     please. His mother was wax in the hands of his more favored brothers.
                  The next day, the Viscount called to see him, hearing he was ill; and in the
                     course of conversation Ernestin learns that Lady De Coucy was likewise
                     indisposed, and kept her room. The lover revives, the philosopher begins to
                     reason more impartially, as we have done; and in illustration of his juster
                     deductions he remembers that his surviving sister, who was quick-tempered and
                     had been rather refractory as a girl, was a submissive and most devoted
                     wife.
                  But with the night and more unrest returns the memory of the walk at Chelsea
                     and the uninvited visit; and when the next day he rises with a burning brain
                     and all the other symptoms of his incurable malady alarmingly aggravated, he
                     resolves to leave Florence immediately,â€”and gives orders to prepare for his
                     departure with the more readiness, that his young companion, who had conceived
                     an imprudent though boyish passion for the Baroness, receives the announcement
                     with evident dissatisfaction.
                  Alone Fitzherbert calls at the Viscount's, and is received by Madame d'Aubusson
                     alone. As he bids farewell, and begs with an ill-assured voice to be remembered
                     to Lady De Coucy, a cloud passes over the noble face of the Viscountess
                     countess; and she said gravely, but without embarrassment,
                  "I pray your excellency to be reseated. Lady De Coucy is indeed unwell; but she
                     desired me, should you call, to let her know. With your permission, I will go
                     myself and inform her."
                  Ernestin, bowing with a flushed cheek, attended the lady to the door of the
                     room, and saw her small but perfect figure disappearâ€”to be replaced after a
                     time by the form of Agnes, and of Agnes alone.
                  She was very pale; and the marks of recent tears were in the inflamed lids and
                     the discolored orbits of her eyes. As Ernestin hurried towards her, she put out
                     her hand; and when taking it lightly he led her to a seat, but stood up
                     himself, she motioned to him to be seated, and waited till he had reluctantly
                     obeyed, before she spoke; and by that time the heart which had throbbed at the
                     sight of her suffering, and at the touch of her slight fingers, was
                     comparatively still.
                  "Will you forgive me? I would not have you go from us in anger."
                  "Forgive you, Missâ€”Lady De Coucy? In anger? I did not know I was offended, or
                     that I had cause to be so; and if I had, I have never in my life borne malice.
                     But the days that are past cannot be recalled." He seemed about to rise.
                  "Mr. Fitzherbert," said Agnes,â€”"pray, do stay! do not fly me, as if you hated
                     me!" There was a tremor in the voice, which, with its old familiar sweetness,
                     had effect on the nerves of Ernestin. He sat still, and grew deadly pale.
                  His silence, and the loneliness, the consciousness that she was making an
                     advance, and the reserve which he
                     assumed to meet it, embarrassed Agnes. She blushed deeply and cast down her
                     eyes; she opened her lips to speak; she stammered; she counted the sticks of
                     her fan: and when at length, recovering, she looked up, and found him regarding
                     her so coldly and so still, she said:
                  "Iâ€” I have asked you to stay. I thought I had much to say to youâ€”butâ€” but I
                     find I have notâ€” that is, I see it would not interest youâ€” for you have
                     forgotten, or you hate me. Do not let me keep you."
                  "Agnes!" said Ernestin in a tone of reproach. Agnes sat still; but the heaving
                     of her bosom spoke her emotion. "No!" he added, in a different tone; "I forget
                     myself. You would but tempt me toâ€”love you, as of old, that you may mock at my
                     bald head and furrowed cheeks." He rose; but as he turned away, he thought he
                     heard a stifled sob. Ernestin stopped,â€”returned. Agnes had both her hands
                     before her face, and her head was bent aside.
                  "Lady De Coucy"â€” he began, in the deep tones he so seldom used, and which Agnes
                     had never before heard. He paused. Over the hands, that hid the face he still
                     could not even think upon without emotion, fell the long bright ringlets he had
                     once so loved; and a darker and grander tress, that was stained and matted with
                     the life-blood shed for him, was all forgotten. But he spoke not.
                  "Let it content you," said Agnes, through her hands, "that you have so humbled
                     me. If in other days I pained you by my caprices, let this be my atonement. Go,
                     sir, and forget it."
                  "Agnes!" said Ernestin.
                  What was there in his now low voice, that more than the simple name, more even
                     than the tremulous touch of his fingers, as, stooping over her, he sought
                     gently to remove her hands, made the hot tears gush from her eyes under her
                     spread palms? She suffered him to take the hand he touched, and Ernestin gazed
                     upon her wet cheeks with a troubled heart. But looking round him to be assured
                     they were alone, he caught the reflected image of himself and Agnes in a
                     mirror; and there was a sudden revulsion of feeling.
                  Raising her without difficulty, he led her unresisting to the glass. "Look!" he
                     said, pointing to the reflection, and bending on her his searching eyes. "As
                     you see me even there, it is not well; and with my hat on, your friends might
                     follow us without derision; but let me lift it up before them, and Agnes
                     Fitzherbert shall blush with shame to think upon the defect it exposes to their
                     sneers."
                  They looked together on the glass. But the contrast was in vain; for he held
                     her hand, and their pulses beat alike together violently and warmly. The man of
                     forty-three was the lover and beloved of the woman of twenty-seven.
                  For a moment thus they stood. Then the unfaded woman turned on the altered man
                     her ingenuous and fair face dyed with the crimson flush of pudency and love,
                     and from her blue eyes, glistening with the tears she had not wiped away, threw
                     on him a look so full of tenderness, almost of passion, the soul of the man
                     shook in him. What made him resist the impulse of his blood? In her virgin days
                     the eyes of Agnes Elphinstone had indeed encountered his, and sought them
                     often; but it was to dazzle, not to touch. Fearless in her innocence, and
                     artless from her perfect purity, the girl had seemed to have no sense to
                     gratify but vanity. Never until now had he seen in them the least approach of
                     that expression which women less virginal and more sophisticate assume at will,
                     and which in Joanna was the
                     involuntary evidence of real passion. Now that it was there in Agnes' eyes, it
                     should have convinced him the emotion was genuine. But the remembrance of the
                     past arose, with its gathered cloud of anger and distrust, before his spirit,
                     and, shivering in its shadow, he said,
                  "Does Lady De Coucy think that years have added to my susceptibility?"
                  Agnes was indeed changed, who, withdrawing her hand, but without displeasure,
                     though her cheek glowed, could answer simply, looking on him sadly with those
                     tearful eyes,
                  "Alas, how much you must have gone through, to warp to suspicion so frank a
                     nature!"
                  "It is a new evidence of what Lady De Coucy will not see in my altered
                     looks."
                  "I see no change," said Agnes solemnly, raised above offence by the very effort
                     she had made to keep down her natural, her just pride, "I see no change that
                     should make you less worthy of the regard of any true woman. And if I did, it
                     would not alter my feelings; for the mirror I have learned to behold you in is
                     not of glass; it reflects the character alone. In your books you have still
                     pleaded to me every day, even when De Coucy's wife, and there I have learned to
                     understand what appeared strange to me as an untutored girl, and to appreciate
                     the romance of a character which was too unlike to all around me to move more
                     than my wonder. Guided by De Coucy's own hand, whose heart was like your own, I
                     have sought to model myself after the examples you presented for me; and if I
                     have not succeeded, as I fear, think it my unaptness, not my fault." Agnes,
                     who, despite of her high purpose and forced resolution, had been growing more
                     and more embarrassed under Ernestin's fixed gaze, which she felt but saw not,
                     here paused and turned very pale. But after a few minutes, which appeared to
                     Ernestin an age, while in amazement and in admiration he drank in her noble
                     words, and felt bewildered, doubting if he were awake or in a blissful dream,
                     she seemed by a new effort to regather resolution, and with a now burning
                     cheek, she added, "I have gone thus far, and will not stop.â€”Mr.
                        Fitzherbertâ€”Ernestin Fitzherbert," (how that sweet voice
                     trembled!)â€”"in other days you wooed me, and, though indirectly, sought as I
                     suppose my hand. Trusting in your high honor and acknowledged generosity that
                     you will not misconceive me, I nowâ€”will tryâ€”Oh, do not mistake me!â€”to offer
                     youâ€”my own."
                  Is Fitzherbert mad? has suspicion indeed warped that once frank and romantic
                     disposition? Or, does he mean to try her? sayingâ€”severely, not
                     disdainfully,
                  "Is it to the ambassador you would offer it? or to Ernestin Fitzherbert?"
                  Again tears stood in the large eyes of Agnes. She turnedâ€”but turned again, and
                     said with humility, "I have not deserved this, sir." Extending her arm to reach
                     a chair, Ernestin drew it towards her; but she did not sit down, but laying her
                     hand on the back for support, trembled visibly.
                  Ernestin was more than touched. But he had still power over himself.
                  "Lady De Coucy will forgive me," he saidâ€”though not without faltering, and not,
                     at first, with undimmed eyes. "Even in my vainest day, I never had confidence
                     in my own pretensions to touch the heart. Remembering then that Miss Agnes
                     Elphinstone was cold to my addresses, even while she permitted them, can I
                     forget that my station and
                     hard-earned renown may serve to gild even the wealth of the widow of De
                     Coucy?"
                  Is this the delicate-minded man? he who carries his consideration for others'
                     feelings to an excess that is often weakness? And is that the indignant beauty
                     of the Rue de la Paix? But Agnes, as a loving
                     woman, is prepared to bear all, to brave all, for her love; and he, who is
                     impulsive as herself, and impetuous, which she is not, has yet in his habitual
                     distrust of women found the source of self-restraint; and he resolves to put
                     her faith beyond a doubt ere he will trust it. But how much these efforts cost
                     them both, you may see in their pale faces, in her quivering lips and in his
                     bloodshot eyes.
                  "You cannot doubt that I am changed," said Agnes in a voice that quivered like
                     her lips, "since I bear with this indignity! But Mr. Fitzherbert shall forgive
                     me in turn"â€”here her voice grows firm, and her eyes look very brightâ€”"when I
                     tell him, that in a social point of view it is I that make the sacrifice, not
                     he!"
                  "And does Lady De Coucy think," said Ernestin, now proudly and indignantly,
                     "that I would wed her wealth? the wealth that has come to her but as the relict
                     of another? Never! were she ten times Agnes Elphinstone!"
                  "But what if she resigns it?"
                  "Say that again," said Ernestin, with flashing eyes, while he leaned forward,
                     and laid his hand upon the chair, beside her own.
                  "What if I resign it?" repeated Agnes quietly. "Know you not that by the will
                     of Sir Henry, if I marry again"â€” Agnes blushed and hesitated notwithstanding
                     the sceneâ€”"the whole of the large fortune, which descending to him from his
                     mother he bequeathed to me, reverts to his own relations?"
                  Ernestin was thunderstruck. "What could tempt De Coucy to a conduct, I must say
                     it, for him so unnatural?"
                  "Inordinate jealousy; the belief"â€” The blush on Agnes' cheeks grew more
                     intense, and spread itself around her eyes, and covered all her forehead. And
                     Ernestin as he saw it, and read into her soul, seemed to burn with an inward
                     fire; and he shook also, as he noticed a like agitation on her part.
                  "The belief that"â€”began Ernestin, in a voice and tone that seemed to search her
                     soul, as his eyes did Agnes felt again through her downcast lids. Her distress
                     was too genuine, too deep.â€”"That you still"â€” Agnes stirred as if she would
                     interrupt him; but there was no need; he durst not trust himself: and pausing
                     to recover, he added in a more assured tone,â€”but the expression was deeply
                     pathetic, "And could De Coucy?â€”and to me?â€” Alas! that the love that should
                     exalt even a vulgar soul, should bring down one so noble! But I will not sin,
                     thou once generous spirit, by speaking harshly of thy memory! Rest in peace. I
                     might, alas, have been"â€” He was about to say, "as mean," gazing with a
                     delicious trouble on the lovely face which now bent down before him was seen in
                     that fascinating point of view which recalled his early passion; but he
                     instantly added, and with some disdain: "No, never! He must have been worked
                     upon, by the selfish and unprincipled, by those who were to profit by it!"
                  "Doubt it not, sir," said Agnes; "for he loved you well. I know it." Agnes
                     sobbed.
                  There was silence, for a moment. Ernestin's head was as if on fire. He felt the
                     danger, terrible, imminent; but fate appeared to drive him on, in the guise of
                     passion; for Agnes' heart beat so loud that it was audible, and she clung with both hands to the
                     arm-chair to support herself.
                  "And you have determined toâ€”to disregard his will?" said Ernestin.
                  "I have done it," answered the widow gravely. She paused. "Mr. Fitzherbertâ€”
                     No,â€”Ernestinâ€” Ernestin Fitzherbert," she added firmly and with dignity, yet
                     looking him in the face with a gentle and submissive tenderness that could not
                     be doubted; "you have taught me in your absence to be like yourself. I will
                     speak as yourself. I have, for your sake, lately declined title, rank, wealth,
                     love evenâ€”for I believe he loved me wellâ€”he must have, who would take me
                     knowing the conditions,â€”in a man your junior, admired and respected by all, and
                     loved by those who know him best. I will not betray him,â€”you would not have me"
                     (as Ernestin looked on her with a pleased eye,)â€”"by naming him: but he is a
                     relative of Monsieur d'Aubusson, and you may, without inquiry as to his name,
                     ascertain the truth. But you cannot doubt me," she added with something of the
                     pride of former days. Then, in another tone, her noble eyes again suffused, but
                     not now averted, she continued: "O Mr. Fitzherbert, do not trifle with your own
                     happiness! Forget in me the foolish girl, that yet perhaps"â€”(a little, a very
                     little hesitation)â€”"had more regard for you than you supposed, and see in me
                     only the reasonable woman, whom yourself have helped to form, devoted as were
                     your sisters, reverent and obedient as should be your daughter, and who now
                     gives you the best security for her faith in that she has learned to despise
                     equivocation, and to fear as well as hate dissembling and concealment." Oh,
                     with what admiration! with what veneration he regards her! He does not doubt
                     her now. He weighs no more her words; he reads her love in her eyes, in her
                     cheeks, in her voice, in her hands, in every motion of her body, in the very
                     tresses of her sunny hair, which seemed to be agitated by the same sweet
                     impulse, as, caressing the soft cheek whose blushes they could not hide, they
                     appealed unto the artist's sense of harmony, and recalled to the lover the
                     feelings of his better days. He speaks not, but leaning on the marble table
                     under the mirror, even as he had done at the close of the former interview, he
                     gazes steadily in her eyes as then, but ah, with how different an expression!
                     while his cheek reddens and grows pale by turns in a singular manner. Agnes
                     sees the unmistakable regard, the admirer, the lover, the adorer, all restored,
                     and with tenfold fondness for the long estrangement, and with a more absolute
                     respect. She sees it; and putting her left hand on her bosom as if to hush its
                     tumultuous but happy beating, she adds with an air of submissive fondness,
                     while her sweet eyes fall:
                  "As for you I have rejected, cheerfully, rank and wealth, and am ready to
                     resign without regret my present independence, so now"â€” The widow lifts her
                     eyes; with how subdued, yet happy a look! and with what a winning air of
                     confidence, frank at once yet diffident! Ernestin speaks not yet, but seems
                     lost in voluptuousness, drinking in with all his soul the sweet tones of her
                     low musical voice, which are not the less delicious that they are not firm.
                     â€”"So now, with the same feelingsâ€”which you will not misconstrue! with which, to
                     convince you of my sincerity, I have forgotten the reserve of my sex, if not
                     modesty itselfâ€”so nowâ€”I will do more."â€”
                  "And that?" He puts his hands to his head, to the forepart and to the back,â€”as
                     it were holding it between them;
                     there is an unnatural fire in his eye, as in his cheek,â€”which appears swollen;
                     and he speaks quickly, as if he feared he should not finish. "And that?"
                  "There," said Agnes, shudderingâ€”not at what she saw, but with the intense
                     excitement of her own purpose, and the violence of her own effort. As she
                     speaks, she draws from the fourth finger of her left hand, but with such
                     agitation her slender fingers could scarce perform their office, a plain gold
                     ring, and lays it reverently on the table. Then extending her right hand to
                     Fitzherbert, she adds with a pensive smile, while her face is very pale: "It is
                     done. It is my hand, Ernestin Fitzherbert."
                  "I take it, Agnes my beloved! But it is too late."
                  Ere the words had left his lips, almost ere his fingers had compressed her own,
                     he fell forward. Agnes, with a faint cry, put out her arms to save him; but her
                     fragile form, unable to support his weight, sunk under it into the chair, her
                     arms still outspread to aid him, and striking the corner of the marble table
                     the body of Ernestin fell across her feet.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  THE TRANSLATION.
                  DOWN into the silent room where in the chair lay Agnes, unconscious of her
                     misery, and across her feet the slave of beauty, reasonable (as he had deemed)
                     too late, floated the unseen angel. A moment he stooped over the body as its
                     last breath was expired, then sought the home of the sisters in that brighter
                     world which dimly, in the vision of the night, the sorrowing poet, whose
                     Heart's Longing was not to know fruition, had been permitted to behold.
                  In the lap of the eldest, while the second, with an arm about her waist, knelt
                     beside her, sat another sister yet a child, but of transcendent beauty, far
                     beyond their own, and which the generous pair loved therefore only more, gazing
                     on it with ever new delight and wonder. They were teaching it in low tones
                     infantine fables of a noble moral, to amuse it usefully, while in another room
                     remote lay their common mother suffering once more a mother's throes.
                  Into that room of happy pain passed still unseen the loving angel, and hovering
                     over the new-born babe, which was a male, breathed into its little lips; and
                     when the lovely sisters, called to the room, received in their arms the callow
                     infantâ€”which opened without bewilderment its bright eyes upon them, and upon
                     the little one clinging in
                     tongueless wonder to their robes, and gazed boldly round the room, with a vigor
                     and intelligence singular in a feeble babeâ€”they knew not that it was their
                     brother ERNESTIN, who, translated like themselves, was now to be their junior
                     and receive in turn, at their hands, the watchful tenderness which on Earth he
                     had bestowed on them, while the love of her who had been Joanna was to centre
                     on him with all its earthly ardor, but purified from passion by their new
                     relationship, and more ennobling unto both by reason of the better aptitude of
                     their more perfected natures.

            NOTES.
            [1] p. 46.â€”â€”except it be rigidly excluded by the nature of the
               composition.] And even then, they must be capable of great self-denial, or thorough
               artists, to make the sacrifice. Thus, Milton has deformed his solemn poem to gratify
               this propension.
            [2] p. 51.â€”â€”at half a crown a day.] This is not sarcasm. Though my
               story is in the main a fiction, such traits as these are naked facts, as any author
               that has been or is obscure well knows. For example, take a work that has employed
               its writer incessantly for six months. In six months are of working-days one hundred
               and eighty-two and a half,â€”"for Sunday shines no Sabbath-day for him;" which at half
               a crown per diem give Â¥22, 16s., 3d.; which is
               considered good pay for so much labor, for such a hand.

            [4] p. 56.â€”â€”and Socratesâ€”if his ugliness had not forced him to confine
               his professional idolatry of beauty to the men.] Socrates was originally a sculptor.
               Pausanias mentions his statues of the Graces which stood before the entrance of the
               Acropolis, and which were draped (en estheti). This
               might have been according to his philosophical and moral idea of the GratiÃ¦ decentes (if the anachronism of the quibble may be
               excused), or perhaps the consequence of his inability to make them naked, though the
               historian declares that all of the ancient personifications of the Graces, both
               painting and sculpture, were clothed, and he does not know what induced later artists
               to change the costume (to sxema autais.â€”BÅ“ot. xxxv.
                  ed. Kuhnii, 1696). The reason is found
               in the insufficiency of the artists. The first who could venture, in the
               consciousness of power, to represent them naked would be copied, strictly or with
               modifications, by all succeeding ones; and drapery, whatever its propriety and its
               necessity in certain cases, is in all ages the refuge of unskillful or of indolent
               artists, while, in the infancy of art in all countries, the idea of a representation
               of the nude would not easily occur. And, if I mistake not, facts will confirm this
               opinion. However, I have little doubt that Socrates' love for Alcibiades arose from
               the habit of his early art, which had made beauty unto him a necessity. All men that
               love it greatly, as the artist and the poet can alone love it, are, if you do not
               take into account the desire of the senses, the slaves of its fascination as much in
               men as in women.
            [5] p. 63.â€”â€”habits prompt unconsciously, like simple instincts.] Hence,
               in this life, habit makes our great punishmentâ€”and our lasting reward.
            [6] p. 84.â€”â€”while Ernestin's writings were conspicuous for the
               practical view they took of life, his conduct was as simple and apparently as wayward
               as a child's.] A contradiction of thought and action which I have had occasion often
               to observe in authors; so much so, that I am inclined to think, that out of twenty of
               this class who shall happen to be very sentimental and delicate, abounding in
               admiration of virtue and religion, in panegyric of the softer sex at the expense of
               their own, and pictures of extravagant self-denial and heroic generosity, nineteen
               will be found in actual life to be the very antipodes of what ordinary readers would
               suppose them. And a critic sees this in the inconsistency of their characters,â€”who
               become good from bad, benevolent from hard-hearted, and so on, at the mere occasion
               of the writer,â€”and in the impertinency of their incidents, which cohere together only
               because they are in one book; mistakes against nature that are unavoidable,â€”for the
               spirit of truth is not in the writers, and falsehood, as the proverb tells us, should
               have a good memory not to fall into self-betrayal. When I hear therefore, that * * *
               * * is an infidel, and * * * * * a debauchee, discover from his own confession that *
               * * * * is meanly avaricious, and find * * * * * * * make public avowal though
               without consciousness, of a shameless ingratitude and of sordid covetousness, and
               display, in a vain attempt at sarcasm casm, an utter want of probity and an innate
               vulgarity of nature, I am not surprised,â€”for their writings have prepared me for such
               developments by the inconsistency of their ethics and their hypocritical parade of
               sentiment.
            [7] p. 97.â€”â€”I am positive it never does.] Nor does solitude, or any
               change of circumstance and condition whatever, unteach him anything which nature has
               not perfectly prepared him to unlearn. Such absurdities, as a man innately and
               habitually selfish becoming disinterested and benevolent by a few weeks' sickness in
               a new settlement of America,â€”or a brutally obdurate father and insolently
               self-sufficient and heartless man made lowly-minded and paternal and tender by being
               ruined,â€”or a miser awaking generous from the impulse of a dream, a dream a miser
               could not by any possibility have dreamt,â€”please those alone who have made up their
               minds to be pleased, or who, revolting at the deformity of their own nakedness, love
               to see human nature in carnival-dress and masked. The Countess Guiccioli had no
               relish for the unplatonic amours of Don Juan. Offer a buffoon a humorous
               play, and he will tell you it is too farcical for a five-act comedy. This very note
               will give offence to nine out of every ten who read it; but the tenth man shall be
               the only one that is not secretly ashamed to know himself.

            [9] p. 151.â€”â€”lying being rarely held a vice, except where deliberate,
               or the act is done on paper.] As the world makes its own rules of action, it takes
               care to put no interdiction on a practice that is convenient. Like the lust of the
               eyes, promise-making amuses, and, as everybody has a relish for the
               pastime, promise-breaking is by nobody accounted sin. It is your
               downright adultery and the violation of important pledges, that by all the world are
               reprobatedâ€”when detected; because all the world has an interest in putting them
               down.

                     The sides did appear,
                     And the bottom how deep,â€”
                     His torments projecting,
                     And sadly reflecting
                     
                     That a lover forsaken
                     A new love may get,
                     But a neck when once broken 
                     Can never be set;
                     And that he could die
                     Whenever he would,
                     But that he could live
                     But as long as he could,â€”
                     How grievous soever
                     The torment might grow,
                     He scorn'd to endeavor
                     To finish it so;
                     But bold, unconcern'd
                     At thoughts of the pain,
                     He calmly return'd
                     To his cottage again."
                  
                A sensible conclusion.
            [11] p. 194.â€”â€”because Agnes is now an orphan, and in this quality her
               claims on a nature like Ernestin's are a thousand-fold increased.] And even for
               prudential reasons he must, in his cooler moments, have seen that his chances for
               happiness were now much greater; for half the quarrels in married life arise from the
               interference of the wife's mother, who seems to be actuated by a kind of jealousy of
               the husband's rule over her daughter, and of the transfer to him of the better part
               of her affections. Indeed, I am convinced, that stepmothers are not more mischievous
               in their sphere than mothers-in-law (on the wife's side) in theirs. Love thy wife's
               mother, if thou canst; entreat her honorably, for it is thy duty, and it makes thy
               honor; but let her not live with thee, if thou be wise, on any pretext.
            [12] p. 216.â€”â€”the Incommunicable Name.] A very elegant, as it seems to
               me, and a reverent periphrasis (as I have used it in the text,) for that Awful Being,
               whom we cannot name with too much hesitation or with too diffident a regard. I find
               it in the Wisdom of Solomon, xiv., 21,â€”though it is there used in a
               simpler construction:â€”"for men, serving either calamity or tyranny [slaves to their
               misfortunes or to kingly rule], did ascribe unto stocks and stones the incommunicable name [the name that cannot or should not be applied but to one
               object: "nulli communicandum nomen" is the interpretation of Chasteillon
                  (Castellio)].
            [13] p. 217.â€”â€”Her lips apart and brows elevatedâ€”a manner indicative of
               pain of mind, but also the readiest mode of avoiding a laugh.] Because it is more
               difficult to command the lips, in their natural position, than the eyes. Hence, in
               the endeavor to conceal their feelings, many persons close them rigidly;â€”these are
               almost exclusively men; while others, who are generally women, open them. When the
               eyebrows, at the root of the nose, are also raised, and the corners of the mouth and
               consequently the cheeks, this latter manner is so closely akin to that of arch
               mockery, or ironical but not ill-humored mirth, that it needs but an almost
               imperceptible elevation of the lower lid to convert it into such; and in particular
               lights, and where the cheek is much lifted at the orbits, or appears to be so from
               emaciation, one expression may easily be confounded with the other.
            [14] p. 246.â€”â€”Be so good as to go up.] Donnez-vous la peine de monter. This is the peculiarity of French
               politeness, which extends often to the lowest classes,â€”the politeness of expression
               and form. Hence the French are often accused of insincerity. But without cause.
               Sincerity has nothing to do with terms of convention; which are different in
               different countries. There is quite as much sincerity among the French, as a people,
               as in another nation. When the Spaniard, at the end of his letter, wishes you may
               live a thousand years, he is neither more nor less sincere than you, who subscribe
               yourself the obedient servant of a man you would do anything else than serve, and
               from whom you may rather claim obedience yourself; nor is any one so ignorant as to
               take it for granted that the Castilian is ready to give him every thing he has,
               because he tells him it is all his own. Let us measure the French by the same rule.
               Their forms are pleasing; and there is as much sincerity under them as where our
               self-respect is less flattered.
            [15] p. 247.â€”â€”It has been said, &c.] By La BruyÃ¨re.
            [16] p. 248.â€”â€”That credulous vanity, &c.] It is probable that the
               consequence of this vanity is one of the causes why women bear the reputation (with
               romance-writers and others who live by flattering the sex) of being so confiding, so
               easily imposed upon by men. Now, it is a fact as positive and as irrefutable as the
               most established in morals, that women are, as a mass, far less confiding than men.
               They are, on the contrary, generally suspicious and distrustful,*
                save in one point, in which their faith is a positive
               
                  *Perhaps the consequence of their weakness and sense of inferiority. So the
                     ignorant mind substitutes cunning for the wisdom it is deficient in, and the
                     weak among animals supply the want of strength and consequent self-reliance by
                     watchfulness and distrust.
               
                superstition or bigotry that no evidence of reason can
               diminish, namely, in the supremacy of their charms. Here it is, and here only, that
               the man has the upperhand of a deceitfulness and craft which otherwise would outwit
               him in all things; and hence it is that men who are, like themselves, false-tongued
               and treacherous, have ten times the influence over them that is acquired by the man
               of integrity and lofty honor.
            These sentiments will, by the ignorant and inexperienced, as well as by the writers
               above-named, be ascribed to misogyny. Alas! there is nothing of that; it is but the
               fruit that is gathered, by long watching, and the sweat of the heart, from the tree
               of knowledge.
            [17] p. 251.â€”â€”Love and Self-Love, a pair that jar incessantly, yet
               propagate in perfect harmony.] It is one of the curious inconsistencies of the
               amorous passion, that both parties, but especially the woman, are prone to a deceit
               which they know beforehand, and are pleased in knowing, will be seen through. When a
               woman, meaning Yes, says No, she does not expect to be
               taken literally; she acts in such a manner that the lover may read her meaning
               easily, while her tongue perversely contradicts it. In this instance, dissimulation
               takes a character she is cautious of assuming anywhere else. She walks as it were in
               domino, and wears a mask, but lets the letter slip aside in fear that her real aspect
               may not be surmised.
            It is certainly a curious trait; and, could reason prevail against instinct, it would
               gradually disappear among the ingenuous. But nature knows her own necessities; and,
               as I have elsewhere intimated, we see in the she-cat, mutatis
                  mutandis, the very same manÅ“uvring.
            [18] p. 253.â€”â€”in the haste to make atonementâ€”which exposed him
               continually to disappointment and disgust.] Put confidence in a rogue, and he will
               cheat you all the sooner. Generosity is thrown away upon the selfish, and magnanimity
               on the malignant. Extend your hand in a spirit of reconciliation to a man who has no
               benevolence, and, confessing you have judged him wrong, ask his pardon, and he will
               trample you.
            [19] p. 273.â€”â€”you, like the best believers, have at times, or have had,
               doubts.] One of the most exemplary divines, and moreover one of the best men, I have
               ever known, I heard but a few weeks before his death declare, that he "found it hard
               sometimes to believe;" and the following verse of Solomon's is full of pith: "Who
               knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth
               downward to the earth?" (Eccles. iii. 21.) It is only men who want
               reflection,â€”or who by their habits of life are indisposed to it,â€”or, finally, who are
                  born believers like De Coucy,â€”that "never" doubt. And it is a
               happiness for the world that the mass are so.
            [20] p. 274.â€”â€”the youth who committed suicide in consequence of having
               read Cain.â€”I would not have the accident of one such death upon my soul
               for a greater fame than Byron's.] Yet I question, if, with all the sorrow and
               compunction an author must feel at such an involuntary manslaughter, there would not
               mingle with the emotion a more transient satisfaction of vanity, flattered by this
               terrible and, I think, equivocal testimony of the influence of his muse. The most
               shocking things that can happen in nature may become pleasing when they titillate the
               palate of self-love, whose inordinate appetite, like that of some ravenous animals,
               chokes at nothing, from a man to a nail. But men are such liars and dissemblers, they
               will not acknowledge any such adulteration of their sympathies, but lay claim to an
               unmixed benevolence, which can belong to celestial natures only; for these, being
               above our sphere, may feel sorrow and compassion for our sufferings without being
               affected by self-interest, as we do for the lower animals,â€”but in an incalculably
               greater degree.
            [21] p. 277.â€”â€”the influence of prayer on our spirit is positive and
               direct.] Because it elevates the mind above sublunary fears, and by the communion,
               whether ideal or actual, which it makes between man and his Maker, puts that control
               upon the actions and desires of the former which nothing else could do, and thereby
               purifies him. And this it would do though all religion were illusion, and does even
               when the form or mode of faith is an imposture. A man, in short, makes to himself a
               standard and endeavors to bring his soul to its proportions. Hence it is illogical to
               cite the death of a devout Christian as any evidence of the soundness of his faith.
               Apart from the fact of physical and moral constitution and the effects of disease,
               men die enthusiastically for a false prophet or for a simple idol. It is exaltation
               of the imagination that is required; which
               puts the nervous power in a state that does not admit of fear,â€”whose action is
               antagonistic; operating, namely, by depressionâ€”paralyzing, not stimulating.
            [22] p. 277.â€”â€”what is spiritual and invisible.] Yet which must be
               material after allâ€”at least in human comprehension; for we cannot conceive of any
               existence that is not so. The air is unseen, yet it is material. And when we speak of
               the soul as something that in us thinks and actsâ€”or prompts to action, we give it
               substance by giving it existence. But to be immaterial would be not to be.
            Nothing shows, so much as this impossibility of conceiving what yet we are certain
               must be, the finite character of the human intellect. Indeed, this finiteness is the
               necessary consequence of its limitation while in the flesh to the sphere of the
               Earth; for our ideas must all be predicated and fashioned after the forms of things
               pre-existent and of which our senses take cognizance. Thus do we give to the Awful
               Spirit that has created us, and to the beings we suppose to be nigher to Him than
               ourselves, human forms, because we know of no superior model to our own, and can
               conceive of none, yet are all the while conscious, that in the nature of things such
               a conformation is impossible, except in a world precisely like our own.*
                As I say, we assign these forms in order to speak more intelligibly of what
               after all is utterly beyond our intelligence. So, when we speak of the soul as
               something purely abstract and insubstantial in its nature, we speak what in reality
               can convey to our understanding no meaning. We must believe that the soul has
               substance, whether deriving its existence directly from the composition of the body
               (a composition whose more subtile essences will ever perhaps escape human analysis),
               or infused into the body, or into the brain (which includes the spinal cord) alone,
               after birth; but it is of a substance that, being invisible to human eyes, and
               impalpable by human touch, imperceptible to all human senses, is, by the limitation
               of our nature, quite beyond our largest and subtlest comprehension. If the soul is
               engendered in the same manner as the body, and has its development, from the embryon
               to the fÅ“tus, in like manner,â€”and this is rendered probable by its character, as
               stamped unalterably by those of the parents, a modification (superior or derogate) of
               their own, having the hereditary features so ineffaceable that they will reappear
               after intervals of several generationsâ€”the progeny having, not rarely, the congenital
               qualities of the grandfather or great-grandfather rather than of the immediate
               parents,â€”if the soul, I say, is the connate attendant of the body, consequent at once
               and coexistent, as the savor in the peach, the sensibility in the mimosa, it still
               escapes our comprehension, because nothing that is permanently invisible, impalpable,
               imperceptible by all the senses, can be comprehended by humanity. Yet it does so not
               more than the vital principle. Nor is there any reason, from analogy,
               why they should not be equally indestructible. In the absence of reason, we use
               conjecture, and in the decomposition of the body find no longer a necessity for the
               existence of the lifeâ€”by which I mean that principle which is not the blood nor the
               nerves, but is their motive power and their sentient property, and that only; whereas
               the soul, having no such simple functions, and the moral good and evil, the
               intelligence and the fatuity, with all their consequences and creations, which are
               its offspring yet itself, look unavoidably to a higher sphere and a wider range of
               action, where the sufferings it has undergone to purify and exalt its nature shall
               have their legitimate, and, by the preordinance of its Creator, their necessary
               compensation, in the product of the fruit whose seed it has sown, which fruit is
               virtue and wisdom.
            
               *The same remark may be applied to our conceptions of Heaven and of the glory of
                  the Most High. Light and darkness, the harmony of musical sounds and the
                  aesthetic effect of colors, are human ideas, predicate upon human experience
                  and observation. But light and darkness are such to us by reason of the
                  position of the Earth, its revolution and its atmosphere; and melody and color
                  (the latter a consequent of light) are the results of impressions on our
                  senses, which senses depend on our organization. Therefore it is more than
                  probable that all our notions of celestial attributes are absolutely false. But
                  there is no other mode of conceiving them, therefore no other mode of
                  expression; nor can this be less than pardonable in the eyes of the Almighty,
                  because nothing can be expected of us beyond the reach of our abilities.
            
            I must stop abruptly; for the fascination of such a theme has carried me beyond my
               bounds. But in closing I beg to be understood, and not misrepresented, when I say
               that the above crudities have no connection with the speculations of materialism. As
               in all things that we know the Deity evidently works by natural meansâ€”that is, in
               this world, by the use of its materials in the regular operation of their preordained
               natureâ€”never accelerating that operation nor interrupting it, because, designed in
               unerring wisdom, it has no imperfection to
               be rectified,â€”I see not why the soul of man should not by its own efforts assume
               hereafter the sphere of action and the form of being or of union with being (to speak
               more intelligibly) which are preÃ«stablished as the result and reward of those
               efforts. Yet, as the gardener, looking on the trees whose growth and product he has
               known to calculate, will favor the better fruit and bestow upon its ripening special
               care, so may the Almighty, or His ministers, contemplating the vast garden of
               humanity, select the product of richer savor and fragrance, and aid and direct those
               innate or ingrafted principles of its being which impel it to perfection. In which
               furtherance of the Divine Will, the driving shower and the cold dews, the battling
               winds and the repelling frost, act a part not less essential than the sunshine.
            [23] p. 295.â€”â€”a wandering desire, &c., like the attachment of the
               cat, which, when the creature is full-grown, &c.] The kitten, from its weakness,
               is deprived of self-dependence, and, from its tenderness, needs fondling. Therefore
               it loves the lap, and courts caresses, and readily singles out the individual from
               whom it receives them. This disposition sometimes continues in the cat, but without
               any discriminating preference. The impressions on the cat's brain are of places, and
               not of persons,â€”because she has no propension of attachment towards these, and
               therefore takes no note of them. In other words, they interest her not, and make no
               impression on her brain, while the conveniences of certain places do.
            The memory, in man, is just the same. All persons have good memories for what affects
               their interests, or tastes, or passions. A man of imagination and of great vivacity
               of temper, who sees directly and reasons rapidly, will pass through volume after
               volume, and theme after theme, and, mastering all of them quickly, retain in mind
               none of them, while the slow and less ideal brain, receiving with more difficulty,
               remembers all. The former complains of his memory; the latter boasts of his. Yet
               there is no deficiency in the one and no excess in the other. Give the former a
               subject that delights him or affects his interest, and the impression is indelible as
               immediate.
            The reason is after all but hypothetical, because predicated of things invisible,
               though real, and is therefore best given by illustration. As with the impressions of
               the graver on the steel or copper plate,â€”some are made by a single stroke and others
               by repeated touches which cut less deeply, yet the result shall be the same; so with
               the mind of man. And this is memory. And love is nothing else; the habit of certain
               ideas produced by iteration.
            [24] p. 309.â€”â€”even in their absence have men such influence over women
               who love them truly.] As men are, so are their wives (when wives in heart,) their
               mistresses, all of the other sex that are attached to them, even to their sisters and
               their mothers. A woman, when she truly loves, molds herself always, often
               unconsciously, but always inevitably, to the character of the being she loves. Wo
               unto her when he is less than herself! and blessed is her lot when he is her
               superior!
            [25] p. 316.â€”â€”I would strangle it in my lap as it lies, but to make him
               love me as I now love him!] It would be greatly to mistake Joanna's character, to
               attach any literal meaning to this exclamation of pure passion. It is the natural
               exaggeration of her extraordinary emotion; natural, because with the ardor that
               belonged to her, and in the excitement of her brain and blood, she feels at the
               moment, and, feeling, fears, that she could do anything to gain the object of her
               longing, yet exaggerated, because, the burst of passion over, she was as incapable of
               such violence and such criminality as her meeker and dispassionate sister.
            [26] p. 319.â€”â€”as children torture flies and men shoot snipes, without
               reflection and for the passing gratification.] Children pull off the legs of flies
               and grasshoppers, not because they are inhuman, but because they are not taught the
               cruelty and the wrongfulness of the action; and if men look on with indifference, nor
               care to teach them, it is because they have never reflected upon the nature of life,
               nor asked themselves what right they have to deprive other creatures of it, except
               from absolute necessity or in self-defence.*
               
                  
                  *Power can confer none, else we were in a bad condition as respects higher
                     beings. Yet men shoot down birds and beasts in mere sport; nor do their dying
                     agonies seem of any consequence where the simple question, whether these
                     creatures have not the same right to their lives as men, has not presented
                     itself; or has been answered by an egotistical denial.
                  The cruel selfishness of man, who has no feeling for any creature but himself,
                     is one of the reproaches of his reason. He pleads in excuse when animals writhe
                     in agony, not to yield him food, but to make him sport, They have
                     no souls. That should be in itself an argument against their butchery. Having
                     no hereafter, they have nothing to make up to them for the loss of the present,
                     and the briefer that present, tho more reason why they should be allowed to
                     enjoy it.
               
            
            
            [27] p. 333.â€”â€”Jealousyâ€”does not necessarily suppose, &c., much less
               those criminal acts which in a malignant or a violent and unscrupulous nature, and in
               such only, are at times its frightful consequence.] When a poet paints truly, he is
               led by the very progress of his picture to introduce traits of character which he did
               not originally design. Othello was intended to be magnanimous, but he
               made, more truthfully, to be unscrupulous; for to purpose the assassination of
               Cassio, by another's hand, if not by a blow in the dark, could never be the impulse
               of a generous mind or the conclusion of any but a callous conscience.
            [28] p. 355.â€”â€”what fervor is added to love by the exaltation of its
               object.] And the same is the effect with gratitude, which is wonderfully increased,
               in man or woman, by the rank of the obliging party. Gratitude to a peasant becomes
               devotion to a prince.
            [29] p. 385.â€”â€”one of the noblest characteristics of classic art,
               &c.] I believe it was a remark of the late Mr. Haydon's, or at least one cited by
               him, that the ancient statues of heroes looked like gentlemen stripped,
               while the modern reminded one of boxers. It is the happiest expression
               I have ever met with, to designate that air of perfect gentility which is the
               quintessential part of the eurythmy of Greek sculpture, or rather, which is at once a
               component portion and the composite result of its eurythmy.
            [30] p. 387.â€”â€”her pliant and round waist, which no stays had stiffened
               into hardness and deformity.] I am persuaded that there is nothing more conducive to
               chastity of thought in men than the use of stays in women. There is something in the
               preposterous shapes thus presented, and in the want of mobility in the loins, or the
               display of those changes in the shape which occur by the alteration of position,
               when, according to the attitude, one or other hip is elevated and its fellow of the
               opposite side depressed, there is something in this absence of the natural that
               offends the sense; and as it is only by natural forms that the natural affections can
               be excited, these affections are destroyed, blunted, or left dormant, where, by a
               violence done to nature, those forms are no longer visible in their normal state.
               Nature's laws are absolute. The Deity has made man to love certain proportions and
               shapes in women, because cause these are the result and evidence of a healthy
               organization, and it is only by the choice of such that the conjugal union can be
               productive of a healthy offspring.*
               
            
            If fine women were to abandon those monstrous contrivances, they would save the
               battery of their eyes an immense amount of ammunition. No leer of the eyes, no smile
               of the lips, nor the fullness of the cheeks, nor the magic of the voice, not even the
               voluptuous effect of a full and round neck, nor the swell of the half-revealed bosom,
               nothing in the whole woman moves so readily desire as the display of a perfect spine
               and elasticity of the reins.
            [31] p. 388.â€”â€”like Niobe, turned to stone by excess of grief.] Cicero
               has very happily observed,â€”â€”"Nioba fingitur lapidea, propter Ã¦ternum,
               credo, in luctu silentium." (Tusc. Disp. iii. 26.) Deep
               grief sits motionless, speechless, tearless, the head cast down, the eyes on vacancy,
               the figure usually gathered together, huddled as it were into a heap. This is in fact
               the essence of the fable, whose moral truth and its eternal pathos (appealing to the
               heart in every age and among all nations) make it one of the most beautiful in all
               mythology.
            [32] p. 390.â€”â€”"To make me fit for Heaven."â€”And with this sublime truth,
               whose doctrine in all its extent, &c.] If the soul is immortal, it must carry
               with it to its new state of being the qualities which it has acquired or perfected in
               this. Therefore nothing, which does not purely affect the perishable body, can,
               however fruitless in this lifeâ€”if any acquisition of the spirit can be fruitless,
               nothing can be lost or wasted; and Cato (the Censor) and Alfieri, in learning Greek
               in the decline of life, were learning it (it may be said in all seriousness) for
               another worldâ€”its results, that is, upon their mindsâ€”not the language itself. It is
               in this way alone, that the toils and trials of this life can be supposed to have
               their just recompense: and that wisdom which man gathers from experience,
               
                *This is an analysis of the preference: but men follow blindly the impulse of
                     the feeling without stopping to consider its object. Not one man in ten
                     thousand knows truly how a woman should be made; but there is not one in ten
                     thousand, who, unbiased by interest or by moral predilection, is not propelled
                     to make choice of such forms as nature, for her own purposes, requires that he
                     should choose. Indeed his bias does in no wise affect his natural desires; he
                     may marry deformity or defect, but he does not covet them amorously.
               
                and that virtue which is the autumnal crop
               of affliction, neither of which profit those who come after himâ€”who read his
               teachings but to disregard them, and who follow his tardy practice only when they
               themselves have in their own persons experienced its necessity, these acquisitions
               are the elements of a new moral language whose studies he is to pursue in another
               sphere, to be but the rudiments of still other acquisitions in other worlds perhaps,
               through infinite changes of being, to the last perfection of which the Creator has
               made him capable.
            [33] p. 395 (Note).â€”â€”another love than Philip?] It will be perceived
               that Joanna marred the force of Alfieri's phrase, to render it more apposite to her
               own situation: un altro che Filippo, for "il figlio
               di Filippo" (the son of Philip.)
            [34] p. 404.â€”â€”Men of this kind, who are open as the air in matters that
               concern themselves, because they have nothing to conceal, &c.] Women are
               proverbially said to be incapable of keeping a secret. As a general rule, it is so;
               but the secret is that of others; their own is safe enough. And in men who are not
               noble in spirit the same general rule obtains, with like discrimination. The frank
               and candid have indeed their qualities by gift of nature, as have the reserved and
               dissembling theirs; but I have never found it to fail; that the former are as secret,
               even in their own affairs, where disclosure would be attended with ridicule or
               disgrace, as the latter. But this is but a spot in the heart that is otherwise as
               bright as the sun. Therefore, in the consciousness of their integrity and in the
               pride of their generosity of sentiment, they are open, fearless, rash; while, on the
               contrary, the reserved man is one who is afraid to expose a heart that is not
               innocent, and where the brightness is but a speck and not the great mass of the
               character. In fact, these live in perpetual self-guard, not because other men are
               hostile, but because they themselves are weak, as the open-hearted leaves the citadel
               of his soul ungarrisoned, not from ignorance of the power or the hostility of his
               neighbors, but because in itself it is impregnable, and, built upon the solid rock of
               conscience, runs no risk of being undermined.
            [35] p. 404.â€”â€”with more directness, &c.] It is easy to free the
               author of The Prince from all other charges as a writer than those of
               selfishness and insincerity. He appears (in that book), amid all the evidence it
               furnishes of enlightened love of freedom and genuine patriotism, to be aiming at his
               own aggrandizement. His real principles, which are those of his reason rather than
               his heart, develop themselves, as is the case with every author, in despite of his
               purpose, or as the accidents of his pen, while his prominent though not sole object
               seems to be to demonstrate his own abilities and to ingratiate himself with the
               ruling power. He appears to have written with one eye, so to speak, upon posterity
               and the other on his time, and, in a want of religious principle, to have considered
               the end to justify on all occasions the means. I cannot therefore think him an open
               and noble spirit; but I am very certain that he hated tyranny and would, had it
               depended upon him, have restored his country to her place among the nations. It was
               the imperfection of his nature to be rather like the first Brutus than the second
               Cato, and, with much of the patriotism of both those Romans, and more than their
               talent, to have wanted the disinterestedness of the one, while he was contented to
               veil the honesty of his nature and his better purpose with the temporary duplicity of
               the other. If I shall not be misunderstood, I would say, it was his misfortune
               (though our advantage) that he was an author as well as statesman. When there are
               contrary interests in a man's nature, it is almost impossible he should not be in
               some respects, to a certain degree, a time-server.
            [36] p. 405.â€”â€”the great Machiavelli.] To comprehend a writer truly, one
               must in his own spirit have something of the quality which that writer preÃ«minently
               displays. To men who are deficient in perspicacity, The Prince and the
                  Discourses on Livy must be at all times books they cannot relish,
               and whose real essence is too subtile for their grasp.
            If Machiavelli's sagacity failed to forewarn him of this fact, and that therefore
               there would be few in the world who would appreciate him justly; or rather, if,
               forewarning him, his sagacity had no power to deter him from displaying its mighty
               reach; it is because of that vanity which by the fiat of the Almighty compels the
               superior man to display his superiority at all hazards, nor suffers him to hide any
               knowledge that may possibly instruct his kind.
            In the preceding note (35), I was led almost unconsciously into certain remarks upon
               the moral character, as a writer, of the illustrious Florentine. But this book is no
               place wherein to handle a subject so much
               disputed, and that is really somewhat intricate from the cloud which, intentionally
               or otherwise, he has thrown about his purpose in The Prince. In
               private, I have satisfied my own spirit in that respect. But far in the distance of
               time I see the opportunity, which if I live I shall eagerly embrace, to endeavor to
               make sensible unto others what to me is as obvious as the noonday. Yet here I may be
               permitted to observe, that, as an author merely, Machiavelli can never be appreciated
               in English. To read him as he is, which is as one of the most masculine writers that
               ever gave words to thought (and I know no higher praise,) he must be read, as Dante
               must be read, in his own nervous Tuscan, whose architecture is Doric, whose
               proportions are colossal, whose materials are basalt and iron. He who reads him thus,
               will rise from the perusal with that profound respect which only such authors can
               command,â€”authors who in reach of sagacity, in profundity of moral knowledge, are
               demigods, and in their language and its tones are thorough men.
            [37] p. 405.â€”â€”like Machiavelli, disdained to practice the arts his
               observation and his subtle reason made known to him.] Machiavelli, as an ambassador,
               is allowed even by his maligners to have been above the duplicity, whose practice he
               so well understood, not to teach, but to expose.
            [38] p. 409.â€”â€”and to your divinities, &c. &c.] It is such
               feelings as these which, if they have not given rise to idolatry, have undoubtedly in
               various nations helped to extend and to perpetuate it.â€”The biblical reader may be
               recommended to a passage in the Apocryphal book of the Wisdom of
                  Solomon: chap. xiv. v. 15-21.
            [39] p. 410.â€”â€”The eyes, beautiful as a heifer's.] It can only be from
               want of observation that critics have mistaken Homer's meaning, and ascribe his
               well-known epithet of Juno's eyes to an idea of their dimension. In a mere matter of
               size the eyes of cattle have no eminence over those of many other animals, but in
               their beauty they are indeed excellent. In shape, in color, in the length of the
               lashes, and the softness of the expression, the eyes of a cow, and particularly of a
               heifer, are well worth observing; and I have eagerly seized the first occasion of
               recording an admiration that I have often indulged, I had almost said by the hour. In
               the male, the expression is somewhat surly, sometimes savage, and, as in other
               animals of that sex, deficient in that softness which may be seen even in the eyes of
               the females of savage animals.
            [40] p. 418.â€”â€”those last touches, and that mellownessâ€”whose
               manipulation I do not think he would have been willing to have supervised.] Titian's
               reserve, as to the material processes which aided him in his impasto and helped to
               give their verity to his carnations, we are apt to censure as narrow-minded; but
               unjustly. That he did not leave behind him the secrets which he so jealously guarded
               during his career, is indeed to be condemned as illiberal; it was denying to the
               world of art what to have imparted could in no wise have lessened his individual
               fame, and what, as a favorite of nature, he had no right to conceal from the less
               fortunate of his fellows: but that he chose in his lifetime to reserve to himself the
               result of his own superior intelligence and observation, industry and experience, was
               but an act of simple discretion. It was the sole means in his power to secure to
               himself the benefit of his own genius, his own indefatigable study, and his peculiar
               good-fortune; which in the mechanic arts men do, without reproach, by their letters
               patent.
            [41] p. 440.â€”â€”more royal than Mandane.] Mandane however is far from
               being a fair specimen of Metastasio's royal personages. In the other piece indicated
               by Ernestin in the text (Demetrio), Cleonice is truly royal, and,
               besides, a very noble woman in all respects. I may as well add, that Metastasio's
               want of individuality in his characters is not as between the characters themselves,
               where there is usually sufficient discrimination, but as between them, the creations
               of his own mind, and those of any other dramatist. They are the moral personages
               common to all writers of dignified drama, being distinguished (in general) by no such
               peculiarities as make portraits of the best drawings of great poets. Yet Cleonice is
               so distinct, both in herself and in the touches of the poet, that I know not that it
               required more than a loftier kind of drama than opera, and a staider verse, of longer
               measure than is suited to lyrical pieces, to give the author an opportunity that
               would have proved him capable of the higher kind of art in which he is generally
               thought defective. And the mention of these two disadvantages incidental to opera
               leads me to say, in the first place, that Metastasio, to be judged of fairly, must always be regarded as a writer of operas,
               for the airs that terminate each Scene diminish (in the simple
               reading), sometimes destroy altogether, the effect produced by the preceding
               dialogue; and secondly,â€”what is the main defect of Metastasio as a dramatic writer is
               his tone, which is not of the drama, far less that of a masculine and
               great poet. It is this which makes him effeminate, as his commonplaces
               make him unimpassioned and (in the sense explained in the text)
               unnatural. Alfieri's tone as a tragic writer is (in his better pieces)
               almost perfect; it has nerve and passion, yet is full of majesty; it is that of a chest voice, and becomes the expression of sentiments that are highly
               elevated. His defect as a painter of passions is that his characters too much
               resemble one another throughout the various plays, not that they are like those of
               other artists. They are evidently cut from the same marble, by the same sculptor,
               after one individual model. This remark I add as a corollary to that portion of the
               text which follows what is here particularly annotated. But, to return to my
               immediate subject,â€”I beg to be permitted to remark, as further illustrating opinions,
               which the occasion did not permit me with due regard to nature to put in the mouth of
               Ernestin, that the source of the masculine in poetry, that which wins
               our respect instantly and forever in Dante and in Milton, in Shakspeare, Massinger
               often, and Alfieri, in Byron, is their language, not their sentiment.
               The disciples of the late Mr. Wordsworth tried hard to persuade the world, that the
               language of poetry has nothing in itself distinct from that of prose. Any true
               analysis will show directly the contrary; and in all cases where great poets are
               admired as particularly great, their language will be found to claim nine parts in
               ten of the merit. It is there that the soul of the man truly displays itself, and the
               lofty, the terrible, the energetic, take directly from the brain of their creator the
               words which alone express them, and which are, as words simply, themselves energetic,
               lofty, terrible. No study gives them; they are a part of the man. Dante and Alfieri
               had given the same tone to English, I would dare to say to French even, had they been
               born and bred to use that language. Strip their ideas of this their natural and
               peculiar, or, if I may say so, personal dress, and how much do you leave that is
               different from the noble ideas of other poets? It is the master-touch that makes the
               master-piece, not its prime conception. Metastasio and Wordsworth have abundance of
               the generous, the noble in sentiment, often to a lofty and romantic degree. That wide
               charity which takes in the whole of the human race, if, from the nature of its
               subjects, it has a more direct as specific display in the latter, is, for the drama,
               not deficient in the former; yet neither of them will be accounted a great poet by
               any but congenial spirits, nor will their moral maxims and examples teach any but
               such. To the lofty and impassioned, who find a rapture in Dante and Milton, and a
               zest in Byron and Alfieri, they give few impressions that stamp the heart itself,
               none that are ineffaceable; while from these they rise with soul expanded, always
               strengthened, often improved. Of such metal are the spirits of Ernestin and
               Joanna.
            [42] p. 440.â€”â€”Metastasio was incapable of real passion.]
               Metastasioâ€”like the eminent poet with whom I have accidentally combined him for the
               purpose of illustration, not paralleled him, in the previous noteâ€”had no ardent, no
               eminently masculine feeling in his nature. You read the life of either
               in their works. And the lives of the others,â€”I mean the tenor of their lives as
               influenced by themselves, not by outward circumstances,â€”Dante, Milton, Alfieri,
               Byron, have the same energetic character with their works. Of Shakspeare as a man we
               know but little; but we cannot doubt that he spoke, and looked, and moved, a man. If
               he did not, he was an anomaly.
            [43] p. 442.â€”â€”milk, not wine. We drink it without excitement, and set
               down the cup without, &c.] It might be argued on the other side, and
               ingeniously,â€”that milk as a beverage has no such dangerous consequence as wine; that
               moreover the latter is but a stimulus, or at most supplies the heat necessary for the
               functions of the body, while milk nourishes and greatly strengthens; and that such
               are precisely the different results with the two classes of poets I describe. I grant
               it. But the milk of Metastasio and his parallels in nervous power will only suit the
               stomachs of those who, therefore, like it, and whom, therefore again, it nourishes;
               it would be rejected by those who drink the wine of Alfieri. In directer language,
               those who from the sentiments, the scenes, the characters of Alfieri's dramaâ€”made to
               their congenial spirits effective by the masculine tone of the languageâ€”derive
               strength and stimulus to their moral energies, and encouragement to noble thought and
                  action tion, would rise,
               like Joanna (who, with the instinct of love, had made Ernestin the model to her
               spirit), indifferent from the pages of a Metastasio, who to the mass of readers has
               so much that cannot be read without profit, both to head and heart.
            [44] p. 442.â€”â€”milk forms a part of our daily food; we meet it
               everywhere, and can get it, every one, at all times; while wine is rarer, and where
               good is costly and to be had by only the favored few.] "And then,"â€”might Ernestin
               have added, had his delight given him opportunity,â€”"wine improves by age, whereas
               milk grows worthless in a day;" a comparison which, though like others it is no
               argument, is perfectly apposite as an illustration in point. As long as the mountains
               stand and men behold them, as long as the thunder roars and men shall hear it, while
               the storm has power and the sea knows no narrower bounds, so long will strength,
               majesty, and impetuous energy, the massive and compact in diction, live eternal, and
               the more conspicuous for their rareness, while the small and the diffuse, the smooth
               and nerveless, the placid but undignified, are borne down the stream of time
               unregarded, and from their very frequency uncommiserated.
            [45] p. 443.â€”â€”Becauseâ€”he is most like you.] Probably Joanna meant, in
               masculine character, in directness, and in classic severity,â€”and perhaps in propriety of tone; for in tone itself (to judge from the specimens that
               follow in the text) they should differ almost as widely as in language.
            [46] p. 465.â€”â€”"You think then, a man's best chance, who wants to keep
               his wife's looks to himself, &c., &c."â€”"I do, indeed; particularly," &c.]
               These remarks of Ernestin's, it is plain from what precedes, have no reference to
               chastity. Chastity is a quality of itself, independent of beauty or the want of it,
               and has nothing to do with the lust of admiration, although too often seriously
               assailed by the consequence of that lust of admiration, which throws down one of its
               best barriers. A want of moral purity, as well as positive unchasteness, are quite as
               conspicuous among the ugly as among the handsome,â€”or, to express it more quaintly,
               are quite as common, and much more conspicuous.

                  TIFFANY. 12mo., cloth, $1.00.
               "A work of high literary merit, and of unusual interest. It illustrates the most
                  interesting period of our historyâ€”the age of American chivalry; and gives us a
                  true picture of the opinions and habits, as well as leading personages of that
                  period. Its style is eloquent and attractive, which will ensure for it a wide
                     popularity."â€”Springfield Republican.

                  HUBER. 12mo., cloth, $1 25.
               This extraordinary book, so full of trenchant humor and pungent satire, has
                  elicited an unusual variety of compliment. The following are some of the
                  criticisms of the Press:
               It recounts a series of adventures, some as droll and whimsical as those of the
                  famous Gil Blas.â€”New York Herald.
               Written in a style between "Don Quixote" and "Roderick Random," Major Potter's
                  oddities and mishaps will remind the reader frequently of the hero of
                     Cervantes.â€”Day Book.
               This is a volume of facetious adventures of this redoubtable Major, something
                  after the fashion of Major Jack Downing's Experiences in politics and fashionable
                     life.â€”New Bedford Mercury.
               It is an exceedingly clever and amusing volume, and those who wish to enjoy a
                  hearty laugh, as well as learn something of real life, would do well to go through
                  its pages leisurely. The Major is a fair rival of the immortal "Sam
                     Slick."â€”S. Times.
               It is full of pungent bits at prominent politicians and other noted personages,
                  who are portrayed with a bold and unsparing hand, while the adventures of the
                  Major are humorous and lively.â€”U.S. Directory.
               A semi-political satireâ€”one of the most powerful books of the
                     time.â€”Times.
            
            
               IV. 
               The Life and Martyrdom of Joan of Arc, MAID OF ORLEANS. TRANSLATED FROM THE
                  FRENCH OF MICHELET. 18mo., cloth, 50 cents. Forming the first of a series of 12
                  volumes, entitled THE HOUSEHOLD LIBRARY.
               This beautiful memoir is characterized by all the vivid coloring and
                  picturesqueness which impart such a charm to the productions of this brilliant
                  writer.

               CHRONICLES OF THE BASTILE. WITH TWENTY FINE ILLUSTRATIONS. 1 large 8vo.
                  volume.
               This work abounds with details of the most thrilling and exciting kind. The
                  atrocities and deeds of darkness that were transacted within the precincts of the
                  Bastile are here given with minuteness and accuracy. It is the opinion of one of
                  the most eminent French critics, Louis Blanc, that this work is unsurpassed for
                  its fidelity to fact, as well as for its vividness and startling dramatic
                  power.
