            ADVENTURES OF MY COUSIN SMOOTH.
            NO uncommon type of our "Young America" is Mister Solomon Smooth, the individual
               whose part in these sketches was performed for General Pierce in particular, and
               "Uncle Sam" in general. Mr. Smooth was born and "growed" on the extreme south point
               of Cape Cod—a seemingly desolate spot, yet somewhat renowned as the birthplace of
               Long Tom Coffin. If I would select one of our nation's 'cutest sons; if I were called
               upon to name the kind of man with that in his natural composition to make the safest,
               shrewdest, and most calculating merchant; if I were called to pass judgment on the
               man most qualified to sustain the spirit and characteristics of the American nation
               abroad—one who would never betray our national energy, nor degrade his profession,
               nor fail to seek that which might promote the interests of those who reposed trust in
               him, at the same time never forgetting his own—if I were about forming an expedition,
               and would provide myself with that character of man upon whom the issue of its
               success most depends; if, I say, I would seek the man possessing those rigid
               qualities of a moral nature which are a sure protection against doing aught that may
               degrade the councils of a nation, I would make this sandy cape my starting point, and
               draw from the upward growth of that stern energy to be found among those flourishing,
               energetic, and intelligent communities embraced within that circle which terminates
               at Cape Ann, and between the circling arms of which two capes heaves Boston Bay. But
               Smooth, though somewhat primitive in his personal appearance, is none of your common
               Cape Cod coasters, such as your Captain Doanes, and Cooks, and Ryders, and Clapps.
               Not he! So slender of person is he, that there can be no particular impropriety in
               our drawing a comparison between him and that peculiar type of person son commonly called a Virginian bean-pole. Nor, when
               he gets himself (as is not uncommon with him) "all over" native brown homespun, does
               his configuration materially change, there yet remaining, and boldly refusing to be
               disguised, that face so full of penetration, and those features so sharp. The
               waggishly inclined have identified them with the wizardry of dividing storm currents.
               Nevertheless, of this lean conformation, which is better within than the world
               without is in general willing to admit, is Smooth particularly proud. In manner,
               Smooth is piquant; and being an acknowledged member of the fast school—that is, a
               disciple of manifest destiny in particular and Model Republics in general—he accepts
               the mission so kindly proffered him by his unfortunate friend, Mr. General Pierce,
               and has no objection to giving the world and kingcraft (the latter rudderless, and
               drifting on those quicksands of common sense which it were well for nations had they
               proved destructive centuries ago) a few lessons in the go-ahead principle. What
               Smooth means to convey by the go-ahead principle, is simply that when common sense
               triumphs universal in a nation, sycophantism dies, and with it that pest of peoples,
               kingcraft! So, with the most amiable intentions, does Solomon set out for Washington,
               to have a first talk with General Pierce: this talk he hopes will be a prelude to
               putting straight the nationalities now drifting on the rock of intrigue, without that 
                  safty
                  safety
               -valve which a people fully conscious of enjoying their rights can give. And
               while thus employed, Smooth does not forget that it is a well laid down rule that
               many small Presidents may talk very large and yet cut very ridiculous figures : hence
               his first talk with Mr. Pierce, who is well known for general and very respectable
               characteristics, may be productive of great good to mankind in a mass. In New England
               educated, (that land where niggers may be white men, and white men too often turn
               niggers), loving universal rights, peace to consolidate a nation's good, and keep
               down that martial spirit which is its cankering curse—being tenacious of freedom in
               its broadest acceptation, and commercial prosperity with a general diffusion of its
               results, it is Mr. Smooth's candid opinion that ere another century rolls into the
               page of time America will whip, feed, civilize, and republicanize the great American
               continent. Could this be done at an earlier period, so much the better for mankind in
               general. Smooth was borne out in this opinion from the fact that Europe had got into
               a great fuzzle, the result of which was an equally great fight. Kingdoms and empires
               had become disordered, their craft was stranded; potentates were turning their people
               into minions of slaughter. Nicholas (modest god of all the Russias) thought his
               murdering a few thousands an act most pious: it was all for the sake of Christianity
               and a very small holy rite! On the other hand, there was Mister John
               Bull, so dogged at times, and yet so hard to hold once his propensity for fighting
               somebody was excited, hurling very unchristian lead and steel into. Nicholas's
               subtle-headed serfs. But the thing most wondrous was, that Uncle John, now foaming
               with the fever of war, had got Johnny Crappo at his back instead of his belly—a fact
               that would be recorded on the strangest page of history. Strange fighting companions
               were they; but as pig and dog do now and then become bed-fellows, who can give too
               much expression to his surprise at this strange Anglo-French combination? Let the
               world say what it will with reference to our worthy friend Uncle John fighting the
               battle of Mohamedanism—let it lay at his door the grave charge of degrading himself
               by seeking to make firm the rotten props of one of the most debased governments that
               has stained the history of the world with its crimes, John will humanely acknowledge
               the charge while forwarding to Turkey a copious edition of his "Society for Promoting
               Christian Knowledge."
            We hope with Mr. Smooth, that Master Bull and Cousin Jonathan may war only in words.
               Both are sensible gentlemen; both are keenly alive to that inspiration called
               fighting for one's rights; both are for ever finding a small bone to snarl over; but
               peace is found the greater bone, which, by preserving, affords the best picking.
               Indeed, we must all admit, that if polite diplomatists and small politicians had
               their way, their naughty recriminations would give us plenty of war, with only bows
               and smiles to pay for the blood and treasure wasted. But Mr. Bull is considerate with
               his power; while Jonathan shrewdly calculates how much being embroiled in war will disturb his tin business. May our
               discretion continue to form the best defence against war between the most enlightened
               governments of christendom.
            At home our negro question bids very fair to get political parties into an
               interminable snarl; which said snarl is made worse by the singular hopes of those
               having friends who would like to be next President of the United States. The "white
               house," (that shrine of patriotic worship!) having its avenues strongly bolted and
               barred with formidable niggers from Virginia and Carolina, has become a mammon of
               faith before which politicians are making sad niggers of themselves. Mr. Solomon
               Smooth lamented this; and, in order to ascertain what could be done in the way of
               finding a remedy, he determined to plainly introduce the matter during his first talk
               with General Pierce;—in a word, to see what could be done in the way of straightening
               things ere he tried the quality of his cigars and Bourbouin whiskey, a large stock of
               which the General was known to keep on hand. The party to which Mr. Smooth belonged,
               "Young America," enrolled among its numbers many young gentlemen whose spirits were
               fast, and young ladies whose talents were fast increasing; hence it was that he was a
               firm believer in the elastic principles of a go-ahead government: such an one,
               albeit, as would republicanize Russia, knock Austria into a smash, or make her
               declare herself something—revolutionize Europe in general, and in particular teach
               kings of the christian faith how very unchristian it is to wage savage wars. In
               addition to this, he would have the world in general more enlightened, and kings made
               to know that their highest duty was to mould their conduct after the example of good
               citizens. Were this not enough, he would go for annexing to these "United States" all
               the rest of creation; Mexico and Central America in particular, to aid which object
               he would have the moon perform a specific part on behalf of manifest destiny.
            The reader must remember that our hero Smooth is a man most unpolished, though never
               so bad as he seems. But we will let him speak for himself, and as his letters are
               addressed to Uncle Sam, of course those may read who will.

            The adventures of my cousin Smooth
            
               CHAPTER I.
               MR. SOLOMON SMOOTH IN WASHINGTON.
               "DEAR UNCLE—Once upon a time you were called Sam; but now that the reign of Pierce
                  is upon us it is difficult to tell what you may not be called. Not long since you
                  were the son of greatness, you are now the shadow of Pierce—the man whose little 
                     lightposterity
                     light posterity
                   will snuff out. I have thought of you frequently, Uncle: I have seen you
                  in sorrow looking back upon the past, and my heart has beat with sympathy as I saw
                  you contrast it with the present. Once patriotism stood on manly feet, now Bunkam
                  reigns. Politics are turned into drum-sticks, parties are lost for want of a
                  policy, principles are buried in the market-place. Mr. Smooth has been long
                  accustomed to hard knocks and crooked places; but anything so crooked as Mr.
                  Pierce staggers his digestion. If the concentrated wisdom of the nation riots here
                  (thought I as I entered the city) who can gainsay my coming? I knew the atmosphere
                  I entered had foul malaria in it; the city I found as straight as the face of
                  parties on the other hand was deformed. But being in the federal city, I became
                  forcibly impressed with the fact, that your smallest man has the largest
                  expectations, though he will not object to become the nation's drone. Having made
                  this wonderful discovery, I took up my line of march for the National Hotel, a
                  gorgeous palace where an uncouth million meet to revel in cheap luxury. So large
                  was the house that a pilot to guide me through its thousand galleries to bed was
                  an indispensable necessity. I was fatigued, and cared not where I hung up. Large
                  as was the establishment, everything looked so costly that I became cautious lest
                  what I sat down upon might become soiled, in which event I might be compelled to
                  pay the shot with a short locker; or, should the case go before Pierce, he might
                  in the profundity fundity of his wisdom
                  exile me to some remote spot on the Mosquito coast. I walked into the
                  establishment like one who feels himself an independent citizen, and then
                  commenced looking at the place and the people, as the people commenced looking at
                  me. Returning looks, and question-asking, seemed the fashion. 'Stranger!' said a
                  well dressed but rather inquisitive individual, 'you must, to be anybody in this
                  place, smother yourself in dignity, and eat dough-nuts of Southern make. Large
                  quantities of this diet are made now at the White House; in fact Pierce has turned
                  the establishment into a factory, where that article is manufactured ad libitum, and all are expected to eat.' I thought
                  the person who thus accosted me had large experience of matters in general, for he
                  gave me a slanting wink and a cunning nudge, which I rendered into an insinuation
                  to stand treat. I affected not to understand him, and edging aside a pace, made a
                  bold effort to gain the long and very expensive mahogany counter that stretched
                  half across the office, and behind which glowed out the figure of a fat citizen,
                  whom I stared right in the face. You cannot get cleverly through this world
                  without brass; if in your face you have enough to establish a foundery, so much
                  the better. It is indispensable in political matters; and, whether right or wrong,
                  the reader can best judge. I have thought the smaller the politician, the larger
                  were his dealings in the article. No one could be more cautious how they
                  scandalized their neighbours than I am; this, Uncle Sam, you well know; but I
                  question the policy of being delicate during the reign of Pierce, whose cabinet
                  recalls to my mind the story of the clacking hen, that forever kept up a noise
                  without laying one egg. To make your way in Washington, you must storm and put to
                  route a whole platform of valiant gentlemen, who have become political images in
                  brass. As they love you, Uncle Sam, so also would they live upon you, die upon
                  you, be buried at your expense, and their friends be very angry were you not a
                  mourner at the funeral. This I, Smooth, declare an honest fact, notwithstanding
                  the high respect I entertain for all those patriotic gentlemen who would take such
                  care of my Uncle's affairs.
               "Now, this very phlegmatic and good natured citizen, who stood: behind the
                  mahogany, had a face as broad and placid as a town-clock seen by moonlight. His
                  figure, too, was tightly driven into a suit of extravagant cloth, and altogether
                  presented the appearance of having quite recently escaped from the hands of James,
                  his tailor. It was not in the power of man to analyze his character from what he
                  said, for what he said meant nothing, when judged by the world's wisdom; but you
                  saw that James had succeeded in making him in love with himself. Should he chance
                  to read this imperfect sketch, he will excuse me when I say he seemed a person
                  brought up to himself, and entertaining the hope that at no distant day he would
                  become a very important character—perhaps outshine General Pierce himself. He
                  looked at me, and I looked at him; then he grinned at me, and I grinned at him. At
                  last I said, I reckoned we might draw the game. I then added, that from the look
                  of the establishment I could not be wrong in assuming that they did a large
                  business in the way of feeding hungry politicians and honester people. "You may
                  stake some on that, old feller," says he, with a suspicious leer. His nasal was
                  somewhat strong, so I put him down as from Vermont State, perhaps from the more
                  mountainous part of it. As if shy of my patronage he upon the counter, pompous,
                  spread his hands, as if the mahogany was all his. This seeming indifference rather
                  touched my dignity, which was of tender quality, so I cast upon him a look he
                  could not misinterpret, inquiring if he could tie a body up for the night in a
                  spare corner. 'You may bet on that! got a spare pin we can hook ye on somehow, I
                  reckon;' he ejaculates, sprawling his elbows, and making a support of his fleshy
                  hands, from between which his face peered like a soft pumpkin sorely squeezed. In
                  this position he stared, and stared, until his countenance assumed an anxiety,
                  equalled only by that of a stump lecturer about inaugration time—say one, who had
                  hoped for the mission to the court of St. James, but as a matter of patriotism
                  would not decline the Dublin Consulship. At length he condescended to say, with an
                  air of languishing endurance, that 'he could do me up brown, in the way of
                  comfortable quarters.' I thanked him for his great kindness, said I wanted to
                  exercise a judicious economy, and could not do the extensive, like those persons
                  sprawling in easy arm chairs at the left hand corner, to whom I pointed, and who, like Mr. President Pierce's representatives
                  abroad, were making a great noise to no purpose. After looking quizically at the
                  tie-up under my arm, then at my tall white hat, and again at the coarse weave of
                  my homespun, he inquired if that (pointing to the bundle) constituted my baggage.
                  Instantly I told him it was none of his business; that there was no occasion for
                  his feeling so large, though Mr. Pierce was President. He made an upright of
                  himself, and very civilly rejoined that there was no place this side of Cape
                  Horn—and he doubted if there was on the other side—where it was so necessary to
                  see the colateral as this Washington. He was proceeding to say much more, and
                  something about the doubtful character of General Pierce and his friends, when I
                  interrupted by saying, I thought he must have forgotten my name. 'Smooth is my
                  name,' I reiterated, 'of the Young American party, the party that intends doing up
                  the manifest destiny for mankind.'
               "'Manifest destiny never pays debts: must see the collateral 'afore we tie ye up!
                  Fact is, stranger, we must have the hold-fast for fear of the shot falling short.
                  The General has got so many tin-less friends, who visit Washington on a small
                  affair of business (here he gave his shoulders a significant shrug), that a body
                  has to keep a sharp eye in the wind.' Suddenly he began to drum on the mahogany,
                  screw his face into a disc of puckers, and look so wise. So glad did he seem, that
                  he whistled Yankee Doodle with the variations, looked every which way, and then
                  laughed right out at what he called Smooth's outfit.
               "'Needn't laugh at the fixens—old feller!' says I, 'Uncle Sam and me are going
                  into the tin business, and Sam, being a generous old butt, will stand all the
                  treats and hotel bills. Besides that, I was born in the very sand heap where Tom
                  Coffin was raised.'
               "'Who cares for Tom' says he, turning aside, and making a polite bow to a thirsty
                  senator from the far west: the senatorial gent bent his neck over, and approaching
                  with his lips the ear of the important individual, whispered something from out
                  the smallest corner. This something, when translated into decent English, might be
                  rendered thus:—If justice and gin slings are administered at your bar, pray direct
                  me the way to it! The fat man pointed up a narrow, dark, and very long passage;
                  and then suddenly turning to me, he said: ' If Tom Coffin lived now-a-days, when
                  politics went on the fast, he wouldn't be worth shooks, he not having a vote, nor
                  wanting an office under the new administration.' 'Now, stranger,' says I,
                  directing a look as if I was going to strike something at him, 'don't make such a
                  fuss about the needful—look'a here!' I just plumps out Uncle Zack Brewster's
                  letter, and having 
                     facinated
                     fascinated
                   his eye, tells him how Cochran and Riggs 'll do the dust. Like an
                  hydraulic current let loose did the fellow prick up his ears: then he said,
                     'do tell,' with a musical emphasis that seemed so full of credit.
                  Again he drew a long breath, and a seriousness came over his face that could only
                  be likened to that of a South Carolina locomotive when drawing a whole convention
                  of 
                     seccessionists
                     secessionists
                  , who, having failed in devising means to dissolve the 'federal union,'
                  were returning homeward very melancholy.
               "'Never doubted Mr. Smooth's word,' says he, with simple dryness,—' but,
                  notwithstanding, painful is the experience that office-holders and seekers, though
                  always kind to Uncle Sam, and tenacious of his dignity and cashbag, seldom
                  maintain the same earnestness for their own when legitimates are left in the
                  key-hole.'"
               "'You mean that the General's friends don't shine over on the square?'
               "'Precisely so!—Mr. General Pierce himself is a sort of mixed stripe; but his
                  friends (and he has regiments of them!), all fighters in the Mexican war when he
                  was brigadier, expect so much something material for themselves that all
                     outsiders are forgotten. Now and then the General is sorry to
                  inform his many friends that he is a little ill; to which a voice here and there
                  is heard to say that he is not inclined to do the clean thing.'
               "Well, I saw what the feller wanted; so I pulled out a fist full of shiners, just
                  to show him what Young America could do. The seeing the dimes smoothed him down
                  into the most agreeable amiability. His face loomed out with good natur, his
                  feelings seemed coming right from his inards; and he struck up Yankee Doodle by
                  way of an offset.
               "'Pooty full, Mr. Smooth,' he generously remarked, 'but we must try accommodate you somehow! We'll
                  tuck you away in a spare corner, high up!'
               "'That's a good soul,' said I,—'know'd ye warn't a bad sort of fellow,—when a body
                  understood how to get the good out!'
               "'Apartments for Solomon Smooth, Esq., from Cape Cod,' he said, mutteringly,
                  looking over his book, and drumming with his fingers on the page. Mr. Smooth, in
                  proof of his fast principles, will have no objection to tying up in the seventh
                  story?'
               "' Rather stiff that, Major! Young America can do most anything,—hang up on a pin
                  if it be necessary to accommodate, but don't just like the moon for a
                  bedfellow.'
               "'Won't trouble you with a bedfellow, Mr. Smooth,' he, grinned out, shaking all
                  over his broad sides.
               "It being well understood in Washington that great men were most condescending,
                  while little men, with large expectations, were most aspiring, there was nothing
                  left but to cut a course between the two. As for the latter quality of gentlemen,
                  they never stood at trifles, and when they failed to get the big business, had not
                  the slightest objection to the small,—which was the doing all Mr. President
                  Pierce's thinking. Therefore, be it known that, with a full knowledge of this sad
                  state of affairs, did I write down:—' Mr. Solomon Smooth, from Cape Cod:' which,
                  when down, looked like the footprints of a hen that, having dipped her claws in an
                  inkstand, had waddled across the page. Thus ended my induction at the
                  National."
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               MR. SMOOTH SLIPS, AND GOES TO BED.
               "AT length, Uncle Sam, I found myself somebody; and while looking about me on the
                  many well-dressed and very good-natured gentlemen who subsisted on the hope of
                  your generosity, could not avoid the contemplation of what a glorious world this
                  of ours must be, possessing as it does so many good hearted souls like yourself,
                  so rich—but as indifferent to their own best interests. 'You will take supper, Mr.
                  Smooth?' inquired the man behind the mahogany. Before I had time to speak, he
                  pulled a bell that jingled like Jehu. And then there came scampering in a school
                  of negroes, so tidy, trim, and intelligent. One bowed—another smiled—a third
                  waited with a salutation my commands. 'Take care of Mister Smooth!' again spoke
                  the man behind the mahogany, as with an effort to be commanding in accent. That
                  they might know more emphatically (as Uncle Tom Benton says) that Mr. Smooth was
                  none of your common citizen, I turned my eyes on the darkies, and stared at them
                  until they turned pale. Then one possessed himself of my bundle: moving off with a
                  scientific motion, and a bow à la cabinet, he
                  bid me follow. Obeying his summons, onward we went, through a long, dark passage,
                  and into a spacious hall up stairs, where he said they eat their people. No sooner
                  was I bowed to a seat than a dozen gentlemen darkies set upon me in good earnest;
                  so fast did they beset me with eatables that I begun to think they had mistaken me
                  for a thanksgiving turkey about to be fatted for the table of the secretary of the
                  treasury. The fixins, as Mr. Samuel Slick would say, made one feel quite at home;
                  not so with the darkies: they recognizing my home spun, soon became sassy;
                  whereupon I turned round and set upon them with the broadest grin I
                  could summon. Nor could I withhold a
                  laugh at seeing them laugh. 'Reckon how mas'r's on big business to Washington wid
                  Mr. General Pierce,' says one, whose face was black, and bright, and full of the
                  quizzical; while another, with a flat crooked nose gave a cunning wink out of his
                  left eye. This being detected by a superior, in the brisk person of a son of the
                  Emerald Isle, who stood well six feet in his boots, a 'soucer' with the broad
                  front of his knuckle bones, between the colored gentleman's two eyes, was the
                  rejoinder—a most striking remonstrance, that laid him measuring the floor. Troth!
                  an' it's myself 'd stop yer botheration. Sure, ye dark spalpeens, is it by the
                  same token ye'd trate the gintleman? (Here the honest son of sweet Erin showed
                  signs of his Doneybrook getting the better of him.) 'Myself 'll take care of Mr.
                  Smooth—doesn't he belong to the self same party, the know-nothings? The divil a
                  such a country, as Hamirike: an' it's the boys from Donegal that 'ud be taking her
                  dignity in care.' Saying this, Mr. Patrick (for such was his name) stretched the
                  whole length of his important self over the table, and says:—I'm yers to the
                  buckle of my shoe, Mr. Smooth! It's a divil a one but yerself I'll vote for at the
                  next helection. Sure, an' didn't mysel jine the native Hamerikan party, with Tom
                  Connolly, afore we'd been two months on the beloved soil an', sure, it's Tom and
                  myself that's goin to put through the nonothin for ye.' Here Mr.
                  Patrick anxiously paused for a reply. To never say a bad thing when I could not
                  think of a good, ever has been my motto; so I returned his good-
                     natnre
                     nature
                   with saying:—'Give us yer hand, Mr. Patrick—we will forget the two, and
                  yet be one! and that our faith may be made strong, we will together do brown the
                  patriotism of these United States.
               'Ye better believe that!' returns Mr. Patrick, with an exultation of happiness;
                  and concluding with: "I'd kill every nager in the land, be the pipers I would! an'
                  it's the boys from old Ireland what does be keeping the bright face on pure
                  Hamirikan principles. Sure an' warn't it the brave boys that halicted Gineral
                  Pierce and his cumrades?' Here Mr. Patrick again paused, and with a wise look,
                  shook his head. 'We put the broad staunch face on the democracy,' again he
                  interjaculated with a mutter. Indeed, Mr. Patrick the reader will easily detect,
                  had the crude idea of right in his head; but, unfortunately, he could only get it
                  out in these simple and sideling insinuations. The negro, whom we have before
                  described as being knocked down, picked himself up and had nothing to say.
               "'There may be much in what you say, friend Patrick,' said I: 'The boys from
                  Donegal do with the elective franchise much that native-Homers in
                  their carelessness leave undone. Mr. Patrick acknowledged this, shook his head,
                  and said the fact, though deplorable, was preeminently established.
               "'Like every one who visits Washington these times, yer a friend of the Gineral's,
                  and have fit with him in the Mexican war?' again he inquired, seeming to
                  anticipate my answer. Of the Mexicans I know little—of the war less: it were well
                  our country made peace its friend, war its enemy. As to the General and his
                  fighting in Mexico, that was a matter that best affected himself; through it he
                  became a great potentate, but not so great a man; but, I accept the general idea
                  that he is now become troubled of a short memory. During this time I had not
                  forgotten number one—my supper! Having stowed it well away under my lining, I felt
                  very much like a man who had just turned away his back on Secretary Marcy, having
                  through personal friendship received the country's best collectorship. Seeing the
                  point of good-nature to which my feelings had arrived through the strong argument
                  of meats, Mr. Patrick proffered his services to navigate me out of the place where
                  he ate his people—through entries, 
                     orridores
                     corridors
                  , passages, halls, and down stairways, along which we were ever
                  encountering persons who, like Mr. Pierce, were groping their way in the dark. In
                  the course of time, and after much feeling and fumbling, I again encountered the
                  light of the mahogany counter, behind which stood the same individual I have
                  before described—his person so formidable, his face so full and fat, his hair so
                  sleek and smooth.
               "'Had a good supper, Squire Smooth?' says he, a broad smile spreading over his
                  broader face. On answering in the affirmative, he introduced me to numerous
                  unsatisfied politicians. One of this very numerous gentry, and of whom I had,
                  unfortunately, occasion to know more at a
                  subsequent period, (he was a man of grief from South Carolina), swore, by his
                  knowledge of southern rights and secession, that his State, so neglected, would
                  certainly go out of the Union. She had not a minister abroad—only Consul General
                  at Alexandria, which was said by the knowing ones to be somewhere in Egypt; and
                  where, to prove his strong faith in southern principles, and his independent
                  indifference to the feelings of thin-skin northerners, he had purchased two very
                  handsome Nubian slaves of the feminine gender. This was merely to illustrate the
                  truly American spirit of our institutions: perchance it might arouse from his
                  stupor the Viceroy, who not fully cognizant of the height of civilization to which
                  America had arrived, was making singular, and to me very praiseworthy efforts, to
                  free his people from the curse of enslaving men. To our patriotic Consul General
                  we say—go it!—a few more such examples will give the Egyptian an impression of our
                  liberty and christian love most strange: the brilliant light of our western star
                  will, I fear, have much in it to remind him of those darker days when his
                  forefathers built pyramids.
               "'Come to see the Gineral, I s'pose, stranger ' our Carolinian inquired, with a
                  suspicious look, touching a companion beside him on the arm. To his inquiry I
                  returned—nothing shorter! 'Cape Cod,' he followed with a respectful bow, 'did
                  noble work for the true democracy; she is great in sands, shoals, and cod-fish;
                  she will send General Pierce a chowder, as emblematic of his foreign policy—' Here
                  I interrupted by assuring him that Cape Cod could stand anything to the stomach
                  digestible; But whether she could digest the General was a doubtful question. Cape
                  Cod, be it known over the broad acres of this land, I added, has a spirit above
                  living on government: she turned disdainfully from the means that were fast
                  turning the functions of government into a machine for grinding out patronage—she
                  never sacrificed Uncle Sam for the sake of what is in his tin-trunk. At this,
                  which he was pleased to call an expletive, he begun to summon his dignity: at once
                  he stiffened in a manner that proved how much superior to me he considered
                  himself, and how much more of Uncle Sam's shiners were necessary to his conceived
                  maintenance. 'Cape Cod is the place,' says he folding his arms, moving to a more
                  piquant position, giving his person a little more importance, and making a target
                  of the brightly polished stove, against which he permitted a well-directed stream
                  of dark fluid to explode ere he wiped his lips.— 'Cape Cod is the place from
                  whence all persons come who profess to be born free and equal; but they are a
                  scrubby set—' Considering it a duty I owed to the nation, I again interrupted him.
                  'Cape Cod,' replied I, ' has got gumption, principle, and the spirit of a go-ahead
                  in her: she germinated the young American party. Understand, citizen, (here I
                  found spunk was necessary), a cape-coaster can at any time boast a full fair of
                  fish; if he draw them from Mr.John Bull's waters, so much the better. He is no
                  stranger to Mr. John Bull, whom he esteems rather a dogged fellow, pugnaciously
                  inclined at times, but never so bad as he seems; and though stubbornly behind the
                  age of progress, nor willing to believe in the principles of manifest destiny,
                  often improves upon acquaintance.'
               "'Good night, Mr. Smooth, said he hurriedly; 'when you tie up for the
                  night—remember me—! Hope to see you bright in the morning.' Off, like the handle
                  of a jug, he went. And now it being time to stow myself away, I hailed for a pilot
                  to navigate me safe into the seventh story. My fat friend at the counter, whose
                  eyes were becoming leaden, rung again the bell, and out scampered some dozen
                  darkies from nobody could discern where. I looked at the negroes with an
                  expression of excitement, and then, somewhat alarmed:—'Stranger,' says I, I these
                  'ere niggers a'int all going to put me through, be they?' He said he reckoned one
                  would do; and to a question as to what time I would complete the journey to bed,
                  he replied that seeing I was of the Young American stripe, and that the
                  distinguished of that party could do almost anything, provided I started soon I
                  would reach the destination about midnight. 'Now, providing it's any
                  accommodation, Mr. Smooth, we can send you to bed by steam. Say the word and up
                  you'll go!' he rapidly concluded, rapping with his fingers on the big book he had
                  so leisurely laid aside for the night, there being no chance of another customer
                  being caught this side of twelve o'clock. I shook my head and moved off, telling
                  him I did not appreciate being busted up.
                  'Ain't a mite of danger!' says he: 'why, stranger, we havn't killed more nor two
                  dozen this year or more.' That young America was a go-ahead I was fully conscious;
                  still, being somewhat anxious to extend a little friendly advice to Gineral
                  Pierce, I begged to be excused from all dangers, Young America must live to
                  proclaim the manifest destiny of a universal republic. You may lay aside your
                  steam fixings until a more expedient time to use them—'Here he interrupted by
                  saying my walking up would only save six cents;—' can put Mr. Smooth into the
                  machine and send him up in a jiffy. Further, we have got some dozen old gents here
                  who go to bed by steam every night!' I shook hands with the fellow, exchanged
                  glances, bid them good night all round, and trotted off, following the darky, who
                  wound his way round corridors, up stairs, and through passages for more than an
                  hour, (at least, I thought it was!), until I fancied we had got lost in an
                  interminable labyrinth of narrow passages. It was just after inauguration, which
                  fact was duly made known through the medium of sundry corks of champagne bottles,
                  which were sounding pop! pop!! pop!!! Again merry voices were heard announcing the
                  misfortunes of those about to pass out: while another whose voice seemed somewhat
                  mellow, said he had in his eye the office he wanted—exactly. A third voice, as if
                  echoed through a subterranean vault, said they must all be forbearing—the General
                  was so undecided in his opinions. Pretty soon, the negro, having wound his way
                  high up in the world, turned a corner, gave a tremendous guffaw, and opened the
                  door of a place that looked very much like a closet in which to stow away lean
                  lawyers. 'Now, Cuff! ye ain't goin to stow this citizen away in that ar place, be
                  ye ' says I.
               "Mas'r,' returns he, 'tis just the snuggest place ye ever did see; why! tain't da
                  length on ye, seein how mas'r can double himself up anyhow,-just as Gineral Pierce
                  do.' The darkey laughed and drew back with a bow, as I began to philosophise that,
                  being now so well up in the world, it was the best policy to coil up and invoke
                  Morpheus,—which I did, bidding good-night to all below, and promising myself a
                  pleasant interview with General Pierce on the 
                     folloving
                     following
                   morning.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               IN WHICH MR. SMOOTH HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL CASS.
               "SMOOTH had just stowed himself away in the shape of a figure 4, when there came a
                  voice as husky as Uncle Zack Peabody's conk, (which said conk had been used to
                  blow his way through the fogs of Newfoundland for nearly half a century),
                  saying:—' It's mighty tight squeezing there, ain't it, stranger?' Where the voice
                  came from seemed a puzzle for all creation. No room was there in the place for
                  another soul—all became as still and watchlike as the tomb. In fear and anxiety I
                  gazed upon the dark wall, and along it to the little window facing the avenue; and
                  there, behold! but tell it not in the Capitol, was the broad, burly face of
                  General Cass, like a wet moon in discontent. Unhappy with himself, he was peering
                  in at the window. Again he muttered:—, 'I can't get in! —such has always been my
                  fate.' The much-disappointed old gentleman bore such an expression of discomfiture
                  on his countenance, that Smooth was forced to the conclusion that to be sociable
                  would only be doing a good turn—more especially as the General and Uncle Sam never
                  got along well together. 'Then it's you, General?' says I: 'well, don't be in a
                  hurry!' After a short silence, he inquired if I could accommodate a traveller who
                  had been long on the road, and short of shot. I said I was not well to do for
                  room; but as to be obliging was the order of the day, and seeing that he was soon
                  to try another turn by joining the 'young American' party, I would see what could
                  be done. He had got upon the roof of the institution,—just where he could slip
                  backward with great ease, though it took some effort to go forward. Being somewhat
                  infirm of age, I took him gently by the hand and assisted him in, where I thought
                  he might, if he pleased, stand upon a square platform. The General was very polite, bore
                  strongly in his demeanor the marks of time and honor; I could not suppress the
                  capricious thought—that it was time a sly corner in the patent office were
                  provided for political relics of a past age, and he safely stowed away in it. All
                  things of a by-gone age should have their place; notwithstanding, knowing that
                  Uncle Sam and him had tried to be intimate friends, and that he had many warm and
                  substantial voters in the far West, I felt to be less than condescending would be
                  bad political policy. He took a seat, and began to get up his good-nature, as I
                  inquired what earthly mission he could be prosecuting on so dark and cold a
                  night.
               "'Well, now, friend Smooth,' he says: I like you, but the question you put so
                  honestly has a point which you cannot see, though I can painfully feel. However,
                  as I have no secrets, I don't mind telling you: it must be private, nevertheless—I
                  am sensitive not to have these matters spread all over the Union. To-night, you
                  see, a conclave of political wranglers met below, in this house. Conscious that
                  they would have a large 'grin' at me, discussing the means by which I
                  have always been the rejected of this great and growing people, I came that my
                  ears might lesson of fools. To this end, I mounted the chimney, and was
                  reconoitering down the black abyss, when my eye turned and caught your light, like
                  a star in tribulation, twinkling from the window. Strange kind of a tribune for a
                  senator, I admit, but I heard many judgments, and from them may draw many more.
                  One reckoned I had stamped with the cold hand of death my political life; always
                  wanting to fight somebody—the English in particular! Another said Virginia and
                  Pennsylvania couldn't approve of my policy—that it was too slow; while New York
                  dare not vote for me, and I was New England's dread. A third said he didn't
                  believe the middle West would back me up, because a doubt existed as to whether
                  other States would. These sentiments I heard from down chimney. My solemn belief
                  is, that I have been sacrificed to a firm and honest belief in the Monroe
                  doctrine; which, singularly enough, had its origin in English minds. My efforts to
                  carry it into effect seemed not to form a tangible objection; though a voice now
                  and then said it might lead to evil consequences, England and France having formed
                  a very unnatural alliance to put down the aggressive spirit of nations, without
                  respect to the side of the Atlantic on which they were domiciled. Then, by way of
                  a suspending clause, they said it was not so much my pugnacious propensities they
                  feared, as that, being an old fogy, full of personal grievances
                  against somebody, I would make the gratifying a venerable spleen paramount to the
                  interests of States (all this I heard from down chimney). That I was not a bad
                  man, nor an inflexible man, they all agreed; but that my time was passed was their
                  verdict, and being passed, I would myself soon pass into political
                  oblivion—nothing being left but executive expectations and ballet-boxes, with
                  which I might build on high a monument! The trouble is, friend Smooth, I am not
                  possessed of the tact of making the nation understand me; had I this all-necessary
                  to political fame, the Chief Magistracy had long since been mine. To me the free
                  press of our country is a sort of infernal machine,—its effect in my case
                  strengthens the idea. Having held me up as dangerous, when in truth I am a
                  peaceably disposed man, they have wronged me while misinforming the public.' Here
                  he paused, as his face assumed its wonted seriousness, and that wart, now
                  historical, looked brighter than ever. I had long been desirous of scraping
                  acquaintance with the old man, whom I esteemed much better inside than out, so I
                  offered him half of my shingle, at the same time intimating that we would have
                  some whiskey. At this he lowered his voice, and continued with a slow shake of the
                  head:—'I'm not so bad as I seem. Peradventure I wanted a small chance at the
                  Britishers. I hate them, but that only signifies a trifle. Mr. Pierce, like a horn
                  lantern for which Uncle Caleb and Jeff furnish the light, is fast getting affairs
                  into a fuzzle; this must be so while the light is thus furnished, and the
                  regulation of its burning be left to Grandpapa Marcy. Fact is, you see, Mr.
                  Smooth, the administration is become like a steam-engine, Mr. Pierce being used as
                  a piston by Caleb, Jeff, and Co., who, in addition, furnish Southern-rights for
                  fuel, use patronage as a condenser, and make a safety valve of Papa Marcy. But
                  Papa has yet to take many lessons in National Engineering before his control over
                  the machine is complete.' I watched the old man's anxious eye as he spoke; and again suggested the taking a little whiskey:
                  I pitied him. 'It will set ye all right!' says I, 'it'll take the fogyism all out,
                  warm up yer inards, and make yer ideas come out with the philosophy of a Mara beau. Mr. Pierce loves to traffic in the language
                  of war, but like all little creatures, makes his noise and stops.'
               'Well, in obedience to my friendship for you, Smooth—and with the knowledge that
                  you are going into business with Uncle Sam—appreciating the 'Young American' party
                  as I do, I don't care if I take. It may revive the hope of 1856. After all, there
                  is something in you New Englanders I like—give us yer hand,' he replied suddenly,
                  as a soft smile spread over his hard face. He commenced wiping his lips, and was
                  so polite. I rang the bell, and up came the negro, his face as full of alarm as a
                  frightened moon in a hail-storm. Alarmed at his appearance, the General sprang to
                  his feet, and was for bolting through the window. 'Don't be scared, General!' says
                  I, trying to suppress a laugh; 'put on the pluck of Young America—niggers then
                  will seem as nothing.' Mr. Pierce pursues this course. General knows it takes
                  somebody to cut a figure in the world; and seeing that these United States
                  constitute a free country, what violation of principle is there in doing with
                  negroes what you please? The steaming punch now awaited us; I filled the General's
                  glass, and he said 'this was a great country, which would soon send Young America
                  out on the world to proclaim manifest destiny.' I said amen, and the punch
                  disappeared into his depot, as he concluded. It was clear his inards warmed, he
                  beginning to brighten up soon after. With a laconic air, he touched me on the
                  elbow, and said, 'Somehow, it seems to touch the right place—I declare it does! I
                  am half inclined to the belief that General Pierce sups formidably of this just
                  before he talks about winding things up in a straight sort of way, all of which he
                  ultimately forgets: the influence of this sort of steam was undoubtedly that which
                  selected Minister Solan Borland the man for Central America. It was not that
                  friend Solan went to settle perplexing questions with that dwarf combination of
                  helpless governments; it was enough that he amused sundry citizens and much
                  annoyed others with the little fracases cases which, through the power of
                  political steam, he was wont to indulge in.'
               "'Now, Uncle Cass!' said I, interrupting him, at the same time adding a
                  good-natured wink, 'you must excuse Smooth's seeming intrusiveness; but, what do
                  you think of annexation in general, and filibustering and taking Cuba in
                  particular?' At this, the General gave a knowing pause, scratched his head as if
                  it was troubled with something, and then replied with much 
                     drynes
                     dryness
                  : 'Ah! the one is a subject popular to-day, the other is fast becoming
                  so: when both are equally popular, we may advocate them with safety. Mr. Pierce
                  understands this policy. That which is popular and holds out advantages must go
                  down in our go-ahead country. According to the axiom of our Southern doctrines we
                  must have Cuba: she must be wedded in political bonds to Cape Florida; not for the
                  purpose of consolidating niggerdom, but merely to complete in that direction the
                  point of manifest destiny.'
               "'Lord love yer political faith, General!' said I, rising up and taking him firmly
                  by the hand.
               "'Ye'll do for the Young America, that ye will! There'll be no more old-fogyism—no
                  more of the slow-coach school! Take another bumper, and you'll be ripe for the new
                  party.' The General, with less dignity than you might have supposed him capable of
                  condescending to, filled his glass, drew his chair back, threw his square figure
                  well over the arms, and roared right out until it became dangerous. At length he
                  began to drink his whiskey, and that stopped his joy for a time. But he soon broke
                  out afresh. 'What on earth is the matter with you, stranger? you ain't going to
                  make a shaking machine of your broad sides, be ye?' says I, giving him a look that
                  would have pierced a stone wall.
               "'You must excuse me, Mr. Smooth, but the principles of your party would make
                  anybody laugh; why!—its sprouting members are all growing out of their breeches.
                  Where, in that stretchy imagination the party possesses, can you find a place for
                  the moon, which of necessity must follow in the train of annexation?' he inquires
                  seriously.
               'Put it? Why, Gineral, you have been stowed away so long, keeping dog-watch over
                  fogyism, that you don't comprehend how Uncle Sam has been transformed into a go-ahead chap to suit the times. Consul
                  Saunders 'll bridge the Gulf Stream, and thus unite Cuba and Cape Florida; and,
                  his pockets well lined with letter-writing materials, be first to march over it
                  and proclaim manifest destiny to the natives. As for the moon, George will find a
                  place in the compact for her.'
               "'But, Mr. Smooth,' says he, 'what in the name of changes be you going to do with
                  so many little kingdoms? A thousand years will scarcely people our present domain!
                  Now, Smooth, I'll cut out a small job for the Young American party:—let them, just
                  to give a specimen of their principles, step across to Europe and help Louis and
                  Uncle John (I hate John, though) whip Nicholas, and turn vacillating, faithless
                  Austria into a republic, with principle and spirit equal to her position as a
                  nation.' The General looked serious as he concluded—so far as whipping Austria was
                  concerned we would be only too glad did she for once throw off her cowardice and
                  afford us an opportunity. She had long played at thimblerig with doty old Mr. John
                  Bull, before whose eyes she had placed the spectacles of fantasy, the changes of
                  which the poor old gentleman's very refined sense and undeniable diplomacy had not
                  permitted him to comprehend. Austria was like the thief who set himself up as
                  umpire to settle between two knaves of his own cloth, and, while he gave advice to
                  both, was securing to himself the very plunder which gave rise to the dispute.
                  Nicholas, John Bull said, was a ruffian of the go-ahead school; but, of the three
                  ruffians, which shall we choose? history may be the teacher! Ruffians, however,
                  may do good at times, in which sense Nicholas was entitled to more consideration
                  than Mister Bull, in his frenzy, was willing to accord. Thus saying, the General
                  and me took another glass, shook hands, and bowed most politely. Again I stretched
                  myself down for the night, as he (promising to call again and have another talk)
                  disappeared out of the window.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               MR. SMOOTH'S DREAM.
               "LEAVING CASS holding on at the slippery roof. I dreamed that the ghost of Benton,
                  in contemplation bestrode the summit of the Rocky Mountains; that 'Young America,'
                  like a Colossus with monster limbs stretched across a world, was endeavouring to
                  wake from their stupor the nations. With a voice like unto lazy thunder murmuring
                  in the distance was he proclaiming his hatred of kings, into whose dominions he
                  threatened to march great armies, and whom he described as curses sent upon the
                  earth by the evil one: for the Evil One sought to promote self, a
                  means to which he found in those intrigues by which he made strong his court—the
                  same was the trade of kings. Again the voice thundered forth—'Here are the
                  instruments that have destroyed a world of human beings, and for a selfish purpose
                  gloated over the blood they had made run in torrents.' I looked, and behold!
                  appeared there before me a terrible devil, of hideous form having two great horns,
                  on one of the long sharp points of which was poised a king, on the other a fat
                  bishop in his lawn. The two perpetual mischief-makers, and desolators thus poised,
                  he came with a hideous roar, threatening to drown them in the river of unrefined
                  common sense. And then there was written in broad letters of fire across the
                  shoulders of this sturdy devil—'Kingcraft and Churchcraft have cursed the nations
                  of the earth, and turned to blight the blessings of the True God!' Again this
                  significant edict vanished, and in its place there came, as in letters of gold,
                  Cheap Government and no Established Church—let the nations be ruled in wisdom and
                  right!' This had reference to good old England, not America, for here bishops are
                  known to be meek and good. All this was a dream: but then there came, soaring
                  giant-like, 'Young America,' and manifest destiny which he spread over the land for the benefit of mankind.
                  Then there came a great darkness, followed by a little light that crept feebly
                  onward as if fearing to spread itself on the broad disc of the horoscope—it was
                  the light of Mr. Pierce, beneath which hovered doubtful devils. How rapacious they
                  seemed! They saw the doubts and fears of his little light, and would fain carry
                  him off into purgatory ere it died out. But his saviours came: they were the
                  ghosts of those great lights that founded the pillars of our Republicanism. Down
                  they sat, in ghostly conclave, and with instruments in hand set about driving away
                  the carrier devils and working the problem of Mr. Pierce's political policy. It
                  was impossible!—not all the trigonometry of which they were masters sufficed to
                  aid them in the task. It seemed like attempting to solve the principle of that
                  which never had one. He stood on a platform of sections, each of which turned at a
                  touch, and seemed giving way for want of strength. Indeed, as beheld in the dream,
                  he could play the game of uncertainty through a dozen focuses. The jury of ghosts
                  became sorely perplexed; then they began to put to him some very honest questions,
                  as to what his intentions really were. And while doing this the spirit of
                  Washington, arrayed in glory, looked down upon its feeble successor, and with an
                  ironical smile shook its head.
               "Then there came an unaccented voice from the little light—the light said to be
                  the impersonation of Pierce; indeed, it was of kindred with the shadow in that
                  singular romance by Hawthorn, called the life of Pierce! And the voice said:—'I
                  shall be known by my practice. Just then the little light became dimmer, and
                  turned away toward a long dark avenue, where the vista seemed studded with the
                  faces of disconsolate 'niggers.' At this the ghost of Webster yawned, and that of
                  Calhoun scowled fiercely and contemptuously; while Clay's rubbed its eyes and wept
                  tears of pity. Again all was darkness. Then there came again the little light of
                  which I have spoken;—it was the light of Mr. Pierce. It flickered and fluttered,
                  and thus we identified it. 'We have to deal with Europe—with that happy alliance
                  my very amiable Lord Clarendon says is for purposes not alone in Europe. My lord's
                  language, however, is so cleverly diplomatic—that is, it can be made to mean
                  anything or nothing,—as to need a translation. My lord means, that when it has
                  served to curb the national ambition of certain nations of Europe it may be turned
                  to the same purpose in another but more congenial hemisphere. Kossuth wants
                  material aid—such as saddles, tin, &c. &c. I would give it him, if he
                  would teach Austria a lesson of honesty! Nevertheless, as to Louis himself I would
                  be extremely cautious, for being more a blower than a moulder, nd having a
                  peculiar talent for getting affairs very crooked, the instrument in the man is of
                  questionable ability;—indeed, in a crisis between nations, such an instrument
                  should he examined with great skill and delicacy before being set in motion.' He
                  spoke after this manner, and quick as thought the spectacle vanished—it was but a
                  dream? Not a ghost was seen; no lurid face cast its pale shadow over the dark
                  canvas; the pure spirit of Washington had departed in hopeless despair. I was
                  about to read a prayer, when the dark canvas moved aside, and there, real as life,
                  sat on a slave's grave the immaculate Brigadier;—he, reader, was sipping whiskey
                  toddy, as if it were his wont. Old Bunkum was the slave whose grave he sat upon.
                  It was a strange penance over the mound of one so old; and yet who in the
                  political world that had not paid it? 'Why!—Bunkum, you are barefoot;' a voice
                  spoke.
               'Remember, old man, you must keep on the stiff,—it's as necessary to success as it
                  was to believe the old Constitution frigate could whip anything afloat.' It was
                  the General who spoke to the ghost of Bunkum, who, having risen from the grave,
                  stood before him, moody and despairing. In ecstasy he grasped the hand of the cold
                  figure cried out that his soul's love was with him. But in his exuberance he let
                  the whiskey run over the green grave, into which the ghost soon disappeared and
                  left him alone to his contemplations. Bunkum, like Billy Bowlegs, who has too much
                  sense for the great father, says he has wandered through all weathers, and endured
                  all kinds of political farcery: now that he had become old, and served as long as
                  the god of sacrifice, would they not let him rest in peace?' Here the General
                  seemed alone and forlorn: then he wept bitterly, until the ghost of Bunkum in pity
                  again appeared and with him sat upon the grave. The General kindly took him by the
                  hand, and in his ear whispered ed
                  something, the only part of which became audible was—'When as President of this
                  great country I became, I was bound—' Here the man paused. A kindlier feeling now
                  came over Bunkum, in evidence of which he motioned as if he would take another
                  drop of whiskey with the President, or ask a favor he was delicate about
                  broaching. For a man who had so long looked upon things beneath him his reserve
                  was to be appreciated, especially when viewed in comparison with the expectations
                  of those many numerous friends, all of whom expected foreign missions. Having
                  chatted and sipped together a sufficient length of time, and as Bunkum was about
                  to say good by, he turned with a half significant smile, and touching
                  the General on the elbow, said:—'Ye ain't got a spare hat and pea-jacket to lend a
                  body?'
               "'Bless you, Bunkum, you are of the South!—anything you want is at your bidding.
                  New England (she's a trump!) can take care of herself; let the storm threaten as
                  it may, she never trips. We must do for 
                     Kentuck
                     Kentucky
                   and Carolina:—the black pig must have his swill if the rest find an
                  empty trough.' 'Thank you! thank you! General; our States will stand firm to
                  you—Bunkum himself never will forsake you;' spoke thus thankfully the ghost of the
                  old man as it took leave of the old General and disappeared. Here I awoke from my
                  dream to painful reflections."
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               A MORNING ADVENTURE.
               "AS Uncle Sam is equally careless of his language and cash, he will excuse a
                  crooked beginning and accept a straight ending. Contemplating my crooked dream I
                  confess I waked up without a straight idea in my head. The fact was, I was waked
                  up with such an incomprehensible jingling, ringing, rumbling, and gonging, that I
                  mistook its purport, and thought the Russians were bombarding the house. I was
                  about looking out of the window to see if the White House was all safe, when a
                  negro with a countenance blacker than vengeance protruded his fizzy head into the
                  door, and without a morsel of knocking commenced grinning. 'Anything wanted for
                  Major Smooth?' inquires he; and without waiting for an answer, catches up the bed,
                  Smooth and all the fixins, and set them somewhat aside. Not so fast, Cuff!' said
                  I; 'Smooth is no Major—plain Mister Smooth from the Cape.'
               "'Lor, Mas'r' replied the negro, interrupting me; 'when in Washington t'wont do to
                  be a mite less than a Major-General. Every man what come to dis city widout his
                  title better come widout himself. Our clerk what stand at the hogany counter be a
                  General,—Jones, the ostler, be a Colonel; and Wilkes what keep the oyster shop
                  ober yonder be a Major! As for Captains, they are as thick and of as little use as
                  blackbirds. Will you take somethin?' The sagacious negro bowed, and waited for a
                  reply. I told him that being invited to a fish breakfast with the General at the
                  'White House,' I would forbear to liquor until I had made my bow.
               "'S'pose you'll take the customary gin cock-tail, Mr. Smooth?' the negro rejoined,
                  with an anxious air. Evincing my surprise at such a proposition, I assured him I
                  did not know its meaning. 'Don't know what it is!' he exclaimed, with a deep sigh.
                  'A very fashionable drink,' he continued;
                  'gemmen what see de General, and study national affairs, all take some on em in da
                  mornin.'
               "'Now, Cuff,' I rejoined, 'just tell the truth; you mean that in order to keep the
                  dignity up, it is necessary to take something stiff in the mornin?'
               ",'Dat him, mas'r,' says he in reply, accompanying it with a broad guffaw. 'When
                  mas'r bin to de White House, and seem serious, as if he ain't got what he want, he
                  put a cock-tail down to make de glorious come up; it be a great anecdote for what
                  mas'r call de blues.' The interpretation of what the negro said was that it made a
                  man feel as if he had the best office in Mr. Pierce's gift safe in his pocket.
                  Having a reasonable appreciation of a negro's statement, I consented on the ground
                  of its good qualities—thus represented—to take a little. The negro left, but soon
                  returned with it in his hand—all bittered and iced. Down it went, plump!—it cut
                  away the cobwebs, made my inards fizzle, and the whole frame feel as lively as a
                  bee-hive. The negro said it was good—and I said I reckoned. And then I 'turned
                  out,' as they call it, broadside on. 'Great kingdom,' exclaimed the negro, giving
                  me a slanting look from head to foot;'why, mas'r, dey must a growed ye in a guano
                  country.'
               'Cuff! don't be sassy,' I replied. And then he very good-naturedly commenced
                  arranging my homespun. He fussed over me as if I were a mere substance to be
                  transformed into anything Mr. Pierce might require. Then, to my utter
                  astonishment, he apprised me of the fact of General Cass having carried off my
                  boots and breeches—adding that it was a sort of mania with him, and for which he
                  was not morally accountable. Then the negro began quizzing my person. One of my
                  legs, he said, was hard shell, the other a soft shell; however, to reconcile the
                  matter, he further added that the embodiment was exactly suited to Mr. Pierce's
                  principles, inasmuch as he could go between—which he always aimed to do. He then
                  said I must have pantaloons of the right stripe; because in Washington a man must
                  look genteel, and have his understandings straight. It was no excuse that the
                  General himself was an undecided Democrat; if he was round. in some things, he was
                  square in others,—that is he was round in policy, and square in periods. The Negro
                  said he did not look so much at the cut of the pantaloons as the quality of the
                  cloth, and its tenacity for stretching—according to the expectations of the 'Young
                  American' party.
               "Upon this assurance, I ordered him to repair to the tailor's, which he did, and
                  was not long in returning and bringing with him a pair of fashionables suited to
                  the times. 'Great country,' said he, holding them before me and shaking his black
                  sides with laughter. Into them I slid myself; the bottoms only reached a little
                  below my knees. The negro, with eyes like astonished stars, set upon the straps,
                  and such a tugging and pulling as there allowed! I began to think I was being
                  pulled in two, after the fashion of Mister Pierce's promises and performances),
                  when Cato, (such was the negro's name), his face almost white with exertion,
                  begged I would not be alarmed—that he would very soon get them all right! In
                  another minute something went—pop! Simultaneously with the report was my head
                  driven clean through the pine-board ceiling into a chamber unfortunately occupied
                  by a lean old maid of some forty-seven summers. 'Good mornin, missus,' I said,
                  trying to make a bow; 'hope I ain't intruding.' The old lady looked mighty
                  streaked, and would'nt be pacified, until I told her I was merely giving a few
                  feats, just to illustrate the principles of the 'Young American' party. It's only
                  Young America, ma'am, he's cutting the three figures of his sentiments, as made
                  known by his particular stars,—Soulé, Saunders, and Sickles. Did'nt intend to
                  disturb you, my good woman,' says I. I wanted to seem polite—to put the very best
                  foot forward; but it was to no earthly use. The old critter screamed, jumped out
                  of the bed, and like a ghost shaking his cotton to the storm, ran away in
                  dismay.
               "'Good Christopher Columbus!' exclaimed the negro, almost bursting with fright.
                  With this he commenced pulling and jerking at my legs, until, finding his efforts
                  useless, he hastened down stairs and spread the alarm. Major Smooth was in an
                  alarming situation!—'most dying!—would breathe his last!—warn't no help fo'h
                  him!—must die, sartin!! Such a ringing and dinging of bells, such a tampering up
                  stairs, such a puffing and blowing of excited citizens as followed, never was
                  heard or seen before. Although in a tight
                  place, I was neither alarmed nor crest fallen. Indeed, I thought I'd enjoin the
                  old lady on the other side to enter upon the discussion of a political question,
                  just by way of keeping up the characteristic sociability of the nation. Presently
                  about a dozen dangerously excited faces presented themselves in the room. 'He's
                  gone, certain,' says one; 'Major Smooth's a cold chicken,' mutters another; 'Young
                  America's cutting a figure,' rejoins a third; ' he's only at rest while performing
                  some overt act,' interposes a fourth. 'Much you know about it!' says I, cool as
                  Labrador: 'I merely put my head through this ere place for the purpose of being
                  friendly with this lone female lodger—pull me out!' In right good earnest they
                  seized me by the boots, saying:—'Let us bring Young America into a respectable
                  position;' and with the most unmerciful jerks they laid me measuring the floor. In
                  no wise disconcerted, I picked myself up, and inquired if they had another strap
                  to loan me. With the exception of Cato, the negro, they all enjoyed a good laugh;
                  he had no sooner relieved me, than he commenced raising a fuss about my damaging
                  the ceiling—never for once taking Mr. Smooth's head into consideration. Young
                  America, he said, was always too fast—always getting into trouble and calling upon
                  others to help him out."
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               MR. SMOOTH FINDS HIS PATH TO THE WHITE HOUSE A DIFFICULT ONE.
               "'GOOD MORNING, Mr. Smooth!' saluted the fat man behind the mahogany, as I entered
                  the office, having escaped from my perilous position in the seventh story. In
                  addition, he took a lunar observation all along down my hull, which he said was a
                  mighty tough sort of craft, and had received no damage for which the house could
                  be held responsible.
               "As if to make the picture more complete, a number of anxious-looking individuals
                  (all firm friends of Uncle Sam) crowded about me, each putting some curious
                  question in reference to my expectations and the Executive and his gifts. Many of
                  these important gentry had proboscises largely developed and very red; indeed, the
                  reddest nose was strongest evidence of the 'best office-seeker; albeit, some
                  waggishly inclined gentleman had said that the most generously red-nosed man
                  always esteemed his deserts to be no less than that of United States Minister at
                  some very fashionable foreign Court, where the good red of a well-developed nose
                  was significant of pure blood. 'Well now, gents,' I returned, 'you needn't be
                  trying to poke your political fun at this citizen! Young America is all right yet.
                  Put me on the track of Mr. Pierce's whereabouts.' Seeing they were facetiously
                  inclined, I summoned that independence so necessary to a citizen of standing. At
                  this moment, one more politely inclined than the rest, stepped forward, and
                  commenced giving me the ins and outs of the way to see the Brigadier, who, lie
                  said, was surrounded by many fairweather courtiers. Stepping politely to the door,
                  he, with grace not unbecoming, raised a well-gloved hand, and half whispered:—Mr.
                  Smooth will walk into the avenue—keep on
                  the West side—join the throng (they are all officials in embryo)—be sure and look
                  as serious as they do; and with them you will arrive at the 'White House' to take
                  your place and chance.' Oh! chance! 'There is no missing the way, Mr. Smooth; get
                  behind some well-dressed citizen—one who looks as if he were in pursuit of
                  something the means of securing which he had made sure. Follow that man!' I
                  thanked him for his civility,—he seemed one of Uncle Sam's bone-breakers, and
                  sallied out under the happy contemplation that a gentleman from Cape Cod was on a
                  par with the same species of mankind from South Carolina. It was true that with
                  what little aristocracy we boasted—and in that little there was truly a great
                  blessing, inasmuch as it illustrated the fact of there being one spot on this
                  earth where common sense had got the better of refined sense—was founded in the
                  possession of 'niggers,' the number giving rank in the scale. In the small but
                  very aristocratic atmosphere of democratic South Carolina it had been proposed to
                  establish an order of the American garter, the means entitling to membership being
                  the possession of a very large number of fat negroes and negresses: and to
                  ingratiate the august order it was proposed to make Colonel Wade Hampton first
                  knight, and Lady Tyler first knightess. The reader, Mr. Smooth feels assured, will
                  pardon this little digression, which he will set down to my love for that darling
                  little State.
               "I soon muddled my way along with the crowd, among which there were very long
                  faces, very short faces, and faces from which nothing could be extracted—the comic
                  faces always kept behind! As a matter of policy I got behind the man who had the
                  longest and most quizzical face; for he gave out signs of seeing daylight through
                  political darkness. I made his acquaintance, and found him of the free-and-easy
                  school. 'On your way to see the General, stranger?' I inquired, edging up to him
                  in a polite sort of way—at the same time keeping up the free-and-easy. 'No,' he
                  answered with a laconic air, and a half significant shrug of the shoulder, 'I'm
                  merely strolling this way, leisurely contemplating. I take it you have not been
                  long in the Capital?' he added. 'You are right on that point, citizen,' said I in
                  return.
               "'Expecting a good appointment?' he continued to inquire quire, philosophically.
                  Well, it may be: s'pose you're in for a Ministership, if you come out a martyr,' I
                  replied, adding a Western wink which is given with both eyes. He very
                  good-naturedly acknowledged that I had hit the mark, gave me his arm, said we must
                  look in somewhere by the way-side and taste a small drop of Young American
                  whiskey, which would have the effect of making stronger our friendship. This we
                  did, drinking a good time to Mr. Pierce. No sooner was the whiskey down than all
                  his ideas came straight up. He said he was none of yer small fry;—like thunder he
                  had stumped it for General Pierce; like electricity he had down in Georgia and
                  Western Alabama carried everything for true democracy. 'Reckon Mr. Smooth never
                  was down South?' he concluded, in parenthesis. I assured him I never was; but that
                  I had heard it was great of office-holders, and persons who would, with every
                  consideration for the Union in general, hold the federal government very fast. To
                  this he merely bowed in confirmation. To another question, which was rather of a
                  delicate nature, he said the South did not so much value the emoluments of office;
                  but her sons reverenced the noble qualities of their forefathers, with whom
                  dignity was inherent,—and it was they that were best qualified to maintain and
                  spread its influence for the benefit of the nation. It was the dignity of the
                  nation, made manifest in its government, the South sought to maintain. So said my
                  friend, whose name was Pringle Pierpont—well acquainted with Uncle Sam. All of a
                  sudden he laughed outright, saying I was ignorant of the 'why and how to do,
                     diplomacy of Washington. What it is impossible to get you must always
                  say you never wanted; and what is within your reach, always say was far beyond our
                  expectations. Meantime, be a philosopher, and act with apparent indifference to
                  what is going on around you: never tell a friend you are worth less than one
                  hundred thousand dollars. Upon such an hypothesis you may face the General, talk
                  profound (here and there in parenthesis letting out your knowledge of foreign
                  affairs), but never give him to understand that you can extract crooked and put
                  straight ideas into his head—above all, be sure and feel as independent as a
                  wood-sawyer at two dollars a day. Play well your face, and a spoil of the game just won will be yours. Marcy is father
                  of this principle! Heed not the sympathy between your heart and head,—while the
                  one feels high never let the other play low. Accept anything the General may be
                  pleased to offer, adding that it is in respect to his great talent and your
                  anxiety to keep respectable his foreign affairs; and think how you belie your
                  conscience the while. Now, Smooth, you will see how open-armed the General will be
                  to see me!"
               "I told Mr. Pierpont how glad I was to hear it, seeing that it might be the means
                  of putting me through on the same hook. Without hesitation, he said he would do
                  what he could. Had I fought in the Mexican war the case would have been
                  different—had I been true to the South, the case had been very different: the
                  distinctions here enumerated brought down the scale. However, the General and me
                  are one, having fought by his side in Mexico, and you shall be put through.' So
                  saying, we proceeded on our way, reaching in a few minutes the White House, the
                  gardens of which we found transplanted with citizens—set here and there as thick
                  as the gardener's tulips. Before the circular carriage-way that sweeps to the
                  great entrance, filed a rampart of moody faces. Mr. Mulligan said they were there
                  for the study of Botany, he believed. Near the great portico stood the tall figure
                  of a man plainly dressed in blackest broadcloth; he sauntered about as if
                  contemplating some hopeless game of party. Another looked as if he had just sprung
                  from a dressing-case to present himself before Grandpapa Marcy, in the hope of his
                  personal appearance making stronger his claims to a very acceptable appointment. A
                  third had a woe-begone smile on his face, and seemed studying the nature of a
                  plant that would soon need a careful hand. When accosted concerning his musings,
                  he said he had done battle right manfully for the democracy; and now Mr. Pierce's
                  only reply was, that his demands were of so hard a nature as to render it
                  impossible for him to knock under. I told him that I would take the small points
                  of Mr. Pierce's ideas, and the strong points of Mr. Marcy's, and from them try to
                  work out the P's and Q's of his case.
               "'You don't know if the General is at home, do you?' I inquired of him, with as
                  much good intention as it were possible to put in a question. 'Know nothing about
                  him since he's possessed himself of the White House!—My name is Major Sykes, of
                  the Hard Shells, New York! I know as little of him as the country did before he
                  was elected:—now and then I see him smoking a long nine while laying off at his
                  ease, his dirty boots sticking out of the east window. Here I interrupted by
                  asking if it were possible such charges could be true. 'True!' (exclaimed he, more
                  gritty than ever), 'true as daylight; the nation may bless itself if he stops
                  there. Be careful, my down-east friend, be careful. He will sell you for a mess of
                  corn for his black pig. Down-east will stand no chance until Down-south gets
                  satisfactorily served: a wondrous change has come over the General since he left
                  the granite hills of his native State, where he did the law trade in a small way.
                  Now—Smooth, I think they call you, says he—if I be not much mistaken the General
                  will create a Babylon of parties, the result of which will render it difficult to
                  define his own position. If the General would but get up a cross between southern
                  secessionists and northern free-soilers, how happily it would illustrate his
                  policy.' Clasping his hand, 'Major Sykes,' said I, 'I pity you.' 
               "'And so do I you,' he replied quickly. 'And when you come face to face with the
                  General, think of Uncle Sam, but don't forget yourself,—that is the
                     motto!' Saying thus, he started off, much after the fashion of a man who
                  feels somewhat fudgy. Duly esteeming the position of a man who has that in his
                  composition which gives power to manliness, and has higher motives than political
                  for its aims, I made my way to the entrance of the White House, whistling Yankee
                  Doodle as I went. The closer I got to the great doors the more violent became the
                  crowd, until at last it ended in a jam of bodies. 'Not so fast!' exclaimed an
                  anxious individual, whose eyes darted terror from their very sockets.
                  'Gentlemen!—it's my turn,' re-echoes another half-stifled voice. 'Was not I in the
                  city seven weeks before the inauguration? and didn't I carry everything for the
                  General down in Pennsylvania? roars a tall individual, whose hat had received what
                  may be called a shocking smash. Then they swayed forward in a serf of bodies. Now
                  it poised, as if for breath; then again it swayed onward, threatening limb and
                  wind. An exceedingly lean gentleman, with
                  a hard brown face, and a patch over his left eye, cried out to the figure that
                  stood bowing at the door, and demanded that his card be first taken to the
                  General, whom he was kind enough to declare a right good fellow and a most
                  intimate friend of his. 'Perhaps you have a claim that way!' retorts a sharp
                  voice, which belonged to a sturdy figure well out at the elbows. He declared he
                  had driven the whigs out of Old North Carolina—had carried strong the, State for
                  Pierce and posterity. Another individual near by, and who seemed inclined to doubt
                  the assertion, suggested whether it were not more probable he carried all the
                     watering establishments of that renowned state, seeing that his
                  nose and eyes had stood the storm of spirits. No one ever heard of his carrying
                  anything else! 'True,' rejoined another: 'he can drink his way through a
                  democratic canvass, tell the most amiable lies, absorb any amount of chaffing, and
                  stands less at swearing than any other man in the country: more than all, he can
                  demolish the King's English at a stroke.' Such pulling, hauling, squeezing and
                  yawning, 'cussin' and swearing-such cross-firing, crooked joking, and slang jibes,
                  never before was seen in such perfect medley. In calmer moments, even the
                  hard-fisted, iron-hearted, unterrified and never-washed democracy would have shed
                  a few blushes over it. Old democracy was nowhere—Young America was triumphant; his
                  sprouts were up and coming.
               "'Clear the way there!' I exclaimed, raising my voice to a point. 'Mr. Smooth will
                  walk in, and himself present his card to the General.' The crowd looked
                  amazed,—begun to give way. 'Mr. Smooth, citizens,' continued I, motioning as if it
                  were my intention to speechify, 'is something of a body—don't stand none of your
                  small fritters. Mr. Smooth—like the principles of his party—was intended for
                  cutting a figure in the world; he will unmask aristocracy, whip creation, and
                  demonstrate the truth of manifest destiny.' Then they all shouted a fashionable
                  hee-haw, by which they hoped to drive me off the track; but it was no go. '
                     Clar
                     Clear
                   the way,' says I, 'or I'll split the crowd like a thousand of bricks!' I
                  accompanied the word with a terrible look, at which they filed right and left as I
                  chased square up to the inner door, where stood a stiff sort of person, whose
                  clothes had grown on him—so tight were they. Surprised at my sudden approach, he
                  first gave many nervous winks and blinks, and then added the silly airs of my Lord
                  Spoonbill's menial, who, with hair buttered and powdered, knew but the servilities
                  of flunkeyism. 'Is the General at home?' I demanded, adding before he had time to
                  answer, that if he had a spare lucifer I'd have no objection to taking a smoke
                  with him. With the consequence of a sleepy congressman, he inquired if my business
                  with the General was special. He seemed to have the keeping of the General, much
                  after the fashion of a keeper who guards the wild animal of a menagerie.
               "'You must send up your card: it's a question whether he is out of his morning
                  gown and slippers, however!' Here the man looked doubtingly at the card, then gave
                  his head a significant shake.
               "General ain't got so mighty big since he moved from New Hampshire?' I inquired,
                  as the fellow hesitated and again viewed me from the extreme points. 'Now, Uncle
                  Sam, to you I would say a word, hoping, in the spirit of a very good christian,
                  that it may be received as wholesome advice. You, Sam, are forgetting that fame
                  which should reflect us in future ages; you, Sam, are assisting those who would
                  lay sullied hands on our pure republicanism—who would sink it in the political
                  slough, and build over it the reeking bastard of a pitiable tyranny. Stretch out
                  thy hand, Sam, that we may cease to cut before the world and the rest of mankind
                  so sorry a figure. Sam! you have sent your little villains out upon the world;
                  recall them ere they prove themselves great fools at our expense.'
               "Well, to go back:—I began to push my way past the flunkey, when he summoned his
                  brass and said I couldn't come in—that I must slide myself into costume of the
                  eight stripe! This to me was neither diplomatic nor polite. And being deemed
                  impolite, according to the rules of our Young America, I placed the broad front of
                  my knuckle-bones between his observators, (just to bring out his spunk), and
                  demanded to know what they charged in Washington for a few knockings-down. To
                  which he elongated himself, and with cool assurance said it had never before been
                  his fortune to be put through the process—hence he was not prepared to figure up
                  the amount. A place called limbo, he
                  said, was just over at the corner; that I better keep an eye to it. This last
                  saying gave the crowd outside furniture for a good laugh; they, the citizens, set
                  to quizzing me about the hang of my breeches, which they were pleased to call
                  diplomatic. This, I inferred, was in consequence of Grandpapa Marcy having gone to
                  there was no knowing how deep into the breeches business, hoping thereby to
                  prevent plain American citizens making very unplain apes of themselves when
                  abroad. Indeed, neighbor Marcy would demonstrate to the world that cloth and
                  diplomacy were two very different things. And this doctrine my Uncle Buck—all
                  praise to his name—fully endorsed,—that is, he proved himself the only American
                  minister not given to purloined crests and crimson cloth.
               "'Smooth is a nine-cornered citizen in the rough: he needs polishing down with a
                  federal holly-stone before he can be admitted into good society:' a voice like the
                  creaking of a door resounded through the passage. Being a rough sort of citizen
                  didn't affect me as long as I had the straight up-and-down principles within.
                  Well, I got up the go-a-head, and walked in steady. 'T'wont do! citizen Smooth!'
                  interposes the flunkey, putting out his right hand as his face reddened into a
                  blaze. Young America must keep within bounds; he must conform to the established
                  etiquette before he can see the General.' Not liking to be out of sorts, I turned
                  to him, and with the best kind of good nature told him not to come within grasping
                  distance.
               "Lord bless yer soul, Uncle Sam! I told him it was always good policy to keep
                  civil to distinguished individuals, and treating his insolence as Captain Ingraham
                  would an 
                     Austrain
                     Austrian
                   proclamation, I kept onward (that's the motto!) until the passage-way
                  opened into a gorgeously decorated hall, the motto on the door of which I surveyed
                  until my head begun to ache. The General seems to have got him a snug and
                  well-ordained establishment, thought I. But the fixings were rather more profuse
                  than democracy in its simplicity had led me to suppose its taste appreciated. But
                  there was no concealing the fact, that the democracy—its love of simplicity not
                  excepted—did pay large sums now and then for showy fixtures and grand failures.
                  The short-comings of the New Hampshire lawshop shop were extinct—elegance
                  everywhere met the eye. While enjoying my meditations one flunkey approached
                  another, telling him to keep a keen eye on that fellow—meaning me. Then a slim
                  figure done up in dignity and tight clothes approached me with a polite bow:
                  'Please remember this is the President's mansion,' said he, viewing my
                  perpendicular as if he questioned whether my length was all real growth. Seeing
                  that the establishment belonged to Uncle Sam, I assured him he was a little too
                  impertinent.
               "'Now, neighbor!' says I to the citizen, don't deceive yourself by supposing the
                  General has got his aristocracy up like this before he has lodged three months in
                  the White House. I'm an independent citizen; come to put some straight policy into
                  the General, who, with the assistance of his grind-stone man, Fourney,
                  unfortunately has got everything into a twist. My name (sometimes they call me
                  Squire) is Solomon Smooth. It don't matter what they call me now, for be it known,
                  ye men of titles, all the fishermen in our district have become judges and
                  generals. This is the result of that necessity that makes negro-drivers of the
                  south captains and majors. 'But the President,' said he, 'has got such a fearful
                  load of business on his hands this morning, it will be impossible he can see Mr.
                  Smooth, nor are the apartments in a state to be seen by visitor—' 'Always in the
                  suds!' I interrupted. 'No! that ain't it,' he continued, half trembling of fear;
                  'but the President is new, nor yet has got into the straight way of doing crooked
                  business.'
               "'Never mind that,' replied I, Smooth's an independent citizen, who must not be
                  interfered with while taking a turn round the establishment: he neither stands on
                  ceremony nor political point-making.' The fact was, Mr. Smooth had a very
                  wholesome hatred of the nonsense of ceremony, and always pitied that complacency
                  of Uncle John Bull who, like a well-worn and faithful pack-horse, never flinched
                  under the heavy burden of that precious legacy called royal blood, which, said
                  blood, was fast absorbing the vital blood of the nation. May our Union always be
                  spared the degradation of such blood! 
               "The fellow, seeing I was not to be outdone, gave it up for a bad job, and
                  contented himself with following me here
                  and there, keeping a fixed eye on my motions, as if he feared I was going to
                  become enamoured of some of Mr. Pierce's chambermaids, which said commodity was
                  acknowledged to be very pretty, and much admired by Jones, who did the fashionable
                  at Willard's. It having been said that the General, like Jackson, would keep
                  himself, I endeavored to persuade the fellow to show me his nook. He only shook
                  his head and said it wouldn't do: so I took a careless stroll through the loose
                  apartments, and ceased only when my sight was gratified. 'Well!' says the flunkey,
                  adding a deep sigh and a despairing shake of the head, 'it's no use trying to
                  control this citizen; he's of the fast school, without bowels.'
               "'You may believe it!' returned I, advancing toward a broad circular stairway that
                  wound downward far into the regions below, where I expected to find Fourney and
                  Company holding the General down upon the grindstone, while Uncles Caleb and Jeff
                  turned, and Marcy stood by to say when enough of the rough was got off. 'There! in
                  my soul he's going down into the kitchen!' The fellow bawled out as I passed down,
                  and soon disappeared, saying it was just the winding way I sought; and, though the
                  things to be seen in the vortex to which it led might be dangerously dear to the
                  nation, the proof would at least be convincing. On I went, the way darkening as I
                  advanced.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               MR. SMOOTH PENETRATES THE DARK CONFINES OF MR. PIERCE'S KITCHEN,
                  WHERE HE FINDS THINGS SADLY CONFUSED.
               "DOWN, down, down, went, groping my way (Significant of the General's policy)
                  through a, long dark passage, whence came a rancorous stench, strong enough to
                  kill cats and doubtful democrats. 'Keep the right hand way for the kitchen:
                  General is in there, assisting in the making of a monster stew. Work your course
                  through the smoke—you may be sure Mr. Pierce is in the thickest cloud, though over
                  the smallest stew-pan, a voice echoed, as if broken on the winds. 'All right!' I
                  muttered, confronting on my way the still stronger odour of the sickening steam.
                  My intention was to have a political discussion with the cook (Fourney by name)
                  and say a thing or two to the General; for I had got a sort of cross-grained
                  notion into my head that he was compounding a grand stew for the black pig with
                  the horns. Meanwhile my stomach said it would have no objection to join the
                  General over a good breakfast. Presently I scented the frying of fish, which
                  betold that I was on the right track. But lo! as I was about to open a great door
                  that led into where the fussing and frying was going on, a voice screamed
                  out—'Visitors are forbidden these premises!' Here was a pretty kettle of political
                  fish. 'Much you know about it!' I replied testily, and turning saw nothing but fog
                  and confusion. Faith and energy being the two great pillars of human progress, I
                  summoned them to my aid, and pressed onward, determined to see for myself who
                  regulated the culinary. This resolution was adopted solely on the ground that the
                  General had repudiated his responsibility to the people, and joined hands with
                  those who eat up all the loaves and little fishes.
               
               Mr. Smooth, on behalf of Young America, esteemed the having positive proof of how
                  Mr. General Pierce kept his kitchen things a duty he could not forego, and upon
                  the strength of which he presented himself to the august culinary cabinet, which
                  he found enveloped in a dense cloud. As I passed the great door, a fat man from
                  Florida, who filled that office of steady habits, the doorkeeper, said Mr. Smooth,
                  which he read on my card, was decidedly impertinent; the more so because neither
                  of the old grey-back parties had ever troubled themselves about the kitchen
                  fixings; that the present was an innovation he was sure Mr. Pierce would resent by
                  the withholding of appointments. I left him to his opinion, and delved my way
                  through the smoke, until I began to think I had lost myself, and instead of Mr.
                  Pierce on the grindstone found a lower region of unlimited extent—so murky and
                  dismal was the place. They said it didn't use to be so! Such fritter frying; such
                  johnny-cake baking; such chowder making, and flounder frying! Nearly a dozen fine
                  buxom-looking, corn-fed females (helps),—such as Vermont only can
                  grow, were stuffing and stewing, and beating and battering, and themselves seeming
                  on the eve of dissolution. They evinced alarm at my presence, but I told them not
                  to be scared, inasmuch as I was an intimate acquaintance of the General, for whom
                  I carried Cape Cod. On the left side of the kitchen there stood at a great deal
                  table an aged maid whose mien was somewhat fidgety. This visible nervousness was
                  increased with the labour necessary to prepare the ponderous pile of soft
                  dough-nuts she worked upon; which, she said, when ready (though of little
                  substance) were intended to satisfy the Down-easters, who never expected much, and
                  seldom got anything. I pitied the poor old lady, for she seemed well worn. She
                  declared it was pinching times in the kitchen—that is, her part of it. She
                  prepared a deal of little niceties for the peace-loving North: but, the General
                  was so pinching with matters on that side of the house, and had become so
                  enamoured of the black pig! This voracious brute demanded everything, and got what
                  he demanded—even got us into a deal of trouble. Indeed, it had been said that all
                  the swill in the country wouldn't satisfy him—he would seek abroad for more.
                  'Needn't be afraid, old lady,' said I, edging up to her in a polite sort of way:
                  Smooth won't harm nobody. The New Englanders think well of the women—they do!'
                  Here I gave the old lady my hand, and shook her's right heartily. 'Why,' I
                  continued, 'there's three Women's Rights Societies down Massachusetts way, any one
                  of which can start a breeze at pleasure—blow the men all into thunder! I say, old
                  lady, better join one of them—pay fifty cents, and blow the men all into political
                  rags. Musn't take what I say amiss; but you looks as if you could do some blowing:
                  the General standing much in need of that article, why not volunteer? The General
                  is going it pretty fast now, but just get the Women's Rights Societies to blow him
                  a little, and he'll go fast enough for any Young American party out.' After
                  leaving the old woman, who said she was nearly related to General Cass, I went
                  politely to the other girls, bidding them, one after another, a square down
                  good-morning, ending with a social chat and a smile for them all. On the opposite
                  side of the smoky kitchen stood the grim figure of a nigger wench, as big as the
                  north side of a Dutch lighthouse, and as saucy as Benton's goat. The way she was
                  making the wool fly over a sas-pan as big as old Zack Coffin's ile kettle was a
                  caution to nervous folks. 'What on earth have ye got in that, eh?' I inquires,
                  peeping over the side into the half-scalding foam.
               "'What business is that to you?' sounds, like thunder rolling away in the
                  distance, from t'other side the cauldron. Looking up almost dumb-founded I espied
                  the hard phiz of the General, in dim outline through the fog and steam, stirring
                  away at a massive ladle.
               "'Pierce! Lord love yer soul—is it you?' says I, my 
                     feelins
                     feelings
                   rising into a rhapsody of affection for him: 'Give us yer hand.'
               "'Yes, it's me; just come round here if you can see your way through,' says he;
                  and I fumbled my way round, and got him by the hand, and had a hearty good shake,
                  just for old acquaintance sake.
               "'But what in the name of Columbus are you doing here?' I inquired, touching him
                  on the elbow, significantly.
               "'Well!' he answers, rather undecidedly, 'just helping prepare this pot of mixture
                  for the black pig.' He kept on moving his
                  big ladle with one hand and throwing in additional feed with the other, from a
                  bucket that stood close by.
               "I inquired of the General where he kept so dangerous an animal, and was told in
                  the most complacent manner that he ran all about, was as ravenous of power as the
                  gentleman of those lower regions we hear so much about is of sinners; that he
                  demanded all the country's swill. Here the General threw into the cauldron another
                  sprinkling of grits, which he said was to complete the pot of homony. It was
                  merely the daily feed of the black pig, which the colored female assisted the
                  General in preparing. The General seemed very good-natured, and commenced a
                  mathematical description of the ingredients of the mixture, when suddenly there
                  came a fierce blow from behind, which well nigh tilted him deep into the foaming
                  liquid. I grabbed the broad expanse of his nether garments, while the wench
                  screamed, and was only quieted when she found him safe under her broad lee. A deep
                  sonorous voice responded:—'Stir quicker in the feed!' I turned to see from whence
                  it came, and who had dealt thus unmercifully with the General, when behold! there
                  stood this hideous animal. With fourteen horns he incessantly used, and two just
                  growing, he hoped in time to use; with a back of thorns he ever and anon
                  threatened all who came near him; with a tail of poison he defiantly lashed, and a
                  wicked eye that sought objects afar off—he was the most pertinacious brute
                  unchained. Moreover he had a snout like a ploughshare, with which he had
                  frequently driven Mr. Pierce to the wall.
               "'Add more grits!' again the brute growled out, as if alike unhappy with himself
                  and those around him. The voice had scarcely delivered its command, when Mr.
                  General Pierce, as undecided as wanting in vigor of intellect, turned gently
                  round, patted the hideous monster on the head—said he would do all he could to
                  pacify him, though to appease his discontent seemed impossible. Indeed, it was a
                  fact that notwithstanding much of the swill intended for the whiter portion of the
                  litter was sacrificed to this demanding brute, he illustrated his gratitude by
                  threatening to swallow Mr. Pierce into the bargain. This was most unfortunate,
                  seeing how much had been done to transplant the breed to foreign lands.
               "Mr. Smooth felt that for a President to be thus driven to extremes was indeed an
                  unenviable position. I told him I thought Young America would do something, and,
                  with a little advice concerning his principles, passed on through the smoke and
                  foam until I confronted Uncle Jeff and Cousin Guth, both hard at work over a
                  blazing fire, frying a monster fish. Uncle Jeff's apron looked as if he did most
                  of the greasy work, while Guth looked on and directed the turns—now and then
                  whispering a word to the French cook, who with sparkling eye, and oval olive face,
                  and hair so glossy, black, and curly, was dexterously compounding a luscious
                  sauce. 'Going it on the strong!' said I, giving Uncle Jeff a significant wedge
                  under the shorts as he was about to let the grease in the stew-pan fuzzle. Guth,
                  who at the moment commenced dredging in a little more pepper, and a little more
                  butter, and a small sprinkling of salt, said they had been trying to cook this old
                  fish for there was no knowing how many years, all to no purpose; but now that the
                  arts of the very best French cook in the country had been secured he was sure to
                  be done brown. Here he smiled and turned to the cook in question, who bowed with
                  such grace! Such a bow in the presence of ladies would have secured his
                  reputation. Indeed, the said cook was extremely neat of person, though rather
                  below the middle stature, and was well thought of among lawyers and ladies, who
                  declared they liked his graces better than his gravies. 'He's of the right
                  stripe—a fillibuster cook!' said Jeff, exultingly, as Guth gave the coals another
                  stir. 'This is a Cuba flounder,' interposed Guth. ' You see, Mr. Smooth, the
                  General is exceedingly partial to this sort of flounder, but he doesn't understand
                  the quality of dressing requisite to the cooking it—he must be done with native
                  sauce. It is necessary he should be fried in a southern griddle, with plenty of
                  native sauce—an article for which this cook of ours is not celebrated.'
               "'Well, gents!' rejoined I, 'if you do brown that old fellow this season I'll
                  knock under. However, don't be bashful about extending Smooth an invitation to
                  breakfast: understand, he is rather fond of a good fish hash, which he thinks it
                  is the profession of your French cook to do up.'
               "'Lord bless you!' quickly interrupted Uncle Jeff,' being a good Down-east
                  democrat, your wish shall be gratified.'
                  Then in great good nature he told me just to step along, and a little further into
                  the dark smoke I'd find Grandpapa Marcy and Uncle Dib, exerting their wondrous
                  energies over a stew they were puzzled to get to the right substance. Knowing that
                  their good advice was much better as example than the result of their actions, I
                  wended my way along, leaving Guth and Jeff to their frying, and soon came upon the
                  two old worthies, busily employed over stews of the most incomprehensible
                  ingredients. 'That,' spoke Grandpapa Marcy, as I approached within hearing
                  distance, 'is the real democratic stew, it will cement hard shells and soft shells
                  into one strong conglomerate mass.' He pointed to a punch-bowl held between their
                  legs—(for they were seated on the floor)—and containing a mixture they stirred
                  with spoons containing the Tammany-hall mark. For some time I stood contemplating
                  the venerable appearance of these two, nor could I resist a smile at the singular
                  occupation they had so readily adopted. Uncle Dib seemed happy, and evidently had
                  a keen sense of what the consistency of the stew must be to make the flounder
                  palatable. Grandpapa's countenance, nevertheless, wore an air of deep anxiety. He
                  had undertaken the management of the most unruly set of cooks that ever infested
                  the kitchen of a respectable gentleman; and they had made a shocking mess. And,
                  too, Grandpapa, was unhappy; his clothes bore seedy marks, and his breeches were
                  in such a plight—it really excited our pity. I called his attention to an
                  unmentionable rent in a conspicuous place, but he seemed careless about it—said it
                  was of no consequence—and that Uncle Sam was a good old soul, and always paid the
                  tailor—he knew from experience. Suddenly I heard the formidable negro-wench
                  raising her voice in admonition. She was scolding the General, who still kept
                  stirring in the homony grits for the black pig. Then a noise came through the foam
                  and smoke as of one in trouble. 'Faster, faster! it spoke, 'stir in more grits!'
                  Then followed a loud splash and a deathlike shriek; alarm and consternation spread
                  throughout the building. From the cauldron came the cry. Grandpapa moved for a
                  moment, as was his custom, declared the voice to be no other than that of the
                  General himself. Dib agreed ("There's trouble!' he exclaimed) and both sprang to
                  their feet, and with anxious countenances hastened to the rescue, Marcy crying
                  out, as he passed Jeff and Guth, 'Stick by the flounder, boys! Stand firm; don't
                  give in until he's well cooked; we'll save the General—you dig in the basting.'
                  The boys, as Grandpapa called them, were crowding the charcoal finely. Always
                  having a taste for seeing what was going on, I kept close at Dib's heels, and soon
                  saw through the grim smoke where the trouble was. The black pig had got the
                  General poised by the nether part of his breeches, on his Virginia horn, and was
                  having a nice little game of shuttle-cock with him, just for his own amusement,
                  while his executive victim shrieked most piteously, expecting every succeeding
                  surge would land him beneath the surface of the boiling mass. The old nigger wench
                  had fainted at the sight, and lay sprawled on the floor, as Marcy, making a grab
                  at Mr. Pierce's breeches at a moment when the savage brute was giving a last vault
                  ere he landed his victim into the scalding homony, tripped his toe and brought his
                  length upon the floor beneath the pig's hind legs. 'It's all gone!' exclaimed the
                  General; and in another minute nothing was seen save the soles of his boots
                  protruding above the boil-surface. The surly brute, having generously moistened
                  Grandpapa Marcy's head, stood, his fore-feet on the rim of the cauldron, gazed
                  after his struggling victim, and held his head high aloft in triumph. This brought
                  Uncle Dib to the rescue. After raising Grandpapa, with limbs extended, they drew
                  forth the half-cooked body, reeking with the black pig's swill, and laid it on the
                  kitchen floor, the ungrateful quadruped walking victoriously away. Satisfied that
                  I had seen enough for one day, I sought my way back to the National, where I
                  contemplated the next move necessary to my mission.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               MR. SOLOMON SMOOTH TAKES A FISH BREAKFAST.
               "'WELL, Uncle Sam, I reckoned I'd seen enough of the kitchen arrangements; so I
                  left them scraping the General—that is, getting off the injured outside, in order
                  to see what really he was made of, and what he had beneath the undefinable cover.
                  When in Washington, there's nothing like going ahead; and if you can look a man
                  into respect for you, so much the better. Dignitary or no dignitary won't do; you
                  must always profess to be a distinguished individual. Well, on the strength of the
                  invitation extended by Jeff—to take a fish breakfast on the following morning,
                  when it was expected the flounder would be done brown, I again repaired to the
                  White House, and after pushing my way through all kinds of passages and doorways,
                  found myself in a gorgeous sort of establishment."
               "'Your 
                     lookin
                     looking
                   for 
                     somethin
                     something
                  , I take it?' said a trim figure, whose face rather bordered on the
                  brassy.
               "'Well! I reckon I am. Can you tell a stray citizen where the General hangs out in
                  the morning?' I replied, as he confronted me and paused.
               "'Sartin!' he rejoined, 
                     interupting
                     interrupting
                   me, and at the same time looking very sociable, as if he wanted to have
                  a talk on politics. Nevertheless, it was getting close upon the hour of breakfast;
                  so he takes me by the arm, and stepping through a frickazeed passage up to a large
                  door which opened into a ponderously furnished room, 'I'll take your card, sir!'
                  continued he, with a low bow and a motion of the hand to sit down.
               "'Didnt' have a card at hand, but chalked down Mr. Solomon Smooth, from Cape Cod,
                  on a piece of thick paper per, that suited all the purposes.
               "'Mr. Smooth belongs to the Young American party, if I mistake not?' he returned,
                  with a polite bow. 
               "'You better believe that, citizen!' says I, and off he goes, soon disappearing
                  through a door at the other end of the room. While 
                     hew as
                     he was
                   gone, I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to take a survey of the
                  premises. So, lighting my cigar, I began at the top end first. Such
                  looking-glasses, sofas, carpets—so much fashion and flummery, that nobody could
                  tell what utility it contained, I never had seen before. Tell you what it is,
                  Uncle Sam, we have an expensively queer way of representing our republican
                  simplicity! As I was squinting about, in comes the General, looking as bright as a
                  newly-coined cent. Running up to me, with hand extended, and exulting with joy, he
                  spake: 'Great kingdom, Smooth!—is it you?' And then he shaked my hand as if he
                  never would let it go.
               ""Tis me too!' says I, giving him a significant touch on the elbow. 'Didn't expect
                  to see you looking so bright, General—rather a bad kettle of fish that you
                  unfortunately got into yesterday, eh?'—
               "'Oh no—things like those are mere trifles; hardly worth mentioning amidst the
                  current turmoil of the day. That black pig is an ungrateful brute, though, I must
                  confess in confidence, the General replied, touching me on the arm.
               "'He sunk you in the very swill you were cooking for him, eh?—petulant brute!' I
                  rejoined.
               "'Well, Smooth,' said he, don't let us say any more about that; I was
                  deceived—most egregiously! How are all the Young Americans down your way—the real
                  go-ahead stripe?' he inquired anxiously: and we both laughed heartily to see one
                  another. 'They're all bright ends up, General,' said I. 'General! (I touched him
                  on the shoulder) 'taint more nor three years since we used to go fishing in old
                  Sam Peabody's pond; hain't forgot it, I reckon?'
               "'Not I, Smooth. Give us yer hand for old acquaintance sake! No change of power or
                  circumstances could make me forget old associations. Fortune may change, my
                  feelings never; they have been and shall always be with the people.' The General
                  couldn't keep the dignity on, to save his life; he was not born to do so!
               "'Give us yer hand, General,' I demanded in reply; 'right glad to see you, and to know that old New
                  Hampshire's granite hills have not faded from your memory, nor been absorbed in
                  the quantity of swill it seems necessary to provide for the black-pig. But, I say,
                  Frank, what harlequin-like changes politics take in a republic—now and then! Two
                  years ago, and who'd a' thought a' seeing you here? 'Stonished you yourself,
                  didn't it? Scarcely expected to brush old General Scott's fuss and feathers into a
                  cock'd up hat, eh? There's nothing like a man keeping his mouth shut when he's got
                  others to do the fighting for him; you know that, don't you, General?'
               "'Mr. Smooth is always asking some strange questions, or making some queer
                  observation!'
               "'Now, General, I reckon how you did'nt get the hang of this 'ere establishment
                  all on a sudden? Seems to me how I'd like to be President of these United States
                  about two months, merely to have the satisfaction of straightening the cross-grain
                  of political parties; they have got so so crooked now-a-days.' The President just
                  then said he would take my hat, and hoped I make myself quite at home. As
                  everything seemed so comfortable, I had not the slightest objection. 'Now,
                  Smooth,' he reiterated, spreading his length on a magnificent sofa, 'I am anxious
                  to hear how the Young American party progresses down your way; and you must tell
                  me all about it. I intend to give you a roving commission as my minister in
                  general.'
               "'I'll do that,' I replied, and just when I was getting the story fixed square, he
                  interrupted me by saying—'One moment, Mr. Smooth; we are going to have a flounder
                  breakfast—it's the same old fellow you saw Uncle Jeff and Guth cooking yesterday
                  morning,—they've got him pretty well browned—You must join us.'
               "'Well,—have no objection; but tell us, General, how is the missus?'
               "'Right well, Smooth; she'll be delighted to see you.'
               "'And so will I to see the missus'; I know'd her when she warn't bigger nor Cousin
                  Obadiah's Jane, and did'nt think no more about being Mrs. President of these
                  United States nor my missus.' In answer to which, the General said a respectable
                  man might as well be President as anything else—we all know how to be. Here we
                  joined arms, and like jolly fellows of a stripe, took a few turns up and down the
                  apartment. 'Well! here's pure democracy,' thought I to myself. Taking Mr.
                  President Pierce's arm doubled my independence—made me feel that I was the left
                  wing of his brightest hope. Having talked over a few small matters of foreign
                  policy, we sauntered together into one of the largest, and longest, and handsomest
                  breakfast rooms this side of Texas. A table of great length stretched across its
                  centre, upon which was arranged in profusion, Georgia potatoes, New Hampshire
                  bacon, Virginia oysters and fried eels, South Carolina rice cakes, and Cape Cod
                  fish balls—all strong incentives to the stomach of a hungry politician. Trim
                  waiters stood round, like statues tailored and anxiously waiting a guest's nod. As
                  I cast a bird's eye glance down the scene, in popped the General's missus, all
                  calm, and with an air of motherly gentleness that inspired me with lofty
                  reflections on woman's mission. As she approached with her hand extended, and such
                  a sweet smile on her face, I could not resist a salutation thus earnest, and
                  grasping it, gave it a good, warm-hearted shake. She said great was her joy at
                  seeing Mr. Smooth—plain Solomon Smooth. She could not feel more joy were I an
                  Emperor—no not even were I a governor of Hungary, who, having lost the chance of
                  winning a diadem, would Uncle Sam lent him aid to regain it. In another minute the
                  gong sounded, the great doors at the opposite end of the hall opened, a train of
                  serious-faced gentry entered, and as unceremoniously took seats. 'Mr. Smooth being
                  put down number one, took a seat beside the missus. After a blessing had been
                  dispensed, the conversation turned on politics and potatoes. A potent-looking
                  individual, who sat not far down the table, said the Union was known by its
                  magistracy, which being an established fact, should make it incumbent that no
                  chief of this great and growing nation leave the federal chair unmarked by some
                  bold stroke. 'Good!' says I, 'Smooth always went in for bold strokes—they are just
                  the things to make outsiders knock under—' Here I was just getting up to make a
                  speech on behalf of manifest destiny, when a gent who ought to have been voted
                  into the army as a regular cried out:—'Keep cool! keep cool! Mr. Smooth.'
               'Scarcely had he ceased speaking, when Uncle Caleb Grandpapa Marcy, Cousin Guth,
                  and good-natured Uncle Dib, and the
                  grindstone-man, Fourney,—all dressed in bright aprons, and white ghost-like
                  night-caps—made their appearance, tugging and puffing at a hand-bier, on which lay
                  the much-talked-of flounder. Jeff, who walked in front with a drawn sword,
                  wheezed, and Grandpapa grunted, and Dib said, 'Carry a steady hand, boys!' and
                  Guth said he would bear up his part, which was the tail part. Staggering along
                  under the load, they brought forth in solemn procession the flounder, and after a
                  good deal of bad diplomacy, laid him, like a stuffed whale, on the table. The
                  General was not quite certain about the catch of this flounder; but as there was
                  nothing like having a dash at things now-a-days,—here's go into it!' he exclaimed.
                  'I don't believe that fish is cooked enough,' retorted John Littlejohn, a
                  statesman of very elastic capacity, who spoke for Uncle Bull, on t'other side of
                  the big pond.
               "Looking as if he were about making a longe into him, hit or miss, the General
                  seizes up the big carving-knife (generally used by Grandpapa Marcy) and asks who
                  will have the first bit? The pall-bearers, still retaining their bright aprons and
                  white caps, had taken seats at the table, among the guests. 'It's all for me!'
                  mumbles a sullen voice; no one knew from whence it came. 'It's all for me!—who are
                  you?' reiterated Mr. Pierce, kicking under the table: 'I believe in my soul it's
                  the black pig, who always pursues unto the death what he considers his!' True
                  enough, there the savage brute was, lashing everybody's legs, and threatening
                  destruction with his wicked mouth. No one knew how he got into the dining-room;
                  but where the good Uncle Sam had anything to eat or give, there he was sure to be,
                  demanding more than his share. After a hard tussle, Grandpapa and Uncle Caleb
                  succeeded in driving him out of the room; albeit, it was only for a time. The
                  unsatisfied animal was always keeping Uncle Sam in a fuss, and the folks about the
                  White House in an uproar. 'That critter is always crying 'Me first!' rejoined
                  Uncle Caleb, who, having lost his white cap in the tussle with the black pig,
                  looked funny indeed.
               "'A Cuba flounder!' exclaims the General, who continued to work diligently, his
                  face flushed as crimson, but I as yet he had failed to secure the first slice. It
                  was evident he had made a stroke too bold, and would now be compelled to draw back
                  a little—perhaps to take a few more lessons in the diplomacy of carving. And while
                  the General was trying to get the knife into the neck part, the critter opened its
                  mouth, and gasping looked as if it thought some of swallowing a whole cabinet of
                  philibusteroes.
               "'The brute ain't cooked yet—if it don't open its mouth!' proclaimed the General,
                  the hair almost standing on his head, as he reclined back in fright.
               "'The critter's going to be generous, I do believe! chimed in Grandpapa, whose
                  white cap, during the moment of excitement, had fallen over into Mrs. Dobbin's
                  plate; from whence that good-natured lady, in the moment of anxiety, removed it to
                  her lap, and ere she had been served found it near her pretty lips, under the
                  mistaken impression of its being a napkin. Grandpapa, discovering his loss,
                  politely developed the dear lady's mistake.
               "'Tell you what it is General; you'll have to be mighty careful, or that Cuba
                  flounder will swallow all the shiners in Uncle Sam's brass box without yielding
                  anything in exchange,' I insinuated.
               "Not a bit on't!' says Uncle Jeff, going off into a state of excitement: 'Just
                  lend me the carver; I'll put him through; and seizing the knife from Mr. Pierce's
                  hand, and the steel from Grandpapa's, he was just on the point of making a thrust
                  into the fish, when his mouth again expanded, his fins fluttered, and out came a
                  long roll of paper. 'What on earth is that?' inquired the astonished General, as
                  Jeff unconsciously let the knife fall in fright, and Grandpapa gave an anxious
                  look toward the door, as if to measure the distance between it and his
                  chair,—while John Littlejohn applying his glass to his eyes, squinted seriously at
                  it. 'He's not just done enough for you yet, gentlemen; I think you had better let
                  him stand awhile,' remarks our Cousin John, rather coolly. 'You cannot
                  republicanize him, unless you change his head and heart; I can tell you that, my
                  good fellows.'
               "Uncle Jeff, at Grandpapa's bidding, took up the roll of paper, the text of which
                  Mr. Pierce requested him to read. 'A protest, your Excellency!' said Jeff, the
                  paper vibrating in his nervous hand. 'It says, this is to notify Brother Jonathan,
                  that the extreme largeness of his appetite, insatiate in its demands for my body,
                  shall never be gratified therewith. You
                  are far-seeing, have grown powerful, and are rather a good sort of fellow,
                  Jonathan; but I'm not quite ready to say I should prefer either to belong to your
                  household or provide your table with dainty dishes. The fact is, Jonathan, and you
                  know it, when disposed to think on the square, we are not prepared to denounce our
                  league loyalty and come over to you; common sense might have convinced you of this
                  fact. The world protests against your forcing propensities in this little affair 
                     betwen
                     between
                   us. For more than two centuries have I remained at peace; let me so
                  continue. I admit that kings, queens, and courtiers, have feasted on my fatlings,
                  and even discomfited me, and caused much discontent among my people; but even they
                  would rather bear the ills that be than fall victims to your black pig's
                  will.'
               "'Well!' interrupted Uncle Jeff, looking suspiciously about the table, 'if he
                  ain't the toughest old flounder I ever did see!'
               "Shouldn't be surprised if you found it so!' replied the fish, his spacious jaws
                  opening, and the end of another parchment slowly protruding from his mouth. 'Read
                  that! I must get somebody to help me to eject this instrument.' The General
                  wrested it from its mouth, turned it over and over, and tried and retried to read
                  it. 'It's a protest from John, my Uncle, John Bull and Johnny Crappo, which
                  says:—'We, the said John and Louis, having entered into a sublime alliance with
                  our sublime brother of the East, by which one great and mighty power has been
                  concentrated, do humbly beg Mr. President Pierce (for whom we now have and ever
                  hope to entertain the very highest esteem) that he take heed how he dips his
                  fingers into other people's political pies. And, further, while exhibiting so
                  earnest a desire to appropriate the choicest delicacies of his neighbors to the
                  cravings of his black pig, to be a little more modest. Now, we, the undersigned
                  Louis and John, whose names—in alliance have become mightiest among the mighty,
                  are duly convinced of the many inconsistencies, irregularities, and breaches of
                     good faith, together with the many petty acts of tyranny, the
                  mother of this Antilla flounder has been guilty of, to her own disgrace. But
                  greatness should be known by its forbearance with the weak; hence we should bear
                  and forgive. Yea, we admit that her footprints are marked with blood—that her
                  history has numberless pages written in blood—that her arrogance and avarice have
                  blotted out her national virtue, and now work like a battering-ram her downfall.
                  Yet, as arrogance is but another name for weakness, is it not better to brush off
                  than kill the wasp? The principle herein contained we have, in the sublimity of
                  our power, adopted as an example to the nations of the earth. Jonathan! we like
                  your amiability; we esteem you as a keen fellow, who, large of trade, and wise in
                  the ways of a cheap government, may well boast a happy people: bridle, then, the
                  audacity of that southern ambition, lest it betray you into unforseen
                  difficulties. Let peace be the guardian of that commerce now teeming its grandeur
                  and wealth on your shores; and in all kindness, Mr. Pierce, do we speak, when we
                  say,—look to those things you send into foreign lands to represent
                  the quiet grandeur of our institutions: send the gentleman whose conduct may be a
                  means to great ends, for ruffians leave their little stains behind.'
               "'Well!' exclaimed the General, his large square face reddening with anxiety, as
                  he turned to Uncle Dib and Grandpapa, 'I should call this the insolence of sublime
                  power. Let them try their sublime power on this side of the Atlantic!' Here the
                  General gave his head a significant toss, and wiped his lips as he
                     added,—'Young America can whip the three.' This pithy speech being
                  received with great applause, he reached over his hand, and was about taking mine,
                  when I warmly embraced his, saying—'Give me you yet, General! Messrs. John, Louis
                  & Co., having consolidated their sublime power, must not entertain the idea of
                  making a menace over here. We have no means of questioning the legitimate
                  qualities of this sublime joint-stock company; but we would advise its keeping
                  decidedly cool about matters this side of the big water, lest its stock get to a
                  very low-water mark. This old flounder, nevertheless, is a hard case for cooks,
                  nor in my opinion will he be made softer by that celebrated French cook of yours,
                  whose process is that of too suddenly piling on the charcoal. In fact, I believe
                  it not untrue that in political cooking a Frenchman is more a man of muss than
                  method. This you, General, might have known before you engaged him to cater for Spanish appetites. In truth, (it must be
                  told now and then, General), that black pig you so fondly nurse, and which you can
                  neither tame nor make grateful, is sacrificing us to his poisonous litter. And,
                  too, he is dividing his own pen; and when pigs become divided among themselves,
                  refuse to eat out of one trough, and threaten to devour each other, they are sure
                  to become an easy prey to the bore of fractional sovereignity.' With the exception
                  of the General, all listened attentively while I spoke: he, exhibiting little
                  concern, arose with the calmness of moonlight, and was about to make some remarks,
                  as the flounder again opened wide his mouth, which produced a pause. 'You are
                  right,' joined in the flounder; 'that black pig's love of territorial feasts knows
                  no bounds, nor will he stop at that point where justice sets the limit; he will
                  continue his insatiate trade until common sense and generous sentiment interpose
                  and exterminate him. Here is another paper for you—read it! It is the protest of
                  the people of free, enlightened, and happy New England: they protest against being
                  swallowed up in your black pig's bowels!' Again the flounder mechanically closed
                  its mouth.
               "'And my old governor across the water will not view with indifference this black
                  brute's ever-threatening disturbances. He watches long, waits patiently, moves
                  cautiously, but enters upon the execution of his plans with monstrous method,'
                  interrupted Littlejohn, who spoke on behalf of his nation, and for the status quo of nationalities in general.
               "'I say, neighbor,' rejoins Mr. Sam Blowaway, a leader of the national Young
                  American party, 'pears how, if your old chap over there attempts that game, he'll
                  get himself boots deep into a scrape he'll not find it so easy to claw out on.'
                  And Sam got right up, and looked brimstone at him, straight across the table.
               "'I'm methodical, but not easily repulsed: impulsive acts do not constitute
                  valor,' returned John, rising coolly and dispassionately.
               "'Grandpapa Marcy now got up to say a word or two, but Mr. Pierce had the floor,
                  and demanded—Order! 'Order, gentlemen!—Order in the White House! My boys want to
                  get me into trouble, but I feel that I can yet regulate my own household!' he
                  rejoined, with a peremptory tone that excited surprise.
               "'Yes,' replied the flounder; I say so too. If you do not keep quiet, and live in
                  harmony among yourselves, I will be the means of swallowing you.' Just at this
                  moment the black pig, with savage grunt, bounded fearlessly into the room and upon
                  the table, where he confronted the flounder with open mouth, overturned the table,
                  smashed all the crockery and pewter, made the uproar and confusion complete. The
                  pig and flounder fell upon each other, wrestled among the wreck, nor ceased until,
                  like Kilkenny cats, they had nearly devoured their substance. Such a chaos of
                  excitement as followed! Grandpapa and Uncle Jeff ogled one another in fear and
                  trembling, women fainted in the arms of gallant men; the General, covered with
                  fish gravy, cut the more sorry figure, as with thunderstruck countenance he raised
                  his hands to protest to the nation. Meanwhile the guests suddenly disappeared, and
                  Grandpapa seriously damaged the broad disc of his unmentionables; while Uncle
                  Caleb, shaking his sides with laughter, stood his comely figure in the doorway,
                  the thumb of his right hand to his nasal organ, and his fingers making five
                  angles, quizzing the General in his dilemma. Esteeming it rather an ugly situation
                  for Mister President Pierce, for whose dignity I had a special regard, I picked
                  myself up, made an apology, bowed myself to the great door, and left the General
                  to his pig. 'What a mess you have made of it!' thought I, and 
                     straightway
                     straightaway
                   ascended the cupola to watch the nation's emotion.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               MR. SMOOTH CIRCUMNAVIGATES THE GLOBE.
               "WHEN the nations of Europe give themselves up to the sword, let us aggrandize
                  ours with the arts of peace. This is my talisman. In that commerce which is our
                  nation's pride there is more of greatness than war can give, more of power than
                  armaments can command. It would be well, Uncle Sam, if you pondered over this;
                  because, having your pockets well lined, war could supply numberless valiant sons
                  ready to do the emptying of them. This was a private opinion, which forced itself
                  upon my mind as I (having received a commission as minister in general to Mr.
                  Pierce) engaged passage in a spacious balloon, with which to navigate this little
                  globe of ours, and report here and there on the condition of our international
                  difficulties. Indeed, some of those difficulties required looking after. And as no
                  man should permit his dignity to take the upward turn when a penny may be turned,
                  I reckoned on turning what I learned to the very best account. That you spend your
                  money very foolishly, Sam, is as true as sunrise; but more than that, you intrust
                  your honor (which is more precious than your gold) to those who are seen abroad
                  only to misnomer us. To counteract this state of things is the primary object of
                  my mission round the globe.
               "This I was anxious to impress on General Pierce; but he seemed to have a wavering
                  bump on his head, and not seeing his way clear, came to the peculiar conclusion
                  that Mr. Smooth had a very novel head, full of novel notions. But he told me, by
                  way of becoming enlightened on the affairs of other nations, to keep a bright
                  look-out, note down the items, and see where we could turn the go-ahead of our
                  people to account. As most of our small disputes were with Mr. John Bull, who was
                  prone to keep open any quantity of very vexatious questions, Mr. Pierce thought it
                  good policy to make John Littlejohn a fellow voyager with me. It was not a bad
                  idea, seeing that Mr. Pierce had an inward hatred of the Britishers, nor thought a
                  war with them would be the most unpopular thing in the world, inasmuch as it would
                  attach to him the Young American party, which said party might in gratitude render
                  good service to his re-election. Upon this principle Littlejohn's company was
                  acceptable; and when he joined me at the National we had a social bit of a chat
                  together about the matter. John was not a bad fellow when once you knew how to
                  take him, but he had qualities of character which at times seemed at variance with
                  what he would have us believe were his straightforward principles. It was this
                  trait of character, at times defying analysis, we had to treat with most care,
                  lest unconsciously it embroil us. My friend Palmerston might without prejudice be
                  taken as an excellent representative of this unfortunate trait. 'Now,' says John,
                  in a methodical sort of way, 'there are, to be honest, (and acts will prove the
                  truth of a principle), two great pirates in the world. You know that, Smooth, just
                  as well as I do.'
               "No I don't,' says I.
               "'But you do!' he returns. 'There's your Uncle Sam: he will steal all territory
                  adjoining his dominions,—in a good-natured sort of way, merely to work out the
                  problem of manifest destiny. As for my old gentleman, Uncle John, why he has a
                  dignified way of doing things, always plays the part of a bold gentleman, and when
                  he joins a kingdom it is with a modesty so quiet and genteel. You needn't shake
                  your head, Smooth,—such are facts; nevertheless, they are both tenacious of their
                  rights—a national trait of great value,—and will shed a river of human blood to
                  gain a very small point on paper. Like two great gamblers, they are opposed to the
                  principle of give and take, standing steadfastly by the take. Once
                  they were father and son—thus, the inheritance may be pardoned; and when they
                  quarrelled it was not to be expected the son would relinquish the traits so
                  paternally bestowed. Now the parent is obstinate and the son 'cute; but the son
                  has an eccentricity that prompts him to outwit. Not unfrequently the father lets
                  the son—just for peace sake—have his own
                  way; but this letting him have his own way has inclined his heart rather to the
                  ungrateful than otherwise. His demands are at times somewhat funny, and when made
                  known surprise a world. And now that they are so firmly and extensively identified
                  with each other in pursuits of the noblest character, would it not be a sin to
                  quarrel?' Thus spoke John, very complacently.
               "'As he got through, the negro produced some liquor, piping hot. To be
                  good-natured, and keep cool, is one-half the battle; and to move those very
                  desirable traits of our nature, we put a hot punch a-piece into the mentality of
                  the inner man, smoked a couple of long nines, bowed compliments, and packed up our
                  duds for the voyage. There was a great gathering where the balloon was blowing up;
                  but Mr. John Littlejohn and me walked cordially down and took our seat, bundled in
                  our traps, and sung out, 'Cut away the strings, and let her go!' I said I would
                  steer for Uncle Sam, and John said he would steer for Mr. Bull; so, not feeling
                  inclined to quarrel about the point, and knowing full well that the mother of
                  constitutional governments (some facetiously called her the mother of
                  constitutional incongruities) always liked to have the first trick at the wheel,
                  we tossed coppers—after the fashion of good-natured diplomatists, when a large
                  stake is at issue. 'John!' I enjoined, 'let us keep calm, and put the point to a
                  test that never fails!' Here I gave him one of those pats on the shoulder so
                  impressive, and pulled out a double-headed cent, like unto those so much in use in
                  General Jackson's time, when shaving decapitated the deposits he found himself
                  mounted on the back of a brass jackass. 'Here!' I continued—'Heads, I win; tails,
                  you lose.' To come the sharp over him in a more square sort of way, I gave him an
                  unmoved look straight in the eye, as I twirled up the copper.
               "'I'll take the chance,' ejaculated John, and down came the other head. His
                  countenance, you may be assured, wore a singular seriousness. The truth was, that
                  John always had one strong idea in his head, and made a strong effort to keep that
                  one straight, to the sacrifice of all the rest. Acting upon that axiom that so
                  stimulated the wood-sawyer who expected to be President of the United States in a
                  very few years, we cut away the fastenings, and having ascended high among the
                  clouds, sailed from the mist heavenward to the blue arch above. Our position was
                  not the most firm; but as Young America had the helm, and rather courted than
                  feared danger, the result could not be doubted. Now and then Mr. John looked
                  somewhat stern of countenance, and turned pale when I crowded the charcoal. 'Be
                  careful, Smooth,' he lisped now and then, grasping my arm as he took a look
                  below—' Be careful; you know what a go-ahead sort of lot you are. Your party would
                  think nothing of going to the d—l, if it were only with steam power. It was indeed
                  a dangerous position for large men with small ideas; but as Young America was a
                  small man with large ideas, the case became reversed. Well, we headed square for
                  California, and proceeded at lightning speed, fast overtaking that old slow coach
                  of refulgent light that has made sentimental the wild wisdom of the poet-world.
                  Soon old Jacob's face loomed out upon its broad disc, looking as
                  good-natured as a Dutchman over a pot of lager beer. My friend John seemed rather
                  moody and dogged; however, we soon got within hailing-distance; and having
                  provided myself with a speaking-trumpet—John having forgot his—I esteemed it good
                  policy to, in a social way, have a small quantity of talk with Jacob, who,
                  although a common sort of person, I felt assured must be well posted on matters
                  and things concerning manifest destiny. We were running bow on, and at the moment
                  I seized the trumpet for a blow, Jacob sung out—'Good morning!' just like a free
                  and easy citizen, who had sense enough to be approached at any time without
                  walling himself up in the dignity of that thing called a duke. His voice was like
                  thunder, with reechoes for accents. 'Mind your helm!—you steer rather wild,
                  there!' he spoke.
               "'Old feller! don't get into a pucker; there's not a mite of danger,' I returned.
                  ' Just hold up a little, and let us have a bit of a talk!'
               "'Well, don't mind if I do,' good-naturedly returned the old man. So we hooked on
                  to his establishment,—laid her aback in the wind, and, as the sailor would say,
                  'came to.'
               
               "'Who are you, anyhow?' continued Jacob, getting up and shaking himself.
               "'Well, I'm Young America (Jacob shook his head, doubtfully, at the name) and my
                  friend here, is Cousin John, from across the water. We are going to take a view of
                  state affairs around this little globe of ours, that we may report to General
                  Pierce in particular.'
               "'Then you're from the States down yonder?' rejoined the old man.
               "'Just so!'
               "'Ah,—go-ahead fellers down there, they are! But they've got to mind their moves
                  just about this time.'
               "Seeing it's you, Jacob,—and knowing that you must be worn down with toil, s'pose
                  we strike a trade in a small sort of way?' Jacob shook his head, and replied:
               "'Like your folks for their masterly energies, but rather not trade.'
               "'That won't do, old fellow: you must come out on the new principles of
                  civilizations. Who knows that we may make an arrangement to annex your little
                  establishment to these United States! Young America has, you see, yet to fulfil
                  the functions of manifest destiny.'
               "'Don't, pray don't, bring your Young America about my dominions!' he exclaimed,
                  interrupting just as John Littlejohn was about to speak.
               "'John spoke, inquiring if his preferences were not for him? He knew old Jacob
                  would like to annex his dominions to Great Britain, seeing that he carried out his
                  annexation in a quiet sort of way. Jacob laughed right out—laughed irresistibly;
                  laughed as if he meant it for something. 'To be honest with you, gentlemen, and I
                  know you'll excuse me for being out-spoken,—I want nothing to do with either of
                  you. You'll both steal territory; and as for you, Young America, take a word of
                  honest advice—be contented with what has honestly fallen to you, covet not that
                  which is thy neighbor's, but improve what thou hast of thine own. At the same
                  time, take particular care how thou sail in this very lofty atmosphere. Your
                  manifest destiny may fall into martyrdom.'
               "'That's right good advice, Uncle,' said I, (interrupting him), but it would be
                  better it did not smack so strong of that fogyism whose obstinate policy won't let
                  the progress of those United States come out. Anyhow, Jacob, seeing that you have
                  got such a nice stock of territory, dotted with fascinating hills and plains, upon
                  which good speculations can be made in starting a speculation in churches, as has
                  become the fashion, doing a little in the tin business, laying a few railroads,
                  and building up factory villages, we must have a treaty of commerce—at all
                  events!'
               "No! no! no! You've large inards, Jonathan; and your youngest son,—Young
                  America,—has got such a pair of eyes! I'm afraid of him. No objection to joining
                  in three cheers for Hail Columbia, almost any time; but save me from your claws.
                  You're both great pirates: pray be merciful to your neighbors, and spare me my
                  Independence. Your little place down there is become troubled with wars and
                  rumours of wars;—the shedding of innocent blood in streams at the caprice of
                  imbecile princes, who make the bones and blood of their subjects the waste
                  material with which to serve their incarnate ambition, tells me to beware. Beware
                  of ambitious princes; the world would be well rid of them!'
               "'Like to hear you talk so, Uncle Jacob. Reckon how you've studied in a New
                  England school! There the greatest power springs from the humble people. Anyhow,
                  Jacob, since we can't strike a trade, nor do a thing or two in the way of
                  speculation, s'pose we take a drop of whiskey punch?'
               "'Can't object to that,' he returned. "So, Littlejohn and me set about it, and in
                  a very few minutes had a first-class punch brewed, of which old Jacob supped most
                  lavishly. In fact, he liked it so well that I reckoned he had forgotten to stop
                  drinking; and Littlejohn felt somewhat nervous lest the old fellow get fuddled and
                  turn everything over. John reckoned I'd better give him a cold julep to wipe down
                  with; but Jacob said he much preferred hot things, that his profession was quite
                  cold enough. So, after we put the punches down, and smoked some cigars, and
                  received some good advice about being careful how I proceeded, we loosened the
                  strings and bid him good morning: it was coming faint daylight, and Jacob had to
                  be jogging. Just as I was leaving, my heart felt kind a down-pressed to think what
                  gorgeous territory he had spread out to a feller's eyes, without the slightest
                  chance of making an operation for a small
                  portion of it—say just enough to get a foothold.
               "Westward we went with breathless speed, soon losing sight of Jacob and his
                  luminary. 'You better reef down, Mr. Smooth. Should anything give way, and you
                  tumble out and break your neck, the democracy would go into mourning,' said
                  Littlejohn, who had kept very quiet up to this time.
               "'Not a bit of it! I answered our democracy is like Parr's Life Pills, enervating
                  and elasticating. You may break its head, but you cannot kill;—it belongs to the
                  heart, and springs from the laws of right. At this Littlejohn began to get
                  dogged,—to shows signs of very bad nature. Knowing this was most unprofitable to
                  him I yielded indulgence. To be good-natured in cases of Emergency is a most
                  valuable trait; and to whip a man for being ill-tempered, when nothing can be made
                  at it, is most absurd. 
               "The world outside of the United States is inclined to believe American democracy
                  something next to infernal—that it must have everything it sees, and turns
                  everything it comes in contact with into dollars, cents, and republicanism. To
                  such it is a mysterious power, moved by chemical agency. As for Littlejohn, he
                  thought that in addition to our speculative spirit we should be governed by
                  modesty, an example of which his forefathers had set us. This he recommended on
                  the principle of a gentleman who keeps up his dignity, gaining one half his object
                  through the influence of his mien. Many said this was the precise material General
                  Pierce was most deficient in; and that if the General would preserve more dignity
                  and less bluster his administration had been marked with results more in keeping
                  with the true character of the nation. Old Uncle John could brag stoutly; but
                  Jonathan was a magnificent player at the same game. I realised this as Littlejohn
                  took a long look over our wonderful West, and asked by what singular process of
                  diplomacy we got to many fine states, so richly burdened with natural resources?
                  He reckoned we must have come the smart of our go-ahead principles over the
                  French, Spanish and Mexicans, and then insinuated ourselves into their dominions.
                  But, this being the smallest end of an Englishman's man's ideas whittled down to
                  the very point of self-conceit, Smooth thought it best to be good-natured and make
                  the best of his calmness. The fact is, John Bull and Cousin Jonathan must be good
                  friends; strife is the dire enemy of good order, while war becomes the assassin
                  seeking to overthrow those principles of constitutional liberty, both nations so
                  wisely combined in their constitutions. Why tear down the noble edifice you cannot
                  rebuild? why blight the cheering prospects of thousands to gratify the vain
                  ambition of pedantic politicians?
               "'Hallo! Smooth, my dear fellow, what place is this below?' cries out Littlejohn,
                  looking over, as the balloon made a B line westward.
               "That,' I interrupted, 'used to be called the 'far West.' Now it is getting to be
                  the centre of civilization. It goes ahead of the march of progress, while
                  outstripping comprehension. Upon this great expanse will spring up the materials
                  for feeding every hungry and oppressed citizen this side of sun-down. We can
                  already raise anything,—from mountain of corn to a river of pork,—on it; and as
                  for the nigger crop, there's no end of that!'
               "'And that yours, too, Mr. Smooth? Your fertile acres stretch from sea to sea.'
                  Little John interrupting, pointed all over the broad expanse below. He had no
                  generalized ideas of America, no distinct estimate of her productive and
                  maintaining powers, and less knowledge of that machinery so simply beautiful
                  called her government. He never for once thought how this wide western expanse was
                  destined for the back-bone of the mightiest republic the world ever knew. People
                  without homes in the old world found happy homes there; civilization drove the
                  buffalo from his wonted haunt to give place to man; man himself yielded to the
                  power of progress marching westward. 'Now, Littlejohn.' said I, 'seeing that your
                  people have but an imperfect geographical knowledge of our country, let me tell
                  you that yon black ridge you see afar down is the range of rocky mountains.
                  Colonel Fremont, a small man, slim enough to split the wind, but as tough as Uncle
                  Seth's whip-stock, climbed the loftiest peak, hung his hat on it, made the stars
                  and stripes on a rag—(in accordance with necessity and the go-ahead spirit of our
                  country)—hung them flying in a snowstorm, whistled Yankee Doodle three times and
                     proclaimed them ours in the name of
                  the United States. All this was smooth and fair,—done in the spirit of our
                  go-ahead, all-accomplished diplomacy.'
               "'Ah!' interrupted Littlejohn, 'your appetite for bits of territory runs
                  monstrously that way.'
               "'Yes!' I replied; 'but, John, give us your hand-on that point we may honestly
                  embrace, and declare ourselves now even two. You are as modest as an archbishop on
                  salary day, and seldom openly embrace territory; we prefer the frank style in all
                  our adoptions. Let us not quarrel over that—you love freedom, we love free
                  government. Our political thoughts are moulded in one die, though self-interest
                  may vary them. To be mutually just toward each other, to live on terms of
                  friendship, and preserve that amity which is our bulwark, serves well that unity
                  of great principles which conserves and preserves our happiness. Yea! cursed be
                  the hand, and stagnate the breath raised against that peace and good-will which
                  saves us from the monster of war.' Here I grasped firmly and earnestly John's
                  hand, and would fain he forgot the past and thought only of the future. Looking
                  down, 'that is New Mexico,' said I, 'a small corner we just hooked on to our large
                  establishment; we let all these little ones come into the same nursery, where a
                  generous mother watches their wants and provides for them as circumstances demand.
                  You, John, treat your colonial babies with singularly cold diet; in fact, you
                  often permit them to become stunted and ill-tempered for want of proper care in
                  the home nursery. You see, Texas was well nursed, and now her territory is fast
                  filling up with the hardy sons and daughters of your land; but, would they become
                  new beings, and enjoy equal rights and equal privileges, they must divest
                  themselves of those servilities which in your country one class unfortunately
                  endeavors to enforce upon the other.' John bowed, but gave no further heed.
                  Presently we came to the Mormon settlement, and here he set to chaffing me about
                  equal privileges. 'We always had inconsistencies in our social system,' he said;
                  'just see how many wives these Mormons have got, and what a nice thing they are
                  making of equal rights. You beat us there, Smooth; we Englishmen would never think
                  of such sort of thing.' John looked very innocent and honest, which, added to his
                  dignity so naturally put on, was enough to make one's face square up into a broad
                  smile.
               "Permit me, John,' returned I: 'we tend well the great things; this Mormon evil
                  will work its own remedy! Westward the wave of empire rolls on; that's the word we
                  speak as the world looks on, grudgingly acknowledging its truth. We nurture small
                  things that they may become great; we make men feel themselves living equals, not
                  inferiors; we put the lowly emigrant in moral progress, and from his mental
                  improvement reap the good harvest for all. By sinking from men's minds that which
                  tells them they are inferior, we gain greatness to our nation. Simon Bendigo is
                  made to feel that he is just as good as Blackwood Broadway; and Blackwood is made
                  sensible of the fact that he is no better in the body politic than any other
                  man.'
               "'Now, Smooth, just let me interrupt you in your train of Yankee logic,' said
                  Littlejohn; 'the safer a man feels his position the better is it for the nation;
                  but the policy of equality in men, though it might do for your young place, never
                  would do for ours. Age and its attendant glories demand different rules of
                  guidance for society. All your fancy articles of freedom, equality, and dignity
                  among common people become doubtful, when subjected to long practice. Our people,
                  sir—take my word, not unworthily—are above considering such degrading innovations;
                  their grades of society are a sacred protection.'
               "Ah! those are English opinions, iron-bound. Your social institution is a perfect
                  curiosity shop, where everything old may be stored away unmolested, but upon which
                  the man of plain sense looks distrustfully, while sycophants waste contemplation
                  in devising means for its preservation. How few estimate the cost to a nation of
                  maintaining' those ancient inconsistencies so preserved by governments of the old
                  world!'
               "'Never mind that, Mr. Smooth; these things are our own, and on us will the evil
                  recoil. Be not so earnest in condemning us, for the same sins you lay at our door
                  are fast developing themselves in your would-be fashionable society! Your society
                  is fashionable without being refined. Your aristocracy is a base imitation of our
                  snobby, revelling in the heartless hording of gold, and vaunting of bad English.' John looked down ere he finished, and
                  seemed taking a bird's-eye view of the great Utah territory. The Great Salt Lake I
                  assured him was where the venerable navigator Noah discharged his ballast of salt
                  bags. As for the settlers on its borders, they were the followers of Joe Smith, a
                  veritable descendant of Ham, who never was known for the good he did. That clever
                  mouthpiece of English opinion, the Times, says they will one day
                  confuse and cause much trouble to the people of the United States; but this is
                  only the offspring of that one strong idea so characteristic of Mr. John Bull. Now
                  these descendants of the veritable Smith have a fantastic appreciation of many
                  wives—a strange delusion in which there cannot be much happiness; but beyond this
                  they are a very harmless people, who, beyond the sin of having many wives (and if
                  this be a sin, it may be found at many a cleaner door!), may be excused from much
                  they do.
               "'One word, if you please, Mr. Smooth!' suddenly interrupted John Littlejohn,—'it
                  is in that the dangerous element of your Yankee nature exists. Once beyond the
                  neutralizing sphere of public opinion, you go in for all sorts of vagaries, the
                  more inconsistent with strict order the better.' This crimination was certainly as
                  fast as out of place; John was, indeed, too ready to censure us without a
                  forethought. We had given these deluded creatures a home in our land; we had
                  received them as citizens, though most of them were subjects of that land of
                  freedom where the chains fall to give place to flunkeyism; we had protected them
                  in their wilderness home—should we not be generous, and forgive their errors
                  rather than punish or provoke the delusion? Preferring more than one wife is not
                  originally American: on that score Uncle John cannot shake clean the skirts of his
                  garment, nor proclaim his virtue as white as snow. Ere this conversation ended we
                  had arrived over California. Standing up I gave three long and strong cheers that
                  astonished and awoke John from the moody reflections into which he had fallen.
                  There the great El Dorado spread out in golden plains, teeming their rich
                  treasures into Uncle Sam's apron. Then, all bright and full of busy life, rose San
                  Francisco, the stars and stripes waving gracefully from a thousand temples. A
                  thousand ships, like monsters sleeping, rode on the calm bosom of her waters;—a
                  busy throng of merchants filled her broad avenues; while houseless, anxious, and
                  never-despairing mortals, like swine at large, rooted her broad plains for gold. A
                  country, by the aid of that Anglo-Saxon energy which carries liberty and
                  civilization into the remotest corners of the world had risen, like a young giant,
                  from a wilderness to a flourishing State. Already was it a world of industry,
                  every man working for the main chance. John could not suppress an expression of
                  gratification,—the sight was bright of promise; but, he added, he much feared his
                  countrymen would view it with a jealous eye, inasmuch as it might become a means
                  of deranging their beautiful organization of very fashionable society. We were
                  made up of an indescribable compound of common people and shopkeepers, he added,
                  shrugging his shoulders and changing slightly his position. He forgot that the
                  absence of two of the greatest evils a nation groans under had brought its
                  blessings on our land,—Mr. Smooth refers to pauper lords, and lords who make
                  paupers. Great men there sprung from the commonest ranks to take the best care of
                  the nation. They discarded the expensive nonsense of maintaining dignity which
                  polluted independence: they respect the poor man's rights and brighten his
                  prospects; they seek to promote the good of all and fear not the few!
               "Smooth, in humble solicitude for the reader's feelings, begs he will join him
                  again while proceeding on his course. Proceeding at a rapid rate we had well nigh
                  lost sight of the El Dorado, when John made a significant motion, which, being
                  translated, meant that he would like to take another glass of hot punch. To this
                  proposition I readily consented; after which we lighted two real Havanas, and
                  rolled on as resolute as a flying Dutchman. It was with some effort that John
                  curbed his natural feelings. The punch, being placed in the right place, seemed to
                  create new thoughts. 'Queer fellows you are!' says he, to talk of freedom and
                  equal rights. Why, you have got a human property market open, and more than three
                  millions of souls up for a bid. Mark my word, Mr. Smooth, the voice of sorrow for
                  your human commerce will yet shake the stability of your country. When slavery
                  drives this country to sectional issues; when it corrupts the federal eral power; when it serves the ambition of those
                  who would drag us into foreign broils; when patriotic men, North and South, ceased
                  to come forward for the safety of a confederation, then will sectionalism wage its
                  angry wars against a noble edifice, whose foundation history tells us must totter
                  under the siege of strife.'
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               SMOOTH PRESERVES YOUNG AMERICA'S RIGHTS.
               "DAY dawned through the gray mist of the East, as crowding the old institution, we
                  sailed swiftly through the air, over the calm Pacific. Soon San Francisco seemed
                  but a speck in the dim distance. On, on, on, we sped, until the land passed far
                  out of sight behind. Our next business was to hang in suspense our hopes, and
                  await the welcome sight of land ahead. John strained his eyes, and I did the same.
                  Two hours passed, and the welcome moment arrived. 'I see it!' exclaimed John—'Land
                  oh! Land oh!' In a frenzy of joy he had well-nigh upset the barge and spilled us
                  out. Then he pointed his finger to an object in the distance that seemed like a
                  lonely steeple holding watch over midnight.
               "'I see it!' I rejoined—'it's land—a new discovery: I'll call it Uncle Sam's
                  Land.'
               "'A little more moderate, if you please, Mr. Smooth,' retorted John, very
                  politely. 'Seeing it first, I claim the right of calling it Prince Albert's
                  Island.' John was inclined to exchange any amount of diplomatic notes, but I
                  inquired, in a plain sort of way, what would be the good it could confer on his
                  country? to which he folded his arms, and replied curtly, that having it was the
                  thing sought for by his government. He might institute the Established Church on
                  it, and create any amount of Bishops, with good fat salaries—a thing all-desirable
                  in the eyes of the Saviour. We use these out-of-the-way places,'he continued, 'as
                  a means of relief to our over-crowded population and pensioners. We are heavy of
                  pensioners, while our governors are prone to create dependencies, which they do in
                  consideration of the very large stock of gentlemen always on hand, and most clamorous to be provided
                  for at John's expense.'
               "Having arrived over the spot, we found it an out-of-the-way island; upon which I
                  suggested that it would be better to drop the stars and stripes, with a note to
                  the chief (if one there existed) desiring he would put it up in the name of our
                  great Republic. John, taking the initiative, began to draw from his pocket a bit
                  of bunting; but so methodical was he, that before he had completed the process I
                  took from my pocket a piece of red chalk, and on my white, Sunday nightcap figured
                  the Stars and Stripes. This done, I rolled it round my jacknife, and let it slide
                  downward ere John had his Union Jack ready. Down it went, like a thunderbolt
                  chased by a streak of chain lightning. 'Put that up, in the name of these United
                  States' thought I,—'we'll take care of that little bit of territory.'
               "'Well,' interrupted John, looking as serious as a May moon, 'it's Yankee
                  outright: I confess the Union Jack can't keep up with the Stars and Stripes,
                  nohow!'
               "'Give us your hand, John,' said I, 'we'll be good-natured anyhow, seeing the
                  positive proof that we both belong to the same school. We are types of two very
                  progressive and honorable gentlemen, who, in a very modest sort of way, do pirate
                  territory now and then, merely for the sake of that inevitable result the
                  extending good constitutional principles has. If our small faults creep above the
                  surface now and then, the influence they have is more than 
                     counterbalancod
                     counterbalanced
                   by the good which may come. But, while we both affect a deal of modesty,
                  and are ever criminating and recriminating each other's acts, would it not be well
                  to acknowledge the motive by which both are moved to the same greedy propensities?
                  Think it over, John; and at the same time let us join—just to keep up the
                  good-nature—in another glass of whiskey. He said he had no objection, so filling
                  up, we drank to the very best sort of friendship, John winking and blinking, as a
                  squall just springing up began to increase.
               "'That place—we were both a little too fast, John—is inhabited, as I'm a
                  Christian. I'll bet a cotton-mill it is!' I returned; and before the words were
                  cold I saw a French sentinel pacing as straight as a handspike in uniform, and as
                  mutely savage as a scare-crow in a corn-field. There he was, moustaches heavier
                  nor a goat's smellers, à la old guard. Not a
                  great way behind his Saxon neighbors, he was watching No. 1; just keeping an
                  unoffending eye on Queen Tamerhamer's little place. That tawny sovereign had
                  insulted the French, but it was difficult for them to define the nature of the
                  offence. However, they claimed the right to mount guard, if only to the end of
                  getting a better foot-hold. Poor, hapless sovereign! she thought more of her
                  tinsel than the French did of her rights: thus the small difficulty. Frenchmen are
                  clever fellows in a small way, have very pliable ideas, which they can change with
                  wondrous celerity; they aim to do good, if, through their eccentricities, they too
                  often fail. They are pleased to consider themselves more refined than Americans,
                  and yet they are more deficient in moral courage—that moral courage which is made
                  to conserve the good of the State. An Englishman's reserve, a Frenchman's
                  politeness, and a Yankee's go-aheadativeness,—all contending for the palm of
                  honesty, form the curious illustration of an eventful age.
               "'Let us push on, John, across the calm ocean we shall soon arrive at 
                     Shanghi
                     Shanghai
                  ,' said I, confidentially.
               "'Yes!' returns John, interrupting me, and I wish we could get a glimpse at Japan.
                  Other nations have supposed it impregnable; but Jonathan has found his way to the
                  very gates of the Emperor's palace, which he now knocks at with might and main.
                  How fantastically he is dressed! Coal-basket in one hand, and Bible in the other,
                  he is cutting what may be properly termed figure number one.'
               "'Certainly! I rejoined, 'that is the figure to make safe our country's interests.
                  Trade and civilization is Jonathan's motto, While 'go-ahead' is the
                  pass-word that has placed him where he is—in power. Jonathan demolishes the
                  aristocratic fantasy of dignity, and builds up the greatness of a people with the
                  simplicity of trade. We never had the most distant annexation design on this
                  little empire, but we want coals that our commerce may be fostered and protected
                  in its march over the world; and, if we chance to do a little trade while teaching
                  an isolated people their proper position, so much the better for the world and
                  manifest destiny. The absurdity of celestial pre-eminence must be removed from the minds of
                  those who yet maintain it at the expense of Christendom. If we can sell the
                  Emperor's people Lowell cotton, at the same time you are selling them Manchester
                  stripes, where can be the objection? There can be no harm in promoting that which
                  has for its end the interchange of good feeling between the most distant nations
                  of earth: interchange of commerce infuses its spirit of energy, and its results
                  are for the good of the many. But those interchanges between progressive and
                  non-progressive governments should be conducted with caution and kindness, in
                  order to preserve mutual respect. The double-sided Dutchman prostrates himself
                  before the barbarian whose commerce he seeks; but in doing so he enlists contempt
                  for his nation, without aiding to tear down that superciliousness of the barbarian
                  which is the greatest enemy of the world at large. Better were it he approached
                  that monarch on equal terms—to, it might be, compel him to reconcile his feelings
                  to the force of manifest destiny. Smooth will stand the odds that Commodore Perry
                  gets the better of the Dutchman, comes the independent over the Emperor, and makes
                  a contract for the establishment of cotton factories and churches all along his
                  coast. 'Land! oh,' suddenly cried out John, at the top of his voice—'another patch
                  ahead.' In another moment he shrieked out:—'There you go—good by!' As I
                  overreached to sight the object far beneath, one of the stays broke, the balloon
                  careened wildly, and making a dashing circle high in the air, out we tumbled into
                  the wild waste of space. Finding myself going, I reckoned it was as well to keep
                  up the philosophy, and remain cool. 'You're on the passage, too—are you, John?'
                  inquired I, finding him turning the most artistic somersaults in his descent.
                  'Yes,' he replied, in a tone indicative of sorrow; 'blast you, and your Young
                  American policy. This is the natural result of soaring above a reasonable level..
                  Your manifest destiny is finding its proper depths now!' John was terribly
                  chagrined; he reckoned Young America was a shade too fast. Flying, he said, was at
                  best a mighty poor business; once again on firm footing he would for ever look
                  upon manifest destiny as the most aerial thing of the fast nineteenth
                  century."
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               MR. SMOOTH IS RIGHT SIDE UP.
               "'THIS side up—with care!' said I, finding we must come down, and keeping an eye
                  on John, who looked as burly as a drifting ale pipe in a head sea, and whispered
                  something about Young America being an unpleasant companion to sail the air with.
                  Feeling how much better it was to be good-natured, I took the matter
                  mathematically, trusting to the best. To be always right end up is a principle
                  never to be lost sight of. There was land below us, firm and frowning; which,
                  before we knew where we were, we had slipped into, like preserved meat, up to our
                  arm-pits. Poor John made an awful blubbering; seeing which, I told him to be
                  good-natured, and at the same time inquired if he had worked up his whereabouts on
                  the way down.
               "'A pretty affair this!' said he, angrily. 'Here, on a desolate island, surrounded
                  by a broad ocean, what chance is there for us to save ourselves, or ever again
                  make the confines of civilization? Despondency knows no joking; and, in such a
                  perplexity, questions about reckoning are out of place. You may make light of it,
                  Mr. Smooth; but, if you please, let us think of some way to deliver ourselves,'
                  grumbled John, sweating, puffing, and blowing. Finally, he said he wished the old
                  gentleman with the horns had made a previous demand on him, inasmuch as it would
                  have saved him the trouble of dying on so desolate a spot, which to him seemed the
                  sorest grievance of all.
               "You groan over it some, don't you, old fellow? Reckon how you hain't seen a
                  Yankee try his ingenuity. Just puff a spell, until Mr. Smooth calmly studies a
                  little philosophy, which is a mighty good thing in cases of emergency like this,'
                  I remarked in reply, getting my ideas into a fix, in order to bring out the best
                  point of operation tion. Working myself
                  out in a cool sort of way, I seized hold of him by the shoulders, and yanked him
                  straight out, like a log from a marsh slough. 'Now, take it all for the best,
                  John,' I rejoined encouragingly, going to work and putting up a liberty pole, to
                  which I tacked the stars and stripes, while John was grumbling, growling, and
                  methodizing about saving himself. This done on behalf of my country, and Young
                  America more particularly, I set about erecting a hut, wherein we could both turn
                  in for the night. With me it was sink the desponding and keep up a stiff spring of
                  hope; but when bed-time came, John made a great fuss about his night-cap and
                  dressing-gown, and slippers,—as if the comforts of home were inseparable. Then he
                  made a crooked face about his bed, while I laughed at him for his whims, his
                  fancies, and his dogged pedantries. However, morning found him better-natured, and
                  taking advantage of the opportunity, we held a consultation upon what was best to
                  be done. That we were on an uninhabited island not a doubt existed: nor had any
                  son of civilized man ever visited it before: not so much of civilization as a
                  gallows was there to be seen anywhere, although there were visible in the distance
                  many mountains, and plains, and valleys, and lakes swarming with fish. With these
                  a people might have flourished, while the soil was pregnant of richness, ready to
                  bring forth corn, rice, tobacco, and cotton. I was grieved that such a spot should
                  lie wasting; all it wanted was a few sons of New England to make its resources of
                  great commercial value. A ponderous mountain rose nearly to the sky, distant some
                  two days' journey, in the west. After breakfasting on wild fruit (of which there
                  was a great abundance) and limpid water, we set out for it, making a straight line
                  through the forest; but before reaching the summit, and after three days'
                  scrubbing, we discovered smoke curling gently upward here and there in the clear
                  blue atmosphere. 'Lord bless ye, John!' I exclaimed, halting suddenly, 'there is
                  living critters here, as I'm a Down-easter.'
               "'I see 'um moving!' he rejoined, nervously surveying the spot. And in another
                  hour we were in the midst of a tribe of savages, swarthy and of vicious
                  appearance. Such yelling, hallooing, jumping, and cutting wild antics, you never
                  saw before, nor could pen describe. Nobody could have understood their chattering,
                  which was a species of growl and shortly accented muttering. Forsooth! it was as
                  unintelligible as that language so generally diffused through diplomatic notes and
                  protocols. Now hideous squaws ran one way, young children another. Dogs and cats
                  brought up the rear, their music combining in most ungrateful medley. John's fears
                  became excited as he saw the chiefs rushing furiously onward in the van. 'What
                  shall we do?' said he; 'they will exterminate us.' I said we had better summon all
                  our amiability and endeavor to engraft ourselves in their good graces. Young
                  America would talk Yankee to them. To this John gave ready consent. I was glad to
                  see that for once he had laid aside his dignity and superciliousness: it was
                  freely acknowledging that Uncle Sam was somebody—that he could, in his plain
                  straightforward way do clever things. Therefore, to initiate my diplomacy I drew
                  forth the Stars and Stripes, and held them before a monster chief of some seven
                  feet in stature, who had almost reached us, making savage grimaces. Soon he stood
                  before us, John commenced to bow with all his politeness, and meekly doffing off
                  his hat, began a speech with:—'Your sublime majesty—' 'Stop that, John!' I
                  exclaimed firmly, interrupting him. Here I stepped in, and extended my hand to the
                  savage. 'My name, stranger,' I continued 'is Commissioner Solomon Smooth—at home
                  they call me General Smooth. Now, seeing that I am sent by our patriotic President
                  (a very small man by the way, but immeasurably large when dealing in the mere
                  language of war) whose determination that talent of a truly American character
                  shall shine abroad has been fully appreciated by the nations honored with his
                  promising plenipotentiaries, Mr. Pierce has deputed me to square the world in
                  general, and manifest destiny in particular.' The savage at first exhibited signs
                  of concern, but finally summoned to his aid a salutation of welcome, and at the
                  same time grasped my hand warmly and earnestly. Communicating with him by signs
                  was not the most agreeable office: but when there is a point to be gained energy
                  is always well spent. I would enlighten him upon matters connected with our
                  government, while ascertaining his ideas of annexation: this the language of signs prevented my doing. I regretted
                  this exceedingly, inasmuch as it compelled me to forego the comparison I
                  contemplated making between his and those known ideas entertained by General
                  Pierce himself. Enough, however, was drawn from the signs to prove a striking
                  coincidence. 'Never bin to Washington—I reckon?' I inquired assuming the
                  independent, as I gave my hat an easy set on the windward side of my head. He
                  shook his head, and croaked out something no one could understand. 'Great place!'
                  rejoined I—'ought to come over and see it, old fellow.' I affectionately placed my
                  arm about his neck, as he shook his head a second time; the small kindness had
                  made us good friends. Motioning John to him, he grasped our hands, led us to his
                  camp, called a council of his people, who said much it was impossible for us to
                  understand. Indeed, they set up a conflict of sound more dinning than the roar of
                  waters. Instinctively hospitable, when dinner-time came they motioned us to sit
                  and partake of a piping dish of snakes' heads and fried beetles, of which choice
                  delicacies the old chief was sorely grieved that we ate but little. Now and then
                  he would spread his hands, as if to say—why not eat of what I give you? I was not
                  long in becoming acquainted with our new acquaintance; nor did I fail to shock the
                  modesty of our worthy friend John, who said he could not view with indifference
                  the celerity with which I walked into things which should be touched only with the
                  dignity of national character.
               "'Now stranger,' continued I, addressing myself good-naturedly to the chief;
                  'seeing you are sovereign of this remote but lovely country—and that yours is
                  manifestly an empire—suppose we try a little trade. Smooth is a free-and-easy
                  citizen of the United States—can meet you at and be friendly over anything. My
                  friend here (I pointed to John who seemed in an offish mood) is a Britisher, an
                  honest member of that very ancient and gallant family which now views us, too
                  often for that spirit which should make us friends, as a beardless upstart; John,
                  though extremely vain, 'is not a bad fellow, and at times improves on
                  acquaintance. If his proclivities for getting into an hole (like a toad in a
                  shower) are at times too strongly manifested, who so ungenerous as not to forgive
                  the hereditary character of the disease?
               "'Umph! umph! whew! exclaimed the chief, as he spread his hands and contorted his
                  face. We could not understand him; pained were we that we could not. He felt
                  keenly the misfortune, shook his head in sorrow; and murmured, as if a world
                  separated his thoughts and ours. Modestly, John touched me on the shoulder, and
                  whispered:—'S'pose we call this distant Britain? you can have the next discovery.
                  I'll proclaim it in the name of my sovereign—it will be quite right;' John was
                  inclined to do the very honorable on the sly; but, being of opinion that he had
                  appropriated to himself enough in that sort of way, I interposed a decided
                  objection. 'Governor!' I retorted, taking the chief by the hand—'if a good
                  speculation you would make, annex this little empire of yours to our great
                  Republic. Manifest destiny will make you one of us; but don't wait for that. Hook
                  on while the link is hot—you'll find it a good speculation. Young America will put
                  your nation through a process of regenerating: he will make steam civilize when
                  everything else fails; he will send his Transit Company to take possession of the
                  government. We seek not, like John to conquer—we colonize. You may be one of us;
                  by accepting Young America's offering you may be as independent as a colored
                  preacher on Sunday.' The chief gazed in bewilderment—his people muttered still
                  more.
               "John now became furious of anger. 'We, too,' he interposed, 'colonize. Say you
                  will come under the protection and acknowledged allegiance to our Queen, and yours
                  shall be a scarlet coat, a cocked hat, and a great broadsword wherewith to fight
                  your way in the world.' The chief moved his head doubtingly, as his body vibrated
                  from head to foot. What strange opinions invaded his thoughts! 'He placed his
                  broad hard hands gently on our heads, drew us lovingly to him, and smiled. In that
                  smile was that which said we were both good and honest, but needed much watching.
                  We were, indeed, good specimens of our separate nations, but the free-and-easy
                  seemed most acceptable to the savage. 'Governor!' I continued to address the chief
                  as I turned to John, beware of his fascinating coat of scarlet. Such things may
                  charm the little; sensible men know their worthlessness. Hang out the
                  star-spangled banner, espouse popular rights; let the rest of mankind know you belong to a nation whose
                  destiny is the overthrow of kings and kingcraft on one continent at least.' Still,
                  mutely the savage listened. There was no getting English into his head; hence I
                  saw the necessity of gaining my ends by signs and motions, after the fashion of
                  our modern diplomacy. Say what you will, mute diplomacy is not without its effect.
                  At it I went, in a style that put French dancing entirely into the shade.
               "'Your Yankee figuring won't play on his head, Smooth,' spoke Littlejohn, in a
                  tantalizing sort of vein. He is less a fool than you take him for.'
               "I calmly intimated that he might be right, but inquired if he ever knew a Yankee
                  out-yankeed? John folded his arms, and got his face well adjusted within the
                  circle of his ample shirt-collar, which he had preserved unruffled during his
                  fall. Suddenly I remembered that in my pocket was a handbill of Uncle Obadiah's
                  clock factory, upon which was broadly emblazoned a time-piece of modern fashion.
                  Its effect was electric. No sooner was it displayed than the barbarian's eye
                  glowed with anxiety; the gaudy picture carried his heart and soul captive to Uncle
                  Sam. In his ecstacy he threw his arms about me, hugged me and fawned me, and in
                  his joy was well nigh devouring me. Poor John stood outdone—dumfounded. The sight
                  was characteristic.
               "'Principles, in these days of development,' mumbled John, as with the fingers of
                  his right hand he stroked his chin, 'I admit give way to circumstances. To say a
                  difficulty exists you Yankees cannot surmount—to say an invention is known you
                  cannot improve and apply; to say a remote colony exists you cannot people and
                  govern, is a calumny gross indeed. If they fail to gain the end they aim at by one
                  movement they will resort to another more bold—success must follow.' John
                  grudgingly made the admission. Had he possessed the forethought to discover how
                  the point was likely to turn he would have provided himself with the picture of a
                  business-like ambassador proceeding to a great convention with only 
                     thiry-two
                     thirty-two
                   females in his train, as might have been seen at Vienna very recently;
                  or, better yet, the picture of a duke's flunkey, which, being the more ridiculous
                  of the two, would to the savage have proved the greater attraction. But John
                  turned coldly and methodically from the subject. His ancestors had made so many
                  sovereigns! he said. Nothing to be gained, his thoughts were turned now to the
                  means of getting away from the savages. Not another day would he stay; I was at
                  liberty to start any amount of young Republics. Apprehending difficulty from his
                  state of excitement I counselled his better nature, and brought to the rescue the
                  quiet and cheerful of his curious composition. It was the only way to surmount a
                  great difficulty. Preserving, then, the calm of a philosopher, I set about
                  inventing something to take us from thence, to a more congenial land. Smooth, with
                  progress in his head and grasp in his fingers, can, upon the same principle that
                  he can start something to please our nation, create some thought for the relief of
                  two distressed individuals. One half the failures in the world are the result of
                  the mind magnifying the undertaking into an impossibility, instead of setting
                  about it fresh and vigorous—making a determination to achieve the object. The
                  American nature has become bold of adventure, and one of its greatest
                  characteristics is, never to stand in doubt when an experiment is to be
                  tried.'
               "'Yes, but, Smooth!' he interrupted, 'you don't consider that we British officials
                  abroad are placed in a very unpleasant position. Our acts being at all times
                  liable to disapproval at the Foreign Office, we too frequently remain passive for
                  want of faith at home and confidence in ourselves. The spirit of the Foreign
                  Office is like a weathercock on wings; we are a mere servilage to the uncertain
                  changes and caprices of those who may chance to be its Chief.'
               "'By that, I understand you know not how to act; and to avoid being wrong you
                  remain inactive, that course being likely to receive the most praise. My good
                  fellow, lesson from Young America,—act boldly, take the responsibility on your own
                  shoulders, and abide the consequences. Be an independent citizen,—let your acts be
                  your country's and your own;—and whatever the result may be, meet it manfully,
                  that moral courage may strengthen your cause. Now, then, let us set about building
                  a canoe; let us imagine we can do a prodigy and it shall be done!' At this John's
                  spirit became restored.
               
               "We went to work in right good earnest, and, with necessity for an incentive,
                  found ourselves at the expiration of three days master of a fine canoe, with which
                  we drew down the astonishment of the natives. Two days more and we bid them a
                  touching farewell, promised to call and see them again, bring cotton, cloth and
                  sundry Yankee notions, with which to start a trade between them and the people of
                  Salem, Massachusetts. Supplied with fish and porkmonhunter, a savory dish prepared
                  by the natives, we set sail for Shanghai, I being skipper of the craft, and John
                  mate. Nothing should seem to one's mind too simple to learn, and I learned to
                  navigate by what the sailors in times past called the rule of thumb: the rule now
                  came nicely into play. Energy is the master of difficulties; the application of it
                  is all-necessary when they present themselves. Adhering to this maxim I took the
                  helm, laid down the course, and steered for Shanghai, while John kept a close
                  watch on the stars. At times he would work lunars in his head, as did the
                  Macedonians. Laughable as it may seem, John was just credulous enough to think
                  that savages in these out-of-the-way parts of the world were honored with a north
                  star, and amused himself with speculations on its 
                     indentity
                     identity
                  . As luck will now and then favor the unfortunate, so we, after a voyage
                  in which were any amount of storms and hair-breadth escapes, which it will be
                  needless to describe here, arrived at the expiration of the tenth day safely at
                  Shanghai. To know precisely where one is, and feel safe on terra-firma after a
                  tempestuous voyage, makes the heart leap with joy—and with joy leaped mine."
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               MR. SMOOTH MAKES A FEW REFLECTIONS.
               "SHANGHAI seemed a place of adventures and uncertain speculations; its people were
                  a medley of all sorts of human kind badly propounded. Perhaps I should except that
                  numerous gentry called fleas, so averse to travellers that they at once set about
                  biting them out of the town. Two days in Shanghai proved quite enough. So, viewing
                  it advisable, we packed up our alls, and on foot shaped our course for Scinde, a
                  territory rather out of the way and very remotely situated. Littlejohn, still my
                  companion, said his honorable Governor got possession of it in a very dignified
                  sort of way; nevertheless, he thought it advisable that as little as possible be
                  said about the process. The truth was, it was not distinctly known what the rest
                  of mankind said about it.
               "After much journeying and hardship, we found ourselves in the heart of Scinde,
                  which looked desolate enough to have been under any other than British rule:— we
                  speak merely for the honor of British rule! 'This, Uncle John's, too?' I inquired,
                  touching John on the shoulder.
               "'Beg your pardon!' he returned, with affected indifference.
               "'Does Britannia rule this territory?' I reiterated.
               "'Well,' he rejoins, hesitatingly, 'as to that—Smooth, give us yer hand—there is
                  something to be considered; we believe in dispensing blessings to mankind; and
                  that all men, great and small, may have their share, we aim to infuse our
                  principles, and make them understood throughout the world. It's all for humanity
                  and the good of Christianity; but, you see, we have for a long time tried to make
                  these foolish Princes comprehend the benefits resulting sulting therefrom without success, and were really
                  forced to harsh measures. We were sorry it was so, but, being the case, we, as a
                  national sequence, had to resort to conquering. Now, though it may not be always
                  necessary to apply the principle of conquering to do good, it follows as a rule
                  that good must result where the conqueror is a Christian power, whose only motive
                  is progress and civilization for the good of all. The Anglo-Saxon teaches the
                  barbarian to know himself; and when he has done this he endeavors to infuse
                  principles of trade and constitutional government into his mind; but not daring to
                  leave him to himself, he reluctantly, nevertheless, is compelled to subject him to
                  his rule. I frankly admit we refrain from doing these manifest destiny things, as
                  you call them, with the same boldness characterized in your proceedings with
                  Mexico. Our East India Company may not be the very best institution in the world
                  for governing purposes, for it is dangerous to invest a trading compact with
                  governing powers, inasmuch as selfish interests will conserve to keep the power of
                  the governing superior to the best interests of the governed, even though they be
                  in the majority; but the Company is a great machine for civilizing and keeping
                  civilized, that trade may not lose its influence. It teaches these poor devils of
                  natives to talk English, and, sir, can you calculate what a blessing that will be
                  when it comes into general use? By and by we will be enabled to turn this vast
                  empire into one field teeming with the richest produce.'
               "'All right,' said I, interrupting his sentence: 'we will yet agree on something.
                  In the meantime, let me inquire, John, why you did not add—what a blessing it
                  would be did they but understand the English!' Your modesty and their insane
                  bigotry furnish a strange group of nondescript governments, which Uncle John
                  covetously fathers, though they be the illegal issues of that very honorable
                  dredging machine, whose grapnels, always extended, are for ever bringing up
                  something new. In truth, this company so strong of power, which it sways on the
                  penny-wise principle, and so pampered by royalty, is ever troubling honest Uncle
                  John with its unfortunate affairs.'
               "'It never will do to talk in that kind of way, Smooth; 'twill never do! When you
                  Yankees make grave charges, you forget to clothe them with style and dignity: they
                  are things of much importance in government matters, and then it never comes to
                  much for small men to prate against powerful bodies pursuing formidable
                  enterprises.'
               "'Listen, John!' I retorted, laying my right hand good-naturedly on his left
                  shoulder, 'that which takes from a country without previously spreading
                  nourishment to sustain it is a dredging machine, and will sooner or later dry up
                  its resources. It takes out, but forgets to put in, thinking only of the present,
                  while the future ,invites an enlightened policy to nurture and bring out its
                  richer resources.' But with these small misdemeanors we would not directly charge
                  Uncle John, who is at times as honorable as he is dogged; but he, fathered as he
                  is with the responsibility, is seriously to blame for this neglect. Viewing these
                  things in their proper light, John and Jonathan, stimulated by the same virtuous
                  inclinations, and weighing well their distinctive prowess, should be careful not
                  to offend by petty means: how much better to encourage friendly relations, than
                  wound a sensitive but worthy national pride! Promising to criminate after this
                  fashion so much in vogue no more, we left the desolate Scinde, continued our way
                  across an immense waste, where might have risen up one of the mightiest and most
                  fertile empires. An enlightened policy only was wanted. The people were ignorant
                  of their power and resources: John had conquered, and viewed it well to keep them
                  so. His East India dredge did not dissent to this verdict. My friend John thought
                  the acquisition well approved. But the people, he said, were worthless; they added
                  superstition to ignorance and fierceness, and obstinately opposed the bettering
                  their condition. 'Without attempting to burden your credulity, Jonathan,'
                  interpolated John, 'the truth is, we well understood the nature of this people,
                  and having failed to conciliate them in one way betook ourselves to another, and
                  in our characteristic style chastised them into submission.' John spoke with great
                  seriousness, never for a moment lessening his air of dignity. Indeed, it embodied
                  and acknowledged serious mode of docilizing a people: how much real attachment
                  between the conqueror and conquered must follow this system we leave the reader to contemplate. The honorable Mr.
                  John, notwithstanding, had a very circuitous way of confessing the fact of having
                  taken into his family, by this arbitrary system of wedlock, no end of people;
                  still he accused Jonathan of using his soft-sawder for the same purpose.
               "Journeying a few days through a country rich of soil and rivers turned to no
                  account, we reached a dominion called the Punjaub, which John said had limits he
                  knew not where, and was his, too. He acquired it by the same bold and very
                  honorable stroke of policy. The chiefs, he said, kept up a continued jarring among
                  themselves; such being fatal to their best interests, he, as a friend, merely
                  stepped in to put an end to their unprofitable disputes.
               "As I have before told the reader, this honorable individual, who sensitively
                  declared nothing could make him less than a gentleman, never failed to consider
                  himself a model of forbearance, but in the fulness of his generous soul, having
                  conquered, he rather preferred to remain conqueror. In the Punjaub John had left
                  his mark, but nothing to praise.
               "Despairing of finding something to praise in the Punjaub we passed over into
                  Pegua—John's also. Got by the same bold stroke of policy—a few variations
                  excepted! It was rather a fascinating piece of territory, to the Rajah of which he
                  had several times offered protection, after the manner of that protectorate of two
                  centuries, so vauntingly claimed over the Mosquitoes. The barbarian as often
                  rejected it. This, John could not submit to: humanity demanded he should accept
                  the kind proffer. And to serve the ends of humanity did John hasten to the Rajah's
                  palace one Commodore Lambert—a pugnacious seafaring diplomatist, known for his
                  love of the yard-arm law. The Commodore would hold a parley with the Rajah; the
                  Rajah, whose dignity was first to be consulted, was too slow in preparing his
                  palace. The Commodore, erratic of temper, was at times accustomed to growl for his
                  own amusement; he now growled for the amusement of his countrymen. The result was
                  natural. In the littleness of his vanity did the Rajah imagine himself a very
                  great man. He was important of those small follies which prove the great
                  misfortunes of old nations. The Commodore must wait in the sun, with becoming
                  respect for his dignity. But the seafaring diplomatist esteemed the importance of
                  his cloth above all barbarian considerations, hence decided himself insulted. As
                  patience is essential to the success of diplomacy, so the Rajah deemed it
                  expedient to test how far that quality was possessed by the Commodore, whom he
                  permitted to wait two hours in a vertical sun. This was too much for the patience
                  of any respectable gentleman, and only resulted in exciting the petulance of the
                  before-named sea-going Ambassador, who just demolished a few out-of-the-way towns,
                  and pocketed the kingdom for his Queen. From this it will be seen (we make no
                  allowance for John's acceptance of the issue) that the vanity of a Rajah and the
                  petulance of a Commodore cost a kingdom. Littlejohn said this was the way Pegua
                  slipt, almost unconsciously, into the possession of his family. The process was of
                  itself so innocent! Language to praise it sufficiently John could not find.
                  Diplomacy having large claims on the observance of etiquette, cannot permit
                  insults to go unpunished, said he. The Commodore, too, was in diplomacy a fast
                  sort of man, and could not be excited to anger without a consideration—which said
                  consideration was no other than that the aforesaid Rajah just hand over the
                  kingdom. Spunky boys are Uncle John and Cousin Jonathan! To that end the Commodore
                  pitched into the Rajah, thrashed him, bagged his dominions, and would as little as
                  possible were said about it. Here, then, it was clearly shown that what John
                  charged Jonathan with was but a facsimile of the crimes so profusely spread at his
                  own door. Great governments are at best thieves; and to claim a superiority of
                  modesty in acquiring dominion is poor moonshine badly spent. With these
                  contemplations we agreed not to quarrel, but continue our journey over Turkey
                  homeward.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               MR. SMOOTH SEES A COUNTRY GREAT IN RESOURCES BLIGHTED BY A NARROW
                  POLICY.
               "DIFFICULT is it for a man travelling in a country where everything seems crooked,
                  to keep up straight ideas. I have said crooked, for where nature has been most
                  profuse in her blessings, and no signs of the iron sinews of progress are seen;
                  where no Mississippi steamboats move on in busy occupation, opening up the
                  resources of a country; where no bright villages hold to light the charms of hardy
                  industry; where the favored few gather the fruits of the husbandman's
                  energy—something must indeed be crooked. Through countries enamelled of nature's
                  best offerings, as fine as ever spread out before the eye of man, we travelled;
                  but all seemed wasting away in the inertness of bad government. A narrow policy
                  had spread weeds where fruitful vines would have hung blessings for mankind.
                  Things called men revelled in what to them seemed luxury, but in poverty and
                  wretchedness a people struggled; men walked to and fro in tattered garments,
                  colored like unto their moral and physical degradation. But they heeded it not,
                  and were careless because no one cared for them. There is no slavery so abhorrent
                  as that of the menial who has no thought beyond the narrow sphere of his
                  servitude, and the little pleasure which his light heart may transitorily enjoy.
                  Here men saw no vitality in the hand that ruled: hence they maudled through that
                  deadening scum of servile life that tramples better things beneath its feet.
               "From the fertile bottoms of the Himalayas to the Indian ocean on one side, and
                  from the Burmese boundary to wherever British rule extended on the other, there
                  spread out the same sickly prospect. There, resigned, stood outlined the same
                  apathy of spirit, the same result of misgovernment—the same soul-degrading
                  influences; the same rebuking spectacle; the result of the same wealth-dredging
                  principles practiced by a few. Cotton, corn, and sugar, would have repaid the hand
                  of the husbandman tenfold, nature having given it germ for that purpose; but
                  jungle grew in their stead, while bad government rioted in its follies.
                  Nationality had no soul, energy no lifesprings, progress no railroads to move
                  onward. The honorable John, having conquered, and very modestly enthroned himself,
                  was strong to maintain his centralizing power, from which point he would make
                  effectual his blighting policy. Notwithstanding this, John would have us believe
                  him world-wide in his kindness, desire his power made known to mankind in general,
                  and stood ever ready to have his philanthropy and his tears spent upon the sorrows
                  of the American slave. Were they not more needed in his own Indian dominions? A
                  peasant clothed in rags picks his little spot of sickly cotton as it falls from
                  the bowl; but how valueless is it to the poor wretch ignorant of the first
                  principles of trade! Yet, instead of providing for his improvement, this honorable
                  dredging machine which so disgracefully governs a people flatters him into
                  contentment with promises it never intended to fill. With his bag of cotton
                  gathered, the humble subject is pointed to a path through a country infested by
                  dangerous bands, over which he may seek a market some hundred miles distant. In
                  its crude state he roughs it, and sweats it, puts it through—without a gin to give
                  it market value!—all the various processes of damaging during the transit, and is
                  surprised that India, with the best soil and climate in the world for such an
                  object, cannot raise a good and sufficient supply of the raw material.' What a
                  look of pity the wretch might bestow upon the board of directors, sitting in
                  pompous conclave in Leadenhall street! Happy is he, Jonathan, who, contented,
                  knows not the things at his hand by which his own condition may be bettered. And
                  how blind is that rule, which, having the power to do good, contents itself with
                  dragging eagerly away the first compensation. The penalty of the crime of not
                  developing what is given us by nature for a nation's good is the sacrifice of a people's happiness. My friend John
                  reluctantly acknowledged the delinquency. Mark the contrast! Had this
                  all-bountiful India been ours, a more liberal policy would have produced results
                  widely different. No oligarch could have sacrificed it to its own avarice;
                  associations would have sprung up for developing industry; a policy to make the
                  resources of the state serve general interests would have been established, and
                  the good of the many had been kept in view. Cotton-growing, and tobacco-planting,
                  and rice-cultivating, had been encouraged and fostered. Those rich alluvial
                  bottoms, so fertile and yet so uncultivated, had given out their rich harvests to
                  some purpose—untaxed prosperity would have rewarded the hand of the hardy
                  husbandman. India would then, besides proving herself the greatest exporting
                  empire in the world, have clothed, fed and made happy her benighted millions.
               "Had India been ours, Yankee enterprise had traversed it with plank roads; Yankee
                  enterprise had laid down strap railroads until better ones had resulted from
                  profits; Yankee energy had invented a species of Mississippi steamboat, wherewith
                  to navigate its narrow water-courses to their source, and there develope the
                  capabilities of the country. 'Yes, Yankee ingenuity had had a steamboat where
                  there was scarce water for a duck to swim. But why pain the feelings with
                  recapitulations like these? Its resources are of little value when government
                  interposes a dogged obstinacy to improvements; nor is it much better where a
                  people seem at a loss to know whose business it is to give out the incentive. So
                  long as this state of things lasts will Cotton remain king, and Uncle John be its
                  most servile and dependent subject. It matters little that his empire is so
                  beautifully adapted to its cultivation. He must shake off his love of those very
                  ancient and effeminating systems of his, and adopt the modern policy of improving
                  and nourishing industry.
               "John admitted things were not conducted on the most approved principle; but as
                  the business belonged to the old gentleman, who was very testy in the exercise of
                  his power, he was at a loss to conceive what we had to do with it. That became
                  very easy to explain; for whereas Young America claims a right to dictate
                  principles that will aid in working out manifest destiny, so also does he take
                  upon himself the right of pointing out the evil of all political misgovernment
                  that falls under his notice. It was not the honorable manner in which a government
                  acquired new territory or incorporated weak provinces, that Mr. Smooth had to deal
                  with, but the dishonorable government that followed. Wherever waste and misery
                  meet the eye of an energetic man, who discovers the palpable cause at the door of
                  wrong-headed government, his natural feelings revolt against the powers that be;
                  and to an American, trained in the New England school of universal industry, the
                  desolation seems calling upon him to take the initiative of working out its
                  improvement.
               "With me, a feeling, inspired by the best of motives, prompted the advancing some
                  rules of improvement; but, conscious of Uncle John's obstinacy to being instructed
                  by youth, and with a just sense of the obstacles my tattered garments would
                  present, the inclination failed. Indeed, John, as dogged as he is old in
                  experience, views his son Jonathan as a bold, reckless, and discontented fellow,
                  whose notions of progress he would receive with the same cautious hand he would
                  his, to him, preposterous principles of republicanism. He, while entertaining some
                  good feeling for us, hath an inert prejudice which views us as levellers, always
                  reforming or abusing reforms. Swelled, he says, by large notions of ourselves,
                  generous in our expectations, and never ceasing in our love of excitements until
                  we are safely landed in the grave, we are become dangerous to the great family
                  compact. In the devil's department, says John, your Young America would prove his
                  energetic nature by devising some new arrangement, addition, or modification of
                  that gentleman's sin-roasting machinery. Failing in that, he would plan some
                  enterprise, propose some joint-account operation with Mr. Jones, and content
                  himself with 'truck-and-dicker,' or charcoal, for his half of the spoils. In
                  heaven, your Young American would be discontented, unless he were devising some
                  improvement, getting up spiritual intrigues, or laying the foundation of some new
                  species of glory—perhaps claiming a right to entire possession.
               "'You must understand,' Mr. Smooth,' said John, 'we have long been meditating a
                  new policy for this great and fertile empire, now so desolate; but we pursue ends
                     most patiently, letting our thoughts
                  have the benefit of time, before reducing them to practice. Manchester wants
                  cotton—wants it free-grown—that she may relieve herself from the yoke of King
                  Slavery; but she cannot yet solve the problem by which the throbbings of her
                  manufacturing philanthropy may be set at rest. She thinks long and strong of it,
                  but there it rests—and there's the rub. John is blind, and Cotton is king.'
               "'With us it would present no rub; give us the means, as spread out to your hands,
                  and the problem we would solve while you were pondering over its intricacy. We
                  would pay good premiums to practical overseers of cotton plantations in Georgia
                  and Alabama, who, with the inducement offered, would come as
                  instructors—cotton-growing requires the application of the nicest agricultural
                  science—in the art of cultivating the sensitive plant. And to encourage private
                  enterprise we would offer bounties for the largest amount of best quality produced
                  on the smallest space. By government encouraging the best staple, a rivalry would
                  spring up which could not fail to produce much good; it would open up a spirited
                  system of planting, as well as that enlarged intercommunication of commerce which
                  must follow.' Let me take leave of this subject!
               "From India we sojourned across the great desert, meeting in succession the
                  white-robed Arab, the savage Kurd, the docile Yeeside, and the melancholy Turk.
                  John said we must have a staff, and a score of guides, and no end of menials, and
                  must put on the dignity, or it would not be safe, especially now that Turks and
                  Russians were at war. Mr. Smooth took exceptions to this ruling, preferring to
                  assume the go-ahead, and test the virtue of a hard front, the effects of which he
                  was quite sure would not be entirely lost even among the Arabs. And then, if the
                  Turks and Russians were again at war about holy places—places for which a deal of
                  human blood had been spilt for the mere gratification of a very unholy
                  ambition—Mr. Smooth, on behalf of Young America, might make a dollar or two by the
                  way of proposing a very christian plan for settling the stubborn intricacy. With
                  this best of all motives in view, I left John in the desert, where he said he
                  expected to do some good business, and, what was better, get some good dinners.
                  So, bidding him godspeed, I made straight headway for the point where the pious
                  difficulty had resulted in so much iniquitous blood-shedding.
               "The fact is, Old Uncle John was at first inclined to make rather spare use of
                  bear's grease to dress his Turkey, an unhealthy bird, scarcely possessing fat
                  enough to cook himself; but, being rather doubtful of his own culinary efficiency,
                  had consented to receive a French cook into the family: and, fearing there might
                  yet be a deficiency, the ever-credulous old dotard was making good-natured
                  overtures to one Joseph of Hapsburg,—never trustworthy, and always known to act as
                  circumstances changed interests,—who said there was no knowing what time he would
                  be ready to turn his attention to such purposes. Joseph, however, was never in his
                  life so willing to play open and shut with John, at the same time giving Nicholas
                  that cunning wink so well understood in all respectable family circles. This game
                  Joseph played, and played, and played, until the credulity of old John seemed like
                  a cooked fish in a pot of porridge. The fact must be confessed that Joseph was so
                  politically dishonest that to be for once honest was tantamount to a great victory
                  over his traditional immorality. Knowing right well the traits of character this
                  Joseph possessed, Jonathan would at short notice lend a willing hand to thrash
                  other morals into his system. However, with a view of leaving this point to be
                  settled by more interested parties, Smooth proceeded to the holy places, where, he
                  regrets to say, he shuddered at the thought of how much human slaughtering it had
                  been the scene—all done for holy causes. Let an impious world forgive those
                     Little Ones who in all ages have lent their aid to stimulate the
                  worst passions!
               "As for Turkey, I, Smooth, would make no insinuations against that lovely but
                  ill-governed country. Muslamism was dying by its own hand; it had shocked a world
                  with its persecutions; it had scoffed at virtue, and was sinking down into its own
                  deluge of vice. The independence of Turkey! Now, Mr. Smooth made no boast of his
                  common-sense, but to such as he had it was a question whether the Turk, instead of
                  exhibiting so fanatical a love for fighting, had not better betake himself to
                  reconstructing and reforming his internal government, and by that means save
                  himself from a continual jarring with nations sensitive of the rights of their subjects. Should this be
                  thought an employment too inferior, he might employ himself with a plan for
                  enforcing a more strict respect for the rights and feelings of the christian
                  population under his political rule. It would not be incompatible with his own
                  best interests, for it is unnatural that an inferior govern a superior race.
                  Flatterers, and even savans, may find apologies in the changes fortune has been
                  pleased to make in the affairs of a state; but here so strong are the evidences of
                  bad government that only lame excuses can be offered for the finest country the
                  sun shines on groaning in poverty and distress. The independence of Turkey!
               "There could be no doubt that the Bear had long cherished a serious inclination to
                  do for the Turkey, the character of whose independence he well understood. He
                  would make fertile use of its apathy. The Bear would cook the Turkey with his own
                  grease—albeit, he found him a sick man, but had no objection to the meal. If,
                  however, he had lain his paws too rudely upon the patient, diplomatic donkeyism
                  made the case still more dangerous. Mr. Smooth begs the reader's pardon for using
                  the term 'diplomatic donkeyism;' but indeed the only difference he has yet been
                  capable of detecting between the conclave which drew upon the nations of Europe so
                  much carnal warfare and the assinine species is, that the former have soft heads
                  in place of ears. These diplomatic donkeys, ever ready to keep the world apprised
                  of their own greatness, and without the slightest objection to getting up an
                  unnecessary number of excitements for its benefit, betook themselves to playing
                  drafts, in which game they made such an innumerable quantity of wrong moves, that
                  they lost themselves on the board. The world strove to respect the body, but
                  having never before been perplexed with such polite players, the effort was indeed
                  a task. With regard to their game of drafts, such was the fear of the Bear
                  exhibited by the movers that no one dare remove him boldly from the King row, lest
                  it leave an opening he was but too ready to take advantage of; nor did they want
                  to wound the Turkey by any incautious move whereby the Bear might unhesitatingly
                  swallow him: so they pushed and shoved until they found themselves in a sort of
                  baby-jumper, in which they could be nursed to sleep while the war they had so
                  innocently kindled waged fierce and bloody. In fact, they themselves got the Bear
                  so far into the crockery shop that no one could get him out without smashing to
                  pieces the whole establishment.
               "Everywhere in Turkey they were preparing for war; and so Mr. Smooth, as soon as
                  he reached Constantinople, where everybody seemed surprised to see such a
                  description of citizen, called a meeting of those whose feelings were so finely up
                  in fighting trim, to whom he stated in most emphatic language that, inasmuch as
                  Turkey had ennobled herself by her noble defence of Kossuth, whose asylum in her
                  domain was held sacred at the price of the kingdom, he had great respect for her,
                  but could not think of fighting. But they didn't seem to understand square Yankee
                  talk; the consequence of which, in Mr. Smooth's opinion, would be the Bear getting
                  his cubs in motion, to do some first-rate fighting. In this fighting Mr. Smooth
                  would not have the least objection to taking a hand, provided always that there
                  was some coin to be made at it. However, before entering upon the fighting
                  business, Mr. Smooth would especially stipulate that all Austrian notes and
                  Prussian protocols be used up in a bonfire, Austria be turned adrift as an
                  inconsistent huckster without principles, the diplomatic donkeys be driven into
                  the Danube, and all constitutional governments bound by arbitrary yokes set free.
                  In that case freedom and constitutionalism would fight its own battles and
                  constitutionalism would bid defiance to Czarism. When the battle of liberty
                  against barbarism became the issue, then Young America would join with a bounding
                  heart, a glowing soul, and a firm hand. We can whip all creation, build more
                  churches, blow up more steamboats, lay down more railroads, and absorb more
                  Mexican territory, than any other nation breathing; but, in this case, where
                  liberty was at stake, hold me back if we wouldn't fight! At the same time we would
                  pay a premium for the privilege of whipping Austria single-handed. Young America
                  owes her a debt he stands ready to pay at the shortest notice and cheapest price.
                  'Mr. Smooth,' said I, 'is here before you, a free and independent citizen of the
                  United States, ready to chalk down the items of fighting to be done, say about how much we can do it for, and get
                  General Pierce, whose fighting diplomatists will be thrown in, to stand security.'
                  Not comprehending this generous proposition I left them to their own stupid way;
                  and as every American conceived he had a right to his own opinions I hoped they
                  would become a reflex of the example.
               "Seeing nothing, in Constantinople I could turn to account—the allies were
                  undermining the foundation of Muslamism as fast as possible—I took a stroll to the
                  seat of war, contenting myself with the hope that something would ultimately turn
                  up. The fact was, I meant to follow the policy of the Aberdeen government when
                  starving to death one of the bravest armies that ever faced a foe. Instead of
                  expanding plains and undulating hills, such as Smooth had pictures to his mind in
                  his boyhood, I found the seat of war an ungainly mud-puddle, with ramparts of
                  savage-looking citizens menacing each other from its opposite banks. Between these
                  banks the amusement of war was every now and then kept up with doubtful results.
                  That something more than ordinary was to pay I felt assumed by the grimaces of the
                  contending parties, and feeling a deep interest in the cause, I vaulted into the
                  mist of a group on the left bank, so singularly mixed that their identity as
                  allies could not be mistaken. To the question as to what brought them there, they
                  answered with unintelligible assertions about the issue—the balance, of power—the 
                     stutus quo
                     status quo
                   of Europe, and nobody knows how many more things that were to remain
                  unmoved. The best that could be made of it was, that the atmosphere of kings and
                  emperors was filled with very explosive matter which they thought it best to let
                  off in this sort, of way. If, according to Mr. Smooth's philosophy, Europe were to
                  remain in status quo, that spirit of progress so
                  much beloved by Mr. Pierce, and his family must die, a natural death. Was it not
                  singular that the least discussed issue, the most prominent one of the war,
                  according to Smooth's opinion, was in regard to who should be the greatest toad in
                  the European puddle? Your European puddle is no ordinary affair; kings and
                  emperors only dabble in it at the expense of their people. I viewed with some
                  interest this European cesspool. In the centre there was seated on a pole, with
                  his arms folded, and having an air of assumed independence, a corpulent old
                  gentleman, whose face fused broad and red, like a full moon in harvest-time. This
                  very honorable gentleman had long esteemed himself the largest toad in the
                  European puddle, and was worthily sensitive of his position, though he at times
                  exercised it to a bad purpose. He was notoriously square-shouldered, had beer'd a
                  great deal during his life, and could be as obstinate as a well-fed donkey.
                  Indeed, he had more than once been known to put his finger in his mouth and look
                  serious when great events demanded prompt action, but he never failed to do his
                  part when driven into the fight. To speak honestly, and with all deference to the
                  feelings of this very respectable gentleman, John had no legitimate right to be
                  thus mixed up in this squabble of European despots; nor should he have permitted
                  himself to be led into it on the one side by that imperial transgressor, and
                  driven on the other by his own beer-shop politicians. That imperial first
                  transgressor had the fickle imaginations of his people to dazzle by paying off
                  certain old scores; even now how beautifully he plays the disinterested to curtain
                  the designs of his ambition! John, nevertheless, did wake from his years of stupor
                  to find himself in an uncertain position;—this was manifest by the manner in which
                  he assumed a contemplative mood. A few shakes at the hands of his rougher
                  politicians aroused his apprehension of being swamped in the political perplexity.
                  Mr. Smooth paused, and took a careful view of the venerable old man, that he might
                  learn something more of him. 'Stranger.' said I, 'what on earth has brought you
                  here?'
               "He canted his head, as if it were thickish. gave a dignified look, and again
                  turned to his meditations;—'Beg pardon, but I don't know you,' he grumbled.
               "'Social's the word, John; be social, and give us an inkling of your motive for
                  that peculiar position you unwittingly find yourself in.' The salutation seemed to
                  excite his astonishment. He was a stranger to such familiarity—rudeness, if so you
                  may please to call it; and turned from me, his movements assimilating to those of
                  a turtle with a coal of fire on his back.'
               "'You are who?' he returned, in a gruff voice, a scowl of contempt invading his
                  broad face.
               
               "'Smooth, from Down East!' I replied,—'who do you think it is?' To make the point
                  more convincing, I started up Yankee Doodle, which I whistled with the
                  variations."
               "'You are not only an intruder, but an impertinent fellow!'
               "'Need'nt feel disagreeable about it. Smooth—a man of standing in his diggins, and
                  Young America's independent delegate, has only come to take a bird's-eye view of
                  the way things look about this seat of war.'
               "'Who the devil is Mr. Smooth? I know he has no business here!' again grumbled the
                  old man.
               "'Don't know Solomon Smooth, eh?'
               "'No, don't nor do I want to. You are always making difficulty wherever you go,
                  probing your nose into everybody's business. You may be a keen fellow in commerce,
                  but in diplomacy you are impertinent and quite beside yourself. You better be off
                  from here, inasmuch as I am the biggest toad in this puddle, and mean to remain
                  so. We are not inclined to know anything about Mr. Smooth; so the quicker he packs
                  himself and his baggage up and is off from this, the better.' The earnestness with
                  which he said this left me no reason to doubt his intention to remain the biggest
                  toad of the pool.
               "'Mr. Smooth, something of a man in Washington, holds a contrary opinion, and
                  claims a right to know the ins and outs of what is going on outside of your
                  dominions, as well as inside his own, and to insinuate himself into just what it
                  may please him,' I replied in the measured manner of an experienced
                  diplomatist.
               "'Perhaps you have,' he interrupted, 'but if you were possessed of ordinary
                  modesty, you would refrain from intermeddling when you saw what a blasted time I
                  had to keep that great Bear, across there, from breaking his chain and devouring
                  everything on this side.'
               "'Feeling a fellow sympathy, I thought perhaps I might lend you a hand to do some
                  of the whipping,—knowing how the brute professes to be a christian of the latest
                  pattern.' Nicholas had a strong appetite for the Turkey, which, though sick, he
                  would have no objection to breakfast upon, as I have before stated; and, that his
                  christian cubs might share the feast, he had begun to teach them the
                  straightforward principles of holy orthodoxy; which said holy orthodoxy incited a
                  craving for blood we have not yet learned to appreciate.
               "'The said sick Turkey had not given the best satisfaction to the world in his
                  mode of reducing to poverty his flock; and, too, he was always ready to bandy
                  words and ostentation,—having a large supply of the latter always on hand. He had,
                  moreover, evinced a certain degree of heroism; nor was he ever backward in
                  professing his readiness to fight somebody—if it were the unruly Bear, so much the
                  better. The heroism thus manifested on the part of the decaying Turk would have
                  deserved more praise had it not had its origin in the assurance that Uncle John
                  would lend a hand to do the fighting. Mark ye! John had copiously poured forth his
                  treasure and blood in order that this vagabond Turkey might still live, and be
                  saved from the Bear's all-digesting stomach, and for which he would deny John the
                  freedom of his city; he would condescend only to honor him with the title of
                  dog.
               "In one sense a more generous fellow than John was not to be found on the outside
                  of our small world. He had been the pack-horse of Europe, and all sorts of kings
                  had used him for all sorts of purposes. Never was friend used better. He was
                  proud, and yet how submissive. Ready to shed his blood and squander his treasure
                  for he knew not what, he was equally willing to submit his well-burdened back to
                  the kicks and cuffs of those he had saved from ignominy. Now, the very type of
                  endurance was he who sat poised in the puddle. 'As for the Bear,' says John 'he
                  won't guarantee to be satisfied with his ordinary rations; and if he were to plant
                  himself in the centre of this puddle I would very obediently have to plant myself
                  out.' Here John folded his arms, and, with a dignified air, ordered his beer.
               "That John should keep his eye sharp to windward was natural enough; but had this
                  very same eye been kept to windward many years ago, much blood and treasure had
                  been saved in the present. It is playing false to his national character thus long
                  for which John now pays so dearly. But that phantom of terror excited by the
                  Bear's growth, Mr. Smooth seriously thinks unworthy of being entertained by the
                  honorable John.
               
               "'You need not be alarmed, Mr. Smooth,' continued John, modifying somewhat his
                  natural crisp: 'I am painfully sensible of our diplomatists having played the
                  donkey; but why should you, being far removed from the scene of strife, nor having
                  immediate interest in the game, desire to burn a finger in it? Be a man of
                  sense—watch kings and kingcraft—go your way home in peace, and let peace be your
                  glorious triumph over war!' From John such advice was valuable. Acknowledging the
                  joys and comforts of peace, we shook hands,—I wished John well with his fighting,
                  and we parted. I could not however, resist the conviction that John knew not for
                  what he fought so bravely, and might have maintained his position as the greatest
                  cock of the dunghill without sorrow to the homes of his people, and desolation
                  into the land of his long tried and most dependable friend. Who can foretell the
                  ways of a Napoleon. Oh! ambition, ambition!
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               DONE BROWN IN DOWNING-STREET.
               "FEW would have supposed that when Minister Smooth left General Pierce and his
                  waggish cabinet he would so soon have taken a turn round the world, and fetched up
                  in that world of misery and wealth called London. But the world has got very fast,
                  and only a fast man can keep up with it. Indeed, it were well we set about doing
                  things fast, instead of so thinking them over in the mind that they seem immovable
                  as mountains. Well, there was in London just about this time much waste of that
                  sort of small talk newspapers now and then deal largely in, (editors are always
                  kind enough to consider themselves great warriors), concerning our very spunky
                  Captain Ingraham, who, they said, had Kosta safe under his guns, and would blow
                  Austria to nobody knew where. The whole, however, only amounted to the simplest
                  evidence of what there was in sympathy and the Saxon heart. To our Christian
                  friends would we say—none of these things moved Smooth from his equilibrium. After
                  all, come to the true philosophy of the thing, and it only amounted to a broil
                  among small bullies. And, too, did the little skipper not take care of himself he
                  was no Yankee, and the whole United States would know it to his discredit.
               "General Pierce, too, being a fighting President, (not a doubt could exist since
                  the bombardment of Greytown), would take good care of the whole thing (perhaps
                  send to Congress a message blazing with the language of war). Could it turn a
                  point to his own advantage, he would—right or wrong—send a fleet to whip Austria,
                  to make her something.
               "But let us turn to a subject more fruitful. London seemed like a great waste of
                  dingy dwellings and badly constructed palaces, the whole sleeping under a canopy
                     of sickly smoke. Everything wore a
                  sombre, heavy air—even the men seemed born to methodize on some one object.
                  Show-shops, beer-shops, and gin-palaces, made the very air reek with their
                  stifling fumes. Above all, there were great palaces for very faint-hearted people,
                  who thought well of themselves, and in their prayers thanked Uncle John, at whose
                  great cost they lived in sumptuous idleness. As this last specimen of human
                  nature, when dressed in full shine, would completely outshine the most vain Pawnee
                  chief that ever ran wild in Arkansas, Mr. Smooth was anxious for a peep at the
                  curiosity. In truth, to Mr. Smooth's unpolished eye London looked as if it might
                  have emanated from a place called hook or crook, and stretched along the banks of
                  a nauseous stream spreading its death stenches in the air, where, diffusing itself
                  in the most perfect of fogs, it lent cheerful aid to the trade of physicians.
                  Everybody affected great knowledge of system; and yet things were so complex of
                  past errors and ages that no system existed equal to the requirements of the
                  present day. The municipality was great only on dinners and donkeyism. It had
                  indeed a dining senate, but that august body never was known to discuss the
                  practical reform of anything but turtle-soup, and that with an horrid carving of
                  the English language.
               "The beggar, (we name the worst nuisances first), the begrimed sweep, the butcher,
                  the hawker, the ignorant costermonger, the 'cute cabby, the wily tradesman, who
                  seeks favors and pockets frowns from his distinguished clowns—the Lord, whose rank
                  is known by his tinsel, and the Duke, so deeply identified with flunkeyism,—all
                  move along, helter-skelter, helter-skelter. And then there came the small men of
                  smaller titles, and the commoner whose grumbling was only equalled by his apeings.
                  To dine with my Lord Flippington was to him something great; nor could his airs
                  and ostentation be well improved. The little man of little titles, too, stood
                  profound in his dignity: no man was larger, nor thought he that his own little
                  self wasn't great. To the tailor who made him he paid money down. Of all men was
                  he the largest dabbler in that divine essence of things called men—the philosophy
                  of blood. But to keep up the dignity it not only required a great deal of
                  experience, but a large amount of tin in the pocket, which for the minus thereof
                  was it necessary to have a deal of brass in the face. This principle, then, which
                  is strictly in accordance with natural philosophy, being very well developed in
                  this worthily aged country, makes the truly great very great of modesty; while the
                  man of pewter greatness—that is, great because Our Sovereign Lady said he might
                  take upon himself the name of Sir Simpleton Somebody! always boiling over with the
                  froth of his own follies. With tin in his pocket, brass in his face, and never a
                  forlorn h in his vocabulary, is he the fellow to do brown
                  the 'rag and tinsel.'
               "Well, Mr. Smooth felt conscious of his own importance, and that same was
                  something among the good British. With philosophy profound in his long face, Mr.
                  Smooth made his compliments to the new and very sedate minister, who some
                  facetious wags called the very unobsequious Jimmy Buckanan, of 
                     Pensylvane
                     Pennsylvania
                  . This worthy and very firm-fisted statesman, who was too much of the old
                  school ever to be President of our United States, advised the doing of a great
                  many things, the diplomacy of which Mr. Smooth seriously doubted. Especially did
                  Smooth question his reasoning on the breeches question, the quaint originality of
                  which was Marcy's own. This the venerable statesman informed me in a sly sort of
                  way, as he invited me to go into the back place and take a little gin and bitters
                  in a quiet way, for he was inveterately averse to every body watching his
                  movements. To live in a country so ancient of incongruities, and where not alone
                  the weak-minded bedeck themselves in fancy coats and flashy tassels, and
                  indescribable coverings of high colors, requires some resolution in the man who
                  mixes with it, and is pleased to make known his taste for plain black. And here
                  Mr. Smooth and the worthy and very promising statesman held a very learned
                  controversy over the fact of Marcy having gone into the tailoring business so
                  largely as to define the shape of coat it was consistent to wear at court
                  tea-parties. Smooth wanted to put on a little bright, just to look a man of
                  consequence, and in order not to be behind several of his brother democrats, whose
                  names he views it imprudent here to insert, and seeing how he was invited to join
                  a dough-nut party in Downing street, while he was certain of a card to one of Citizen Peabody's most select dinners,
                  for Peabody was an intimate friend and old acquaintance; but our honest and very
                  American plenipotentiary said it would not do, for the obvious reason that a man's
                  importance should depend on what was in his brains. His very democratic secretary
                  having come to his sense of the force of this argument, had made a solemn promise
                  to put on red cloth and feathers but four times a year, one of which he stipulated
                  should be at the opening of the Crystal Palace, that being an occasion when all
                  the fine ladies were expected to be present for the purpose of witnessing the
                  superiority of genius over court fooleries, as well as being singularly fascinated
                  with the young secretary's handsome person. The argument here was so strong that
                  Smooth at once knocked under; and, too, simplicity in great men being greatness
                  itself, he sincerely enjoined all his countrymen to let sense and not semblance
                  honor their country, guide their actions when abroad.
               "Acting upon the principle so many of our countrymen unhappily develop, (thinking
                  nobody could hear of it on the other side of the water,) Mr. Smooth chartered a
                  donkey-cart, put his donkeys in shining liveries, and was determined to outdo the
                  Choctaws in making London astonished. The most expensive tailor in Regent street
                  did up the external, as he had before so many of my very simple-minded countrymen.
                  Such a suit of toggery as it was! Alongside of me General Scott would have looked
                  shy, I reckon. And then, when the big cocked hat was spread! I tell you, Uncle
                  Sam, there as no touching Smooth—he was half-duke, half-beadle, and the rest
                  Pierce diplomatist. 'If a dash ain't cut among the nobs!' thought I. The donkey
                  turn out was a curiosity, Smooth himself was a curiosity; and with two curiosities
                  an excitement was certain. My first dash was into Hyde Park, near the entrance of
                  which stood the brazen statue of a gladiator, raised by fair hands, in
                  commemoration of the Iron Duke, whose indelible deeds they would emblazon on
                  hardest brass. In this park, at fashionable hours, sauntered the nice young men of
                  the West End; that is, the biggest snobs of the fashionable world; but Smooth took
                  the shine out of the whole lot, as did nearly all the rest of Mr. Pierce's little
                  folks. Had he, however, turned out in the flummery of some of his 
                     cotemporary
                     contemporary
                   snobs, and driven thus equipped into Cape Cod, a town-meeting, to take
                  into consideration the sending him to a place where straight-jackets are worn, had
                  been the result. But in London a man may make almost any kind of a fool of
                  himself, without applying for a license. Indeed, the man most earnest in making an
                  ass of himself may do it, with the satisfaction of knowing that he has a very
                  large number of very respectable families for patrons. In Hyde Park the greatest
                  asses (a name and the needful may be necessary) have the most followers. Longest
                  ears are not the surest indices. After all, my reader must excuse me for not
                  visiting the purlieus of Downing street just yet, having a few of Mr. Pierce's
                  little folks to pack up and send home to Fourney, with instructions that he give
                  them a few more turns on his grindstone."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XV.
               HIS LITTLE LORDSHIP'S SHOW, AND A PEEP INTO DOWNING-STREET.
               "UNCLE SAM!—if, beside yourself, there exists outside of Cape Cod another
                  individual who would like to see Mr. Thomas Foolery move in state most perfect,
                  just send him over here: he must be present on that day when the little Lord Mayor
                  makes a great man of himself. A great man is the Lord Mayor on that day on which
                  he sacrifices all his good sense to an ancient and much-beloved show, in which he
                  permits himself to be made the fool of the farce. No Choctaw war-train was ever
                  half so extravagant of colored cloth and feathers. A great day for London loafers
                  is it, when my Lord Mayor puts on the big chain, and issues his mandate to the
                  sprats, who then come up the river, to the great joy of the poor, who have it thus
                  in tradition. Well, Smooth thought he would keep Lord Mayor's day, 
                     aud
                     and
                   to that end harnessed up his team of donkeys, merely by way of
                  contrasting it with some duke's turn-out. Imagine, Sam, my chagrin, when one of
                  the donkeys took it into his head to keep Lord Mayor's day in his own obstinate
                  way. Not a step would he go. However, I got another donkey, and proceeded to where
                  the Lord Mayor was, just in time to hear him make a funny speech, throughout which
                  he made a sad slaughter of all the h's and a's of the King's good English. Then he
                  seated himself in the barge, and had a sail on the Thames, followed by innumerable
                  beggars, sycophants, and costermongers. Succeeding this he marshalled his
                  show-folks into a string (such a string!), and with them caused his august self to
                  be moved to the Mansion House. Swarms of frightened turtles were seen hurrying
                  away in front of the cavalcade.
               "Such a set of white-washed heads—heads with all outside side—heads with little
                  inside—and heads nobody knew what they had been made for, never before were seen
                  displayed in one string. Strangely attractive was the glare of tinsel—it
                  fascinated the little souls of corpulent men, and made small men more becomingly
                  great. Fact was, Uncle Sam, His Worship the Lord Mayor, whose year of greatness
                  was death to turtle and terrapin, so outshone Her Most Gracious Majesty (a good
                  little body) in confusion of brilliant brass, that the little woman thought it
                  incumbent to call a Cabinet Council, before which she laid the grievance of his
                  stealing her thunder. At this privy council Prince Albert was permitted to be
                  present without anything being said by the Daily News and Morning Advertiser. His
                  Worship had indeed usurped all the modern appliances of flunkeydom. But the
                  cabinet, it was acknowledged, was very thick-headed, and her Majesty, good body,
                  must bear the consequences.
               "Well, after the most curious caravan eyes ever rested upon, there followed his
                  jolly worship the Lord Mayor; he largely sat in a coach of gingerbread, the
                  tea-things spread outside, and the glows of Souchong impregnating the air. They
                  said his jolly Lordship sold real and mixed Twankey. In this sense, however, was
                  his Lordship more fortunate than his predecessor, who, having ascended from the
                  soap business, and himself used a large amount of that article for the purpose of
                  washing down the wares of Threadneedle street, found his greatest difficulty that
                  of getting rid of the fœtid scent. And then, my Lord's h's were the things most
                  violently handled; for otherwise he wasn't a bad fellow, and when he rode in his
                  coach of the olden time, which might, by the green in mythology, have been taken
                  for the lost chariot of Elijah, it was a serious question whether himself or the
                  things that held on behind were greatest. Then these latter gents of flunkeydom in
                  frills had big sticks in their hands, with which they kept the flies from my
                  Lord's good-natured countenance. Happy fellows were they, and, like well-stuffed
                  mules, only wanted the long soft ears to make them marketable. Everybody said it
                  was a big day in London. To have suggested that his Worship might be making an ass
                  of himself in this common-sense nineteenth century would have been to render
                  yourself a victim of hasty contempt. Smooth was just taking a contemplative view of these things,—asking
                  himself how many poor wretches would lose a day's work over the nonsense; how many
                  would get drunk on the hallucination of the show; how many poor mechanics would
                  make a blue week to his Lordship's honor; and how many would find themselves in
                  the House of Correction to his disgrace—how many employers would be annoyed,—how
                  many customers would be disappointed—and how many wives would get broken heads;
                  when suddenly a crowd of filthy, dejected, and ruthless beings swept along in
                  mass, heedless of whatever came in their way, and threatening life and limb in the
                  onset. Then there came such a smashing of maids' bonnets, squeezing of milliners,
                  and frightening of old maids, as never was seen before; indeed, this, added to the
                  many well-jammed ribs and jostled beavers, seemed the most expensive part of my
                  Lord's show. Summing the whole thing up in a logical sort of way, Smooth made it
                  amount to this:—that the Lord Mayor, just mounting into greatness, could by no
                  means make that greatness impressive by any knowledge of philosophy he possessed;
                  so, to be sure that his importance had its force upon all vulgar minds, he
                  suffered himself made to play the part of a monkey in a cake-shop. To this his
                  Worship added the greater gratification of having given amusement to nine-tenths
                  of the city costermongers, made idle seven-tenths of the working people, kept busy
                  two thousand gin-shops, filled eleven hundred chop-houses, given hard work to five
                  hundred policemen, who never like to be worked hard, and made lackeydom
                  tumultuous. And then Beadledom seemed crazed, and, joined with the many
                  ale-bibbers, were turned out to do good service in the show. But, to make my
                  Lord's train complete, there was no knowing how many men he had to ride on
                  horseback, how many more so inebriated they couldn't ride, how many of a character
                  nobody would desire to know out of his show, and how many ballet girls who ride in circuses and so forth,—all of which latter
                  material had faces made deep of moonshine modesty, to suit the solemn occasion.
                  Then my Lord topped off the little end of his show with the soup and great
                  Ministers of State. And, that nothing should be left undone, the
                     Times must have a go in at it, which it did with
                  one of Doctor Moseley's most spicy articles, putting the whole thing into a very
                  comical nutshell. Quoth Sam, without the thunderer's dissecting knife a London
                  Lord Mayor would be the most beautiful of nobodys—that is, so far as sense goes.
                  Smooth, on the nicest observation, was decidedly of the opinion that only one
                  thing more was wanted to make the Lord Mayor's Show complete—a pair of long soft
                  ears emblazoned on the Corporation coach. The reader will excuse Smooth for
                  dwelling thus long on little things.
               "Having peeped long enough at the Lord Mayor's Show, I felt like looking at
                  something more solid; so to that end I turned about the donkey-cart, whistled to
                  the flunkeys (kept things of this kind merely to be like other Americans when
                  abroad), and drove into Regent street, where I would inform General Pierce and all
                  my firm friends a desperate excitement was made. Then, in glowing independence, I
                  rolled away down Pall Mall, where the club-people—especially those of that
                  institution of arrogance called the Reform—seemed much astonished. From thence I
                  proceeded past Trafalgar square, where stood in singular contrast the monument of
                  the noble Nelson, and an equestrian statue of that ignoble creature, Charles the
                  First, the loss of whose head saved England from disgrace. How strange, that even
                  in this day of intelligence and liberty-loving, it should stand a shrine before
                  which very respectable old gentlemen poured out their stale patriotism! At last I
                  found myself in Downing street—at the door of a massive and sombre-looking mansion
                  (No. 12) in front of which stood methodical-looking men with grave countenances.
                  And, too, there sauntered moodily venerable-looking gentlemen, now and then
                  casting wistful glances at the time-begrimmed walls, as if they would see some one
                  sealed-up in the antiquated recesses of the place. Mr. Smooth's turn-out only made
                  a stir among them; they reckoned somebody had come! In a free-and-easy sort of way
                  I walked straight to the door, maintaining my independence the while, and feeling
                  as important as a door-keeper in Congress. After passing the massive entrance I
                  encountered innumerable obstacles in the form of flunkeys, and then passed into a
                  dingy room of immense size, which for all the world had the appearance of having
                  some two or three hundred years ago served for a barracks. 'By appointment?' inquired a human thing dressed, as he
                  emerged from behind a green screen situated at one corner. He bowed, and I bowed,
                  until he was satisfied I was somebody, 'Who would you see?' he reiterates, adding
                  another bow.
               "'Well!' returned I, 'reckon how I'll think about that. Then the fellow crossed
                  three or four times my track, as much as to say—Stranger! you don't go in there.
                  Presently a batch of well-to-do individuals came snickering out of a closet, and
                  eyed me very suspiciously; at which I summoned all my brass, and stood fronting
                  them like a staring machine. You must say who you want to see!' interposes the man
                  I first confronted.
               "I here took leisurely out my card, and said 'I would like to see the Duke of
                  Newcastle, who temporarily tied up in this establishment.' He viewed my card with
                  a serious hesitation; at which I turned round, and told him I would not trouble
                  him, but take it myself, had he had any special objection to going a-head. They,
                  the people, said 
                     she
                     the
                   Duke, did all he could with what he had to do with. If it were not
                  possible to see the Duke, I would like a peep at my venerable aunt Aberdeen, who
                  was about as well qualified to sway the destinies of discontented England as a
                  virgin pumpkin; and together with my ever amiable Lord Clarendon, would set a
                  world at war good-naturedly. These very high functionaries, Mr. Smooth was
                  informed, could not at present be seen by common people, inasmuch as they were
                  contemplating the problem:—'I don't know what to do!' Nicholas's appetite for
                  Turkey breakfasts had made work too profound for the brains of Downing Street.
                  'Don't seem a subject of this atmosphere,' said the stupid, significantly canting
                  his head, and giving a queer look out of the corner of his right eye. 'You fellows
                  don't seem to know me,' I interpolated, 'Citizen Smooth—they call me Solomon
                  Smooth, Esq., that is my name.' A door now opened near where I was standing, and
                  in I walked—right among the Dukes and dough-heads. It only wanted a bold push, in
                  the right go-ahead sort of way, to make myself respected. Dukes were not only
                  flesh and blood, but owed much of their importance to the ignorance of the people
                  they aspired to frown upon. Dukes, Earls, and Lords, were, at this moment, playing
                  at very un-English games for England. They affected to believe it right that the
                  loyal people (I mean the simple and vulgar), who have hitherto proved
                     mean the simple and vulgar) who have hitherto proved
                     
                   true to their noble traditions, should remain ignorant of the game
                  played at their expense. This, Mr. Smooth thought too bad; however, his friend
                  Urquhart was devising a scheme for remedying the evil, which, did he not himself
                  fall into evil, might do great good to the nation in general. But Urquhart was so
                  modest that he never accused Lord Palmerston of anything worse than bringing about
                  the potato rot in Ireland. 'Hallo hallo!' a dozen voices echoed from the table
                  around which the all-accomplished sat:—'A rustic intruder is upon us!' half
                  muttered the man who followed me in. It's only Solomon Smooth, Esq., from the
                  Cape,' returned I, with a good, wholesome laugh. Believe me, Uncle Sam, there sat
                  round a table ten of the most solemn-looking fellows, with faces as dreary as a
                  wet moon in November. Some of this unique body looked as if they had seen hard
                  usage and lean pay. Others were grey with thinking, instead of moving. Be not
                  surprised either when I say that the gravity of their countenance left no visible
                  room for anything else. Hard at it were they, straining their antiquated
                  imaginations over a secret game of thimble-rig, which seemed of momentous
                  importance. Only five, however, could play at the game; and Sawny Dablerdeen, who
                  always played on two small pipes, and paid sundry small pipers to do a deal of
                  blowing, seemed in the greatest fuddle. And then there was my Lord John
                  Littlejohn, as crusty a little snap as ever declaimed against tyrant in one
                  breath, or turned a political summersault in another;—bricks to the back-bone was
                  he, and all for old England, though he was not bigger than one of Betsy Perkin's
                  well-grown cucumbers, and could be turned to as many uses. But what there is
                  mentally in a man must not be judged by the measure of his body from head to foot.
                  And, too, there was my very amiable Lord Clarendon, who attempted to out-clever my
                  Lord John, inasmuch as John stated, in the fulness of his geographical knowledge,
                  that the passage between Havana and the extreme southern point of Florida was not
                  more than four hundred miles, while my Lord Clarendon assured the House of Lords
                  that South Carolina was an island. Enlightened House of Lords! But, after all,
                  there was a harmony of sentiment between these two noble worthies that was truly
                  grateful to the submissive hearts of
                  the freedom-loving English; both could spin flattering speeches: both could play
                  the long and short; both could wince when foreign bull-dogs sent out their
                  threatening growls; and both were mighty of mouth when dealing with little
                  chickens. It was not to be concealed, however that Dablerdeen, master of the
                  board, was gifted with the unfortunate characteristic of talking himself into an
                  interminable difficulty.
               "'Who, or from whence on earth do you come?' inquired my Lord.
               "'Smooth,' I replied, that is my name; I am a citizen of the Great Republic—come
                  to study the way in which you are disorganizing foreign affairs.'
               "'Yer a little in advance of the times—too fast, sir!' replied a large man most
                  serious of face. Thinking it best to answer him by declaring my opinion to be that
                  it was better to be with the age than behind it,—and which I believe constituted
                  the only difference between a fast and slow man of the present day, I let slide at
                  him upon the fallacy of his political philosophy, with knock-down arguments.
               "The fellows cooled down at once, and John Littlejohn said, 'Come, Smooth! if you
                  really are a clever citizen then you are precisely the fellow we want!' And then
                  he conversed feelingly with me, said how much he liked our country and our
                  countrymen; persuaded himself to believe them the real go-ahead chaps—though he,
                  at times, thought it quite necessary to keep their go-ahead a little slow. I
                  proposed their taking a smoke in a rough and ready sort of way, and pulling out my
                  pouch, in a friendly sort of way, they all seemed struck aback with astonishment.
                  One said, if we did things that way in Congress it was not the way they did them
                  here. They all shook their heads—said they didn't smoke.
               "'We will may it please you Mr. Smooth—Citizen of the United States—excuse these
                  things for the present,' rejoined Dablerdeen, who looked as if he did not know
                  which way to turn, or how to please his people. Seeing this I sat down and watched
                  the very odd style in which they played the game. Dablerdeen did all the talking,
                  and Littlejohn, whom the reader will see had returned home helped him make his
                  muff; and then there was a good deal of assisting one another to forget each move.
                  But Sandy always moved slow, as if he had something under his thimble he was
                  afraid of damaging. 'That's Turkey, that's Russia, that's France, and that's
                  Austria—and this is ourselves! he would say, making the moves up or down, but not
                  knowing where to stop. 'It won't do to push that one, it won't! he continued,
                  pointing at the one he called Austria. 'If you did, nothing would you get from
                  under it. It's a costly cup with a tender handle, somewhat dangerous to turn: only
                  the cup of Spain is more costly; but that in this emergency is of no account
                  whatever. They had no United States cup to move, inasmuch as Jonathan had very
                  respectfully declined to hazard a point in European games when he withheld his
                  ascent to a tripartite treaty for the purpose of keeping his delicate fingers off
                  Cuba. Now these very antiquated gentlemen seemed to entertain some respect for the
                  British Lion, some apprehension of Jonathan and Nicholas, and a great dislike for
                  fighting, which they had been driven, or rather drifted, into much against their
                  imagined obligations to peace; for, indeed, did they carry on the war tail
                  foremost, finding everything they had done large of stupidity. By and by a loud
                  call rang through the tabernacle, and in another minute the platter of dough-nuts
                  was borne in by two cooks. One, they said was Mrs. Victoria, and the other was Mr.
                  Napoleon, curious acquaintances, who lugged and tugged, and puffed and blowed; and
                  the piping hot doughnuts nuts gave out their glows. Then the players all seemed to
                  quicken up, as if they had sooner be eating than thinking.
               "'Strange things will come to pass at times, and nothing stranger has come to pass
                  than that John Bull and Johnny Crappo have gone into the brotherly-love business,
                  by which they hope to bring about one grand object, I said. 'Neither had I any
                  objection to Spain joining, provided she kept Cuba all right. But, Cuba being so
                  near Uncle Sam's fingers, nothing more than the common course of events was needed
                  to let it slide so naturally into his modest hands.' Smooth told the old gentlemen
                  that the very best way to hasten Uncle Sam's getting Cuba was to point out a
                  process by which he could keep his hand out of his pockets. 'We, Mr. Smooth, do
                  not question your correctness on the point, so far at it refers to this Cuba
                  business, and the tripartite treaty which we would you had signed merely that your fingers were kept
                  off the property; but you have misconstrued our amiable motives—we only wanted to
                  form a trio, honorable in combination—that is, we would it were mutually
                  understood that you do not annex Cuba, and we will not!' said my Lord Littlejohn,
                  who spoke quite as spunky, though with less assurance on geography, than he did to
                  the very amiable Mr. Everett. Smooth understood the P's and Q's of the thing,
                  without examining further into the portfolio. It was Johnny Bull saying to Johnny
                  Crappo—'them Yankees 'll get Cuba!—in spite of all we can do.' Of course something
                  must be said in return; so Crappo puts in his say:—'Can't you suggest some way to
                  stop it, Uncle John?' he inquires, with a quizzical shrug, adding—mon dieu! 'But, by gar, we may do him somefin yet, by
                  gar!
               To make rogue one honest man is one clever thing; Mr. Jonathan mistake himself in
                  tinking himself great, when he not so great. Now, dem Yankee one grand 'cute
                  fellow; you no catch him wid de, bird chaff,' he is supposed to conclude. Smooth
                  very amiably suggested that it were better to let Cuba be Cuba, until the time
                  came when, if she felt like snugly brooding under Uncle Sam's wings, without any
                  assistance would he attend to the little matter of offering her a roost. Uncle Sam
                  was growing, but had grave ideas, with which he generally maintained his own
                  dignity. They here reckoned Mr. Smooth had delivered his speech with becoming
                  dignity. Of this fact I was fully sure, for my Lord Littlejohn put his finger into
                  his mouth and began to suck it, as is common with him in these his days of
                  tribulation. 'Let us quit the Ottomans and go into the eatables: the one is so dry
                  nothing is to be made at it, while at the other everything is to be made, for
                  there is something to eat,' rejoined John. They carried the suggestion by
                  acclamation. Just then, whang!—bang!—whiz! somebody thundered at the door, when,
                  alarmed, they all cried out—'whose there?' In answer to this the man with the long
                  rod cried out at the very top of his voice—'Stop the game!' The old fellows began
                  to stow away their gambling tools, look innocently and vacantly at one another, as
                  if a crisis was upon them they could not understand. 'It's only us outsiders,' a
                  voice replied, in most harmless accents.
               "'There! I told you we'd make a mess of it,—that the outsiders would break in upon
                  us' said Littlejohn, with a savage grimace, directing himself to Dablerdeen, who
                  it was now thought better to call Grandmamma Fudge. The gentlemen outsiders were
                  the honor-saving committee from Finsbury, the members of which declared themselves
                  large stakeholders in the game at the Treasury. Grandmamma Fudge thought it best
                  to tell them, merely in a bluff sort of way, that England's honor was safe in his
                  keeping—that they must not be scared about it; not however, until they found him
                  pedling pills and other quack medicines with the object of inducing Austria to be
                  more explicit. But, my old closeters, in we must come! Fearing you have got the
                  gout in the head, we are here to make an examination; things done in secret have a
                  dark look about them; and we, being the honor-saving committee, have come to make
                  a single suggestion, which is that my lord of foreign affair memory is found
                  wanting in firmness, and gets very crooked when he is not kept straight, which is
                  most unfortunate in a diplomatist who smokes bad cigars all the day long. This
                  said, it must be remembered that old Finsbury feels sensitive of her rights and
                  liberties; closely allied to which is the honor of Old England. And Christmas
                  being near at hand, if the old Bear eat up all the Turkey, Finsbury cannot keep
                  it; and we have been honied down in a good-natured sort of way long enough.' Poor
                  old Grandmamma Fudge looked dumbfounded, like at times we see a disconsolate
                  individual, who nipped in a hail-storm, mourns the loss of his umbrella. Like
                  death, it was necessary to keep close, tell the honor-saving committee to maintain
                  their usual spirits, and call again, when in respect to their ancient character,
                  they would get a listening for their grievances. With this valuable solace,
                  condescendingly bestowed by the ancient gentlemen aforesaid did the committee go
                  away happy, promise to be very good, and keep Finsbury before the world.
               "The gentlemen having been respectfully bowed out of Downing street, a loud call
                  was made to commence again at the dough-nuts. 'I say, bring 'em on,' rejoined I;
                  Smooth 'll help (I'd been seated a little back, watching the while) play at that
                  or any other game, provided there be a rule of honor and economy to work out.'
               
               "'Be a little more modest, Smooth—if you please!' spoke up my most intimate
                  friend, Palm, who until then had seemed viewing the whole conclave with measured
                  contempt. Indeed my friend Palm was a regular brick in his way, which fact was
                  most happily illustrated in the manner he now and then threw the hard tokens at
                  the head of his parliamentary brother Bright. It was as unfortunate as notorious,
                  however, that in his dealings with the United States, his conduct was as
                  dishonorable as uncertain. 'Smooth, you are a large youth,' said he; 'but your
                  reforming principles have too great a resemblance to innovations to go down
                  without scratching, in this aged atmosphere of ours! Nor must you be so lavish of
                  your manifest destiny policy; that, to me, is the medium by which you intend to
                  come on this side of the big pond and stick your fingers into everybody's
                  mess.'
               "I interrupted him just then; and in reply to a question I put, he acknowledged
                  his conviction to be that we did things well and simply; but he made one little
                  reservation, and that was that we did not do so well when we permitted the little
                  State of South Carolina to imprison Uncle John's nigger sailors. Then he said
                  South Carolina was the Empire State of Nigger Slavery; and was not
                  aware of his mistake, until such I happily removed by convincing him that she was
                  the only Don Quixote of the Union; and as it was necessary for every nation to
                  have such an inhabitant in its compact, merely for the purpose of keeping alive
                  the humorous, so Carolina filled the void in America, where happily her little
                  exploits were viewed as very harmless.
               "Well, peace again being preserved, we drew up to have a feast of the hot
                  dough-nuts, when a terrible 
                     thunderin
                     thundering
                   came at the great door. Then the figure standing guard, who resembled a
                  flour-barrel in frills, announced the reporter of the Times; who
                  said he must come in, for his folks, too, held a large stake in the game. And the
                  individual did come in; and a right jolly-looking fellow he was, too; and in
                  contrast with the fudgy old conclave, seemed bright, fresh, and ready to go ahead;
                  and then he said the Times and the country were two great
                  institutions. 'You!' he spoke, advancing independently to the table, and grinning
                  the old fogies almost out of countenance nance, 'have got to render an account of
                  this game to the country! your just unequiliberizing everything; and my humble
                  opinion is that you have got the fear fever in your heads.' The old gentleman took
                  it all in good part; in fact (the truth must be told at times) they seemed rather
                  to fear and like the man of the Times, who seldom failed in getting
                  by some mysterious process the secrets of Downing street. However, as disturbances
                  seldom come separate, no sooner had the man of the Times been
                  smoothed nicely down with Downing street soft-soap, of which a never-failing
                  supply was always at hand, than a most furious hue and cry again echoed through
                  the old walls from another part of the house. Alarm and anxiety darted into the
                  face of everyone present; all eyes stared in death-like gaze in the direction from
                  whence it came. Smooth being in for a share of the alarm as well as the fun,
                  looked along with the rest, when, lo! high on a seat in the corner, sat Mr.
                     Punch, his comical face glowing through a sort of knot-hole and Toby
                  perched on his right shoulder, growling and looking as if he wanted to bite every
                  old fudge in the conclave. Punch, to outsecret the players, was, in
                  a very clever sort of way, taking private notes, the subject matter of which he
                  intended giving to his readers in a very condensed and elegant volume. This
                  started the players to their feet, when each seized a book, and, letting fly at
                     Punch's head, drove him scampering out of Downing street.
               "Having got rid of Mr. Punch, and bowed the man of the
                     Times politely out, Grandmama Fudge, in a strong Scotch brogue,
                  said,"Nu, luds, let us gang awa to the crumpets—bring 'um hither, mya bullies!' He
                  drew a sort of simple contortion over his broad, hard face, and mouthed his lips,
                  as if he would the amplest dough-nut be put on his plate. Palm, just as they were
                  resuming their seats, insinuated that as the venerable old man was well gone in
                  his dotage, he had better measure his diet somewhat after the judicious character
                  of his diplomacy, which was celebrated for its small doses crookedly doled out.
                  The dish was again removed, mouths began to water, eager eyes glanced upon the
                  steaming viands, giving out their strong glows and unsavory smells. This incited
                  dither strong, on calling the two cooks its, after many and tedious interrogatories, confessed, in fear and trembling,
                  that Grandmama Fudge had strictly ordered them fried in grease of the Russian
                  Bear, an animal for which he entertained a curious sympathy. And here it was
                  observed, with no very commendable emphasis, that the precious old dote had a
                  particular partiality for Bruin's dominions, nor could be driven from the strange
                  hallucination. Another minute and the poor old man was in the most alarming state
                  of mind that could be imagined; the largest dough-nut on the platter had stuck
                  half-way down his throat. To relieve himself of his unsuccessful attempt at
                  swallowing things beyond his capacity, he called lustily for Palm, who,
                  unfortunately, had left in disgust, the stench of Bear's grease being too strong
                  for his capricious organs. 'He! he! he! ah mun, I doe believe to heaven it's all
                  up—I doe!' gurgled the old man, struggling in spasmodic efforts to get the thing
                  up or down. 'If I die,' he continued, 'with this lump of indecision in my throat,
                  the consequences will be that no man will mourn over me.' Littlejohn, always ready
                  to move as occasion required, sprung to his aid, crying 'Swallow it! swallow it!
                  for the honor of Young England swallow it! If it comes up you're a dead premier:
                  dead without a doctor.' The whole thing now became a complex confusion; no one
                  knew how to unconfuse it. It was a sad mistake having its origin only in the want
                  of the age's appliances to our day and its circumstances; he had attempted a nut
                  he had not capacity to swallow. A dozen voices cried out 'Bring in the doctor.'
                  and as many more said the case was a desperate one. Some run one way; some run
                  another; 'and some never moved. Downing street was in tribulation. Then everybody
                  ran in everybody's way; nobody knew what to do;, nor could anybody find Mr.
                  Chesterfield, the loud shouts for whom seemed to make him a character of some
                  importance. Mr. Smooth kept very cool the while, thinking it best to maintain his
                  philosophy up to a scientific point; and in that way he reckoned it was as well to
                  send for Doctor Punch, who, in such cases was an adept of a
                  practitioner, and had an extensive infirmary in Fleet street, where patients
                  innumerable were healed for three-pence. Well, just as they were on the point of
                  making a rush, a voice cried out—'Here I am! here I am!' and in another minute
                  there jumped from under the table a suspicious-looking turkey, who stood upon the
                  platter, clapped his wings, and sent the dough-nuts into a flutter about the room.
                  'I'm all right' he proclaimed, stretching to his extreme height 'let every man
                  take care of himself.' My reader will scarce question my veracity when I say the
                  turkey looked with grave disdain upon the unnecessary confusion, made at this
                  moment by British cabinet cooks, whom it was gravely intimated, had lessoned of
                  Mr. Pierce's French cook, Monsieur Souley. Mr. Smooth, about this time, resolved
                  to leave the donkey diplomatists, and drive his own ugly brutes home."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               SMOOTH DINES WITH CITIZEN PEABODY.
               "SMOOTH being a great man, as well as Mr. Pierce's minister in general—and citizen
                  Peabody being no less great in diplomacy, which he illustrated in the most
                  substantial manner—it became necessary to make a demonstration: to this end did
                  friend George delegate his hospitality in an invitation to dine with him at
                  Blackwall. George was large and loose of figure, possessed a broad, honest face,
                  bright with kindness, candor, and firmness: added to which a well-developed nose;
                  a soft, yet watchful eye a mouth indicating gentleness; and a broad, benevolent
                  chin, finished the make-up of the external man—if we except a neat pair of brown
                  whiskers, and a head of dark youthful hair. Citizen George loved dearly his
                  country, and was altogether a man who meant well, nor ever forgot those of his
                  countrymen who reflected honor on their country when abroad. He had no genius for
                  politics, had never aspired to the class par
                     excellence; no, he espoused none of their dogmas; he let littler
                  minds revel in such luxuries. The means by which little demagogues find themselves
                  great politicians could reflect no fame to George: he served his country with less
                  noise and more effect. If he was quiet and unassuming; if he loved his country to
                  a fault, that fault was his own, not his country's. How much more to be praised is
                  he who seeks when in foreign lands to sustain the simple but grand spirit of our
                  institutions! For sustaining the simplicity of our institutions is friend George
                  most to be praised. The object of his labor was the establishment of a simple but
                  real and effective diplomacy, from which international benefits of great worth
                  might result. A few here and there had doubted the quality of his diplomacy; but
                  no one bold enough to question his abilities as a diplomatist had yet been found.
                  It is not what we are supposed to do, but what we really do, that ought to entitle
                  us to respect. And had not citizen George done more to promote a kindly feeling
                  between the too boastful peoples of England and America than all our well-paid
                  ministers, their court luxuries, and costly retinues thrown in? That citizen
                  George would interpose for peace and international harmony, in the event of an
                  unfortunate misunderstanding between the two countries, was equally certain;
                  indeed he had more than once had occasion to view with feelings of commiseration
                  those small jealousies against which great minds have to contend while seeking to
                  carry out an enlarged policy. Painful as may be the assertion, it is nevertheless
                  true, that whenever questions of an intricate nature arose those whose legitimate
                  business it was to act in the matter were either moved by the narrowest
                  aspirations of party, or, yielding to their own more contracted views, were
                  disposed to keep alive dissensions blighting to their country's best
                  interests.
               "Deeper than etiquette and quibble (those much-beloved virtues of the time-serving
                  and polite corps) had friend George delved into the recesses of human nature, that
                  he might find a law upon which to build a comity of enlarged sentiment, having for
                  its end the bringing together of Americans and Englishmen, cementing the bonds of
                  commercial intercourse, and pledging the continuance of peace. Those whom he thus
                  worthily drew together did he enjoin to cease their small jars and partake of his
                  large jar, which was always plentifully stored. Be not surprised, then, when
                  Smooth tells all his readers in general, and General Pierce in particular, that
                  Citizen Peabody has founded a dinner diplomacy, contrasted with which all other
                  species of the order are but secondary. This was indeed the means by which he
                  hoped to, and no doubt would, develop a more fruitful international policy; for,
                  meats and good drinks being never-failing arguments with fat Aldermen and
                  Statesmen, who could doubt it? Smooth would here say to Uncle Sam, that there is
                  no mistake about the effect of this sort of diplomacy, and begs that he will
                  insinuate to Mr. Pierce the propriety of his suggesting to Congress through the
                  medium of his next Annual Message (he will make a hit) the propriety of sending
                  abroad good cooks instead of bad
                  ministers. They must be well provided with gold eagles, and give the very best
                  sort of dinners to every hungry citizen, at Sam's account; the boy will then shine
                  in all his glory! Never dealing in sarcasms, nor casting reflections of an
                  insinuating character, yet, Mr. Smooth cannot forbear to say that while the very
                  polite worship at the shrine of the polished corps, stronger-minded men are always found doing homage to the
                  meats and drinks—more particularly when they are good! Upon this most modern but
                  very material principle of natural philosophy (with a great heart, and intentions
                  to correspond) did our worthy and truly characteristic countryman pursue to
                  usefulness his diplomacy. That it had excited the fear of small politicians and
                  antiquated and very polite diplomats, whose trade it seriously damaged, was well
                  known to Mr. Pierce and the world in general. Even this species of gentry was at
                  times disposed to pay it compliment; but it was only on the ground of its
                  relieving them of that onerous tax of now and then receiving their
                  fellow-citizens respectably. Smooth is exceedingly delicate about mentioning here
                  the onerousness of this tax, inasmuch as our parsimonious government has proved
                  itself obstinately opposed to grant a sum requisite to the necessary
                  respectability to be maintained at foreign courts.
               "Well, the day arrived on which Smooth was to dine with Citizen George, and not
                  the smallest idea had he of meeting another stray citizen. Happy in the enjoyment
                  of our own greatness, Smooth expected to learn something of Uncle George's
                  opinions upon international questions in general, and to give him in return some
                  account of General Pierce's crooked notions of a national policy—so crooked,
                  indeed, that they left him alike the laughing-stock of friends and foes. This was
                  very easily done, for, being Mr. Pierce's special minister to everywhere in
                  general, and more particularly to Europe, where he invested him (Smooth) with
                  power to draw up preliminaries for the 'Ostend Convention,' as well as to cut a
                  figure on behalf of Young America, the power thus given made the divulging Mr.
                  Pierce's policy no breach of confidence. As for Young America, that very
                  unassuming young gentleman was being gloriously represented by the very famous
                  house of the three S.'s and Co. (Sickles, Saunders, Souley, Buckhanan & Co.),
                  the latter very respectable gentleman having been received into the firm with the
                  specific understanding that he sell out his large stock of old fogyism, and invest
                  the proceeds in manifest destiny.
               "Nothing is so easily attained as the flattery of small men; and yet no essence is
                  more delicious to the soul of a sycophant, for it is he that loves to refresh his
                  recreant spirit with human frailty. Mr. Pierce's comprehensive and very elastic
                  mind had not yet made a point of analysing this as properly as it was capable of
                  being.
               "Doing himself (Smooth) up in his very best fixings, he chartered a steamboat—that
                  is, he got aboard a steamboat—and in the company of our very gallant Secretary of
                  Legation (who has since joined the very excellent and honorable order of doubtful
                  politicians), paid his pennies and steamed away for Blackwall. Here he and his
                  friend sought the Brunswick, a very grand hotel, where now and then the vulgar do
                  dine, and console their love of fashion with much show of dishes and very
                  aristocratic prices. And now, to Smooth's utter astonishment, on being bowed into
                  a gorgeous hall by lackies in ordinary, who stood like tailored mummies along the
                  halls and passages, he found it taken possession of by some hundred and fifty of
                  both sexes, gaily attired, and altogether presenting the brightness of a bridal
                  party. There were knights and baronets, great and small; some wore an insignia,
                  but nothing else to distinguish them from the very vulgar. And, too, there was Sir
                  William Busey, a good diner-out, and always ready to do such noble deeds. All
                  stiff and staid, sallied up and down Sir James Muke, affecting to feel much
                  annoyed because vulgar citizens would not regard him in the same distinguished
                  light in which he contemplated himself. Indeed, were Sir James's manners taken in
                  evidence of his distinguished position, the verdict could not fail to be in favor
                  of his only being set down a very distinguished bore. However, on the principle of
                  forgiveness being sweet, did Smooth forgive Sir James, and charge his manners to
                  defect of early bringing up.
               "And, too, there was, all reserve, smiling and dignified, Sir Memberman Plenat,
                  who wore no toy of rank, that article being largely developed in his manly
                  bearing. There were also, be it known, other barons and baronets, some of whom were equally imbued with their own
                  importance, others quite modest and gentlemanly in their demeanor. But, to make
                  the greatness of the occasion complete, there was the little Lord Mayor, who, like
                  a mirror reflecting a sun-shower, loomed forth in all the greatness of his own
                  light. Of ladies there was no lack. Some were of well established celebrity;
                  others were decked in costly fabrics to create a celebrity; a third were fair to
                  look upon. The English ladies seemed round of person, buoyant and joyous of soul:
                  the American queens of beauty (their faces sparkling of love and gentleness) moved
                  to and fro, like sylphs of some fairy land, making splendid the scene. The dashing
                  New Yorker, her smiles, unerring arrows, piercing whither she shot them; the
                  vivacious and intelligent daughter of Massachusetts, all sensitive, modest, and
                  graceful; the placid belle of Pennsylvania,
                  whose fair complexion drew upon her all admiration; the bright-eyed Buckeye, with
                  face so oval, than whom none was more coy, nor ever shot a glance or stole a heart
                  so well; the rustic daughter of Down East, who affected great contempt for all
                  superior people, and declared the queen not a whit better than anybody else; the
                  buxom Green-mountain girl, whose motion was as crude as her cheeks were rosy; the
                  New Hampshire prude, lisping, regardless of Murray; the statue-like Baltimorean,
                  with queenly figure and all lovely face, dazzling in her beauty, like a diamond
                  among stones less brilliant; the flirting blonde of Washington; the gracious
                  Virginian, with features so classic and serene; the daisy-like daughter of
                  Connecticut, ever ready to give out her wild unmeasured laugh—all were there. And
                  then there came the imperious Carolinian, whose stately step, Grecian face, dark,
                  languishing eyes, and thoughtful countenance, drew upon her the admiration of many
                  an envious eye. And, to make complete the group, there moved haughtily along the
                  proud Madame of Alabama, affecting the possession of each good and gentle
                  attribute of womankind. She would have us know how much attention she drew upon
                  her while being presented to 'England's queen,' forgetting that it was merely the
                  effect of her badly arranged lace. Indeed, the conclave mingled most socially. My
                  Lady Flippington seemed not above a modest and very sensible condescension to the
                  very level of the vulgar who surrounded her, and whose friendship she seemed to
                  court.
               "Citizen Peabody, as much good nature in his broad face as benevolence in his
                  great heart, moved king among his guests, bestowing a smile here, and a cheering
                  word there; but more particularly consoling the old maids, with whom he is a great
                  favorite. No sooner had the genteel waiter announced the readiness of the festive
                  board, than each gallant sought him a fair partner, and filed off in procession,
                  those not fortunate enough to possess such an accompaniment being compelled to
                  bear up with one of their own harder sex. Smooth was among the most fortunate,
                  having succeeded in fettering himself to a Kentucky belle. Down a long, circular stairway, the procession proceeded,
                  inspirited by sweet music, and soon reached a spacious hall, set out with tables
                  stretching along its whole length, and bedecked with the choicest viands,
                  delicately overlaid with fresh-plucked flowers, impregnating the very air with
                  their delicious odors. Indeed they looked more like beds of bright flowers
                  trellised with silver and gold. A din of confused voices resounded throughout the
                  hall as all took seats who could, while not a few added to the confusion by
                  appropriating to themselves the seats of others. Mr. Smooth, being a man of the
                  world, and Mr. Pierce's minister extraordinary, took the best seat he could find,
                  and made himself quite at home. Opposite him loomed out the hard, knotty face of
                  Sir James Muke, who, suffering under the most painful grievance of having been
                  deprived of his seat, so generously provided in a space to the right of the
                  chairman, let loose some very unfashionable and badly moulded oaths. As if this
                  were not enough, Sir James, whose temper had fairly boiled over, and to the great
                  annoyance of less dignified ears than his own, did hurl most indiscriminately at
                  the heads of astonished waiters several oaths less vile, but more pointed. 'Soup!
                  soup!' he demanded impatiently, at the very top of his voice—a voice that sounded
                  like the creaking of a door troubled with a chronic disease. Albeit there was no
                  measuring the latitude Sir James would have allowed his feelings to take in
                  demanding soup, and be-d—mn the astonished servants, had not Lady
                  Constance Caution, who sat all calm at his left, reminded him in softest
                     accents that 'Citizen Peabody always
                  invoked a blessing before he gave soup.' Sir James in response kindly thanked my
                  lady for her timely admonition, listened to the blessing as it fell solemnly upon
                  his ear, bowed and extended his plate as the spontaneous Amen concluded the
                  seemingly anxious moment. Calm but well directed was my lady's rebuke; deeply did
                  it tell upon Sir James, who, more in imitation of Smooth's coarse manners, behaved
                  henceforth with more regard to the feelings of those near him.
               "It was now time to discuss the well-ordained set-out of viands. Round after
                  round, the most delicious, came on with that disorder so characteristic of English
                  servants. It will, Uncle Sam, be scarcely necessary for Smooth to add that great
                  skill was displayed in safely depositing the meats and drinks in nature's most
                  appropriate depot. Most cheerfully was it performed to the accompaniment of music,
                  merry laughs, and flashes of well-worn wit: the only discord discoverable, or
                  which could offend delicate ears, being that one or two English Gentlemen, of very
                  polished manners, obstinately refused to be contented with the long list of wines
                  provided by the generous host, and must needs display their cultivated taste by
                  ordering bottles of a name scarce known, assuring the polite landlord that they
                  themselves would pay the shot did Citizen Peabody fail to stand it.
                  Mr. Smooth had not the least objection to this delicate proceeding inasmuch as it
                  illustrated a principle, and contrasted strangely with those much cultivated
                  manners facetious gentlemen who so often waste ink in discoursing upon the
                  vulgarities of Americans would have us fashion from. Wishing, however, these
                  gentlemen may display better manners next time, we must beg the reader's pardon
                  for thus digressing and proceed.
               "The meats having laid a very decided foundation upon which to build a tabernacle
                  of joviality, and the nectar adding its 
                     exhilirating
                     exhilarating
                   power in erecting a substratum for the fine work of the festival, it
                  became necessary to top off with spicy speeches, which might indeed be compared to
                  a compound of salt and cream very liberally mixed. From among his guests and great
                  folks Citizen Peabody now rose, somewhat nervous, and with becoming dignity
                  delivered himself of a very piquant speech, the bone and marrow of which was that
                  Americans from home being moved by those sentiments the appearance of things new
                  and strange naturally produce, the sequence was that they looked with an interest
                  divided between reverence and curiosity to see their Minister; such a
                  gratification he was only too happy in being the medium of affording. Nor, when he
                  relieved that worthy representative of a tax his purse could ill bear, did he
                  consider it less than a very agreeable duty. In reply to Citizen Peabody's toast,
                  'Peace and continued friendship between the peoples of England and the United
                  States,' the guests filled a bumper, and with three hearty cheers let the liquid
                  run down so smoothly. Sir Arthur Coddlecomb's name being coupled with the toast,
                  and that compound of self-importance and bad grammar esteeming himself a great
                  speaker, rose, and relieved himself of what is commonly called a very neat and
                  appropriate speech. To Smooth his mind seemed on a wandering expedition;
                  notwithstanding, he took occasion to refer to that approaching curse—an Eastern
                  war, and also to divest himself of some very fine words, highly complimentary of
                  America. Marked applause followed the speech, and Sir Arthur sat down bowing.
               "'The present Lord Mayor!' being drawn into the order of toasts, the individual
                  filling that office, a firmly compacted figure, with well-rounded limbs, and a
                  broad, pleasing face, set off by the addition of a well-lined nose, full
                  intelligent eyes, a brow nicely arched, and organically well-developed, and
                  surmounted with a superstructure of dark, glossy hair, tinged with grey, rose to
                  reply. My lord, in addition to being rather shortish, possessed a countenance
                  indicative of amiability rather than strength of mind or force of character.
                  'Silence!' echoed and reechoed through the hall, and for a few seconds all was
                  still. Then the badge-bedecked figure, with dignity all sublime, rose to the
                  order. His dark eyes wandered to to the right and left, then over the banqueting
                  scene, and again toward the ladies. Smooth would here say, by way of interrupting
                  his lordship, and for the better information of his readers, that Sir James,
                  becoming somewhat civilized—perhaps he should say tamed,—and made conscious that
                  he confronted Mr. Pierce's special minister, pledged him in numerous glasses, and
                  being now somewhat mellow, cooled away into an all-refreshing nap, during the
                     enjoyment ment of which he, with
                  unpolished bows, made known his approbation of each happy sentiment contained in
                  the speeches.
               "His lordship (the reader must now return) here commenced drawing from the
                  cavities of his deep mind all the nice sayings of which his speech was so
                  beautifully made up. Again he paused, made several gestures with his right hand,
                  declared war upon all obstructing coughs, elongated his importance as never did
                  peacock on a shingle, and proceeded: 'My lords and gentlemen!' Loud and
                  good-natured laughing brought his lordship suddenly to a stop. 'My lord is not in
                  the—', whispered Sir Matthew Moore, who sat all facetious at his lordship's right.
                  Sir Matthew, significantly touching his lordship's elbow, while casting a sly wink
                  across the table, enjoined;—'Fellow citizens and ladies, your lordship!' His
                  lordship's face dispensed a few gorgeous blushes as he hesitated, and with an
                  angular motion of the head, he convicted another cough, and made the very best
                  kind of a bow acknowledging the default. 'Ladies, gentlemen, fellow-citizens!'
                  continued his lordship, not having altogether gained the firm footing of his
                  equilibrium—which, however, was much relieved by sundry well-modulated
                     bravos from the assembly—'I 'ave the 'onor (his lordship must be
                  pardoned for his onslaught upon the h's) in happearing before this respectable
                  body of Hamerican gentlemen hand ladies!—ladies hand gentlemen! (his lordship
                  suddenly corrected himself), let it not be thought that I ham bestowing flattery
                  when I say I esteem it an 'onor which I cannot too highly characterize, and for
                  which I am so deeply indebted to my friend who 'as so long and nobly contributed
                  to the durability of friendly intercourse between the two greatest and most
                  enlightened 
                     pooples
                     peoples
                   on earth—the man whom I am compelled to view as the greatest living
                  diplomatist of the hage!' Here the company, with one accord, made a
                  bow, while Sir Matthew interrupted his lordship by whispering, 'Nicholas of All
                  the Russias excepted!' His lordship, with a peremptory glance at Sir Matthew, the
                  meaning of which it was not easy to mistake, continued, somewhat testily:—'I will
                  make no single exception for any such renegade!' Turning to the chairman, he
                  reminded minded him of Sir Matthew's rejoinder, which he assured him he could not
                  consider, unless indeed he sacrificed the high functions of that great office to
                  which the voice of a people true to their traditions, and Providence, had so
                  significantly called him at this all momentous moment—the breaking out of an
                  Eastern war! 'No less 
                     surprized
                     surprised
                   than hoverjoyed am I to meet so respectable looking an
                  assemblage of citizens of that great country in the West, which we naturally view
                  as the exponent of true independence, as well as our great hoffspring. Would
                     hi, as the great representative of this city, be saying too much
                  while asserting that in my 'umble opinion no one part of this expansive hearth
                  (great applause) could send forth so respectable and orderly an assemblage of
                  persons.' The ladies here shouted, and waved their handkerchiefs. Having received
                  this distinguished compliment with due dignity, he commenced drawing aside the
                  curtain that we might know more of his early history, which he felt assured in his
                  own mind could not fail to hinterest the citizens of the United States in general,
                  seeing that he belonged not to the 'haristocracy.' (This was received with a
                  perfect explosion of applause.) In the days of his youth, when geographies were
                  made without reference to correctness, and the study of globes was considered
                  equal to the minds of those only who were learned enough to raise the devil, had
                  he been taught from one of those imperfect pasteboards that Hamerica was an
                  immense expanse of forests, inhabited by wild Hindians and curiously formed
                  barbarians. And the impression thus made, he assured Mr. Smooth in particular, had
                  so enrooted itself in his mind that he ever and anon found himself most
                  mysteriously contemplating the want of a state of civilization in that great and
                  glorious country. (Deafening applause). Here his lordship's animation was at the
                  highest pressure; indeed so high was it, that a very respectable gentleman,
                  sitting not far from Smooth, bowed, and suggested that the little Lord Mayor must
                  have mistaken the present company for his dining senate. 'Now, continued his
                  worship, emphatically, 'nothing could more happily 'ave affected a change in my
                  mind, than the beholding with my own eyes the lovely fair ones and respectable
                  persons here present. To that great country, Hamerica, shall I hereafter look for
                  the noblest results to civilization and mankind kind. (Cheers). It is now nearly two 'undred years
                  since the foundation stone of that great republic was laid by the immortal
                  Washington.' His lordship's speech was again interrupted by a demonstration of
                  surprise on the part of the audience. He paused a moment, as if questioning the
                  cause. Sir Mathew's aid was again called into service; reminding his lordship that
                  his history was at fault, he added, in a tone most prudent, 'Not yet one hundred,
                  my lord; 1776 marks the date of the declaration of independence.' Thanking Sir
                  Mathew for the kindly hint, he apologized to his hearers, and proceeded. 'One
                  hundred years, then have hardly rolled around, and we find that wonderful country
                  presided over by a commoner—the choice of a free people, who raise him to that
                  proud eminence once every eight years—vieing (here Sir Mathew again interrupted by
                  saying, 'Every four years, my lord!') with the oldest and most powerful nations of
                  Europe. Thanks, Sir Mathew,' interpolated his lordship, rather tartly, turning
                  round. His Honor now proceeded for some time on a rather smooth course, except
                  that he left out a great many h's and put in a great many a's. The great minds of
                  America, he said, had done a world for her greatness. Here he condescended to pay
                  what he was pleased to consider a very deserved compliment to General Flum of New
                  York, whose broad and deeply wrinkled face he espied at the extreme end of one of
                  the long tables, where it loomed up like a careworn lantern amidst a cluster of
                  delicately tinted foliage. America, said his lordship, sought her great men, not
                  from among the effete walks of the haristocracy, from the more legitimate
                  hemisphere—the common walks of life. With a strange elongation of the body did our
                  speaker emphasize the remark. Great men were the gift of an age, and a nation's
                  fortune; and with which he was more than happy to say Hamerica had been
                  blessed—would that his conscience and love of truth would permit him to say as
                  much of his own country! He saw the personification and embodiment of America's
                  great minds in the countenance of his much esteemed friend General Flum, whom his
                  very soul joyed at recognizing present. (We will here add, by way of parenthesis,
                  that the knowing ones of New York had a less exalted opinion of Flum's talent,
                  which had remained hid under a pewter pot, but for General Pierce, who dragged it
                  to the light of day for the purpose of eventually harmonizing his cabinet).
                  Fortunate was it for the welfare of a great country that such men existed; they
                  seemed born to a special purpose, which to him was a medium of conserving and
                  protecting the great international well-being of the two peoples. That purpose was
                  the greatest the world could contemplate in this great age of pounds, shillings,
                  and pence; and with such a mind as he knew General Flum possessed, and the
                  stronger arguments with which the generous host had conciliated all differences
                  international, the two countries were sure to continue in a bond of friendship. To
                  this distinguished compliment our general was pleased to make an approving bow.
                  Again, his honor, in compliment of himself, informed those present that nothing
                  could be more significant of divine will than that at this momentous crisis, when
                  a bloody war was on the eve of hurling its vengeance over Europe, and devastating
                  the nations, he should be called to hadminister those high functions of a nation
                  the duties of his office involved; and, too, when an opportunity would be afforded
                  him of exercising those mental gifts with which God had happily and liberally
                  endowed him. With the full force of this valuable interposition he had not a doubt
                  but that the peace and harmony of the world would again be restored. Nor should
                  her Majesty's ministers ever ask in vain his advice;*
                  
                     
                     *Note.—His Honor recently brought forward in the Board of Aldermen a
                        resolution having for its object the impeachment of Lord Aberdeen and his
                        cabinet.
                   and, as to the right of impeaching them, he would tenaciously reserve that
                  to himself on all occasions. Whenever they evinced want of hexperience, his
                  knowledge of hintricate questions and mystifying diplomacy should always be at
                  their disposal. A single flourish more, his face glowing earnest, and the little
                  great man proposed (having reiterated that great men were the gift of an age!)
                  'The great minds of America! This inspiring sentiment he coupled with the name of
                  General Plum, and sat down amidst a shower of very good-natured applause.
               "This compliment, as the vulgar say, took Plum all aback. He rose in all the
                  dignity of a Pierce diplomatist tist;
                  his face brightened, conscious of merit; his tall loose figure elongated; he
                  mastered several very ill-positioned coughs, and with glances very congressional,
                  as if seeking a reportorial eye, spoke as modern politicians mostly do when
                  President-making. But before Smooth proceeds to transcribe the elements of his
                  speech, some description of his person may be necessary; in truth, he hears the
                  reader demanding it. Flum is a long-jointed man, tall and coarse of figure, has a
                  broad inexpressive face, with a spacious mouth and thin lips, disclosing irregular
                  and discolored teeth; to which is added a sharp, projecting chin, prominent cheek
                  bones, lazy grey eyes, deeply sunken under narrow arches slightly fringed with
                  short, sprouting, reddish hairs, and a thin high bridged nose, forming a curvature
                  on the ridge, and twisted to the left at an angle of some twenty-two degrees. This
                  singular deformity of the nasal organ arose from the fact of its having been in
                  contact with the hard hand of a pugilistic congressman; at least so went report.
                  To those exhibiting nice taste for the appearance of our political gentry, we
                  would say that the general, not at all like Smooth, added to the beauty of his
                     personel a low, reclining forehead,
                  superstructed with bright crispy hair, that stood confused all over his head, and
                  gave him the appearance of having been chased by some infuriated bull. Of the
                  general's general estimation of his own capacity, Smooth is sure the reader will
                  not impose a penalty so far beyond his humble capacity as that of finding within
                  this narrow world of ordinary presumption anything with which to compare it
                  successfully. Having had many misfortunes in his upward career of political life,
                  which was singularly marked with disappointments, notwithstanding he had lent
                  forcible aid in making many a President, he never has permitted the strongest
                  opinion of his own talent to die out from his mind; and now that that
                  well-cultivated opinion is made stronger by the all-important verdict of his
                  eloquent worship, how can he resist the real proof of his being a much-neglected
                  great man? 'Mr. Chairman, and fellow citizens!' ejaculated Flum, nervously. 'My
                  friend, the Lord Mayor, has paid a well and much deserved compliment to our
                  country, our country's institutions, and our country's great minds. So, far,
                  ladies and gentlemen, as that compliment applies to myself, I may or may not have
                  deserved it; delicacy and reserve are always the noblest attributes of great men.
                  But—and with all due deference to those accomplished gentlemen of England do I say
                  it—it is to the democratic character of our institutions that we owe the
                  usefulness of those great minds, as reflected in our country's greatness. Yes
                  ladies and gentlemen, the democracy!—'
               "Here Flum was interrupted by Sam Spooner from Boston, who sat at his left, and
                  with a gentle touch on the arm, reminded him in a careless whisper, that Citizen
                  Peabody, although a very unostentatious man, was no democrat; nor was it certain
                  the ladies would all be inclined to father his adoption.
               "Flum, somewhat nonplused, allowed a smile of endurance to invade his broad
                  inexpressive face, and rejoined with what he was pleased to consider very nice
                  wit. 'If Citizen Peabody,' said he, 'be not an independent democrat I am
                  exceedingly sorry for it—nothing more being required to make him a perfect man!'
                  At this the company set up one of the very best-natured laughs ever rung out of
                  human organs. Flum, not comprehending its meaning, continued, ere it had
                  subsided—'I hold nothing more imperative than that our generous host, Citizen
                  Peabody, should at once declare his intention of not only becoming a round, sound
                  democrat, but joining the Young American party; which will in truth be a more
                  forcible proof of the purely democratic spirit of that diplomacy he has so
                  worthily founded, and which can now claim so many happy results as its offspring.
                  No system of diplomacy heretofore established has been so redolent of influences
                  tending to strengthen the bonds of international amity; for, indeed, meats and
                  drinks are all-powerful.' Here some indifference was manifested on the part of the
                  English aristocracy present, which, causing a momentary suspension of the speech,
                  produced a very unexpected calm, much to the astonishment of Flum's own dear self.
                  'Well, I apprehends the gist on't—democracy don't go down, no way, this side the
                  big pond. But, if John is old, and has got his noddle so full of antiquated
                  nonsense that he can't get an idea into his head suited to the exigencies of the
                  times, democracy, with its all-elevating power, will stand by him, give him new
                  siners to sustain himself, and carry
                  him through those struggles aristocracy has not nerve to surmount.' (Cheers).
                  Having literally illustrated every beauty to which democracy was heir, wasted
                  several well-constructed and not badly directed compliments on General Pierce's
                  patriotism, called upon those present to come boldly out and imitate Young America
                  in all his go-ahead proficiencies, Flum turned to his worship, on which wonderful
                  embodiment of statesmanship and experience he intended to return the compliments
                  that functionary had so flatteringly bestowed. As disappointments will occur, even
                  with the greatest of men, so did Flum find himself totally inadequate to the
                  discharge of this duty. There was, however, a responsibility resting upon him,
                  which he must, considering that it touched that which was an honor to England and
                  the English nation, discharge. It was, that he had to congratulate old England on
                  the possession of such men as his Worship—men born to the exigencies of an age,
                  and in whose charge the distracted affairs of Europe, now threatening the peace of
                  nations, would be sure to find a satisfactory solution. Here his honor made a most
                  appropriate bow in acknowledgment, while a few gentlemen, rather loquaciously
                  disposed, smiled and Miss Mapplebank, from Arkansas, covered her face with her
                  white handkerchief. It was evident to all present that the two greatest men of the
                  two greatest countries had met on a great international platform (the banqueting
                  table), and as the exchange of verdicts upon the capacity of each other only
                  served to make stronger the opinion they had always entertained of themselves,
                  everyone present was ready to throw up his or her hat in compliment of a discovery
                  which must reflect to the great good of nations in general. Flum ended his speech,
                  the mediums had met; international unity was perfect. Mr. Peabody bowed, the great
                  men signified their acknowledgment, the company rose as the general made his last
                  flourish and wiped the sweat from his brow, and all adjourned in the very happiest
                  phase of good humor. Smooth being somewhat modest, and always bashful when in the
                  presence of ladies, did not make his speech until they had left. It may be well to
                  say that Mr. Smooth's speech was gracefully responded to by Citizen Peabody, who
                  expressed himself delighted, and had no doubt but that in the care of Mr. Smooth,
                  General Pierce would make an unexceptional President. After this, gentlemen
                  feeling very jolly, we all adjourned to the gorgeously furnished hall up stairs,
                  where we joined the ladies, partook of most delicious coffee, enjoyed many happy
                  salutations and cordial greetings. The Lord Mayor and Flum having embraced in
                  style truly Roman, and pledged themselves over a cup of coffee, never to lose
                  sight of their own greatness, nor to forget the beneficence of that all-wise
                  Providence that had called them into being to struggle with the great events of
                  the age, the company dispersed homeward, delighted to the very heart. If there was
                  one who did not feel a glow of satisfaction, admonishing him, as he wended his way
                  homeward, to lend his influence for the maintenance of that mutual good feeling
                  which should exist between Englishmen and Americans—between nations so kindred in
                  spirit, and whose interests radiated from a common centre, he must have belonged
                  to a class Smooth would not deign to designate. Citizen George would that England
                  and America shook hands, remained friends, and left the gunpowder and big-word
                  business entirely to newspapers and small politicians of the Pierce stamp.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVII.
               SMOOTH LOOKS IN UPON THE MIXED COMMISSION.
               "MR. PRESIDENT PIERCE, who was by his friends supposed to be a comical and very
                  small miniature of General Jackson's political school, and whose cabinet was of
                  the Bunkum stripe, intimated to Minister Smooth, in one of the interviews he had
                  with him, which were numerous and very confidential, that in his tour over Europe
                  it might prove profitable to the country in general were he to keep a sharp eye on
                  the movements of a very respectable firm which did business under the name and in
                  the style of Soule, Saunders, and Co.—funny functionaries, who were now cutting
                  figure No. 1, and expecting him (the man Pierce) to cut the smaller figure No. 2.
                  No one personally acquainted with the merits of the aforesaid gentlemen would be
                  surprised to hear that they had threatened kingdoms, emperors, and kings,
                  astonished peoples, and given deluded individuals wonderful opinions of that
                  country which could send such embodiments of its wisdom and spirits to their aid.
                  Indeed, Smooth found himself, while in Europe, made an exception to the generality
                  of Mr. Pierce's diplomatists, whom, it was generally admitted, had either shown
                  spunk or turned gentlemen fighters to no account. It mattered not how much these
                  strange sprigs of capricious Young America misrepresented American manners,
                  education, and sentiments; no, to revolutionary spirits of the real-red
                     order were they the all-great of America's bone and soul. But let us not
                  arouse the gods by recounting their many follies; the generous soul of America has
                  indeed been compelled by them to father many an extravagance; and, too, though
                  more modest, had not Mr. Pierce delegated extensive powers to the Tomkin's family
                  for the very harmless purpose of transacting over the world such business as old
                  Sam had several times declared unnecessary, and which was in opposition to the
                  interests of the nation, the said Sam being expected to pay all the shot. Pierce
                  said Smooth must keep an eye practically to windward in reference to the business
                  this species of gentry were sent to perform. Hence, acting from principle, which
                  was Smooth's motto, and with a full knowledge that Sam was curiously good-natured,
                  had broad and ever open pockets to accommodate that worthy characteristic, which
                  no one thought it any harm to relieve, he gave his (Smooth's) assurance that the
                  charge of neglect never should be laid at his door—that he would watch the
                  Tomkinses! To deny the existence of a singular prompting to kill time over aught
                  that Sam stood sponsor for, was a very good-natured absurdity; few indeed could be
                  found who did not consider him an old foodle, who had fathered more expensive
                  abortions than any other individual, and was willing to father more. How, then,
                  could Mr. Pierce help viewing with suspicion the performances of those
                  tool-grinders he had sent abroad! The amount of kitchen labor he had himself
                  performed and the number of times he had laid on the grindstone to the turning of
                  his man Fourney, formed no excuse; forsooth, it enabled him the more clearly to
                  comprehend the ins and outs of this wholesale style of coming possum over poor old
                  Sam, whose credulity was only surpassed by that fatherly old gentleman, Mr. John
                  Bull, whom millions love to live upon, and spend their lives in getting out his
                  affections and his purse.
               "Now John and Jonathan had for many years amused one another with the long-drawn
                  music of diplomacy, played on very expensive keys, made with the express view of
                  settling all ungrateful international growlings. Diplomacy, nevertheless, found
                  these growlings beyond its power to reconcile; and now, having worn out its pipe
                  over them, they were shuffled off upon the genius of a mixed commission, which
                  high convention was expected to exert common sense and forego etiquette, and
                  result in a mutual settlement of all outstanding questions since 1812. But, by a
                  mysterious process, which never fails of effect in such cases, a deal of time had
                  been unprofitably consumed by this supposed immaculate commission. And now the high contracting parties sought
                  an extension, that much more might be consumed in the very same way. Uncle Sam
                  being very good-natured, the request could not be refused.
               "Through the Strand to Wellington street, Mister Smooth wended his way, and soon
                  found himself between rows of high and stately buildings, in one of which, all
                  calm and easy, sat the convention. Entering a narrow arch to the right, he passed
                  down a passage so intricate and dark that it had the appearance of leading to a
                  cave, and in a few minutes was confronted by a polite attendant, who ushered him
                  into the presence of the international dignitaries, then sitting round a large
                  square table, in the centre of the room, in moody contemplation. The room was high
                  of ceiling, about twenty-five by eighteen feet in dimensions, and in appearance
                  very well adapted to the pursuit of knowledge, for the display of legal ability.
                  Upon the table, which seemed somewhat infirm, lay in excellent disorder, a few
                  massive books, two green bags, a jacknife, Murray's Grammar, Walker's largest
                  Dictionary, four large pipes, an ample supply of fine-cut tobacco, and sundry very
                  bad writing materials. In one corner of the room spread out a green screen, behind
                  which was various simple but very useful ware; this, together with two extra
                  chairs for strangers, standing at the other corner, constituted the furniture.
                  There was a strong legal air about the table, notwithstanding its 
                     promiscous
                     promiscuous
                   burden. At the head of it sat like Cicero—but he had none of Cicero's
                  genius in his soul!—a man moody of countenance and portly of person: he was called
                  the Umpire, and they said he was chosen because of his birthplace being America.
                  Some had gone so far as to characterize the choice an evidence that Mr. Bull was
                  inclined to act upon the square, and permit Cousin Jonathan to have it all his own
                  way,—never for once keeping in mind that it mattered but little where a man's
                  birthplace was, if he had long since forgotten the spirit of its institutions.
                  Indeed, as far as sympathy and manners are concerned, an American may be more than
                  an Englishman, and vice versâ. Smooth does not
                  mean to insinuate that the case is illustrated in the present functionary, whose
                  face was of that stern cast which at times would lead to believe it unhappy under
                  the fatigue of a too solid body. To this singularly stern face was added a nose,
                  facetious gentlemen might be inclined to call the ripening fruits of good wine,
                  while pervading all was an air of sordidness curiously at variance with the good
                  parts repute asserted he possessed. Smooth would have taken him for a man whose
                  mind was of a mechanical turn; for at times he would become dreamy, his eyes would
                  close within leaden lids, and his body seem prone to cool away into sleep's
                  gentlest embrace. Again he would, as if with much effort, raise those leaden
                  eyelids, draw forth a languid breath, stretch his arms athwart, and, as if 'twere
                  pain, listen to the legal logic boring its dryness into his very soul. The tax did
                  indeed seem beyond his power of endurance.
               Being introduced all round, Smooth commenced the conversation by saying, in a warm
                  and good-natured sort of way:—'Well, Citizens!—how do ye make out to get time over
                  the bank? S'pose it's because Uncle Sam stands at the gangway serving the shot?'
                  They did not seem to brighten up at this remark. It was evidently viewed as rather
                  out of place; for the Umpire quickened his nodding, and the other five
                  functionaries constituting the convention permitted their faces to yield looks by
                  no means significant of good-nature. Quoth, by the way of conventionality, were
                  they right glad to see Minister Smooth; further, they shook him warmly by the
                  hand, and made many inquiries about Pierce and his policy—a thing he never had,
                  hence the impossibility of enlightening them. Mr. Pierce had an eye to Cuba, but
                  no policy whatever with regard to the getting of it: in addition to this, Pierce
                  himself so far defied analyzation that many grave and experienced diplomatists had
                  declared the problem beyond their power to solve.
               "Again, our grave conventionists said they had heard it whispered that Minister
                  Smooth (generally called Solomon Smooth, Esq.), being special Minister of Mr.
                  General Pierce to nowhere in particular, had secret instructions to arrange
                  matters for the holding of an extraordinary convention at Ostend; which said
                  convention, being principally composed of very respectable foreign gentlemen,
                  would especially take into consideration the Cuba question, as also the deciding
                  the point as to whether the Spanish spirit of the people of that island would
                     detract from the national purity of
                  Americanism. In the event of Cuba forming an integral part of the federal compact,
                  a grave question would here be involved. Assuring them they were not wrong in
                  their conjectures, Smooth was invited to sit down, in a very honorary position,
                  where, having examined certain papers pertaining to previous proceedings, and
                  passed an undivided approval upon them, he remained in all his dignity, listening
                  with great legal seriousness to the very important case then being argued by
                  General F—, whose eloquence was of the 'rip-roarer' style, and whose tragical
                  flourishes were as terrific as dangerous to the limbs all persons in proximity.
                  Smooth's seat was at the left of the Umpire, that functionary's right being
                  flanked by a gentleman lean of figure and studious of countenance, said to be the
                  American Commissioner, a worthy person of great legal abilities. A little below
                  Smooth sat the compact figure of a man in a genteel garb; an air of amiability sat
                  on his countenance, which ever and anon seemed playful; indeed, the very soul of
                  geniality darted from a pair of large blue eyes that gave great softness to an
                  oval face, nicely outlined in its parts. In a word, he was what might be called a
                  very promising limb of the modernly honorable law profession; nor would our
                  opinion of him have been less exalted had he refrained from the very innocent
                  sport of amusing himself with blowing peas through a quill, which he did in all
                  the playfulness of youth, his head being level with the surface of the table the
                  while. We had never supposed him the British Commissioner but for the assurance of
                  those in possession of stronger proof than we had been permitted to see. A little
                  below him, and with seeming indifference to the arguments of which General F— was
                  relieving his mind, sat a sharp-featured man, whose lithe figure, clear
                  complexion, quick gray eyes, finely arched eyebrows, well-developed brow, and
                  head, superstructured with a profusion of light Saxon hair, that hung soft and
                  smooth down his neck, an even cut mouth, with thin lips, slightly turned, and
                  disclosing teeth of great regularity and pearly whiteness,—a nose high, sharp, and
                  strictly Grecian, gave him a personel of more
                  than ordinary attractions. Smooth apprehends the reader will not charge him with a
                  diversion when he says that any lady of taste might have become enamored of this
                  gentleman without for a moment subjecting herself to the charge of stupidity.
                  Queen Victoria might, indeed, claim for herself the merit of having done a pretty
                  thing for Cousin Jonathan; for the two pretty gentlemen she had chosen to
                  represent her in the mixed commission bespoke how much she had regarded the value
                  of personal beauty in the settlement of those claims, so long outstanding, and so
                  beset with grave difficulties. Notwithstanding all this, the last gentleman was
                  said to be young, but a clever lawyer. Now a play of the humorous invaded his
                  face; and while from his eye there came out a strong love of the ludicrous, a curl
                  of sarcasm now and then ruffled his lip. They called him the British agent—in
                  other words, the Counsel for Her Most Gracious Majesty. Smooth had no stronger
                  evidence of this fact than that the gentleman seemed very contented with the way
                  time went, amusing himself with making paper spy-glasses,*
                  
                     *The writer here describes what he saw, without any attempt at ridicule.
                   with which he quizzed objects on the floor, then took lunar observations
                  through it, the broad disc of the Umpire's red face affording the medium of a
                  planet. To General F—, who was then in the full pressure of his speech, making
                  his, to him, crushing arguments a legal treadmill for his handsome brother, he
                  seemed a perfect pest, inasmuch as whenever the General had got a real stunner of
                  an argument on the crook of his mind, and just where he would be sure to lose it
                  if the course were not left clear, he was sure to interrupt him with some annoying
                  question, which in most cases amounted to nothing less than disputing the premises
                  assumed. The General had not received these interruptions with so much
                  perturbation but that they were always coupled with a sarcastic leer, the
                  significance of which had not been well directed, nor should ever be indulged in
                  by legal brethren engaged in the settlement of grave international questions. The
                  reader may say:—'who so cruel as to begrudge the legal gentry their little
                  innocent sport!' As the British Cabinet is at times a sort of toy, with which the
                  facetious House of Commons loves to play the game of knockdown (just for the fun
                  of seeing how much trouble it costs the nation to build it up) so the good-natured
                     gentlemen men of this mixed
                  commission seemed to view the gravest international questions.
               "'I reiterate!' continued General Flum, for it was no less a personage than he who
                  poured out his eloquence to the Convention: 'If the gentleman for t'other side of
                  this question was only to read Kent's Commentaries, or take a peep into one
                  Story's pleadings, 'twould do him more good nor all (we quote verbatim) the stale
                  law he's larned in the Inner Temple—'twould!' Here Flum paused, and majestically
                  turned round, as if to see how his antagonist felt. His legal brother was very
                  quietly pursuing his lunars with the paper tube, expecting soon to work up all the
                  curious angles of the Umpire's face. To properly intersperse this amusement he
                  would now and then bestow a good-natured and very sly wink upon a wag who sat at
                  the opposite side of the table, ever and anon tickling with the feather of his
                  quill the nasal organ of the Secretary, who had just melowed away into a delicious
                  nap. Flum proceeded: 'I mean no disrespect to the proficiency, or to the very high
                  position which my learned brother holds in this Convention; but what will be said
                  by the two governments when it is found that among the great array of cases
                  brought before this high tribunal so few have been settled without a reference to
                  the Umpire? I sincerely believe that did Her Majesty's Councillor exhibit more
                  readiness to meet our demands with a liberal and becoming spirit, many of the
                  cases which have passed before this high tribunal might have been settled with
                  little consumption of time, and at small cost to the nation. I know General Pierce
                  won't like the way things are done here, and how can I doubt, seeing the
                  distinguished person present who represents him in the capacity of special
                  Minister (here Smooth acknowledged the compliment by making one of his very best
                  bows), that he will be made acquainted with the facts. The Umpire, his countenance
                  quickening, would inform gentlemen that the many personalities and invidious
                  references he had so often heard reminded him rather of the pettifoggers of a
                  police-court than the high representatives of two great governments, met for the
                  purpose of dispassionately discussing the merits of grave international questions.
                  He had become wearied over such a useless waste of time, had purchased a whole
                  library of law books (which he hoped never hereafter to have occasion to use), and
                  must content himself with honor for his recompense. Now he was willing to submit
                  to the world whether there could be any honor conferred upon him by sitting from
                  day to day, listening, at the same time using every effort to keep awake, to the
                  legal cross-shots of gentlemen not inclined to agree to anything. The Umpire ended
                  in a voice deep and musical, drew himself again into his attitude of
                  contemplation, and like an Egyptian Sphinx seemed gravely studious with
                  himself.
               "The American Commissioner approved of all that had fallen from the lips of the
                  honorable gentleman. So did the English Commissioner, who suspended his little
                  amusement of the quill and the peas, and commenced examining the pages of his
                  Vattel. Having laid aside the paper spyglass, our English agent rose quickly to
                  his feet, and with eyes darting legal tenacity, said he had a few remarks to make
                  in reply to what he considered had very improperly fallen from the lips of his
                  legal brother. He did not intend disrespect to the very honorable Umpire, nor the
                  gentlemen Commissioners, when he said that the rules on which the business of the
                  Commission had been conducted seemed to him to be a complete mumble, growing
                  deeper and deeper with difficulties. Language had been used in that forum which
                  would be more genially localized in Whitechapel, Drury Lane, St. Giles's, or the
                  Surrey Side: he was sorry to see his transatlantic brother so familiar with the
                  piquant jargon of those atmospheres it were well not to be too familiar with.
               "'May it please the Umpire, I ask the protection of this tribunal from any such
                  imputation as the gentleman's insinuation would leave me under,' said the General,
                  almost bursting of anger.
               "There seemed to be a nice little difficulty brewing, which threatened a readier
                  dispatch of business than that which had marked their efforts in the settlement of
                  claims outstanding. Here again the Umpire, with the aid of his two Commissioners,
                  interposed for the peace and respectability of Mr. Pierce's family. And here Mr.
                  Smooth is happy beyond his power of expression to state, that after a very few
                  unmeaning explanations, the gentlemen Councillors bowed politely to each other,
                  laughed with buffoonish ish
                  good-nature, nor seemed a whit less than the very best of friends. 'If General —
                  will proceed with his argument!' said the Umpire, gravely, by way of what writers
                  call parenthesis. 'Then, to the point of this case: now, ye see, the law on our
                  side of the water aint a bit like it is here, on this; 'specially with cases of
                  this kind. This is the case of a vessel with niggers on board, bound from one part
                  of the United States to t'other, but driven by what sailors call stress of weather
                  into a British port called Bermuda, where the natives (report says they are not
                  very enlightened), not having the fear of God before their eyes, nor understanding
                  the constitution of the United States, nor comprehending the principle by which
                  certain democratic States in the free American Union make good property of such
                  things as men, did regardless of the laws of those States, insult the sovereign
                  flag, which was alike the protection of property and citizen, no matter in what
                  part of the world it floated, and set all the niggers free! After consuming an
                  hour in arguments of this stamp, the General claimed to have made out his case,
                  inasmuch as the niggers being property to the laws of the States to which they
                  belonged, and the flag of the United States being absolute in its character of a
                  protection,—no matter under what local jurisdiction,—the claim against England for
                  compensation was as just an one as ever man could present for man; did she
                  withhold payment, it must be at her peril.'
               "His legal brother now rose, a good-natured smile playing over his sharp face.
                  Before commencing, he would say he wished his learned brother had taken a more
                  dispassionate view of the case, and laid down a basis of broader principles. Much
                  of the difficulty in settling the many claims that had been presented for
                  adjudication arose from the fact of his learned brother laying down rules to suit
                  his own case, which he would not admit when applied against him. Further, he had
                  not the most faint idea of the nigger question being dragged before this tribunal
                  for adjudication. He had hoped that that question might be left for settlement on
                  the soil of America, where those best acquainted with the evil could most readily
                  find a remedy. But if it were true that the flag was inviolable, and that such was
                  held as law, and regarded in good faith by the federal government of the United
                  States, how came it that certain States in the federal compact so far disregarded
                  the rule as to scoff at the idea of the flag being superior to the municipal
                  regulations of the port; invade the decks of British vessels, regardless of the
                  flag; and drag from beneath its folds British citizens, whom they incarcerated and
                  made criminals merely to suit the caprices of a municipal statute? Strange indeed
                  was it for a nation great as was the American to lay down a principle of foreign
                  policy the action of which could only be allowed when it suited the immediate
                  interests of that nation, and was rejected when it came in collision with them. He
                  would tell the learned representative of that nation, that the spirit manifested
                  in such a course to him seemed more to comport with that specious style of
                  conducting business better understood among hucksters!' Here the man of the
                  American side of the house evinced some excitement, and quickly rising to his
                  feet, said he would not stand silently by and hear such imputations cast upon his
                  house, country, and people. The judiciary of the United States could not be
                  impugned—none was purer; while the foreign policy of the United States stood out a
                  model for the nations of Europe to pattern from. A counter interruption again took
                  place. The Umpire drew a long breath; the good-looking English Commissioner heaved
                  a sigh, and again commenced amusing himself with the quill; the sedate American
                  Commissioner yawned, and turned contemplatively the leaves of a commentary; to
                  end, they all seemed seized with the yawning fever, which was kept up until they
                  laughed right earnestly at one another, the handsome gentleman stretching his arms
                  athwart, and making a hideous grimace. At length this state of things was put an
                  end to by the Umpire, who did hope gentlemen would see, in his dinner hour having
                  arrived, the necessity of either resting the arguments here, or postponing them
                  for another day.
               In rejoining, her Majesty's sharp featured Councillor having pronounced a high
                  eulogium on his Honor's power of endurance, and the onerous duties imposed upon
                  him by the Governments which he so nobly sought to serve, and from whom the mere
                  honor afforded but a meagre compensation, (inasmuch as he felt convinced the
                     proverbial bial ingratitude of
                  Governments would be carried out in their not even compensating him for the large
                  outlay he had been constrained to make in law books) hoped he might be permitted
                  to make a few more remarks. His honor bowing assent, the well-looking legal
                  gentleman, in blandest accents, proceeded to say Jonathan must not lay a
                  foundation for others he was first to knock down; for if a rule applied to great
                  principles it must not be made subservient to small exigencies of an opposite
                  character: Jonathan must bow to his own stumbling-blocks. It did, however, seem
                  that this Commission had been viewed by certain parties as a sort of ola podra; before which deluded persons thought
                  nothing more certain than that their manifold grievances would be patiently heard,
                  their claims find a ready settlement, and their family affairs all be handsomely
                  arranged. There had been men from the coast of Africa seeking a protection under
                  cousin Jonathan's wing, by which their demands on Old John were to them certain of
                  being paid. There were good men from Manchester, who, forgetting their
                  anti-slavery sentiment's, sought a relationship with our noble cousin which dated
                  from previous to 1812, and under the shadow of his wings now sought to make the
                  rascally Britishers pay for certain slaves frittered away from them while residing
                  in Georgia, during the last war. There too, were noble Dukes and Earls presenting
                  claims against our cousin for certain lands in Florida, presented long since to
                  them by some imbecile king, who would upon the same style of conditions, have
                  given away the whole Continent. The said gentlemen had long since forgotten the
                  titles, and were only reminded of them by the existence of this Commission.
                  English gentlemen from Mexico sought, through the virtues of this Commission, pay
                  for property appropriated by General Scott during the Mexican war. Pensionless
                  widows thought it the grand centre of generosity, and sought through it
                  compensation for dead husbands. Holders of Mississippi bonds regarded it a perfect
                  El Dorado, at the shrine of which those long repudiated mementoes would be duly
                  paid, hopes and angry passions requited, and old Mississippi herself again, as
                  bright as a new-coined Jackson cent: and last, but not least, gentlemen with very
                  credulous and speculative faculties, and who held the most doubtful species of
                  Florida bonds, had made their hearts glad on the certain payment of them by the
                  Commission. In a word, said the learned Councillor, nothing can be more certain to
                  my mind (and I am borne out in the belief by the variety and character of the
                  claims presented to this Commission) than that the whole world is beginning to
                  look on our worthy transatlantic cousin as the most generous, if not the most
                  credulous, fellow extant! Whether his model friend George Saunders, can take to
                  himself any merit for having created this now very general opinion in Europe (by
                  virtue of his most extraordinary circulars), Smooth is unable to decide; but
                  certain is it that every disaffected subject on the continent who can get up
                  spleen enough to fancy himself a much injured republican —' Here General F—
                  interrupted, by submitting to the honorable Umpire whether these remarks were not
                  gratuitous, irrelevant, and improper. The Umpire, having given his opinion that
                  they were unduly long (extending a whole hour beyond his dinner-time), begged the
                  gentleman would turn the key to his concluding remarks. 'I have only another
                  remark to make,' rejoined the gentleman with the sharp face: 'If Sydney Smith had
                  lived, there would have been more wit and sarcasm levelled at this mixed
                  Commission than would have filled an octavo volume. I cannot forbear to say,
                  however, that strange as is the character of many of these demands, claims, and
                  grievances, some of them might have been settled without such a deplorable waste
                  of time, had it not been for the interference of that phantom devil, Mr. General
                  Pierce's black pig, who is always construing principles to suit his purposes. So
                  avaricious is that animal, that no amount of swill seems to pacify his desire to
                  overthrow principles and defeat great objects. No place would seem too obscure for
                  the brute to get his nose into; no demands too egregious for his appetite; no
                  rights too daintily established for his disregard. He is here, there, and
                  everywhere—demanding with the same ferocious spirit. We had hoped Mr. General
                  Pierce would keep him at home during the deliberations of this Convention: let us
                  console our disappointment by trusting to what the future may bring forth.' Here
                  the Umpire's patience was at an end—patience no longer remained with him a virtue.
                  He rose moodily from his seat, said the
                  sitting would adjourn until to-morrow, and. betook himself to his dinner, which he
                  added he feared would get as cold as the gentlemen's pleas. This was rather
                  abruptly bringing matters to a close. The legal gentlemen, as if disturbed
                  elsewhere than in their thoughts, looked terror-stricken, packed up their law
                  tools, shouldered their green bags, and, in the company of Mr. Smooth, sought a
                  place whereat to bestow good care on the inner temple. Smooth, with all deference
                  to the opinions of the very respectable gentlemen of the mixed Commission, begs to
                  inform his readers, and Mr. Pierce in particular, that they never will catch him
                  looking in upon them again."
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               SMOOTH RECEIVES THE DOCUMENTS, AND CALLS A CONGRESS AT
                  OSTEND.
               "SEVERAL months having passed, during which no further instructions from the
                  General came to hand, I began to think he had forgotten my mission, and taken
                  himself to dieting on gunpowder and War-Messages for the next Congress. Then I
                  received a private note from his boy Caleb, in which he stated very confidentially
                  that everything was waiting the next turn in the Brigadier's mind. Caleb's letter
                  discovered much impatience with his position, and a good many sly remarks which
                  were intended as a hit at Marcy and his budget. I should tell the reader that an
                  additional cause of my anxiety was the not receiving a reply to a private and
                  confidential note to Pierce, in which I remonstrated with him against the
                  propriety of holding a thing so open to base ridicule as a Congress of American
                  Ministers at Ostend. That fraternity of infallibility, kings and princes, might
                  become somewhat uneasy at its presence, many honest-hearted republicans would be
                  deceived, and its result be only the illustration of an unprecedented amount of
                  folly on the part of the American Executive. But the thing was a great pet with
                  Caleb, Jeff, and Pierce, who knew that Marcy would have to father the abortions,
                  which were generally laid at his door. With all these very natural difficulties
                  before me, I decided to charter the next Collins steamer, and proceed to the White
                  House, there to learn in person what the boys were doing. I was anxious to know
                  what had become of Pierce and Papa—whether Papa was yet administering the
                  pap-spoon to the General, by way merely of counteracting the effect of the
                  charcoal being piled on by the boys—Jeff and Caleb. Now, lest there
                  should be any one in Washington unwilling to separate Smooth's better inclinations from the general character
                  of the Convention to be holden, he would here say that the very best of his
                  abilities were exerted with the General against the policy of making his Ministers
                  cut so ridiculous a figure in Europe. He knew also that Monsieur Souley would take
                  upon himself all the cooking business, and have it all his own way, as they say in
                  England.
               "One morning, while consoling myself with the prospect of soon leaving Europe, its
                  aristocracy, its blighting kingcraft, and its squabbles, who should confront me
                  but grandfather Steady, a monster despatch under his arm, on which loomed out in
                  all its scarlet the great seal of the State Department. Steady had recognized
                     'Confidential' on the envelope, and bore it to me safely ensconced
                  beneath the ample skirts of his coat. 'Something of great importance for Minister
                  Smooth!' said he, making a very diplomatic bow as he extended the packet, made his
                  compliments, and retired. Steady having disappeared, I opened the packet, and,
                  equally surprised with the reader, what should I find but a State document of
                  great dimensions, commissioning Smooth without further delay to call together at
                  Ostend, or such other place on the continent of Europe as was celebrated for its
                  pure air and good liquors, a Congress of American Ministers! Three several times
                  did the commission reiterate—'Pure air and good liquors!' as if the tastes of the
                  very respectable gentlemen forming the Congress made such adjuncts inseparable
                  from the prime object of their deliberations. For some time did I exert my most
                  mature deliberations to get the diplomacy of the thing square into my head, which
                  I thought was more than had been done by the State Department. Well, you better
                  believe it was a puzzle! It was so Dutch, as we say. I was directed particularly
                  to consult my old and much-tried friend, 
                     Jemes
                     James
                   Buckhanan, whose sanction and presence at the gathering was necessary,
                  as well for the purpose of imparting an air of dignity to the Convention as
                  counteracting the fast spirit of those gentlemen, who had gained a doubtful
                  notoriety through their extensive dealings in cheap popularity. Marcy added, in a
                  private and confidential note, that he felt inclined to question the policy of
                  inviting certain gentlemen, but as a matter of etiquette it could not be foregone;
                  and then he was anxious to keep peace in the house, I was ordered to bag
                  Buckhanan, and, if against his will, carry him captive; to summon Monsieur Souley,
                  who was an excellent cook, not a bad fighting man, but a diplomatist fit only for
                  the small work of the carbonari; to dispatch
                  Mason, who they said was cultivating his French, with the hope of being up in the
                  language of diplomacy in the course of six years more; to enjoin Mr. Fay, well
                  known in Switzerland for his love of quiet life; to inveigle Mr. Belmont, who at
                  the Hague had taken upon himself the reforming his brother Israelites, and turning
                  to account sundry Dutch bonds; to do as I pleased with Mr. Daniels, who had
                  sustained the character of America by affecting contempt for all the aristocratic
                  snobs about Turin, who would to his annoyance crowd themselves into his opera-box,
                  and make too free with his fair favorite; to be sure and capture Mr. Jackson,
                  through whose courteous and dignified demeanor America was making herself
                  respected at Vienna; to send an escort for Mr. Spence, who had endeared himself to
                  his fellow-countrymen in Constantinople; and to send a jackass for 
                     Mishter
                     Mister
                   O'Sullivan, who had at Lisbon become celebrated for his misfortunes at
                  bagatelle and chess—to drum them all together for the one grand object. As for
                  Seymour, Pierce thought it not good policy to disturb him, seeing that nothing had
                  been heard from him since he found his way to St. Petersburg. With such spirits as
                  these, Europe could not fail to be astonished; and then, when it was borne in mind
                  that the consideration of its distracted affairs was the object No. 1 of such a
                  Convention!
               "While calmly cogitating the first and last move in the getting up of the thing,
                  my lodgings, '42, Bennet street, St. James's,' were invaded by the man Dudley, who
                  declared himself a special minister of Mr. Pierce, who sent him as envoy in
                  general to Mr. Smooth, under whose directions he would proceed to get together the
                  Congress at Ostend. I examined his credentials carefully, and finding them of Mr.
                  Pierce's legitimate stripe, commenced comparing notes and arranging the
                  preliminaries. He said, Pierce told him I would have a hard tug with old Buck, who
                  was like an aged turtle, and never moved until a great deal of fire was applied to
                  his back: but then his friends said he was fast, once he got going! 
                     Nothwitstanding
                     Notwithstanding
                  
                   Buck had very confidently told a
                  friend or two there was no understanding Pierce, Pierce said he understood him,
                  and, with Saunders to lend a hand, the getting steam on him would not be so much
                  of a job, after all. I must here say to the reader that we had not long proceeded
                  with our conversation before the fact that our man Dudley was commissioned to play
                  the part of Corporal Noggs to the fire-eating portion of the Cabinet, at the small
                  end of which Mister Pierce was appended, discovered itself. This fact fully
                  established, I sat down and commissioned him, first—to keep his mouth shut;
                  secondly, to proceed immediately to the Continent and get together the boys;
                  thirdly, to enjoin upon every one the necessity of declaring the object of the
                  Convention to be the relief of mankind in general; and fourthly, to be careful
                  while in France that none of Consul Saunders' epistles to all oppressed
                     citizens were found in his pocket,—that functionary being held as the
                  great revolutionary star, sent from the West to move the dead waters of an Eastern
                  world.
               "Having dispatched the man Dudley on his mission, with many bows and much esteem
                  for his high consideration of my position, and acting on the intimation from
                  Pierce, I packed up my portfolio, and in a Hansom cab made the best of my way to
                  56, Harley street,—a large mansion, in one of the back rooms of which they said my
                  esteemed friend James Buckhanan had for some time past been burrowed. That is,
                  Mrs. Sprat, who knew all the gossip of the legation, declared such to be the fact.
                  She saw very little indeed of the 'Governor,' whom she believed smothered in his
                  diplomacy, for he appeared never to want anything but the spittoon, and now and
                  then, at long intervals, a clean pair of stockings. Arriving at the door, I rang
                  lustily the bell, and soon there appeared a very stiff flunky, in democratic
                  livery of bright colors, who bowed me into a great hall, and after grinning at me
                  for about a minute, said he reckoned I was a citizen o' the United States. 'From
                  Vermont, I take it?' he continued, in quick succession. I told him it was no
                  matter about that; if he had no objection I would take a look at his governor.
                  While I was deliberating, the best-looking 'yellow fellow' outside of Carolina
                  made his appearance, and immediately commenced taking charge of me. He said he
                  understood diplomacy all up, (having studied dancing and attended Mrs. Sprat's
                  tea-parties for more than two years!) and would put me through if I said the word.
                  Then he added, with a sang froid that seemed
                  quite grateful, that though he wasn't exactly governor of the establishment, he
                  would show me up to the man who was, and under whose dictation Mr. Buckhanan had
                  for peace sake accepted a fifth-rate position. On my motioning him to proceed (he
                  seemed much inclined to affect a good deal of etiquette) the fellow led off,
                  through a long dark passage, crowded with empty Genessee flour barrels, champagne
                  baskets, boxes of cast off pipes (breathing redolent of tobacco), decrepit
                  arm-chairs, old foils and boxing-gloves, numerous empty beer-bottles, a lot of
                  worn-out dancing slippers, and a quantity of second-hand nightgowns and
                  side-saddles. What use diplomacy had for these abused relics we leave the reader
                  to conjecture. Opening a door on the left, my guide with a bow accompanying a
                  graceful bend of the body, ushered me into a spacious room, with the
                  announcement:—'A gemman fum de States, Mr. Prompt!' No Mr. Prompt could I see,
                  such was the state of the atmosphere. In fact, I was set upon by a perfect fog of
                  tobacco smoke.
               "'Well, stranger—glad to see ye this side the big pond!' croaked out a little
                  sharp voice, peculiarly nasal. I replied I thought it was rather foggy about these
                  diggins. 'No matter about that,' he rejoined, 'we do clean business in this
                  establishment, notwithstanding the puffing, we deem it necessary to keep up in
                  diplomatic matters. The atmosphere clearing a little, and objects becoming bolder
                  outlined, I discovered a figure so singularly lean and sharp of visage that you
                  would have sworn him peculiarly adapted by Providence for cutting his way into a
                  better world. Upon the walls of the rooms, which were very dingy, hung suspended,
                  tomahawks, bowie-knives, scalping-knives, bows and 
                     steel-poined
                     steel-pointed
                   arrows, an innumerable variety of dressed scalps, much worn Indian
                  uniforms, and various other things—all adapted to Western warfare. Here and there
                  stood sundry reed chairs and cronic tables, of Florida pine, while the floor was
                  very liberally set off with what are vulgarly called spit-boxes, which, unlike the
                  pages of an antiquated Bible that lay neglected in one corner, had been very generally used. Smooth would
                  here say that such adjuncts as the latter, seemed to be, judging from their
                  presence in all our Legations on the Continent, inseparable from Pierce diplomacy.
                  In the present case there were, in addition to the above-named fixtures, seventeen
                  patent rat-traps, with which members of the Legation amused themselves when not
                  invited to dancing parties. Smooth could not help thinking there was no need of
                  the latter pieces of furniture, while Mr. Prompt, the sharp gentleman, was in the
                  establishment. Indeed, Mrs. Grundy would have said he was sharp enough to be used
                  as an instrument for splitting the nicest diplomatic points; while the promiscuous
                  relics of antiquity arranged along the passage she would have sworn illustrated
                  nothing so nicely as Pierce's confused policy, the saddles being indicative of how
                  easily he rode over the credulity of the people.
               "In the centre of the room stood a five-legged round table, somewhat nervous and
                  infirm of age. Upon it stood, badly arranged, two tumblers of Cuba sixes, an ample
                  stock of fine cut tobacco, about a dozen long and much discolored pipes, a
                  spacious ash-box, and the dirty boots of Prompt, his lean figure sprawled back in
                  a dilapidated arm-chair, a long nine in his mouth, from which he incessantly
                  puffed an immense volume of smoke. Prompt's face was a perfect picture of
                  edge-tools; and with his easy air generally, his hands stowed away in the ample
                  pockets of his nether garments; his passion for the Byronic—made known by the
                  extravagant roll of a turn-down shirt collar—and his bushy hair thrown back on a
                  veiny and narrow forehead that seemed to have been cut away to fit his hat, had an
                  appearance easily imagined by those who have witnessed in New Hampshire the
                  general make-up of an itinerant stump orator. I bowed as he cast his eyes along
                  down my figure, and gave a friendly wink. 'From York State, I take it?' he
                  continued. I replied I had been in York State, but was born on Cape Cod. 'Well,'
                  he rejoined, 'don't matter where a feller's born nor grow'd, only he's got the
                  right sort o' bone and siners in him.' The general appearance of things had
                  mightily changed since I last visited the place—in truth, I could scarcely believe
                  my own eyes. Mr. Prompt now drew forth a handful of long nines, said he never
                  liked to smoke alone, and invited me to join him. I excused myself as well as I
                  could, adding that I had no small vices. The truth was, the spit-boxes, and
                  rat-traps, and a large supply of tobacco, looked so suspicious, that I was at a
                  loss how to comport myself: I feared I had got into the wrong box. 'Anyhow,' said
                  Mr. Prompt, ' bring yourself to a mooring—remember we treat all citizens alike
                  here—and be quite at home in the establishment. Smooth, I believe, is the name?'
                  He looked at my card as I bowed, expecting every moment to see him rise from his
                  easy posture. With a sort of languid endurance he said the establishment was at my
                  service—that anything I desired would be put through like Jehu. A set of snobby
                  fellows, he said, had for a number of years made a den of aristocracy of the
                  place, but the aspect of things had been changed now to suit the good
                  fellow-spirit of our institutions. Here he drew a deformed hat over his forehead,
                  and let fly a moist projectile; which, instead of taking effect in a box of
                  saw-dust, expanded ineffectually upon the face of a female dog-iron. I suggested
                  that it 'warnt' so bad a shot. He replied, he reckoned — Just at this moment the
                  full yellow face of the negro protruded itself into the doorway. 'Mas'r,' he
                  ejaculated, dat's da geman (pointing to Prompt, whose face was seen to contract)
                  what do up all da plomacy ob dis establishment.' The yellow face withdrew behind
                  the green baize. All this time I had been careful not to disclose to Mr. Prompt
                  that I was minister in general to Mr. Pierce.
               "'Citizen,' said he, continuing his cigar, 'that ar nigger's sassy enough for
                  three legations. Pierce sent him here;—for what, no one about the establishment
                  can tell. Anyhow, seeing it's you, I was about giving out an idea of what an
                  interminable muddle Pierce would get everything into if he had but his own way;
                  but, as there isn't time now, and as you won't join me in a cigar, suppose we send
                  out and have a first-rate brandy-smash?'
               "This I respectfully declined; I thought it would give him so much trouble.
                  Indeed, he said there was so much to do about the establishment, and nobody to do
                  it except himself. In reply to a question, he said, the governor—meaning Mr.
                  Buckanan—had worked himself out, and was laid away to dry. At present he alone constituted the establishment. There used
                  to be a secretary (the salary, he had reason to believe Uncle Sam yet paid) but
                  nothing had been seen of him for several months: when last heard from, he was
                  entering into a partnership with Monsieur Souley for the purchase of Cuba, at any
                  price. As for the attachés, one got no pay, and was expected by the government to
                  do a deal of work, while the amount paid to the other was so small that he very
                  wisely spent it in cab-hire to see the sights, which it just covered. One might be
                  almost sure of seeing the former gentleman on the approach of a court concert,
                  while the presence of the other at the legation prognosticated the advent of a
                  drawing-room. In fact, Mr. Prompt said, with considerable logic, that when people
                  were only half paid they were sure to do nothing. As for himself (here he smiled,
                  and commenced a new cigar), why he did up the diplomacy of the establishment by
                  the job—that is, he absorbed in his lean person the functions of minister
                  plenipotentiary, secretary of legation, and gentlemanly attachés. And for the
                  performance of their duties (the pickings were not worth mentioning) he would, at
                  the end of a few years, make out his account against Uncle Sam, whom he was sure
                  was too straightforward and generous not to allow it. 'Fact is, stranger,' he
                  reiterated with great assurance, 'I am almost worked to death here.' A monster
                  gray cat having entered the room, and inspected curiously the several rat-traps,
                  Mr. Prompt, as if much annoyed, drew himself with great effort from the crippled
                  chair, and drove her unceremoniously out of the room, accompanying her retreat
                  with Peters on diplomacy. 'Then, Mr. Prompt,' said I, 'may I consider myself
                  entirely in your hands?' Again spreading his boots on the table, and languidly
                  elongating his lean body, he replied, 'nothin shorter!' In answer to a question,
                  he said he could fix me out with anything—from a passport to a grindstone. In
                  fact, he was a man of universal qualities, and could accommodate the needy with
                  almost anything. He could issue a passport for the infernal regions; he could give
                  a card to dine with old Jones when one got there; and by way of 
                     faciliting
                     facilitating
                   matters, lend him a saddle to ride there. I admitted he was exceedingly
                  generous, and well calculated to bring out all the various functions known to
                  diplomacy; but, having no taste for the sport he proposed, intimated my preference
                  for a box at the Opera, or an invitation to dine with her Majesty. 'Well, I do
                  declare,' says Prompt, who was seized with a very troublesome cough, 'if you ain'
                  got a-head on me there!' Seeing his confusion, I begged he would pardon the
                  intimation. In reply, he good-naturedly drawled out, 'them things, somehow, don't
                  come within the privileges of this establishment. Can accommodate ye with a box at
                  the Theatre Royal, Westminster—play the very best sort of patent farces in that
                  national place of amusement. Then they've an audience so forbearing, that it makes
                  no matter what they play, and the fun of that establishment beats bull-fighting
                  all holler. Should the low-comedy man some call Pam, and his walking gentleman,
                  John, chance to have steam up, you will be sure to get your money's worth. Take my
                  word, said he: Covent Garden and Drury Lane are but dull show shops compared with
                  it.' Again I thanked Mr. Prompt for his kindness, and told him I would wait till
                  the next bull-baiting came off—understanding from good authority that such amusing
                  spectacles in that house had frequent possession of the boards. Did I want to
                  revel in the sights and dark places of London, Mr. Prompt said I had better wait
                  the return of the absent secretary, which could not be more than six months
                  hence."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               SMOOTH DISCOVERS HIMSELF.
               "'NOW, CITIZEN!' said I, thinking it was about time I disclosed to Mr. Prompt who
                  I was, and also the character of my mission, 'as you seem to be the establishment
                  in general, and can grant such very accommodating passports, let me inform you
                  that I, Solomon Smooth, am Mister Pierce's Minister Extraordinary, to Europe in
                  particular. Mr. Prompt's sharp visage now became sharper. 'Pierce,' I said, 'had
                  commissioned me to call together all the boys, in congress at Ostend.' In
                  testimony of what I had set forth I produced the document, at the sight of which
                  he relieved himself of a very handsome bow, brought his lean body to a
                  perpendicular, and, with an effort at modesty, laid aside his hat and cigar; this
                  I regarded as creditable to the establishment. 'The governor's cum, Mas'r Prompt!'
                  exclaimed the negro, again thrusting his full yellow face into the door. Prompt
                  was evidently abashed at this sudden announcement.
               "'I'll see the governor, if you have no objection,' said I, attempting to relieve
                  his quandary. He replied he had none whatever; that I would find him a trump,
                  though rather low. 'He seldom comes out of this place!' ejaculated Prompt, leading
                  the way through an extremely narrow and crooked passage into a dark cloister-like
                  room, lighted by a small lamp that shed a sickly light over the few antiquated
                  pieces of furniture it contained. 'Minister Smooth will please to introduce
                  himself!' said Mr. Prompt, ushering me into the room, and closing the door as he
                  retired. Descrying through the pale glow of the lamp my venerable friend Buck, who
                  was seated at a table in the centre of the room, amusing himself with the cat
                  Prompt had so unceremoniously kicked out of his presence, he immediately
                  recognized me; the reception I met would have done honor to companions in the
                  Continental War, meeting after a long absence. He said Saunders and his boy Dan
                  (that is, he was boy to Dan) had reduced his light wonderfully. Here he began
                  pricking up the wick of the old lamp, while I drew up a seat and commenced without
                  further ceremony disclosing the object of my visit, and making known to him some
                  of Pierce's opinions (private) on matters in general. 'Read this carefully,' said
                  I, handing him my instructions from the State Department. He took the document
                  like one compelled to do a thing against his will, while I attentively watched the
                  changes that came over his countenance as he read it. 'Indurable Pierce!' he
                  muttered, adding a languid sigh. Then his portly figure seemed to expand, his hair
                  to grow whiter, and his general appearance to assume a more venerable air, as he
                  read the portion that particularly directed me to bag him, pro or con. Indeed, his
                  crooked eye became straight with indignation, while his neck no longer retained
                  its wonted curve. 'I have studied the man, but find I yet know little of him!'
                  said he, recovering his usual calmness, and shaking his head significantly. I
                  inquired if he meant Pierce. He replied, testily, in the affirmative. 'Several
                  times has he made me cut a ridiculous figure in the eyes of the nation. I cannot
                  disclose my true position,—he knows that, but will have me a partner to this most
                  stupid of projects;—well, well!' Here he seemed in the act of yielding to his
                  despondency, when to revive him I presented several private notes which I had
                  received from Pierce, explanatory of his views with reference to the immense
                  benefit that would accrue to the nation, and manifest destiny, from this great
                  congress. 'Now Smooth,' continued the old man, relieving his mouth of an
                  encumbrance, which, missing its aim, took effect in the face of the cat, which set
                  up a fearful yell and scampered out of the room, 'although I can't understand
                  Pierce, I have great confidence in you, and there is something so ridiculous about
                  this affair that I feel like relieving my mind to you, which I do without
                  prejudice. I care not to examine your confidential notes; they are doubtless of a
                  like character with those I have myself received from him on this very subject.
                  The man seems crazed. He has inundated me with confidential trifles about Cuba,
                  the affairs of Europe, the Central
                  American question, and the holding a Congress at Ostend. I am bored to death with
                  his opinions, which, on the policy of the latter, are cheap indeed.' The old man
                  now became exceedingly nervous; indeed, he seemed like one laboring under the
                  first symptoms of an over-dose of Parr's Life Pills. 'Smooth! I am sacrificed;
                  yes, sir, literally sacrificed to all his folly! The despatch bag has groaned
                  under the very pressure of his nonsense, which I am compelled to read and commit
                  to the flames, lest our nation should suffer by its disclosures. I have appealed
                  to him on behalf of my conscience; I have reasoned from the depths of my
                  experience; I have besought him to spare my reputation—and here you bring me fresh
                  proof that it has all gone to no purpose.' I could not help pitying the venerable
                  old man as he shrugged his shoulders, and gave such a desponding look. 'Pierce,'
                  he continued, 'will smash the democracy before he has done, by simply making it
                  ridiculous. Thrice have I remonstrated with him in all my power of persuasion; but
                  it has fallen harmless at his feet, for here he is, up again and harping. He
                  singularly argues in his private despatches that Europe being in a fuzzle
                  generally; that England having enough to do at keeping her grumbling people quiet,
                  and fighting her old friend Russia; that Monsieur Napoleon, the very Republican
                  Emperor, having three large kettles of fish to fry—one in helping England to whip
                  Russia, by which means he hoped to wipe off an old score; the second, to affect a
                  great determination to fight for the independence of the Turks, who say they will
                  lend a hand when they get in cash; and the third, to crush all revolutionary
                  movements at home; and that all having enough to do in their work of protecting
                  despotism and neglecting liberty, the time is singularly opportune for America's
                  making one grand demonstration. Thus, he said, Pierce argued. It was all very well
                  showing a saucy front to mankind in general, but if we undertook to bag Cuba,
                  there must be something more than threats and war messages to back it up.' I could
                  not throw up my commission; therefore begged my friend Buck would consider my
                  position, and excuse in me what seemed fast. And then I had despatched my Corporal
                  Noggs to arrange matters with Monsieur Souley, who was to play the part of
                  engine-driver, crowding charcoal for the whole team. After the manifestation of
                  much indecision, my friend Buck consented to go, at the same time stipulating that
                  he should not be led by certain fast spirits. 'If I go, Smooth,' said he, 'it will
                  be with virtuous reluctance; the whole thing is sure to come out. Further, my boy
                  Dan (a sharp fellow he is!) has gone on a little affair respecting Cuba, by which
                  he expects to make hit No. 1.'
               "At this moment we were interrupted by the brusque figure of George Saunders
                  appearing in the room. George instantly recognized me, and said he anticipated my
                  mission, having received sundry private and very confidential letters from Pierce
                  on the same subject. It seemed that Pierce and his boy Fourney had written any
                  amount of private and confidential letters on this to be kept very secret affair.
                  George made himself quite at home. Indeed, the uninitiated might have mistaken him
                  and the cat for fixtures of the establishment. Calling me on one side, he begged I
                  would consider Mr. Buckanan entirely in his hands. In order to bring his speed to
                  the right gauge, Dan and himself had, he said, spent several months hard labor;
                  but now he was happy to say they had found the key to his movements, and nothing
                  more was wanting. As for Buck's presence at the Ostend convention, just leave the
                  arranging that to him. Further, in order to make a demonstration while it was
                  sitting, he would write an epistle to the Emperor of Austria, forewarning him of
                  the sympathy in America for the spirits he held down in oppression. This would be
                  a decided hit, he added, with a knowing wink. So confident was George of his
                  mastery over the venerable old man, that I felt it would not be prejudicing Mr.
                  Pierce's interests to leave the matter entirely in his hands: so bidding them a
                  very good morning, I signified my intention of calling again in ten days, when I
                  expected he would be ready to move on; if not, I should be under the painful
                  necessity of bagging him, as directed by the State Department.
               "I had left the legation, and was passing into Portland place, when, to my
                  surprise, I was overtaken by the indomitable George, who insisted that I join him
                  in some gin-and-bitters at the first drinking-place. To have declined George's
                  amiability would have been immaculate
                  folly: he always bagged his friends, precisely as Pierce directed me to bag the
                  ambassador. Having stopped at the first crossing, as they say in Georgia, we drunk
                  ourselves, wished Pierce much joy with his project, and parted, George saying he
                  would turn steam on the old man, and have him all right when I called.
               "Prompt to the hour, no sooner had the allotted time expired than I presented
                  myself at the Legation with an express wagon, for the accommodation of the old man
                  indispensable. 
                     Coporal
                     Corporal
                   Noggs had got the boys all right on the continent, and such a jolly time
                  as was expected! George had evidently been screwing up the old man, for I found
                  him in the very best humor. There he sat, portly and venerable, surrounded by
                  boxes, carpet-bags, and trunks; all, he assured me, containing various diplomatic
                  implements of great value. At his feet purred the cat diplomatic, as if anxious to
                  accompany him. 'These boxes are a great trouble to me,' said the old man, getting
                  up with some effort, and pointing to three, about two feet square each, and
                  labelled as follows:—No. 1, 'Cuba by purchase,' below—'Copies of Correspondence with our Minister to Spain, some years ago,' at the
                  left corner the words—'Promiscus.' No. 2. 'Cuba at any
                     price'—underneath—'This side up, with care?' 'No. 3. Cuba of necessity, and as a link in the manifest fulfilment of
                     destiny?'—underneath—'Handled only by the experienced
                  porter.'
               "The hall now rang loud of confusion,—the fiery-eyed cat ran screaming to the
                  door, maids' eyes were seen wanting to weep, Prompt affected great grief,—he would
                  be worked to death,—porters were seen carrying out the luggage, and then waited to
                  convey the old man. Then Prompt said—the negro, as if to make the picture
                  complete, was making all sorts of grimaces in a corner,—if Dan should by some
                  accident return, what a deal of extra work he would make! But Smooth made up his
                  mind that such complaints were the natural consequences of an irregular system. At
                  last, having got boxes one, two, and three nicely cared for, we bundled in the
                  rest of the traps, following then with the old man indispensable. Saunders being
                  present by appointment, insisted upon his right to drive the team, and suddenly
                  springing upon the box, seized unceremoniously the reins, and put the horses into
                  full gallop. Increasing his speed, until it became frightful to delicate nerves,
                  the poor old man's fears for his safety became so excited that it required all my
                  strength to keep him from jumping out and breaking his neck, notwithstanding I had
                  tucked him away so nicely among the boxes before starting. Down Portland place,
                  through Oxford street, up Holborn, and down Cheapside, to the Bank (astonishing
                  the natives as we went) we drove, and from thence to St. Katherine's Dock, where
                  was moored the trim little steamboat chartered to convey Mr. Pierce's
                  plenipotentiaries safe to Ostend. Buck was in a sad state of excitement when we
                  stopped; he resembled an individual just escaped from a perilous adventure. He
                  discharged himself clumsily from the wagon, his face undergoing singular changes
                  of color the while, and cast a few savage glances at Saunders, who very composedly
                  sat on the box endeavoring with might and main to suppress a vagabond laugh. 'Now,
                  Saunders,' indistinctly sputtered the old man, as that bluff-sided individual
                  turned upon his seat, rather knavely casting a comical glance over his shoulder,
                  'I'm not afraid—my courage never fails me; but that steamer don't take me to
                  Ostend if you're a passenger! Mind that now!' Saunders lowered himself gravely
                  from the box, and with serious countenance assured the old man that no danger
                  could result while he drove the team. In reply to this, the old man declared that
                  with Saunders on board a blowing-up was certain. The much-dreaded gentleman,
                  however, soon quieted the envoy's fears by assuring him that accompanying us to
                  Ostend was farthest from his thoughts, he having made all the necessary
                  arrangements for throwing a bomb-shell into the camp from this side of the water,
                  as directed by the Uncle Caleb and the boy Fourney. Boxes one, two, and three
                  being safely on board, we supported the old governor after them—Saunders on one
                  side, and Smooth on the other. Then the bell rang, and the steam thundered and
                  roared, and the little craft glided on her way, Saunders waving his adieus from
                  the wharf, and crying out at the very top of his voice—'Don't forget Cuba!' and go
                  it, Buck! Go it, Smooth!!'
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               ARRIVAL AND GRAND RECEPTION AT OSTEND.
               "OUR passage was attended with extremely pleasant weather; and nothing remarkable
                  occurred, except that the Dutch crew thought Mr. Buckhanan a very great man, and
                  the object of his mission the overthrow of European dynasties in general. Twice
                  they undertook to regale him with sour-krout, which he pronounced inferior to that
                  made in York county, 
                     Pennsylvane
                     Pennsylvania
                  . As to me, they declined to be convinced that I wag not Governor of
                  Kentucky, having a singular belief in the peculiarities of that State for growing
                  long citizens—the tallest man always being elected governor. Perhaps I should have
                  added that the Schiedam was only tolerable, the brandy bad; and that Buck, having
                  forgotten his tobacco, was compelled to resort to very bad Dutch loggerhead, with
                  which he kept the swabs busily employed.
               "As we entered the port of Ostend, once so celebrated for the defence of its
                  garrison, a salute of thirteen guns was fired from the old fort, which we
                  attempted to answer with a rusty swivel, Buck waving his hat, and singing 'Yankee
                  Doodle' to the burghers who filed along the dilapidated dyke. As the steamer
                  neared a landing-place, we descried the coarse figure of Corporal Noggs,
                  surrounded by numerous of his fellow citizens, prominent among whom was Monsieur
                  Souley and the Chevalier Belmont. In addition to these welcoming spirits, there
                  came also a Dutch band, which, ere we had made fast alongside, struck up something
                  they intended for Hail, Columbia! The reader will please appeal to
                  his imagination as to what our reception must have been, when I tell him that
                  shouts and huzzas, interspersed with this discordant 'Hail Columbia!' rent the
                  very air, and made faint the roaring of the steam from the funnel of our little
                  craft. Boxes one, two, and three, were now sent forward under an escort to the
                  hotel, while a triumphal chair secured to two long poles was placed in proper
                  order for the reception of my friend Buck. Rather against his inclination, and not
                  without expressing some doubt as to the propriety of displaying so much pageantry
                  in a foreign country, was he packed into it by Monsieurs Souley and Belmont.
                  Corporal Noggs now formed in order the procession, which moved in state through
                  the city, headed by the band playing the 'Rogue's March,' which it mistook for
                  'Yankee Doodle.' Such a funny procession! The reader may imagine the figure cut by
                  my venerable friend, when I tell him that the triumphal chair was borne on the
                  shoulders of Monsieurs Souley, Belmont, Daniels, and O'Sullivan—the two former
                  being in the lead. Close in the rear of the chair, your humble servant, Smooth,
                  took up his position, riding a female jackass, an animal domesticated by Monsieur
                  Souley, under whose saddle she had borne up until the flesh was nearly off her
                  bones. This was tapered off with an everlasting string of seedy citizens, for whom
                  an innumerable quantity of goats seemed to have a fellow sympathy, so close did
                  they follow. At the hotel, from the balcony of which streamed the stars and
                  stripes, the uproar and confusion was beyond description. Could some of the old
                  burghers have risen from the tomb, they might have imagined a modern siege of that
                  city they so nobly defended in times gone by. Staggering and sweating, the four
                  envoys bore their precious burden to the great porch, whence he was escorted to
                  the balcony, upon which he stood, like a Roman of old, and, by the advice of
                  Monsieur Souley, delivered a stunning speech, that versatile functionary
                  translating it into Dutch. It will scarcely be necessary to add that the speech
                  proved a decided hit, and was received with shouts and acclamations. Not a little
                  done over, the old statesman was now regaled on delicious krout and gin-slings,
                  and put carefully to bed by a Dutch chambermaid. This was at three o'clock in the
                  afternoon. At seven I marshalled all hands for a grand banquet, which had been
                  prepared without any regard to expense, it being intimated that Uncle Sam would
                  settle for the whole thing.
               
               "Fresh and refreshed we all appeared ready for action, and as bright as could
                  possibly be expected after such a fatigue. The table was set out in grand style;
                  indeed, it literally groaned under every delicacy of the season—not excepting
                  krout, the glows of which impregnated the atmosphere. Buck said he would sit
                  opposite the krout; but that was objected to, on the ground of his eating so much
                  as to change the tone of his speech, which was expected to be more than usually
                  spirited. After so little opposition from Monsieur Souley, who wanted the place
                  himself, it was voted that I should take the chair. Of course I could not refuse
                  the honor; but in order to illustrate the three principles of our political
                  policy, I was cautious to stipulate that Buck sit on my right and Monsieur Souley
                  on my left. Here we were—steady, very steady, and very fast. Belmont insinuated,
                  rather ironically, that Buck could no longer be considered of the steady school;
                  in fact, Saunders had so cultivated his component parts that he might now, without
                  any fear of contradiction be put down as remarkably fast. I need scarcely add that
                  the viands were discussed with great gusto, Monsieur Souley absorbing so much of
                  the fricasee frog that his glossy black hair, which had before
                  beautifully undulated over his shoulders, now curled tighter, his eyes sparkled
                  brighter, his face became more olive, and his periods more intensely French.
                  O'Sullivan, too, had procured some capital Irish whiskey, which he said he already
                  felt in his boots. At ten o'clock there was a general secession of knife and fork,
                  and a resort to the less tasteful amusement of speech-making. Souley, however, had
                  all the while said all manner of things about, and brought all sorts of charges
                  against Louis Napoleon, whose government he denounced in very general terms, not
                  dreaming that that shrewd sovereign had introduced two spies in the capacity of
                  waiters. The cloth being removed, Monsieur rose, considering he was in duty bound,
                  and commenced throwing off the rounded sentences of the first part of a very long
                  speech,—at one moment denouncing princes and kings in general, and in the next
                  threatening to smother Spain with an interesting exposition of her perfidy. Her
                  puppet government was a base mockery; he said Espartero had grossly deceived
                  him!'—Here he was brought to a stand by Mr. O'Sullivan, 'It's meself thinks the
                  gintleman 's about debatin matter what 'll cum afore the Convention to-morrow,'
                  interposed that gentleman. Monsieur Souley replied somewhat tartly: he hoped the
                  gentleman from Ireland would not interrupt him. Order! was now called for on every
                  side, and an appeal made to the chair, without whose interposition a savage
                  encounter must have resulted. The whole company were now on foot, interposing for
                  peace; nor had I time to assert my authority, when, decanters of port and claret
                  standing close at hand, Souley seized one, and O'Sullivan the other, as if for
                  weapons of mortal combat, and commenced a series of threatening menaces. The
                  waiters were not accustomed to such feints, and one, before we were conscious, of
                  it had run down stairs and alarmed the house. Landlord, servants, and a whole
                  troup of police, came rushing into the hall, as the two gentlemen of Verona,
                  revealing the joke, made the politest bows over their glasses, which they
                  gracefully emptied. I was about deciding that Monsieur Souley's language was
                  decidedly personal, when he proclaimed his determination to postpone his speech
                  until to-morrow. He would however, conclude by proposing a toast, which he need
                  scarcely add would be heartily responded to by every one present. He would propose
                  the health of the venerable statesman on the chairman's right—a man who had long
                  and worthily maintained the highest rank among his country's statesmen, and whose
                  opinions (although he differed with them at times) were world-wide! (Great
                  sensation). Mr. Buckhanan now rose, evidently affected by the immensity of the
                  cheers. His mien was at once dignified, and when contrasted with the promiscuous
                  countenances that surrounded him, wore an air singularly American. He began by
                  saying he was happy to say he did not feel himself a stranger in a strange land.
                  (This being translated into Dutch by Monsieur Souley, the invited guests present
                  received it with loud acclamations). We read the same books; we were animated by a
                  kindred love of liberty; we spoke the same language; we enjoyed the same 
                     immuninities
                     immunities
                   of a constitutional government; and that spirit which animated us to
                  fight for liberty had its origin in the same stock! Here Mr. Belmont interposed by
                  reminding the venerable statesman that the Dutch of Pennsylvania and New York could not be said properly to
                  represent the whole American Union. Order being demanded and restored, Mr.
                  Buckhanan apologised for the grave error, which he charged to the delicious
                  quality of the krout. He seemed unconscious of what he had been saying, and
                  suddenly became aware that he had mistaken his theme, and was letting off the big
                  end of his model speech, with which he had so often entertained his friends at
                  feeds given by sundry Lord Mayors of London. The joke was too good; the old man
                  could not suppress a laugh at his own mistake, and sat down, intimating that as he
                  would have something to say to-morrow he would now bring his speech to a close. (
                     Uproarous
                     Uproarious
                   applause). Again Monsieur Souley rose, and amid shouts of—'question!'
                  said the question was of no kind of consequence, that he always went on the
                  principle of making himself heard. Further attempts to rein up Monsieur Souley
                  would have been sheer madness; so he continued his speech, which included fifty
                  irrelevant topics without discussing one. He even charged Louis Napoleon with
                  poisoning the champagne. Whatever of truth there might be in the charge, we only
                  know that the speaker ere he had concluded his speech found himself standing
                  alone, the whole Congress having dropped off into a profound sleep. Becoming
                  indignant at this display of indifference, he stopped suddenly, commanded the
                  waiters to wake up the sleepers, and himself commenced an uproar by smashing the
                  tumblers and decanters, after the fashion of a French fiddler in for
                  a frolic. The company with one accord offered an apology, joined in drinking the
                  health of the speaker, charged the delinquency to the strength of the poisoned
                  champagne rather than that of the speech—(which was narcotic, rather), and
                  adjourned to meet in Duitenethipicgnisher's Hall, at twelve o'clock on the
                  following morning. I must not omit to inform the reader that those who were unable
                  to see their way up stairs were carried there by the waiters. Smooth, as a matter
                  of course, had no bricks in his hat.
               "'Bright and early on the following morning I tumbled out, made a hasty toilet,
                  and set about waking up the Congress of sleepers. Souley I found in a sad plight;
                  Buck was snoring like great guns; O'Sullivan I thought had either been dreaming of
                  the Pampero expedition, or taken too much whiskey during the delivery of Monsieur
                  Souley's speech; Belmont had made a pillow of his Dutch bonds—indeed the only
                  specimen of humanity up and moving was Corporal Noggs, who expressed his anxiety
                  to know what Marcy would say were he an eye-witness to the preliminaries. As for
                  Pierce! it mattered little what he thought, he being a mere cypher among the 
                     bhoys
                     boys
                  . Having succeeded in moving the Congress we sallied out to view those
                  suburbs so full of historical lore. To our surprise we were surrounded wherever we
                  went by a clamorous and grotesque crowd of discontented individuals, each bearing
                  a document in his or her hand, on which was prominently described the great seal
                  of the United States of America. For a time the mystery involved seemed as
                  undefinable as the jargon of the motley group. Indeed, the whole city seemed not
                  only agog, but panic stricken. Nor was its influence confined to any class. It had
                  delved alike into the palace of the king and cabin of the burgher. Wherever a
                  delegate made his appearance he was sure to he followed or surrounded by a
                  clamorous group, pouring forth its jargon in a rhapsody of praise to America,
                  which singularly enough they supposed had sent the first instalment of her
                  intention to overthrow the dynasties of Europe, and relieve mankind in general.
                  Monsieur Souley, whom they happily mistook for a Greek, was the only member of the
                  Congress exempt from the annoyance.
               "A little more light was soon reflected on the mystery! Saunders had inundated the
                  city—not with his promised bombshells: his missile was more alarming, but less
                  dangerous. Having ingeniously changed the object of a very long epistle, he
                  dedicated it to the French people instead of the Austrian Emperor. The mould of
                  its dictum was decidedly strong; but in order to add more point he gave his
                  periods a peculiar slant, at the head of Napoleon the Third. That a fellow-feeling
                  as lasting as the mountain chain existed between the French and American peoples,
                  there was, according to the circular, not a doubt. In reference to other heads,
                  there were strong doubts! The Congress now assembling was an earnest of what he
                  said: that august body George strongly recommended to the esteem of
                  all aggrieved citizens. Did any one doubt the genuineness or the national character of these
                  epistles he had but to refer to the great seal on their front, which was none
                  other than that of the Legation at London.
               "The reader may now easily imagine our increasing difficulties. On proceeding to
                  the Hall at the appointed time, I found our Ministers in a general state of alarm.
                  Souley had received a private and very confidential letter from his agent in
                  Paris, 
                     forwarning
                     forewarning
                   him of Louis Napoleon's intention to descend 
                     npon
                     upon
                   the Congress, perform a coup-d'-état,
                  and having nicely bagged the game, appropriate it to his own table. In view of
                  this, Monsieur Souley recommended an adjournment to a more congenial atmosphere.
                  Messrs. 
                     Buchhanan
                     Buckhanan
                   and Belmont rising together, objected to any such movement, inasmuch as
                  it would discover a spirit of weakness, to guard against which Uncle Caleb and
                  Master Fourney had given express instructions. Here a long cross-fire of
                  discussion ensued. I thought it had neither head nor tail, and was something after
                  the order of what Mr. Pierce conceived to be the object of this Congress, for it
                  resulted in nothing, the speakers all agreeing to withdraw what they had said. As
                  a first move to the organization of the body, it was agreed that Hanz Voghnine,
                  who was privileged to open a bar for the sale of good liquors in one corner of the
                  hall, would be the only outsider admitted. Hanz was accordingly examined in
                  reference to his being a spy; the result being satisfactory, he was enjoined to
                  keep nothing but a first-rate article. On the second balloting I found myself
                  elected President, which high distinction, having been conducted to the chair
                  amidst soul-stirring acclamations, I acknowledged in what is generally termed a
                  neat and appropriate speech. Noggs was at the first ballot elected
                  Sergeant-at-Arms and door-keeper in general, the duty of which offices he promised
                  to fill to the very best of his abilities. A vagrant-opinion was rife that
                  Monsieur Souley would have filled the office of door-keeper much better, himself
                  being so easily opened and shut. However, as Noggs had been voted the office, we
                  all reconciled ourselves to the selection, each member providing himself with a
                  gin-sling, and taking his seat. A silence, as of the tomb, prevailed, while I rose
                  to open the proceedings of the first day. I first made my own bow, then drew forth
                  the State paper commissioning me to call together 'this august body.'
                  Mr. O'Sullivan suggesting it was agreed that there being out so many documents of
                  a similar character the reading was rendered unnecessary. I bowed to the decision.
                  A similar fate awaited an attempt to read several of Mr. Pierce's private
                  opinions. Mr. Buckhanan said we better hear what Pierce had to say, and then make
                  up our minds as to whether it was entitled to the consideration of 'this important
                  body.' Monsieur Souley replied, with great fervency, that it were better Pierce be
                  left entirely out of the question, and the Congress proceed to deliberate on its
                  own hook. A good many dissenting voices here interposed; but the speaker, very
                  pertinaciously, said he had the floor, and was prepared to discuss the question
                  with any gentleman (here he turned a meaning glance at Buck) disposed to accept
                  the challenge. The dread of a lengthy speech brought gentlemen to their senses:
                  rather than endure it they agreed that Pierce should be left entirely out. It was,
                  now generally expected that Monsieur Souley would sit down. No such intention had
                  he. Turning to me, he bowed, and said: 'Your Excellency will observe, that as the
                  order in which the many 
                     question
                     questions
                   to come before this Congress has not been produced, and the question of
                  the acquisition of Cuba to the United States being the most important one in the
                  schedule, I move that the order be suspended, and that the discussion of that
                  all-important subject be commenced. Souley was inclined, I saw, to absorb time
                  very unprofitably. I was about to pronounce him out of order, when there came a
                  loud knocking at the door, followed by a band attempting to play a Dutch medley.
                  The door was immediately thrown open. Ten citizens, savage and hairy of visage
                  entered, to the consternation of the Congress assembled. One of their number
                  advanced, having exchanged the countersign with Noggs; but he failed to make
                  himself understood until Monsieur Souley politely tendered his aid, introducing
                  him in succession to every one present. They were, according to the rendering of
                  Monsieur, a deputation from the 'Very ancient and honorable order of Red
                     Republicans,' who, having become aware of the many grand objects for
                  which our Congress was convened (as set forth in the circular of the great
                  Saunders), had appeared before it to
                  pray that their grievances might be duly redressed and themselves reinstated in
                  the government of France. Monsieur Souley made a speech of more than ordinary
                  length on the subject, which he brought to a close by calling upon the President
                  (me) not to permit this patriotic body of suffering men to depart without an
                  assurance that their case would receive immediate attention. This I did in the
                  very best manner possible, adding that Hanz might treat them to gin-slings all
                  round. This done, Monsieur politely bowed them into the street, the last bow being
                  his very best. The reader will by this time have discovered that Monsieur Souley
                  constituted the Congress and Mr. Pierce thrown in.
               "Scarcely had the deputation of very ancient and honorable red republicans taken
                  itself into the street, when entrance was demanded by a deputation from 'THE
                  HOPEFUL ORDER OF POLISH EXILES.' The individuals constituting it were lighter of
                  person and complexion than the reds; and, too, there was about them an air of
                  melancholy which at once touched the tender of my feelings. They bore with them a
                  long petition, and humbly but devoutly prayed America to make their cause her own
                  (here they produced several of Saunders' circulars): they asked only to enlist in
                  her bond of brotherhood. Long had they waited the coming of this day—the day when
                  she would invade Europe, and fight the battle of Liberty against despotism. Sweet
                  was the recollection of a fatherland; to them it became sweeter as they
                  contemplated that great star of liberty all powerful in the West. They spoke
                  Scandinavian in silvery accents. Monsieur Souley's genius was for once at fault:
                  he spoke only French, Dutch, and bad Spanish, rendering it necessary to call in
                  the aid of Hanz, who, having rendered it into Dutch, Monsieur did the rest.
                  Dismissing this very distinguished deputation with a positive assurance that their
                  case should be at once referred to the great George Saunders, nothing more was
                  required. 'I would suggest,' spoke Mr. Belmont, rising with great gravity, as the
                  satisfied gentlemen made their last bow at the door, 'whether it be not necessary
                  to close the door against further deputations, it being expedient to proceed with
                  the transaction of more important business?' To this Messrs. Sullivan, Buckhanan,
                  and Souley rose, greatly agitated. Souley said he had the floor, and would not
                  yield an inch. Mr. Buckhanan had only a word to say. Mr. Sullivan gave way.
                  Monsieur Souley said he had great sympathy for all 
                     oppresed
                     oppressed
                   citizens. He could not but characterize such language as had been used
                  by the learned statesman, Mr. Belmont in reference to these very respectable
                  bodies, as contrary to the spirit of our institutions. Mr. Belmont bowed, and left
                  the speaker to indulge his love of speech, which was again interrupted by a
                  terrific thundering at the door, which opened,—not to a deputation, but to a whole
                  platform of rejected humanity, presenting the most grotesque appearance.
                  Falstaff's invincibles would convey no comparison. Some were hatless and shoeless;
                  some had sleeveless coats and tattered trousers: others had collars but no shirts;
                  all had faces immersed in massive beards. Two-and-two abreast, they walked, in
                  with an independent air, each provided with a Saunder's circular, and took up a
                  position in a half-circle just behind the seats of the several members of the
                  Congress. The person who represented them, and who could boast of but one shoe,
                  and one sleeve to his coat, and had a countenance smothered in hair, now
                  approached Monsieur Souley as Monsieur Souley approached him, and both bowed. I
                  ought to have mentioned that this last procession was preceded by one of their
                  number, wheeling a barrow, on which was a monster petition, specifying the fifty
                  thousand grievances they hoped would be redressed by the Congress. Buck, who it
                  was more than suspected looked with suspicion upon the mixture of reds in general,
                  was seen squinting steadily in the faces of the savage-looking intruders, while
                  others could not suppress a laugh at the singular quaintness of the picture they
                  presented. The leader having extended his hand to Monsieur, a consultation ensued,
                  and was continued with innumerable gestures, grimaces, and contortions of the
                  face. The Chair begged to remind gentlemen of the importance of time. The Chair
                  hoped Monsieur Souley would find it convenient to report. That versatile statesman
                  replied,—'He had the honor to inform this august body, that these
                  gentlemen—externally so deficient!—constituted the 'FORLORN ORDER OF
                     Very RED REPUBLICANS.' Here Monsieur turned to the forlorn order,
                  as it, with one accord bowed, in confirmation of what he said. 'Gentlemen!' continued the speaker with a
                  rhetorical flourish, 'you must not judge these men by their exteriors. We have
                  here the rough bark covering the fine tree. Gentlemen! have not these men hearts
                  of oak, nerves of steel, and bone that, like their souls, never breaks in time of
                  need?'
               "The Chair thought it time to interrupt the speaker by inquiring what the forlorn
                  order prayed for? Monsieur Souley resumed. 'Learning from the authority they held
                  in their hands (epistle de la Saunders), what were the true objects of this
                  Congress, they had nobly come forward to tender their services, and to express in
                  person their readiness to take up arms in America's cause. He proposed a vote of
                  thanks for this patriotic manifestation.' This was voted without a dissentient
                  voice, seeing that it cost nothing. The spokesman of the order again held a
                  consultation with Monsieur Souley, the result of which was, that gentleman's
                  making a charitable appeal to the Congress, and concluding by proposing that a
                  contribution be taken in aid of the forlorns. This brought Mr. Belmont suddenly to
                  his feet. He would oppose any such thing. Their difficulties had already increased
                  beyond calculation; and, were this proposition acceded to, it would not only
                  confirm a singular belief outside—that the object of this Congress was the general
                  relief of mankind, but so increase their responsibilities as to render it
                  impossible to proceed with legitimate business. No sane man—much less one
                  accustomed to dealing in coin—could have entertained such an idea. I need scarcely
                  add that the proposition was negatived without a dissenting voice, Monsieur Souley
                  not voting. It was now pretty evident to all present that the Congress would have
                  its time and attention pretty well absorbed in receiving deputations of citizens
                  deluded by Saunders' letters, and listening to the very pathetic speeches of
                  Monsieur. The day was now far gone; the Congress began to feel its appetite; the
                  forlorns withdrew in discontent; the presence of many other deputations
                  surrounding the doors was announced; and the Congress drank all round, and
                  adjourned to meet on the following morning for the dispatch of business. 
               "The 'following morning' came, and with it troubles insurmountable. Scarcely had
                  the Congress resumed its sitting, when an avalanche of deputations was announced,
                  waiting an audience. Monsieur Souley proposed that they be received in their
                  order. Of course I was bound to submit his proposal, but could not suppress a
                  smile. I thought the order would be the most difficult thing to ascertain.
                  However, as we are naturally good-natured, and love to turn the gravest subjects
                  into the lightest jokes, that they be received in their order was agreed to
                  without a dissenting vote. By four o'clock in the afternoon we had received and
                  heard the prayers of all sorts of deputations. There was—'The Ancient Order of
                  Roman Republicans;' the 'Lone Band of Oppressed Brothers;' the 'Universal
                  Brotherhood of Exiled Patriots;' the 'Hopeful Band of Hungarian Refugees;' the
                  'Polish Perpetuators;'—in fact, there came all kinds of orders, and bonds, and
                  leagues, and societies, all with innumerable grievances about they knew not what.
                  There were the oppressed, and very oppressed; the hopeful, and very hopeful; the
                  patriotic, and very patriotic; all praying that their grievances might be
                  redressed. Indeed, they illustrated the fact that Europe was in no want of
                  spirits. Some of these forlorn brothers marched with bands of music, not only
                  keeping the city in a state of general alarm, but seriously disturbing the nervous
                  systems of many very respectable persons, high in office.
               "It was now six o'clock, and as the Congress was hungry, and fatigued with its
                  labors, and Hanz was literally worn out with mixing slings and smashes, I rose to
                  propose we adjourn until to-morrow, seeing there was no time to receive any more
                  deputations; but was interrupted by Noggs, who significantly announced a platoon
                  of soldiery in front of the hall. Monsieur Souley now turned a pale brown color;
                  Belmont was seen looking for a back-door; and Buck's hair changed two shades
                  whiter:—indeed, the alarm that had prevailed in sundry palaces outside seemed to
                  have seized upon our Congress.
               "'A demand from the King!' announced Noggs, with ominous accent. Suddenly a
                  suspicious-looking gent, smothered in dark uniform bespread with a profusion of
                  lace, was ushered in, and with an elastic step, and quick, wandering eye,
                  approached gracefully the President (me) and announced himself as King's
                  Messenger. For a moment he stood uncovered, as if taking a bird's-eye-view of the mental qualities of America; then,
                  raising his right hand, which held a scroll, he extended it to the Chair as Mr.
                  O'Sullivan demanded—'Hats off!' The silence of a minute was then broken by
                  Monsieur Souley, who, having regained his courage, interposed sarcastically,—'a
                  messenger from the King of the Dutch?' The official gave a glance in return, and
                  bowed. A seat was now provided for the stranger, who, as he was about to sit down,
                  intimated that in the event of the terms of his Majesty's proclamation not being
                  complied with, painful as it would be to his feelings, he would, in deference to
                  his orders, be compelled to resort to arms. It was a moment full of painful
                  anxiety: the Chair cast an eye over the document, as every one waited with eager
                  suspense its being read aloud. At length, summoning to my aid all the dignity my
                  composition entertained, I rose as each restless eye denoted hope and anxiety, and
                  said I would read the King's commands, which were to the following effect:—'That
                  whereas sundry evil-disposed persons, not having the fear of God before their
                  eyes, and representing themselves as citizens of the American Republic, have come
                  into this country with ill intent, and have, in defiance of law and order, held
                  sundry meetings for the purpose of conspiring against the peace of the State and
                  safety of the throne; and whereas the said persons herein set forth have, since
                  their landing on our beloved soil, conducted themselves in a manner so riotous as
                  to cause suspicion of their deliberations, be it known to all concerned in this
                  mysterious gathering, that by this my proclamation I forbid the holding of any
                  such assemblies; and further, that unless that now in deliberation be at once
                  dispersed, the persons found engaged in it will be dealt with according to the law
                  made and provided for the punishment of vagrants in general. Signed and sealed
                  with our hands, &c., &c.' Need I say that the reading this proclamation
                  created a wonderful sensation, which was here and there interspersed with marks of
                  contempt for its authority. The Chair, I insinuated, would await any remarks. Mr.
                  Buckhanan immediately rose, and proposed that we bow to the authority, and move to
                  a more congenial atmosphere. Messrs. Souley, Belmont (having come back), and
                  Jackson, rose to oppose. The King's Messenger also rose: seeing the first symptoms
                  of a powerful opposition manifesting itself, he would warn gentlemen of the
                  Congress that it was of no use—they must move on! By way of adding tone to his
                  demand, he intimated that it might be necessary to motion his guard. As things
                  began to look rather squally, I said the Chair would like to say a few words,
                  provided Monsieur Souley did not interrupt, and was perfectly willing to yield the
                  floor. That gentleman firmly declined; adding that he stood upon the order of his
                  reputation, nor would ever yield to Pierce, Marcy, and the King of the Dutch
                  thrown in. He firmly believed it a trick of Marcy's own; he was known to be in
                  league with the Queen of Spain, Louis Napoleon, and the Dutch King, with whom he
                  had compromised the Gibson case. Mr. O'Sullivan, with good logic clothed in very
                  bad English, now rose to the rescue, and was fortunate enough to hit upon the
                  identical expedient by which we all got honorably out of a very bad affair. He
                  proposed (Mr. Souley continued talking) that it being evident to this Congress
                  that insurmountable difficulties of a local character having arisen, thereby
                  impeding the progress of legitimate business; that whereas the oysters are found
                  to be diseased; the gin-and-bitters intolerable; the champagne poisoned by Louis
                  Napoleon; and the sour krout absolutely indigestible, an adjournment is thereby
                  imperatively necessary. In consideration of all the foregoing facts, the speaker
                  moved that this Congress do adjourn to the more congenial atmosphere of
                  Aix-la-Chapelle. The motion was carried with shouts of laughter, and the Congress
                  broke up in the very best humor, leaving Monsieur Souley in possession of the
                  floor. In addition to this, the King's Messenger was carried captive to the first
                  hotel and treated, while Noggs received orders to draw on Sam for all outstanding
                  bills.
               "On the following morning the Congress took up its march for Aix-la-Chapelle,
                  resembling somewhat the children of Israel on their historical pilgrimage. In
                  straggling order did the grotesque train wend its way,—Monsieur Souley mounted on
                  the before-named jackass, which, having so long been accustomed to Monsieur's
                  riding, obstinately refused to be mounted by my friend Buck, who was in
                  consequence seated on boxes 'one, two and three,' which were placed on a Dutch van, and drawn by two
                  more docile donkeys, bringing up the rear. The world knows the rest—that is, with
                  one exception! Buck told me, very confidentially, that the Congress had been fast
                  enough for anything; that Pierce was soft enough to think good would come of it;
                  and that he only put his signature to that remarkable document proclaiming our
                  natural right to Cuba with virtuous reluctance,—merely to keep peace in the
                  house!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               FASHIONABLE DEBTS AND FASHIONABLE DIPLOMATISTS.
               "IN days not altogether halcyon, I had a venerable great-uncle, a quaint specimen
                  of human infirmity, the singularity of the parish. Though eccentric at times, he
                  was not destitute of good qualities. These, had they been properly applied, might
                  have served to distinguish him among men in what is pedantically called the higher
                  walks of life. But he had a fault, and one that is very unpopular even at this
                  day: he would get vexed at the short-comings of his neighbors, at whom he would
                  level truths exceedingly unpalatable. Indeed, he never failed to put very keen
                  edges on his sayings. Even now, I have the old man in my mind's eye, as in the
                  hey-day of youth my boyish fancy sported with his infirmities. Never shall I
                  forget his slender, stooping figure; his bright bald crown, curtained with locks
                  that pended snowy over his coat collar; his weeping, watchful eye; his tottering
                  mien; his high and furrowed brow, lengthening a sharp, corrugated face; his blunt,
                  warty nose, made more striking by a sunken mouth and the working motion of his
                  lower jaw; and his crutch, for he was a cripple. They left a deep impression on my
                  mind. I speak of him as he was in the dawn of his eightieth summer—when pale blue
                  spots bespread his hands, and his bony fingers he would when excited frisk across
                  the polished crown of his head. His great hobby was his knowledge of diplomacy.
                  And, too, he was forever talking about the affairs of the nation, and would not
                  unfrequently get put out with the whole parish, because it withheld from him, he
                  said, that deference his experience was entitled to. He had, many years ago, been
                  in some way attached to the diplomatic corps, which he ever after regarded with a
                  sort of religious awe; and whenever a
                  strange fit came over him he would do something he said was to prop up its
                  dignity, of which none could be more jealous. I have, known him declare, that to
                  maintain untarnished the character of the polite corps, he would swear by its
                  virtue and his crutch. He would not have it held in suspicion by the vulgar world,
                  and would go straight into a fit of sickness at the news of one its members doing
                  aught to sully the fair name he described it as possessing. Sometimes I thought my
                  great-uncle had been attached to some foreign mission in the mean capacity of
                  butler, or footman, for he was scrupulous of his bow, had an excellent taste for
                  wine, and would spend much valuable time in bringing to light and brushing, and
                  then putting carefully away again, certain velvet inexpressibles of great
                  brightness, and richly embroidered waistcoats, of wonderful length. 'These,' he
                  would say with an air of exultation, 'have a mysterious but mighty influence in
                  changing and directing the affairs of powerful nations.' He had also a boyish
                  fondness for displaying a lithograph of the Countess Hopenpap's family arms,
                  presented, he said, by that august lady to the legation, of which he had the honor
                  of being a member, and from thence stolen by Thomas, footman in ordinary to the
                  establishment. For this 
                     henious
                     heinous
                   offence, Thomas, though his knowledge of etiquette was invaluable to the
                  mission (the gentlemen up stairs always fashioned their bows after his!), was
                  discharged, having been detected in the act of offering it for sale at the counter
                  of a dealer in old clothes.
               "On the other hand, there was that about my great-uncle which completely overthrew
                  the suspicion of his having been a kitchen diplomatist: he was an excellent judge
                  of dancing, and what stronger evidence of his forming one of the polite body
                  up-stairs, does the reader want? In addition to this,—he not only discoursed
                  glibly about diplomacy, but sagaciously gave out that he would turn his back to no
                  one in his knowledge of treaties; which said knowledge, and his crutch, he was
                  always ready to swear by. Those great brass buttons with the eagles, and his blue
                  small clothes, too, he wore to the day of his death. The parish had a feeling that
                  no fourth of July could be celebrated without him; and I well remember how on that
                  day I used to think him rather too fond of laying his crutch over the heads of all
                  who differed with him on a question of state policy. My readers will please
                  understand that I have no particular interest in raising the question as to
                  whether my great uncle got his knowledge of diplomacy up-stairs or in the kitchen.
                  The fruits of my research would neither be interesting here, nor serve the object
                  I have in view. Enough is it to know that he would now and then get into a funny
                  vein, and in the outpouring of his child-like enthusiasm, let out some exceedingly
                  rich jokes, touching the manner in which certain gentlemen paid their, to him,
                  most fashionable debts. And, although the old man did at first seem himself to
                  enjoy the recital, he was as sure to end in a great passion. And with every
                  deference to the feelings of certain of Mr. Pierce's gentry, who have so recently
                  figured upon the stage of London and Paris fashionable life, I may add that he
                  would testily declare nothing would so please him as to cudgel every diplomatic
                  dandy that brought disgrace upon his country abroad and left his countrymen to
                  bear the smart. Indeed, he once honestly admitted that foreigners were just
                  foolish enough to look for exponents of our national character among our
                  representatives. If they were not inclined to form the most exalted opinion of it
                  through that test, it was because they never once took into consideration the
                  nature of the accomplishments necessary to our office-holders, at the door of
                  which the blame lay. My great-uncle said that it was not that two or three
                  conducted themselves in a manner unbecoming their positions, but, that,
                  representing us in a national capacity, they saddled the responsibility on their
                  honester fellow-countrymen. This, to me, had something about it I could not
                  clearly understand; but I have since thought that if my eccentric uncle had lived
                  to this day, and been in possession of his crutch, a reckoning with General Pierce
                  had been the result. Either he had made the splinters fly, or that worthy
                  gentleman's ear tingle with certain facts relative to the manner in which his
                  gentry have strutted upon the stage we have before mentioned. I say this of the
                  old man because his regard for the feelings of the nation was almost equal to his
                  reverence for the diplomatic body. And I am sure he, in the earnestness of his
                  soul, had prayed Mr. Pierce to take into his pious consideration the means of remedying an evil so gross as
                  that of his diplomatists making it the fashion of paying their debts with that
                  sacred character the comity of nations has granted all missions. He would have
                  told General Pierce that he was but a man, whose little day would soon pass on the
                  wheel of time, but that the country had a name to maintain among the nations, an
                  exacting posterity to account to! Will his men in the bye-ways have done anything
                  to which it may recur with pride? The stages we have twice named can answer.
               "The story of Mr. Secretary Bolt, as facetiously related by my great-uncle, when
                  in one of his funny moods, may not be inappropriate here, inasmuch as it bears a
                  strong resemblance to certain realities perpetrated at this day, but which my
                  habitual modesty forbids me transcribing here.
               "'Of Bolt, morally,' my great-uncle would say, 'nothing have I to say.' This said,
                  he would rub his hands awhile, and then continue: 'He was correct of
                  person—extremely so—had fine limbs, was tall of stature, courtly in his movements,
                  spoke with great preciseness, and a clear, musical accent; had model features, was
                  not a little vain of them, and always employed a tailor prince, who dressed him
                  with exact taste, but at an enormous cost. His motion, too, was as graceful as
                  needs be; indeed nature had done well her part, lavishing on his person a goodly
                  number of those endowments so necessary to a modern diplomatist, whose chief
                  function is to ornament the drawing-room, and create a flutter among certain of
                  the fair sex. You must understand that in Europe, as well as America, the corps
                  diplomatic rules the roost of fashion, and, in addition to its enrolling within
                  its precious precincts numbers of the legitimate aristocracy, creates a great
                  fluttering among that of a more doubtful hue, who seek it and worship it as the
                  idol of their ambition. It always reminded me of birds with weak minds permitting
                  themselves to be charmed by snakes. However, be this as it may, the knowing ones
                  of York State (Bolt was a three-quarter blood Dutchman, and from that State!)
                  declared it no scandal, when they said his great popularity with the ladies more
                  than made up for his lack of law knowledge. Honester people said, if his mind was
                  not exactly Websterian sterian, there could not be a doubt that nature had
                  intended him for the profession of diplomacy rather than one requiring more
                  profound thought. His make-up was unexceptionable, his smile exquisite. Then he
                  had dark moustaches, which he would gracefully finger into such an exact curve;
                  and he had his small whiskers so neatly combed, and every hair on his head lay in
                  unexceptional smoothness. The legation was not a little proud of Bolt, and on
                  drawing-room days, when he blazed out in his gold lace and sword, would delight in
                  watching the many dark, languishing eyes that would ogle him over the down of
                  gorgeous fans. Bolt was not dead to this admiration, for we learned, from the
                  constant wandering of his eye, that he rather appreciated his own popularity. For
                  a lady to say she did not admire Mr. Secretary Bolt, was strong evidence of her
                  want of taste. I do not choose to enlighten the world as to how Bolt came to be
                  Secretary of Legation!' Here the old man would make a desperate flourish with his
                  crutch, by which I was led to believe that the means were none of the cleanest; in
                  fact that they were of a character very similar to those used at this day, and to
                  which may be traced the cause of certain of Mr. Pierce's diplomatists having so
                  distinguished themselves in Europe. 'Zounds!' the old man would continue, testily
                  making a cross on the floor with his crutch, "a desperate set was soon made on our
                  Bolt by that little world of fashion and intrigue which, lizard-like, crawls about
                  our Legations, and did more particularly so about the one he honored with his
                  handsome person. The Countess of Longblower, very distinguished (according to the
                  gossip of the kitchen), and wife of the celebrated Earl of that name, took him at
                  once into the velvet of her good graces. Here, after a little ripening at the
                  hands of Samuel, the polite footman in ordinary, he shone out the star of her
                  small but wonderfully select firmament. There were suspicious whisperings and some
                  scandal concerning what afterwards took place between my lady and Bolt; but as
                  scandal and diplomacy seemed inseparable to an European atmosphere, we as
                  noiselessly as possible laid the charge at the door of a certain sin.' Here he
                  would fling down his crutch. 'The Countess's carriage was forever at the door,
                  waiting the pleasure of Mr. Secretary Bolt; he had a plate reserved at her table; he was the Adonis of
                  her drawing-room; there was a seat for him in her opera-box. In the front of the
                  latter, facing the stately front of her ladyship, one of her sweetest smiles
                  forced over her hard face, 
                     sate
                     sat
                   the handsome Bolt, now playing with the tassel of her fan, then passing
                  upon the Cavatina a sort of rosewater approval. He had a fund of small talk always
                  at hand, and as her mightiness was extremely fond of such wares, so also did Bolt
                  become a very agreeable person. The Countess, too, would smile so condescendingly,
                  and keep up such a conversation with her eyes, now and then glancing at the Earl,
                  who dozed at a respectful distance in the rear. If unexpectedly he exhibited signs
                  of consciousness, Bolt would immediately divert the subject by passing some
                  facetious criticisms on the rotundity of the primadonna. And then my lady would
                  chime in, having enjoyed her laugh: 'Your lordship never did enjoy anything.' The
                  Earl's nap over, and the last act near its close (her highness never condescended
                  to remain for the vulgar ballet, and generally retired at the close of the fourth
                  act), our hero would tenderly arrange her satin, make himself so polite! and then
                  she took his arm so condescendingly, and exchanged the sweetest glances! How often
                  I pitied the poor Earl, as in the mightiness of his gravity he would bring up the
                  rear, bearing her ladyship's perfumed cambric. Several times a tingle of wrath
                  came over me, and I could not resist the thought, that had I been in the place of
                  the poor Earl when my lady hung so rolickingly on the arm of Secretary Bolt, and
                  sailed with such an affected youthfulness through the grand hall, to the no small
                  danger of all muslin dresses in the way, my crutch had served as a means to
                  separate them.' The old man, with weeping eyes, would now finger his bandanna and
                  resume his crutch. And then Samuel, in the full blaze of his livery, would stand
                  conspicuously at the grand entrance, and ere her highness's head loomed out at the
                  top of the great stairs, announced her coming in a voice that seemed to strike
                  dismay into all unliveried bystanders.'
               One thing Secretary Bolt would, do that always displeased me, as did everything
                  that tended to lower the dignity of the corps. It was this:—My lady loved dearly
                  her drives in the park, and took them nearly every day, at the most fashionable
                  hour of five. Bolt, in cloth exquisite, had always his seat at her side, where his
                  special office seemed that of nursing her favorite poodle and smoothing the Earl,
                  who on the front seat sat with icy straightness, all over with cheap compliments.
                  This was all very fine as far as it went! Being proud of Bolt, as I have before
                  related, we generously overlooked in him those errors which are rather the result
                  of vanity than the natural offspring of an imperfect education. But we, as a
                  nation have a worthy aversion to paying a dear price for the maintenance of
                  dignity; hence Bolt, whose salary was but a paltry pittance in an atmosphere of
                  singular extravagance, soon found himself becoming involved for the 
                     adjunts
                     adjuncts
                   necessary to such a connection. A happy thought, however, soon flashed
                  across his mind: was he not protected by the sacred character of the mission? Of
                  course he was!—away all misgivings! What was the contemplation of such dreary
                  matter to the pleasing recollection of those fair ones whose hearts he had made
                  flutter! And then, not a day passed but he received no end of pretty missives,
                  perfumed and enveloped with curiously wrought lace, and virtuous satin,—all
                  bearing the tenderest burdens of love and despair. Bolt was indeed fairly set upon
                  by rival candidates for his heart, which was supposed to possess a large portion
                  of susceptibility. Nor were his admirers merely confined to the satin and velvet
                  of the aristocracy, for 'pretty Betty,' maid of all work to the Legation, and on
                  that account so vain of the honor that she would not condescend to associate with
                  servants not attached to the corps, was by Thomas, a wonderfully sagacious
                  footman, discovered to be the writer of an highly scented missive, directed as an
                  arrow at the heart of Bolt. That this little shaft of the tender passion contained
                  some truly original lines the enlightened cannot doubt; and I think I may assert
                  without fear of contradiction that Betty did in these lines, notwithstanding they
                  evinced a sovereign contempt for orthography and versification, discover a deep
                  knowledge of diplomacy. I say this for the reason that her diction could be
                  construed to mean anything but what she intended; albeit there was such an
                  openness about it generally that any clever gentleman might walk in at the back
                  door. I thought it highly creditable in Betty to attempt a thing so mighty as the conquest of
                  Bolt's heart—indeed there was an admirable heroism about it; but it caused a great
                  flutter in the kitchen, where the sensitive Thomas brought forward a motion for
                  her extradition. Thomas would not for the world have the character of gentlemen up
                  stairs sullied by vulgar hands.
               "'Bolt had scarcely reached the full blaze of his glory when a series of material
                  obligations truly alarming commenced; and as I then regretted the manner in which
                  he discharged them, so am I now less ashamed to relate them than sorry for their
                  existence on the page of the past. As nearly all Bolt's acquaintances had
                  carriages, it seemed imperative on him to follow their example, which he was not
                  long in doing. And this item of expense necessarily entailed that of two very
                  worthy gentlemen—viz.: Mr. Fripp the coachman, and Mr. Still the footman—without
                  whom no turn-out can be considered complete. Well, these worthy personages were
                  put in possession of the carriage, but scarcely a week had passed before a great
                  deficiency was discovered. Messrs. Fripp and Still had acted in similar capacities
                  to my Lady Brackenbridge, and now declared it beneath their dignity to remain in a
                  service not honored with livery. They laid their grievance before Bolt, who,
                  appreciating the deficiency, forthwith ordered the requisite plush and cockades,
                  to the no small joy of those worthies. If you ask me the cost of these adjuncts so
                  necessary to a very fine gentleman, my answer is that I 
                     annot
                     cannot
                   enlighten you; and this for the very reason, that the cost of an article
                  depends very much on the manner in which you pay for it.'
               "As my great-uncle said this he would grasp tighter his crutch and look wrathfully
                  about the room for a seat. 'Bolt!' he would continue, having adjusted his shabby
                  drab hat, 'soon learned that in Europe tradesmen are exceedingly impressible, and
                  notwithstanding they are held in utter contempt by the fine gentlemen of the
                  diplomatic world, will be their humble servant to any amount, asking no other
                  security than the, to them, immaculate character of the mission. I do not mean to
                  say that Bolt made such 
                     facilties
                     facilities
                   a study; nor would I be understood as casting a sneer at the diplomatic
                  body in general, but when modern instances prove notorious facts, how can I turn a
                  deaf ear to the belief that our diplomacy has embodied another function?—that of
                  practising the most fashionable way of paying the most fashionable debts. Pardon
                  this little digression. There was a never ending demand for Bolt's custom. Mr.
                  Peppers, the distinguished jeweller of Regent street, would fill his order to any
                  amount; Broadwood & Willow, tailors in ordinary to Her Majesty, always had a
                  newly arrived fashion, the senior partner knew his honor would be pleased with;
                  Dole, the wine merchant, who counted his customers among the first nobility of the
                  land, sent a list of his very best importation, humbly soliciting an order. And as
                  Mr. Secretary Bolt had not the least objection to being driven into dignity, he
                  would order all sorts of things, from a diamond bracelet down to a tin tea-pot for
                  Mrs. Loveleather the laundress. It was wonderful to see how credulous these
                  tradesmen gentry were, and how they would chuckle over an order from one of the
                  legation. But I must here say that Bolt found a clever diplomatist in Thomas, who
                  was one of the best brought up servants in Picadilly. Thomas had no end of
                  accomplishments, and as a certain vice in a servant is necessary to certain poor
                  aristocracy and deeply involved diplomatists, so also could he lie with a 
                     facilty
                     facility
                   truly incredible. If the history of Bolt's wealth, as related to certain
                  tradesmen by Thomas, could be handed down to posterity, I fear my friend Cresus
                  would find himself eclipsed. This it must be borne in mind was before Thomas found
                  himself dismissed for purloining the family arms of the Countess Hopenpop. And
                  while on the subject of purloining propensities let me here say that I fear the
                  vice of stealing family arms did not end with Thomas, but was transmitted by some
                  of his more fortunate brethren up stairs to certain diplomatic gentry of Mr.
                  Pierce's choice, else how comes it that they, notoriously plebian, made cockades
                  and carriage doors bear strange devices.'
               "My uncle continued: 'While as many as fifty good gossipers predicted daily the
                  marriage of Bolt to some aristocratic belle, there came along a lady of the name
                  of Mrs. Bolt. This person, whose name Mr. Bolt had been extremely careful not to
                  lisp, caused a desperate sensation among his admirers. My Lady Longblower was seen
                  to cool away like liquid tallow, while not a few who had been equally fervent just
                  before, said it was a very impertinent
                  tinent thing in Mr. Bolt. But as that gentleman took a more philosophical view of
                  the matter he returned the compliment by introducing his lady to several of those
                  damsels who had but a few days before themselves hoped to win his heart. Indeed
                  the arrival of Mrs. Bolt, though it brought things to a more legitimate platform,
                  did not in the least lessen his material responsibilities. Mrs. Bolt must have
                  more fashionable apartments; there was that splendid diamond bracelet at Peppers'?
                  she must have that rich honitan cape and accompaniments at Stebbin's? drawing-room
                  day was approaching, and nothing less than one hundred and fifty guineas would
                  suffice to purchase the dress she would be presented in; Madame Lacelooper,
                  milliner and dressmaker to the Court, urged the necessity of her orders being in
                  at an early day; and she must have that set of furs at Orchard's, and Mr. Bolt
                  must give a brilliant introduction party. Many as were the poor fellow's previous
                  wants Mrs. Bolt's arrival seemed to increase them four-fold. Nor would it have
                  done for him to have intimated a necessity for retrenchment, inasmuch as she was
                  equally determined to keep up the dignity of the establishment, and would not hear
                  a word about limitation in anything. The poor fellow now began to think a time was
                  coming when his diplomacy would be put to the test. He, too, had an eye to a
                  little popularity at home, liked to be thought well of by his fellow-citizens,
                  who, when abroad invariably want to see all the sights and dine with
                     their Minister, and to that end gave them dinners and sundry other
                  little things. Everything except his salary Bolt found enlarged, and as his time
                  had been principally taken up with the issuing of orders, so was it thereafter to
                  be arranging certain payments. Isaacs, the Hebrew gentleman who took corners of
                  advance checks for the convenience of his very aristocratic friends was seen
                  frequently about the premises, looking very serious. Six months passed and
                  circumstances were changed with Bolt. The Countess Longblower no longer permitted
                  him to sit at her side and play with the poodle; his fair admirers had lost all
                  their compliments; and it became absolutely necessary that Mrs. Bolt return to the
                  more humble precincts of her home on the other side of the water. When Peppers
                  called for that trifle of ninety-seven guineas—pay for that necklace that shone so
                  about Mrs. Bolt's neck when at Court—it was curious to see how the genius of Mr.
                  Bolt would come out; and how in conjunction with Thomas' sagacity quite a comedy
                  of sharps would be played. Thomas tended door, was rather sleepy of countenance,
                  but could assume an air of great consequence, and would receive his importuning
                  visitor with unexceptional bows. 'Peppers I think you said?' Thomas would politely
                  inquire, smoothing his chin reflectively, giving his ear a knowing cant, and
                  concluding by whisking his fingers through his powdered hair. 'Mr. Peppers
                  presents a little affair this morning;' he would announce blandly, having left the
                  gentleman standing in the hall. Mr. Bolt, who occupied a sumptuous arm-chair in
                  the parlor, and generally sat reading leisurely the Morning Post, would receive
                  this announcement with some change of countenance. 'Peppers! Peppers!' he would
                  reiterate, Thomas watching his every movement. 'Blast the fellow—he's a perfect
                  torment'—Thomas would interrupt by inquiring if he should bow the individual out.
                  'Say, Thomas,' he would rejoin, 'that we are engaged to-day studying treaties and
                  cannot be disturbed—that he must call at a future day.' Mr. Bolt would with great
                  complacency, turn to a more comfortable position in his great chair. Thomas always
                  executed his mission with great skill, informing the unfortunate individual that a
                  little misunderstanding having broken out between the two nations,
                  the Legation was extremely busy in the study of treaties, and could not be
                  disturbed. Having digested this piece of information rather doggedly, Mr. Thomas
                  would politely bow the gentleman into the street, watching his departure through
                  the side lights. Another time, when Broadwood called for that trifle, having a
                  deal of ready money to make up, it was despatch day; and upon the same principle
                  despatch day came so often that people began to think the Great Republic engaged
                  in one eternal controversy with the nations of Europe. Bolt never could be seen on
                  despatch days. The man with the bill for the tin-teapot was alike unsuccessful;
                  the gentlemen up-stairs walled themselves up in despatch days, while Thomas
                  politely bowed out all-importuners. They were a scurvy lot, and might have known
                  better! Mr. Bolt thought, as he
                  contemplated the sacred character of the mission. I well remember how I laughed
                  once, when Madame Lacelooper's man of business drove Mr. Secretary Bolt, as I
                  thought, into close quarters. Thomas, in order to somewhat diversify his
                  apologies, had three different times satisfied this person by informing him that
                  the gentlemen of the Legation were in consultation with the Prime Minister; but
                  this time he was determined to see for himself, and regardless of Thomas'
                  assurance pushed his way into the presence of Mr. Bolt, who I need scarcely add
                  was extremely put out. 'I ask your honor's pardon' spoke the man; 'you always
                  come,' petulantly interrupted our hero, when we are in a uproar.' The man replied
                  with a bow, that it was the first time he had gained an audience. He came from
                  Madame Lacelooper's, and would be extremely glad if Mr. Bolt could make it
                  convenient to discharge that little account, which had stood over for some time.
                  It was only two hundred and fourteen pounds, he said, in reply to a question from
                  Mr. Bolt, who encouragingly took the missive from his hand. 'Thank you—thank you!'
                  the man continued, evidently encouraged as our hero cast his eye over the long
                  list of items, so neatly carried out with heavy numbers of pounds, shillings, and
                  pence. 'Rather heavy;' sighed the astonished Secretary. I suppose you have orders
                  for all these little affairs?' The man replied that he would have them forthcoming
                  if necessary—that Madame Lacelooper's was one of the most respectable
                  establishments. With a gracious bow, reaching his hand for a book which the
                  expectant gentleman mistook for a bank-book, Mr. Bolt replied that it was on that
                  account he gave it his patronage. The gentleman thanked him for the honor, and
                  hoped he would continue his favors. And while this little episode was performing
                  in the great parlour, Mr. Thomas was exercising his skill in diplomacy at the
                  door—informing gentlemen that Mr. Bolt was engaged over important State affairs,
                  and politely bowing them out.'
               "'Then Mr. Bolt having worked the gentleman's anxiety up to the highest pitch,
                  would take up his great gold pen, and on a piece of whitest paper, figure, and
                  figure, and figure, multiply and subtract, contort his face and nervously frisk
                  his fingers through his curly black hair. It was all to no purpose, however he
                  could not twist the plaguy figures into a favorable balance. In fact the balance,
                  despite all his diplomacy, would get on the wrong page. At length, having
                  exhausted patience and found language to adapt himself to circumstances, with
                  great blandness of manner he would beg the gentleman, convey his compliments to
                  Madame Lacelooper, and say that her little matter will be discharged at a future
                  day. His balance, he was surprised to find, did not enable him to meet it today;
                  and he further regretted that a very disagreeable affair having sprung up between
                  the Emperor of the French and his government, requiring for a few days all the
                  attention of the establishment, deprived him of the opportunity of repairing to
                  his banker's for the purpose of enlarging his deposit. Ordering an attendant to
                  bring in the treaties of 1812, he added how sorry he was to give Madame
                  Lacelooper, for whom he entertained the highest regard, so much trouble. Legations
                  were peculiarly situated at times, he said. In reply to an intimation from the
                  gentleman in waiting, he said, gentlemen of the diplomatic corps never paid in
                  piecemeal. Here Thomas would put an end to the comedy by announcing the arrival of
                  the 'Minister for Foreign Affairs,' and politely bowing out the
                  retiring gentleman, who, you may well imagine, maintained a reluctant gravity.
                  There was no end of these little diplomatic comediettas, while Bolt honored the
                  mission with his presence, ending in what was long afterwards esteemed a capital
                  joke, which, though somewhat against my feelings, I will confidentially relate.
                  Bolt had named a certain day when all his little affairs would positively be
                  arranged, and this dawned of a calm and sunny autumn morning, when everything
                  about the Legation seemed to repose in peace and quietness—when wars and obdurate
                  creditors were forgotten, and we plumed ourselves on the happy issue of several
                  important international questions. One very important member of the corps,
                  however, seemed to have something of great importance evolving in his mind; this
                  was the sagacious Thomas, who paced the hall with more than ordinary
                  superciliousness, now and then arranging his livery in the mirror. About eleven
                  o'clock there came a great gathering of serious-looking individuals at the hall
                  door; among them the quick eye of
                  Thomas discovered the following very respectable gentlemen, viz.:—Broadwood, of
                  the firm of Broadwood & Willow; Dole, the distinguished wine merchant; Staple,
                  the bootmaker; Madame Lacelooper's man of business; and Peppers, the jeweller. The
                  opening of the door was succeeded by a great rush. Having expressed some surprise
                  at their mistake in calling so early, Thomas received his visitors with his
                  customary equanimity, and begged to remind them that three o'clock was the hour
                  appointed for the interview between themselves and Mr. Bolt. Here he threw a sly
                  wink at Peppers, which that gentleman rendered into an intimation to remain, while
                  he politely bowed the remainder out. 'Wonderful assurance, these fellows have,'
                  said Thomas, turning to Peppers, who began to think he was all right,
                  'they won't learn etiquette.' As he concluded he turned to have a view through the
                  side-light at his friends outside, who hung contemplatively about the door, then
                  addressing the inside gentleman—'Peppers, I think you said?' he continued, working
                  his lips and smoothing his chin with the fingers of his right hand. That gentleman
                  bowed affirmatively as Thomas advanced a few steps toward the parlor door, and
                  then hesitated, as if in a deep study. 'Peppers, Peppers, Peppers!' he accented
                  somewhat curiously, until the creditor had well nigh lost his patience in
                  suspense. 'I beg your pardon, sir!' (Thomas faced about with an entirely altered
                  face), but, may I, ah!—hem,—you see; there is a small affair in the way, Mr.
                  Peppers. The truth is, Mr. Bolt has ceased his connection with this
                  establishment.'
               "'I must see him, nevertheless,' replied the obdurate creditor, permitting his
                  suspicions to get the better of his judgment. 'If you do,' rejoined Thomas,
                  bowing, 'you may have a longer drive than is agreeable at this season of the
                  year.'
               "You don't mean to tell me that he has left?' demanded Peppers, stamping his foot,
                  and allowing himself to become generally excited. 'Now, my friend,' Thomas replied
                  in the coolness of his nature, making a motion to open the street door, 'just take
                  the matter like a philosopher; don't let such little affairs trouble a man of your
                  standing. The fact is, between the sundown of one day, and rosy dawn of another,
                  our gallant Secretary just stepped out—that is, Mr. Bolt has bolted!' Thomas bowed
                  him politely out, and I leave you to judge how many indignant threats were thrown
                  out by Peppers, and what occurred when he related the climax to his
                  fellow-creditors, who having a suspicion that all was not right, waited his
                  appearance among them at the corner of an adjacent street, against the lamp-post
                  of which they entered a protest deep and solemn. My great-uncle having concluded
                  his story, adjusted his crutch, wiped his weeping eyes, relieved his hoarseness
                  with a small quantity of temperance bitters, and limped away.

               CHAPTER XXII.
               HOW SMOOTH GOT HIS MANNERS.
               "READERS, and fellow citizens of these United States in general! know ye, that I,
                  Solomon Smooth, in the first person singular, as Uncle Sam Houston used to say,
                  being worn out with the fatigues of the Ostend-Aix-la-Chapelle Congress, crossed
                  the Atlantic in two steamships—wanted to do both a good turn—got busted up by
                  neither—and at last found myself calmly luxuriating in the velvet and damask of
                  the 'White House.' By way of keeping up the spirit of Young America, I knocked
                  down all the attendants, stalked in like an independent citizen who felt he was
                  part owner of the establishment, spread myself upon the softest sofa, and demanded
                  the flunkey, who stood trembling in the doorway, to bring me a Turkey ottoman, on
                  which to advantageously take the measure of my extremes. Believe me, Sam, I went
                  it in the way of comforts. The flunkey shook his head, and kept up a significant
                  silence. This was rather too much for the patience of any respectable gentleman;
                  and being aware that the Gineral had not larned him proper manners, I got up and
                  brought it myself. Nor yet did it seem just the thing—something was wanting to
                  complete the free-and-easy, to which end I pulled out a real Havana regalia, and
                  puffed away so comfortably. Then I ordered the flunkey, whose hair was seen
                  stiffening on his head with fright, to bring me a spittoon—felt sorry I neglected
                  to import one from some of our European Legations!—or I'd hurl the liquid every
                  which way—perhaps storm his high-colored Persian rugs! I was about to lay off in
                  the very bliss of comfort, when Pierce, followed by his black pig, came laraping
                  into the room, looking as amiable and undecided as ever. 'Smooth,' he exclaimed,
                  greeting me with a heartiness of hand little expected, 'I am so glad to see you
                  home once more! Here he suddenly paused, gave out ominous looks, lowered his voice
                  to a whisper, and continued: 'In the name of forgiveness, where did you contract
                  such manners?' A little cold sweat bespread his brow just then. 'Upon the faith of
                  my high position,' he continued, 'I thought my sending you to Europe would have
                  proved a polishing machine, and prepared you for shining in society.'
               "'Mr. Smooth,' I modestly returned, 'would prefer the General sat down and calmly
                  listen to how he came by his pretty manners. Somebody has said, a man was known by
                  the society he keeps. Be this as it may, General, I don't come here to cast a
                  single reflection on you; nor would I proclaim to the fellow 
                     citzens
                     citizens
                   of these United States that you are in any wise accountable for what I
                  am going to say and disclose.' The General, somewhat struck by my demeanor, took a
                  seat, nervously, and applied his ear, while I extinguished the cigar, and
                  commenced summoning my thoughts. 'Having no manners when I left home, General, I
                  naturally depended for them upon those whom my mission brought me in contact with.
                  Now, General!—and this I would were held strictly confidential between
                  ourselves—when I got on the other side of the water, (here I gave him a touch he
                  understood), being your Minister in General I naturally fell in and associated
                  with your Ministers in particular; and such a lot they were! I couldn't trust my
                  virtue in the company of one of them: albeit, in their company, you were sure not
                  to get into decent society. Foreign victims of misgovernment had long viewed
                  America as a land from whence came the plain unostentatious gentleman of sense.
                  How sad to think that they had of late been so grievously disappointed! They are
                  only men of coarse manners, and low of bringing up, assuming the democrat, while
                  aping the snobism of the aristocrat. General, they are of your own selecting; and,
                  mark me, I only name it here out of sincere regard for you, not expecting it to
                  get abroad. In fact, General, the people of Europe find they have been deluded.
                  They see us affecting contempt for the very fooleries we seek to imitate; they see
                  these, your chosen, playing the coarse ruffian to the end. To the foreign mind
                  Americans are America—to its chosen they look for the embodiment of its
                  institutions It cannot comprehend that the mongrel-mixture you have sent abroad constitute the
                  very essence of that ill opinion gained of us by misrepresentation. This, General,
                  is strictly private—only intended for your own good. It were folly to look for
                  pretty manners in me after my connection with your chosen on the continent of
                  Europe! In London I found things all in a fuddle,—the head of the house having
                  dwindled into obscurity, while the juniors had been in all sorts of business but
                  that for which they had been paid and sent to discharge; indeed, the revolutionary
                  business, into which members of the house had largely entered, had brought it into
                  all sorts of difficulties and disgraces. Again it was currently reported that, for
                  being too deeply engaged in the affairs of others, two of the smaller
                  functionaries had found themselves locked up in a police-station, and only
                  unlocked themselves with that protection which the sacred character of the mission
                  is supposed to grant:—in fact, General, and I advance the intimation for your own
                  good, the only thing in real good order was the smoking and spitting department.
                  In Paris the house was a dead lock, inasmuch as the head couldn't understand a
                  word the French said, either about himself or his government; while the retinue
                  were all familiarly known at the cafés. In
                  Madrid, the head of the house, not having the value of discretion before his eyes,
                  had fuzzled away all his influence, having fought sundry duels, written himself
                  down an ass in controversy with editors, and failed in his proposal to build up a
                  young republic on the ruins of an old and dissolute monarchy. Forcibly as the
                  truth may depict our singular misrepresentation abroad, we cannot forbear to say,
                  that, so far did this very French-American representative carry his fighting
                  proclivities, that a single instance of their being excelled—our fighting London
                  Secretary, who had challenged a score of very aged gentlemen (and had been equally
                  courageous were they double the age!) without finding a single one to accept—could
                  not be found. At the Hague, the very respectable Hebrew gentleman, who conducted
                  the affairs of the house, had opened a barber-shop, where needy gentlemen could be
                  shaved ad libitum—provided always they brought a
                  certain description of notes, nor were dainty about how much were taken off the
                  corner. The house at Lisbon, report said, had got into very orderly disorder,
                  which was not in accordance with the character of the very respectable Irish
                  gentleman who kept it, and who could absorb whiskey and tobacco with any other
                  respectable gentleman from Kilkenny. To the denizens, among whom he had made an
                  extensive acquaintance, his being an American and speaking such very good Irish
                  and bad English was a perfect mystery. You may be sure he likes well his
                  situation, and finds the duties of a Minister Extraordinary much preferable to
                  leading the retreat of a pampero expedition.'
                  Here the General significantly opened one eye and shut the other: 'Only telling
                  you this for your own good' I watched him anxiously as he grasped me by the hand,
                  and replied: 'Smooth! the boldest stroke in my administration does not please me
                  so much as sending you Minister in General to Europe. But can half you say be
                  true?'
               "'True?' I rejoined—'too true for delicate ears! General, you may accept my word
                  when I say it is not so much the public duties as the private affairs of men you
                  have got to keep a close eye upon; when the private affairs of public men get
                  astray the public suffers: this is borne out in the result of your having
                  appointed foreign gentlemen to misrepresent us abroad. Your house at Turin is
                  fashionable, but sorely scandalized; the people there love the fair,
                  but expect fairer things of Americans. Your son of Moses, who plays so well his
                  part at Alexandria, is a bird vain of his feather, and may to-day be seen carried
                  through the streets in something resembling a clothes-basket, and to-morrow in the
                  market purchasing Nubian slaves fair to look upon. These things may be necessary
                  to a very fine gentleman in Alexandria; but the being who performs them at the
                  expense of his country well earns the pity of its people. And while I am on this
                  theme, General, I cannot in justice pass over one whom I say in all seriousness
                  has, when contrasted with others, won for himself immortal honors; I mean our
                  worthy representative at St. Petersburg, who understanding no language but his
                  own, and that very imperfectly, has the great good sense to say nothing, seclude
                  himself from the society of the Czar, and seek only the enjoyment of his own
                  melancholy contemplations. Now General; however much you may esteem the doings of
                  your chosen, there is in Europe but one opinion of their manners; and that opinion
                  being, I regret to say, not the very
                  highest, will for some time to come measure our influence at sundry Courts. I got
                  my manners, General, by mixing with your chosen!' The General here drew a long
                  breath, said dinner was almost ready; would I not change the subject, and talk
                  about the war business, and such things."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               MR. SMOOTH PROPOSES TAKING MR. PIERCE'S FIGHTING BY THE JOB.
               "MR. SMOOTH, a young man of the fast school, has been calculating, during his tour
                  in Europe, the saving it would be to nations if they would but let their wars out
                  by the job to some enterprising fellow-citizen. He reckons, in a funny sort of
                  way, he would then pay just in accordance to the amount and quality of thrashing
                  it were necessary to inflict upon the enemy. That it would divest war of its
                  glories, and ambitious men of their zeal, he never had a doubt. War taken by the
                  job, at a given sum for thrashing the enemy right soundly, would resolve itself
                  into a mere trading commodity, fit only to be dabbled in by shopkeepers and
                  stockbrokers. By this turn in national affairs, Kings and Czars might curtail
                  their ambition, and their devoted subjects, being paid to fight by the lump, would
                  hurry through their contract. General Pierce, too, would find it decidedly more
                  convenient, inasmuch as it would save his benevolent people the trouble of
                  inflicting that most unwarrantable rebuke—sending bread to the hungry people at
                  Greytown he has made homeless with his bombshells. Smooth leans no disrespect to
                  Mr. President Pierce, who, since his wondrous victory over the Mosquitoes, has
                  disappointed the world by demonstrating the singular fact that he has a gunpowder
                  policy, which he developes when he can find objects sufficiently small for his
                  purposes. Heretofore, Smooth had got an idea in his head (crosswise he admits),
                  that if Mr. President Pierce had anything assimilating to a policy, it must be
                  like his grandmother's hard cider—the longer it remained exposed the flatter it
                  became. That this was an egregious mistake, is fully proven to a mistaken world by
                  the dauntless and immortal Admiral Hollins (he should be promoted to the rank), who, to give positive evidence
                  of the size of his master's spirit, just battered down a defenseless town or two.
                  It may turn out that the bombshelling was only to practice a little in that sort
                  of gunnery, and that using up the property of American citizens to illustrate the
                  war principles of Uncle Sam was merely an evidence of spunk in Mr. Pierce, who
                  expected his people to knock under.
               "Smooth has been at the White House, seeing Mr. Pierce, and cautioning him about
                  the look of things abroad, lest they get kind of snarled up.
               "Being a genuine New Englander, with real Puritanic blood in his composition,
                  Smooth considered himself a good sort of man,—rather a desirable neighbor,
                  conscientious, extremely disinterested, and always ready to do a bit of a good
                  turn, never forgetting number one. Smooth was just going to ask the Gineral if
                  this was not so, when he smiled so free and easy that it settled the point
                  shorter.
               "'Now, Smooth, you've seen a good deal, I reckon, and must be a man of profound
                  opinions: tell us, are we going to get fuzzled up in the breakers on the other
                  side of the big pond?' inquired the Gineral, looking so serious that Smooth made
                  it a point to get his ideas squared up.
               "Somethin for us citizens to have a go-in-at, you means, I s'pose?'
               "'Yes!' replied the Gineral.
               Smooth reckoned 'twas best to have an understanding about how much he was going to
                  get from Uncle Sam's chink-locker for doing the thrashing for these United States
                  afore he said much about what was going on in the world. Uncle Sam was a good old
                  soul, and, seeing that he did not keep the best cash account in the world, Smooth
                  had no objection to entering into the tin business with him, now that
                  he had a large stock on hand. Smooth, however, must make one single proviso, and
                  that is, that he be always permitted to work out the p's and q's of his own
                  demands.
               "'Ah!' replied the Gineral, good-naturedly; 'Smooth, you're a sharp fellow, with
                  gumption enough to see through a thing or two; but remember, if we contract for
                  the licking, with some enterprising individual, we must pay by measurement.
                  There's the democracy to please, the country to satisfy, Young America to provide
                  with clean shirts! I thought my gallant fellow Hollins would have done that when I
                  sent him to let strip at the Greytowners; but, as the result was
                  different, a body can't always tell how such things 'll turn, I now think of
                  letting him out to the Emperor of Russia, who having granted him means of
                  developing his fighting capacity, by investing him with full power to thrash the
                  allied fleets of England and France, would not hesitate to pay a large amount of
                  revenue into the treasury of these United States for his daring services. But you
                  see, Smooth, my government is merely an experiment, which may or may not please,
                  and in this sense your experience will be extremely valuable.'
               "Smooth saw Mr. President Pierce wanted experience; but, at the same time, he was
                  fearful the General would get the points, and out-general him. However, as it was
                  always better to have confidence in each other when pursuing a political question,
                  and knowing the General to be a sort of clever fellow, ready to do almost
                  anything, he entered upon the decyphering. There was the S. S. S. (Sickles,
                  Souley, and Saunders) Company, doing a slap-up business in Europe! He must have
                  them thrown in. While the head of the firm was generously lending a hand to turn
                  mother monarchy out of doors, and the in-door partner was making sad use of the
                  stock in trade (which consisted of a very large supply of letter-writing material,
                  only to be used for disseminating republican principles), the junior of the house,
                  taking advantage of the opportune moment, thought it quite in keeping with the
                  spirit of the times to make a spec on his own account; and to that end the said
                  junior partner (not the least sagacious of the three), with a bill of sale of Cuba
                  in his pocket, had just stepped over to Washington to consummate the purchase, and
                  revel awhile in the damask of the White House. Borland, finding no more
                  congressional faces to smash in Washington—from which city it was considered
                  General Pierce had removed an intolerable perplexity by sending him to foreign
                  parts—had been recompensed by the smashing of his own, in Central America, where
                  he had raised a tolerable sort of a breeze. He, too, must be thrown in. Seymour,
                  the blue-stocking governor, of whom so much was expected, and whose mission to the
                  god of all the Rushas, American statesmen looked upon with great anxiety, it was currently reported had
                  burrowed in a snow-bank somewhere in the interior of the amiable Czar's vast
                  dominions, not one word having been heard of him for the last nine months. That he
                  had not lent material aid to the fighting Cossack, was a source of grievous
                  dissatisfaction to Young America.'
               "Smooth spread all these things out before the Gineral, just as clear as water. To
                  get Cuba—which was not just ready to hook on—and St. Domingo, that it would take
                  some nice diplomacy to make consider the annexation question, and a few slices
                  more of Mexico, ready to make fast any moment; the Sandwich Islands, yearning to
                  get in; Central America, hardly worth taking in, but nevertheless acceptable, on
                  the ground of carrying out the universal plan, and Canada only requiring a little
                  more coaxing, Smooth thought the cost could be reckoned down to a close figure.
                  But there was Uncle Johnny, and his newly-coined friend Louis Napoleon, to be kept
                  shy while all this was going on; and just there the plague and expense of the
                  thing hung. However, Smooth scratched his head, and made up his mind to enter into
                  a bargain to do the licking at a fair showing, cash down. As to the brush between
                  Nicholas and his neighbor—unhappy wretches; one always wanting to steal the bits
                  of stray territory—Smooth found it painful to keep his fingers out; but there was
                  this to be taken into consideration: the getting his fingers in might be the
                  getting out of his commerce, which said commerce was the model machine of the
                  Model Republic's power.
               "Mr. President Pierce fully believed that Nicholas of all the Rushas had got his
                  eye set to the East, notwithstanding he had quite enough to do in the West; and,
                  though he declared himself moved only by christian visions, it seemed curious
                  enough that he had not the slightest objection to raising most un-christian wars.
                  Nicholas was shrewder than a Connecticut tin pedlar, and more ambitious than a
                  South Carolina politician, who, ever and anon, is ready to war with the
                  Britishers, because the fools obstinately refused to admire slavery.
                  Nicholas had got himself into an interminable fix. Mr. Pierce, merely to please
                  the youthful democracy, would like to lend Nick a hand to unfix himself, but the
                  hitherto dormant power of the nation quickens to action, and says, 'It won't do,
                  Mr. General Pierce!' Forced to submit, the General consoles himself with the fact
                  that his friend Nicholas will draw himself into his invulnerable shell, sing the
                     Te Deums, and trust the fate of war, for a
                  dozen years or so, to the All-wise Father.
               "'Now, Gineral,' said Smooth, addressing himself to Mr. President Pierce,' the
                  items are all down!—there will be warm work, depend upon it!—and seeing how Uncle
                  Sam'll have to scratch in somewhere (just to make a point or two), Cousin Caleb
                  and me will take the job of doing all the necessary fighting on both sides the big
                  pond, and getting all the stray territory required to complete these United
                  States, for eighty-six million dollars—two and a half per cent. off for ready
                  money. Might as well let Smooth have the shiners, seeing how me and Caleb would
                  give security to do the fighting up brown; and. then somebody was getting the
                     tin out of Uncle Sam's big bag in a fast kind of way that nobody
                  could explain. Smooth begged Mr. President Pierce to give the thing a few turns
                  over in his head, and when the problem came as clear as daylight, send him
                     his figure by the first post. With this, Mr. Smooth retired to the
                  National."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               MR. PIERCE SENDS SMOOTH DOWN AMONG THE BRITISHERS.
               "MR SMOOTH (I write after the style most in fashion), having been associated with
                  Mr. Pierce, whose Minister in general he was, as has been set forth in this
                  history, is come to be regarded as a very dangerous individual. It is astonishing
                  with what facility we gain bad repute from association with a certain class of men
                  and things. Our country is a stalwart oasis, rising in reproachful greatness over
                  the old and dwindling dependencies around it; but our Pierce government is a waste
                  in its centre, contaminating and casting the blight of intrigue upon those
                  connected with it. It builds bulwarks for itself, and breaks them down with the
                  mere fog of its own breakers. It, like a dauntless boy, seizes the helm of State,
                  and steering by scheme instead of compass, runs the ship ashore in unknown seas.
                  As Smooth is a national Christian, he believes the timbers of the old ship tough
                  and strong, or they had been bilged ere this. But, while speaking of contamination
                  in connection with Mr. Pierce, he (Smooth) is forcibly reminded of the similarity
                  between it and an episode in the life of his great-grandfather. This venerable
                  ancestor, when fine society was less tenacious of its associations, entered upon
                  the cultivation of pumpkins as a business, but in after life, as the novelist has
                  it, became a railroad president, and as an inseparable result, a great financier.
                  When in the latter position, being a very sensitive person, he tried to get rid of
                  the odor of the pumpkin business; but all to no purpose. Do what he would, go
                  where he would, contribute to what he would, mix with what society he would, be as
                  generous as he would, people were heard to whisper 'pumpkins;' and to construe his
                  motives as prompted by the same spirit which induced him to make a business of
                  cultivating that vegetable. A similar odor, arising from his connection with
                  Pierce, Smooth found clinging to his garments. The world in general viewed him as
                  a dangerous man, for the simple reason that his master was regarded with the same
                  eye of suspicion. Pierce was not ignorant of this, and to obviate Smooth's
                  difficulties, said he would send him Down East, as before related. Being of an
                  undecided turn, he could not make up his mind about the war business in Europe,
                  nor could he exactly define where he stood with regard to Central America. He
                  would like to give me (Smooth) the job to do the fighting for these United States,
                  for he felt sure I could not fail to make a grand affair of it. As for Caleb being
                  taken into the contract (he, the General, shook his head doubtingly), he had some
                  doubt of the policy; he was fast enough, but there was no knowing which way he
                  would turn at any moment, nor was he at all times to be trusted. For the present,
                  Smooth must be contented with a first-class mission to Down East, where he would
                  settle the fish and other questions international; at the same time, he might be
                  evolving in his mind the affair of the war. Did Minister Smooth deem it expedient,
                  he might without prejudice, taking the Ostend for example, call together on the
                  Island of St. Paul—or, if preferable, the Isle of Sables—a Congress of American
                  Ministers, provided, nevertheless, he invite Major Hammet, of the Pictou Mission,
                  and Governor Darby, of the Isle of Dogs. Pierce strictly enjoined that no letters
                  be received from Monsieur Souley, nor his dogmatic Secretary, and that the
                  subjects to be discussed were the internal affairs of Baffin's Bay, Greenland, the
                  North Pole, the Labrador Coast, and the straits of Bell Isle—from which the
                  importation of cod oil had sadly fallen off during our fish difficulties. Not to
                  weary the reader, Smooth is here happy to relieve his mind by stating that simple
                  prudence restrained him from calling together this august Congress; he left it
                  where he found it—in Mr. Pierce's fruitful head.
               "Conscious of the necessity, Smooth bound Mr. Pierce down to detail, particularly
                  stipulating that he should bear the ultimate responsibility in the event of
                  failure. Now to the result!
               
               "His opinion of the Novascotians had always been favorable, and when he left Mr.
                  Pierce it was with a promise that he would do all he could to enlighten them. But
                  as impressions will change at a nearer view, so when he got wrong did he regard
                  both the quality and quantity of their radicalism as injurious to the best
                  interests of the State. There was in the little green-hilled province an endless
                  amount of political talking done, with so small an amount of patriotism evinced,
                  that we were not at a loss for the cause that had kept the State in obscurity.
                  Then there seemed so much government, that everything was ungoverned. And he
                  (Smooth) thought there was a want of activity, physical as well as mental, and a
                  recklessness of getting into debt to Mr. John Bull, who never could infuse a
                  sufficient sense of honor into his Colonial subjects to make them pay over, or
                  regard their obligations. Want of energy and a criminal dependence upon the 'home
                  Government' for assistance, with which to develop the resources of the country,
                  resulted in a want of confidence in the State's own means to better its condition.
                  The Home Government, and an imported Governor, were blighting to their vital
                  energies. This subject, however, is not fruitful, hence his reader will please
                  accompany him to a different. Having left Pierce for a time, Smooth, with that
                  resolution so characteristic of his countrymen, wherever found, entered into the
                  codfish business. Transforming himself (after the manner of his uncle Jeff Davis),
                  into a captain of the fishing schooner Starlight, which said schooner he ran over
                  the treaty line straight into Fox Island, on the coast of Cape Breton, where he
                  proposed making the acquaintance of the inhabitants, and, if possible, a treaty of
                  friendship and commerce. The waters in and about the port were alive with
                  mackerel—the finest, plumpest, fattest, and most willing fish ever seen in any
                  waters. They sported round us, looking clever enough to make all on board the
                  schooner believe they wanted to come on board. The crew felt like scraping
                  acquaintance with them, favoring them with a hook, and the like; but then there
                  interposed that great bugbear—the treaty line. Hard was it to tell where this line
                  was; it might, for aught to the contrary, be on the top of a wave, upon which we
                  might be tossed, much against Smooth's inclination, far into the unlawful side.
                  Being, however, inside of the line and surrounded by mackerel, one would have
                  supposed the Nova Scotians had been on the alert catching them. The case was just
                  the reverse, for not a Nova Scotiaman was to be seen. To Smooth's mind this was
                  making a law to protect the lazy, something he never approved of, more especially
                  in these days of energy and railroads. A determination was come to, after mature
                  deliberation, that fish there were and fish our boys must have, so you must lend
                  an ear while Smooth relates the manner in which he got them. Deacon Hawkins kept
                  an inn for the entertainment of man and beast. It was not the very best kind of an
                  inn, for it was managed by the deacon's wife, whose parsimony and love of Friday
                  evening meetings had lost her nearly all her guests and driven her children
                  barefoot into the street. On the day following the Starlight's arrival, as luck
                  would have it, a 'political meeting' was to be holden at the Deacon's, when a
                  considerable amount of first-rate drinking was sure to come off. Smooth, being Mr.
                  Pierce's minister in general, was honored with an invitation which he declined in
                  consideration of his anxiety to be among the mackerel. Something must indeed be
                  done for the mackerel; the case was a serious one. Had the Britishers shown a
                  resolution to be among the fish, Smooth had lent them a hand to secure the whole
                  shoal, and then brought them back, merely to avoid the penalty of the British law,
                  and secure the bounty given by ours. Well, the Britishers were all gone to a
                  political meeting, where a noisy politician of the name of Joe Howe, and another
                  of the name of Doyle, having come all the way from Halifax, and brought with them
                  other great men of the political world of Nova Scotia, would relieve themselves of
                  ponderous speeches, to hear which all the old men of the parish would take their
                  promising sons. Smooth never regarded political meetings over highly, and had more
                  than once thought those so earnest in attending them had done much better
                  attending their 
                     potatoe
                     potato
                   fields. With this opinion made stronger in the present instance, he
                  counselled Mister Splitwater, the mate, whose logic never was known to be at
                  fault. Splitwater, agreed that it was expedient to be in pursuit of the fish while
                  the Britishers were attending their political gatherings and prayer-meetings.
                  Mackerel were right knowing fish, he
                  said, and could with good feed be coaxed across the line, and into the waters not
                  held sacred against American hooks by British law. And to this end a goodly amount
                  of bait was ground up; and the wind coming in the quarter most 
                     favorabe
                     favorable
                   to our movements, canvas was got on the Starlight, and in charge of
                  Splitwater, who was directed to keep a bright eye on the warships, she put to sea
                  like a thing of life dancing with snowy wings over the blue, blue waters. While he
                  was taking care of the fish, Smooth remained on shore, keeping those who attended
                  the political meeting all right, and making a speech or two when called upon.
               "To hear the eloquent Joe Howe tell the Nova Scotians what they would be were it
                  not for James Johnson and Toryism was really very amusing. He forgot to tell them
                  that he had no serious objection to being made Colonial Secretary seeing that a
                  nice little salary was attached. When Smooth made his appearance at the political
                  gathering of course no one thought there was any fish-taking going on. Then he
                  endeavored to make the credulous citizens feel free and easy, entertaining them
                  with jokes of a strong kind, and explaining the crude process of electioneering
                  down in Texas and Arkansas. No sooner had the politicians got through their
                  speeches than they retired to what was called an 'open house,' where all good
                  radicals could drink ad libitum and make merry.
                  Smooth was honored with an invitation to join in a few joyous glasses, but he
                  rather doubted the policy of drinking so much election liquor. It might under
                  certain circumstances serve the ends of politicians, but never the greater
                  interests of a nation. A drinking man is sure to fool himself in the end, nor can
                  a man serve the interests of the State who neglects his own. But, be it here
                  understood Uncle Sam, there is a philosophical way of applying the practical to
                  make things profitable, which may be carried out with more facility by making
                  oneself cheerful and courteous with those among whom we may be cast. This Smooth
                  always aimed to do.
               After a while Smooth calculated how he'd got politics enough; an' knowin' how
                  Splitwater was 'commodatin' the mackerel outside the line, he steps down to Deacon
                  Sam Moody's prayer meetin,' what they holds at night after the 'lection meetin.
                  Here it was all right; Smooth was just as much of a Christian as anybody could
                  honestly be, and a longer face nobody could desire. Smooth, at the Deacon's,
                  was-well known for his pious principles; but the good folk about there had never
                  seen Smooth in an anxious way. Well, the deacon congratulated Smooth on his
                  appearance, his spiritual welfare, his happy prospects of something beyond this.
                  It would have done you good to see the brothers and sisters crowd round him,
                  lookin' so excited 'bout the care of somethin' anybody can take care of without
                  neglectin' business. (We here give Smooth's language in its crude state). It was
                  amazin' to see what an amount of pious a fellow could get into his face, and then
                  get his face into a right focus; but when brother Smalwood invited him to pray!
                  that was shavin' the thing a little too close—more nor a man what was thinking
                  about Splitwater and the mackerel could shoulder. Had not a mite of an objection
                  to 'commodatin' the good folks with 'most anything, or puttin' on the longest and
                  seriousest face out doors—a face that would beat the Deacon's; but couldn't go
                  t'other thing. Smooth could rather beat the Deacon on a serious face; but the old
                  hoss was a regular steamboat when it come to exhortations and such things.
                  Wouldn't 'a done to have a brush with the Deacon, without being sure of beating
                  him, for he was mighty egotistical about his prayers. Well, there was no help for
                  it, we must feel kind and happy to see so many happy ones around one, who could
                  not? It was strictly in accordance with Smooth's philosophy to make people as
                  happy as possible, and so he kept asking anxious questions, gettin' satisfactory
                  answers,—answers that would be sure to make me all straight in the pious, with a
                  day or two's consideration.
               "In this way the spirits kept up until the pleasant hour of midnight came; then
                  the Deacon invited me to go home and hang up at his house. It was just the thing
                  for Smooth, but he had to decline twice before he got over the polite so to
                  accept: and then he knew Split was taking the mackerel aboard like sixty. So he
                  went home with the deacon, turned in for the night, and knew nothing more till
                  daylight.
               "Now he must disclose how the Starlight and Split got along, coaxing the mackerel
                  with fresh bait, just as General ral
                  Pierce does the Soft Shells. Split meets the schooner Spunk, Skipper Pluck, afore
                  he begun to get to the line, outside of which he could fish according to law.
                  Split and he were old cronies, and they just heaves to, and has a
                  talk about what's best to be done. 'Twarn't long afore they had negotiated the
                  plan, which, when carried out, they were to divide the spoils equal. Seeing how
                  the Britishers, every year, pay over a million pounds sterling for keeping open
                  the fishing question, driving the fish out of the water with big man-o'-war ships
                  and steamships, and making a deal of pleasant fun for a great many fine gentlemen
                  who threaten to swallow a fisherman for taking a fish; and that the United States
                  pay about one-fifth as much for the privilege of sending some of their big ships
                  to help the Britishers play the genteel, while hoping that stupid diplomacy will
                  long continue to give them the same Opportunity, Split and Pluck reckoned how
                  they'd come a point over the Britishers.
               "The great point was to steer clear of the big British steamer, Devastation. Pluck
                  said he seed her steamin' away down to the northward t'other a'ternoon, and so it
                  was agreed that Pluck, with the Pinkey Spunk, should run down in her track. If he
                  sighted her in the morning he was just to play her about some, until
                  Split got the mackerel on board. And so, instead of the Devastation going in
                  search of him, the Spunk went after her, and, as luck would have it, met her just
                  inside of the treaty line. The Spunk pretended to be shying—put on the rags as if
                  he was going to try legs with the Devastation. Crowdin' steam like all Jehu, down
                  the Devastation came, as if she were going to smash the Spunk, and blow her to
                  Daniel's dungeon. Bang! whang! boomed a gun or two, but seein' how ther' warn't no
                  iron fallin' about, Pluck reckoned he'd keep her to it a time longer, knowin' in
                  his soul that every mile further he got the Devastation away from the Starlight,
                  so much the better for Splitwater and the mackerel. It warn't long, afore whir!
                  ziz! ziz! came somethin' what made a mighty splashin', and looked savagarous,
                  square across her stern sheets. Pluck reckoned how the Britisher had got his
                  dander up, and about cleverest thing would be to round to, seein' how the feller
                  was wastin' his shot, and sendin' things what might save a body the trouble of
                  puttin' on a night-cap about bedtime. 'Now,' said Pluck, 'the Devastation feels
                  kind a out o' sorts, and 'll just knock the Spunk into an apple dumplin';' but she
                  didn't! Well, the skipper and his dandy officers came on board, looking all so
                  shined up, and vented their indignant feelins' by takin' it all out in a shower of
                  cussin' that would 'a made yer hair stand on end straight. In a few minutes more,
                  a feller in a monkey jacket, a brass button on his hat, and otherwise officially
                  costumed, put on the dignity of the quarter-deck, and out-talked the skipper.
                  'Now, why the devil didn't you come to when you saw our signal?' says he, with a
                  face of daggers, and looking at Pluck as if he was goin' to spring the main-mast
                  with his teeth. Hand up yer papers here—quick, bear a hand! Take off yer hatches,
                  too; you've been fishing inside of the line,' he grumbled out, as
                  quickly as you'd overhaul a chain cable. Pluck bore it like a philosopher, cool
                  and quietly. 'No we hain't nether, stranger; hain't hooked a fish for two days.
                  Can't 'commodate us with a sup of fresh water, can ye? Wanted to get a chance at
                  the shore, but ain't had one for more nor three weeks; true! by Christopher
                  Columbus,' rejoined Uncle Pluck, puttin' on the most innocent face ye ever did
                  see.
               "'We'll talk about that by-and-by,' says the Britisher. 'If you'd a cum to, like a
                  man, as you should, and not given us this long chase after you, you might have had
                  some claim to our generosity. We are only carrying out Her Majesty's orders for
                  the benefit of the Colonial fisheries.'
               "'Lord love yer soul, stranger! had I but known that, ye wouldn't a seen this
                  salt-water citizen about these diggings. Pluck had been hum, helping Cousin Gethro
                  to keep school—would!'
               "'Never mind that. We don't want yer Yankee soft sauder! Bear a hand, get your
                  hatches off, and your papers up!'
               "'Ye hain't seen Uncle Caleb's craft—her name's the Winking Weazel—as ye come from
                  down north, have ye?' inquires Pluck, giving the mate a side wink.
               "'What the devil do I care about yer Winking Weazels? I'm quite certain you have
                  been fishing inside of the line, or you had obeyed our summons properly,' he growled out again, like a bear in
                  trouble. 'Blow my buttons, if I warn't most scared to death when I seed ye comin'!
                  Couldn't tell what on 'arth ye wanted; and I know'd that if there war' a chance at
                  all, it was to run. If I'd know'd ye war' such a clever lookin' fellow, and that
                  ye warn't a going to hurt a body, I'd come to quicker nor lightenin.' Pluck got
                  all the philosophy in his natur' up. 'Suppose ye step down into the cabin and have
                  a leetle of somethin' to take, seein' what a tarnal ugly fog's comin' up. Tom
                  Blowers 'll get all the things clear, so ye can take a look round, and be
                  satisfied how we ain't been takin' advantage of the law, while you and me wets
                  t'other eye with a little what won't taste bad,' continues Pluck, doing the polite
                  all up. The good natur' of the chap was a good way down' in him, but talkin' of a
                  little drop just dropped into the right place, brought it up all over him. 'Well,
                  seeing it's you, providing it's right good, I don't mind,' he replied,
                  reflectively. It warmed up the tender spot in his stomach, and, going down below,
                  he wet t'other eye twice. 'Stonishin' to see how good the critter got all at once.
                  He was just the best natured Britisher that ever came along. 'Twas just the
                  medicine to cure his disease.
               "'Now! here's the dockerments' (Pluck hands him the papers), 'and ye can take a
                  squint into the hold. Hain't touched a fish for three days. Just so, stranger,'
                  rejoined Pluck, tellin' the cook to get the skipper of the Devastation to be kind
                  enough to lend him a keg of water.
               "'Schooner Spunk, of Barnstable, 84 tons burden, Jacob Pluck, master, &c.,
                  &c. Mighty formidable combination,' ejaculated the Britisher, lookin' his eyes
                  almost out, and runnin' the forefinger of his right hand over the Spunk's
                  Certificate. Then turning to Pluck, a sort of half-way grin of good nature on his
                  countenance, he continued: 'You Yankees are curious specimens, after all. Pretty
                  generous, good-natured when it's profitable, hard to understand, and as cute
                  as—'
               "'Don't say the last!" interrupts Pluck. 'Seeing it's you, citizen, we wont argue
                  that point just now. Satisfied on the dockerments, ain't ye?'
               "'Confound the dockerments! I don't want to bother myself with
                  them. Mind your eye next time; cover when you see the signal,'
                  says the Britisher, whom Pluck had got nicely smoothed down.
               "'Reckon how there won't be any mistake about it next time. Give us yer hand,
                  captain.' (Pluck shakes hands with the Britisher). They say the Pinkey,
                  Starlight—you know she's a ripper to fish inside of the line!—got into a monstrous
                  shoal of fresh mackerel day afore yesterday, and is now takin' on 'em like sixty,
                  inside of the line, down north-east of us.'
               "'Do you tell me that? That fellow Smooth at it, again, fishing inside of the
                  line? And inside the point as well, I suppose?' The Britisher looked surprised,
                  and listened attentively to Pluck as he assumed an air of innocence.
               "'Just so! Smooth is the keenest feller. Don't care a whit about the line; and the
                  Starlight's so mighty used to fishin' inside, that even the fish seem to have a
                  likin' for the skipper.
               '"I'll see after that treaty-breaker, I will,' growls the chap, changing his good
                  natur' into bad again.
               "'Down north-east of us ye'll find him, inside the point,' continues
                  Pluck, looking all over serious.
               "'I'll catch the fellow, and right soon, too;' and, being right good friends, they
                  shook hands, and the Britisher left, quite satisfied. Just as he, in his boat, was
                  leavin' the Spunk for the Devastation, Pluck bellowed out, fearin' he'd forget it,
                  'Keep a straight course, north-east about two points east! about two
                  points east! and yer sure to come upon him.' The last thing Pluck saw of the
                  Devastation, she was heading for the supposed spot, steering away,
                  drivin' all the fish into the middle of the Atlantic, and expecting to find the
                  Starlight where Pluck said she was.
               "No sooner was the Devastation put all right than Pluck hauled his wind, and next
                  mornin' came up with the Starlight, which had taken about eighty barrels of fine
                  fat mackerel. The game being nicely played, the Starlight and the Spunk both run
                  in for a shelter, where the spoils could be shared according to practical
                  diplomacy—not the diplomacy that has been twenty years gettin' the question into
                  an interminable difficulty. This done, Smooth, having helped the folks on shore
                  with their political meetings, and prayer meetings, and consultation meetings, stepped on board again, and took command
                  of the Starlight without any extra trouble. But that was not the end of it. The
                  looks of such fine fat fish raised a mighty fuss in the town, everybody forgot the
                  politics and the prayer meetings, and begun to talk fish. They declared the
                  Yankees had encroached on the Britisher's rights. Despatches were next day to go
                  to head-quarters, a whole British fleet was wanted, and must come down and seize
                  Smooth's Pinkey, the Starlight—fish and all. The whole talk and noise didn't make
                  much matter to Smooth; he didn't believe in talking—acting was his motto—go-ahead.
                  'Blow away, citizens—blow away! A little more energy is worth the whole. There is
                  fish enough for us all; but politics and prayer meetings will not catch them.'
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               THE PIOUS SQUIRE.
               "THE good people of Nova Scotia were, in days gone by, exceedingly given to
                  Toryism, and, as was then held to be the natural result, very loyal. To such an
                  extent was this loyalty and love of Toryism—as it was then called—carried, that a
                  person who consumed 'Yankee goods' was seriously suspected of some improper design
                  against the State. The consumption of British manufactures and British-grown
                  produce was, on the other hand taken as strong testimony of loyalty and confidence
                  in the wise powers protecting the interests of the State. The very presence of
                  'Yankee goods' was ominous of evil; and as it was desirable the good people should
                  be kept well up to their Toryism, many were the means resorted to for forcing the
                  exclusive consumption of British produce. Tea from the United States was
                  prohibited for the benefit of the East India Company—powder must be British!
                  Tobacco paid imperial and colonial duties approximating to a prohibition; and the
                  consumer of the weed was considered quite an extravagant aristocrat, who either
                  had dealings with smugglers, or was wasting his fortune in the ways of the devil.
                  In a word, imperial and colonial duties dried up the energies of the people, and
                  gave new life to a contraband trade that was fast destroying the best interests of
                  the State. The result was, that the best smuggler was the most desperate fellow;
                  but it generally happened that the man who said most against 'Yankee goods' was
                  sure to be deepest implicated in contraband trade.
               "To be a scientific smuggler in those days it was necessary to be a justice of the
                  peace: and if the office were coupled with that of church warden so much the
                  better. About this time there was, in the Bay of Fundy, an old coaster of the name
                  of Hornblower, who knew every creek,
                  cove, inlet and headland, together with all the best points for smuggling, from
                  the St. Croix River to Windsor Bay on the one side, and from Windsor Bay to
                  Barrington on the other. Skipper Hornblower, as he was then called, had the
                  go-ahead in him, and commanded the schooner Dash, owned by one Squire Burgle, who
                  carried on a strictly legitimate trade with the Yankees over the
                     line, though he always gave out that he hated them as a people,
                  nor would ever sell a pennyworth of their notions which he denounced as worthless.
                  Hornblower was a brusque old salt, but had a
                  right good heart in him, and, not liking the way trade was restricted by imperial
                  and colonial exactions, thought it no harm to work to windward of the collectors
                  now and then, and accommodate his 
                     frinnds
                     friends
                   in a free-trade sort of way. Tea, 'in them times,' cost six colonial
                  shillings and a day's journey per pound, and a gallon of molasses about the same.
                  The good old women in more remote parts of the province, must have their tea, and
                  molasses was an 
                     indipensable
                     indispensable
                   luxury, for they were indeed poor. But they were compelled to buy of the
                  established merchant, who was a sort of prince in his way, and dictated his terms
                  to the people, whom he always kept in poverty while he got rich. Molasses, tea,
                  tobacco, and rum (New England white-eye, labelled Jamaica!) constituted his stock
                  in trade. To length of credit he added corresponding prices, never forgetting to
                  take good security. His medium price for tick was only forty per cent. addition,
                  which he considered extremely liberal.
               "And thus, through a pettifogging colonial policy, commerce was turned into the
                  merest peculation by a class of persons who made it their object to restrict the
                  agriculturist, and hold his interests at their mercy. The more the farmer raised,
                  the more he found himself subject to the shopkeeper's narrow restrictions; and
                  thus the interests of a naturally energetic people were held in check. The Home
                  Government (God bless it! as the very loyal Provincials used to say when the
                  Imperial Parliament took their cause under consideration) thought little about the
                  outside Nova Scotians, except to say, once in a while, that the territory they
                  inhabited belonged to her Majesty, which fact the people of the province were
                  forcibly reminded of by the presence of imported gentlemen, whom it had pleased
                  her Majesty to place in all responsible offices. In fact, the Home Government,
                  through its pewter-headed policy, was for ever making laws to suit the immediate
                  demands of a favored few, who said good things of loyalty and toryism, and left
                  the rest to chance.
               "During this state of affairs, Skipper Hornblower's fame sounded far and wide, and
                  many were the stories told of his smuggling exploits, and how Squire Burgle always
                  kept a large stock of British goods on hand, which he never sold cheaper than any
                  body else, though he got richer. Hornblower's account of how he and the Squire
                  carried on business together in the good old times may not be uninteresting,
                  'Squire Burgle,' said Hornblower, 'was a great man in them days, said a sight of
                  good things in his prayers every night and morning, denounced smuggling, and hoped
                  all those fearless men that followed it would see the error of their way, turn to
                  her Majesty, and make their loyalty honor the State. Squire used to send me to
                  Boston—(the Dash was the only craft in the trade then)—with little things to sell,
                  and a return cargo of flour, gin, tobacco, and such like Yankee notions, which the
                  Nova Scotians must have, and upon which her Majesty lavished most ungracious
                  duties, to fetch home. Well, the Squire lived at the town of Annapolis, twenty
                  miles up a river, where Digby, at its entrance, was the only port of entry within
                  a 
                     hnndred
                     hundred
                   miles. Seeing that I liked to make quick trips, it was not always
                  convenient to stop at this obdurate port of entry, and so I used to lay the Dash's
                  head for a piece of dark wood on a point of land outside the entrance (always
                  being careful to have a clearance in merchandise) and run her close
                  aboard of it. Squire had a cousin living near that bit of wood, who used to
                  understand the thing, and could sight the Dash's signal ten miles at sea. Lying
                  off and on until sundown, the Squire's cousin would hang out a light on a tree; if
                  at the top it was the signal—'All right;' if half-mast, 'Keep out!' 'There's the
                  light—all right to-night! the boys used to say, when it gleamed at the tree top.'
                  Then into the basin and up the river we used to dodge, passing on the opposite
                  side of the river, and as far from the port of entry as it was possible to get,
                  and reaching a point on the banks where the cargo was to be discharged, while the
                     folks on shore were all nicely
                  sleeping. The Squire, of course, had said his prayers, or, as it sometimes would
                  happen—though it was always accidental—had gone to Digby, for the purpose of
                  giving her Majesty's Collector a ride into the country. The Collector was always
                  an imported gentleman, who maintained a good deal of imported dignity, which the
                  Nova Scotians had to 'tip' out of him, ere he became a clever fellow, according to
                  their notion of such a being. In addition to taking the Collector a short pleasure
                  trip into the country, the Squire had a nigger fellow, of the name of Tom, who, as
                  cunning as a fox, could tell the Dash was coming, by something he always said he
                  saw was in the clouds. Tom lived on Pin Point, where the Squire had his half-way
                  warehouse, always full of foreign goods, on which no one could tell how much duty
                  had been paid. This half-way warehouse, which Tom called his, used to atone for a
                  monstrous quantity of sins. The Squire, however, declared he had established it
                  there, in the fulness of his generosity, merely to accommodate his kind customers,
                  whose means of travelling did not enable them to reach his trading marts at either
                  extreme. But, when customers called at Pin-Point to do a little trading with the
                  Squire, they generally found it closed, and Old Tom offering his very best
                  apology, by saying it was where master only did his wholesale business. This was
                  accepted on the ground that the Squire and Tom were very funny individuals. Well,
                  we would run to the Point at night, and Tom having everything ready to move at the
                  word, would shoot the Yankee goods into the warehouse, where, in six hours, they
                  would be all transferred into real British growth and manufacture. During this
                  time the Squire was nowhere; but Tom did things as if he knew how. Indeed no
                  sooner were the goods out than we made the best of our way down the river
                  again.
               "Next morning, the sun about two hours up, you would see the Dash away down the
                  bay, as calm as moonlight, just sighting Digby. Squire—totally ignorant of
                  Hornblower's arrival—would be putting on the longest face in the town of
                  Annapolis, going up and down the street quite disconsolate, and climbing into the
                  church steeple to see if he could sight the Dash below. 'Hornblower's gone this
                  time!' he would say, shaking his head, 'must be lost! must be lost! must be lost!'
                  And the Squire would tell about his horrid dream, seeing Hornblower's ghost
                  smuggling a chest of tea (real congou), and the Collector catching him on the
                  spot. 'Hornblower's tricky—he larnt it of the Yankees—and I'm always afraid he'll
                  get cotched smuggling little things for himself. What a blessing it is to have a
                  clear conscience!' he would say: the last sentence referring to himself.
               "But soon the knowing ones got an inkling of the Squire's secrets, and when he
                  mentioned the Dash in his prayers at morning, and walked the wharf after
                  breakfast, muttering his misgivings, she was sure to arrive in the afternoon.
                  There was virtue in the Squire, but the citizens got the hang of it so well, that
                  whenever I arrived at town they would say: 'It's only Hornblower's ghost.'
               "While the Squire would be doing what he called the straight-forward up in town,
                  I'd be dropping kedge at Digby, where (the Colonial Parliament having withdrawn
                  the appropriation for a boarding-boat, that smugglers might get through their
                  little operations without trouble) we would send our own boat for the collector.
                  Used to have everything as bright as a new sixpence, and colors flying, and my own
                  face squared up to do the honest, when that imported dignitary came on board,
                  affecting all the importance of a Port-Admiral.
               "'Had a good passage, eh, Hornblower?' the prim collector used to ask, as he
                  mounted the rail.
               "'Blowed like cannons, outside, last night! Seeing how we had just ballast in her,
                  like to tipped her over,' I'd say, bowing, keeping my hat in my hand, and doing
                  the polite all up.
               "'Didn't have a chance to smuggle, according to that, eh?'
               "'Yer honor knows Hornblower never does that sort of thing. The Squire, my owner,
                  is pious, you know,' I'd say, keeping the long face hard down.
               "'Yes, Hornblower, I know your owner to be conscientious and pious; that is why I
                  always let you off so easy.' And the collector would look so credulously
                  good-natured that I couldn't help drawing out a roll of cigars, telling him they
                  were pure Havanas, when presenting them. It used to do me good to see how it—small
                  as it was—softened things about his heart. I would immediately follow the cigars with the papers, taking good
                  care to have merchandise enough in the hold to correspond with what was set forth
                  on the clearance and manifest. 'Ye see, sir,' I'd remark, 'I never smuggles,
                  except it is a few cigars now and then, for my own smoking! Old Jacob Grimes says,
                  when a government makes laws what people can't live to, you must live round them;
                  but them ain't my principles.'
               "'Thank you, Mr. Hornblower, I am sure you have more regard for your honor than to
                  smuggle,' he would resume, keeping his eyes fixed upon me.
               "'I am obliged to you for the confidence—the confidence of superiors in spirit or
                  body; and I hope I may never do anything but what will merit yours. It has been my
                  motto through life to keep before me the words of my good old mother. Ah! she was
                  a mother. Fond soul, she used to say, 'Solomon, my boy, let your dealing with the
                  world be marked by honesty, and remember that one small error in your life may
                  stain forever your character. The eyes of an unforgiving world once excited to
                  suspicion will ever wear the same glasses.' Having said this, nothing more was
                  wanted to make complete the Squire's confidence. Without further detention, he
                  would have the papers made out, and having received them, we would trim our sheets
                  and sail away up the river, Old Tom boarding us off Pin Point, and laughing
                  himself almost out of his black skin—welcoming us after the fashion of friends met
                  after a long absence. All this time the Squire would be impatiently waiting on the
                  wharf at the little town of Annapolis—so glad to see Hornblower! 'No contraband
                  goods on board, eh, Hornblower?' he would inquire, affecting such an amount of
                  piety that it made me laugh in my shoes.
               "'Not so much as a plug of tobacco!' I would reply, contemplatively, as the crew
                  commenced putting out the few things we had entered at Her Majesty's Custom House.
                  We had great regard for Her Majesty; nor have I the least doubt of the Squire's
                  honesty, which would have been all right had it not been for the law and
                  parliament. We have only to add that, having played his part after the manner of a
                  good Christian, he would seek his way home, there to arrange an evening
                  prayer-meeting.
               "But the beauty of the Squire's nature, as illustrated in his pious hatred of
                  smuggling, or otherwise defrauding Her Majesty, would shine out bright on the day
                  the Dash left on her return voyage. I was sure of an invitation to breakfast with
                  him on that morning, and he was equally sure to paint the purity of his conscience
                  in such glowing colors that it was difficult for me to maintain a serious face.
                  When we had eaten bread, and he had offered up his prayer (in which he always
                  remembered Her Majesty), he would accompany me to the Dash, when, having got on
                  board, and cast off, he would mount the most prominent place on the cap-sill,
                  where the citizens assembled could hear him, and cry out at the top of his
                  voice:—'Hornblower! good-bye. One word more, Hornblower! Let me entreat you not to
                  smuggle a pennyworth for anybody.' My reply always was that I would follow his
                  advice with christian strictness. Then he would modestly finger that cravat so
                  white, and fix in his face such becoming dignity, that I thought his green
                  glasses, which I never liked, covered his eyes to great advantage. Remember what I
                  have always endeavored to impress on your mind,' he would continue; 'honesty is
                  the best policy—it is!' Just then everybody would look at the Squire, while it was
                  with great effort I kept from my face a smile. I knew honesty was the best policy;
                  I knew it was the true policy to all praiseworthy ends; but how could I help
                  contemplating the necessity of those preaching who never practised it, seeing that
                  the Squire was not what he seemed, for he smuggled an hundred barrels of flour for
                  every one he paid duty upon. I had also seen him pass sentence of imprisonment and
                  fine on the wretch who smuggled a demijohn of bad spirits, when for him I had
                  smuggled a thousand.
               "Thanks to a more liberal commercial policy, that has precluded the necessity for
                  such scenes as the Dash stealing her way into a river at night to land her cargo
                  of contraband goods. Those violations of law, so prevalent a few years ago, have
                  ceased; and in the improved condition of the people we see the result of a new and
                  more liberal policy. But a few years ago, that small craft, the Dash, alone sought
                  to establish what was considered a doubtful trade with the port of Boston; now,
                  some forty pursue a profitable traffic with the State of Massachusetts, which has
                  annually brought to her in British bottoms no less than 170,000 cords of Nova
                  Scotia grown fire-wood.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               SMOOTH ENCOUNTERS A COLONIAL JUSTICE OF STRANGE CHARACTER.
               "NOVA SCOTIA being what a South Carolinian would call a hard country to live in
                  (though the people were proverbially kind, and hospitable, and loyal, and
                  simple-minded), Smooth, like many other special ministers, resolved to give up his
                  mission in disgust, and, without further delay, seek the arms of General Pierce.
                  However, before quitting the province, he visited the shores of Cape Breton (an
                  island belonging to Her Most Gracious Majesty), and there met with a singularly
                  eccentric character of the name of Belhash. This Belhash added to a figure of
                  great rotundity a square, red face, small hazel eyes, a heavy, flat nose, a low,
                  reclining forehead, and a head covered with red, crispy hair, which he took great
                  pains to part in the centre. The only expression the Squire's face could lay claim
                  to was that of a pumpkin burned ripe in the sun. When in his favorite dress of
                  blue-grey homespun, which he judiciously arranged (for Belhash was a Squire), no
                  greater functionary lived on the island; that is, in his well-developed opinion of
                  himself! His principal law business consisted in settling all disputes arising
                  between the people on shore and the Yankee fishermen who, against the law,
                  infested the coast, and for whom the Squire had a hatred he always made known in
                  his decisions. To Belhash the Americans were all of a flock, they would steal,
                  smuggle, take a Nova Scotiaman's eyeteeth out, and, what he most hated, concoct
                  some republican plot to overthrow his darling government. 'Now,' said the Squire
                  to me, one day, 'I have no bad opinion of you individually, Smooth; for, by the
                  righteous, you're a sort of clever feller—an exception to Yankees in general—nor
                  do I think you'll steal!'
               "I said, 'No, I didn't think I would!' And he continued.: 'You must see I am
                  something of a man here on these shores; in fact, sir, some call me very
                  distinguished; but I hardly think I have arrived at that yet, though the honorable
                  attorney-general of the province, when this way lectioneerin about a year ago, in
                  referring to my position in administering the law, said: 'That distinguished
                  gentleman, Squire Belhash, than whom none is loyaler, or more capable of
                  administering the law;' he did, sir, I assure you!'
               "Of course I bowed to this, and declared the compliment as merited as handsomely
                  bestowed. And then he continued: 'You see now, sir—and it's no small compliment to
                  a man in this out of the way part of the world!—I holds her Majesty's commission
                  to alienate (some call it demonstrate) the laws of the land.' Here the Squire's
                  face broadened and got redder, and the flashy handkerchief seemed too small for
                  the organic conformation of his big blue-veined neck.
               "'Now and then, though, I gets a law case so confoundedly cross-grained, that I'se
                  forced to call in Lawyer Songster (he's a cute un, ye know), afore I can get the
                  point o'nt halucinated. Then, Smooth, you see, I isn't one a them kind a folk what
                  run after bigified gentry; and that's how I'se got where I has! A squire in this
                  part of the world is somebody, I assure ye, sir. Then, what's more, I've always
                  bin as loyal as a body could be; but, remember ye, I warn't on the Tory side, and
                  for the very reason that they never appreciated native talent and native larnin.
                  Them were the days,' said the Squire, accompanying the words with a sort of
                  political flourish, 'what tried the souls of us county-folk. Tory Johnson, and
                  Radical Joe Howe, used to come this way lectioneerin, and set the whole country by
                  the ears; what folk neither of 'em winned over to his party they were sure to get
                  drunk; and poor folks were so fascinated with politics there was no getting a
                  stroke of work done for a month after. Joe Howe, see ye I was a perfect Jones on
                  politics—was what them that know most about politics called a champion of free
                  suffrage; and, what was more nor all, worked himself up from the use of a
                  printer's stick to holding a stick of stronger cast over the whole province,
                     not even excepting our own country.
                  In fact, he kicked Sir Rupert George out of the Colonial Office only for himself
                  to be kicked in. Well, Joe said if I'd put in the strong talk, and lectioneer for
                  him and the radicals, he'd make me Squire when he got in the
                  place—and he kept his word, you see. Joe once see'd me try a case,
                  and he was so taken with it, there was no describin' his feelins. I take it you'd
                  think natur had done her part for me in knowin' so much 'bout law, if ye'd see me
                  put a case through.'
               "The Squire had it all his own way, Smooth not having a chance to put in a word
                  edgewise. 'But, seein' how you cussed Yankees has upset everything in trade along
                  the coast, I isn't so rich as I used to be. There wor a time when my little store
                  was as good a gold mine as you could turn up in Californey; I could get any kind
                  of a price for goods; and New England rum, what I liquidated with a sprinklin of
                  Jamaica, sold as quick as gold-dust at fifteen shillins a gallon.'
               "Here, by the way of diversifying the conversation, I inquired if he remembered
                  the Queen, in the way of duties paid!
               
               "The Squire opened his spacious mouth, showed his great shark-like teeth, threw
                  away his worn quid, gave his eyes a significant roll sideways, laughed out
                  heartily, and with his left fist added a warning pinch under my left ribs. 'Don't
                  ask that unanswerable question! The custom-house was so far off that nobody
                  thought it any harm to smuggle, just a little! Bless ye! Mr. Smooth, why (here
                  Belhash wiped his face with a flashy Spitalfields) the Rector used to get all his
                  tea smuggled; nor a bit of harm did he think it. But, times ain't as they wos
                  then, nor did folks deal so much in politics and Yankee notions.' Here the Squire
                  gave his head a significant twist, as his face glowed as expressive as a fatherly
                  pumpkin of venerable age. After another dissertation on the mode of administering
                  the laws of the land, he invited me into his law establishment, which was the
                  kitchen of a somewhat dilapidated farm-house, of very small dimensions,
                  clapboarded and shingled after the old style. I (Smooth) said there could be no
                  objections to this proceeding, and so, following him very cheerfully into the
                  kitchen, he fussed about for some time among what seemed the cookery arrangements,
                  and at length drew from a chest that stood firmly fixed under an old deal table
                  near a spacious fire-place, in which was a monster back-log, from behind which the
                  ferret eyes of three mischievous urchins peered curious and comical, his judicial
                  suit. Again from the chest the Squire drew forth a large steel chain, and a very
                  mysterious-looking book, and began decorating himself in the most shocking manner.
                  This done, he repaired to the door, in all his profuseness, and seated himself on
                  a block of wood just outside, where as if suddenly becoming conscious of the
                  absence of something very necessary to his personal appearance, he doffed his
                  coat, rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and what, readers, do you suppose he commenced
                  doing?—Getting up the dignity! With nothing less than a pound of chalk before him,
                  he commenced polishing up a steel chain that might on an emergency have served to
                  chain up a very large bull-dog; but the Squire adapted it to the more fashionable
                  use of adorning himself, and making safe his ponderous pinchbeck watch. Belhash
                  now puffed, and blowed, and swore, and sweated, and piled on the chalk, and rubbed
                  and tugged criss-crass his knee, until, with the motion and fritting, he had well
                  nigh covered his cloth with the white substance, from the knee downward. Getting
                  it to the dignity point of brightness he invited me back into his forum, which
                  served the double purpose of kitchen and law-shop. Here he again smothered himself
                  in an extra coat of judicial homespun, and solicited my assistance in securing the
                  bandanna tight about his neck. 'I looks somethin' of a judge, I take it, now?' he
                  said, waiting my approval of his personal appearance, as he fingered the broad
                  turn of his shirt-collar, which seriously threatened his ears and chin. I said I
                  never saw a judicial gentleman look more upish. In fact, nobody could deny that in
                  clothes the Squire was all consequence; and when he loomed into 'Court,' all over
                  the steel chain, believe it, there were bows and servilities without stint. Taking
                  his seat on a high birch block, the plank table being set before him, on which to
                  spread his inseparable law-book, the plaintiffs and defendants assembled, and took
                  seats on a wooded bench in front. 'All persons whatsoever havin' any business
                  whatever with this 'ere court—Squire Belhash sitting—must come for'ard now or
                  never,' cries out at the top of a deep
                  sonorous voice a little scraggy-looking Scotchman, who, without coat or vest (his
                  shirt-sleeves rolled up, and the right leg of his nether garment tucked away
                  beneath a coarse deck-boot), acted the double part of usher and constable. Again
                  directing a few legal phrases to the Squire, who bowed acknowledgingly, he turned
                  to those present—hoped gentlemen would take their hats off, and spit in the
                  fire-place, seeing how the Court had been newly sanded.
               "Having examined a paper, somewhat judicially, the Squire, with an air of
                  dignified endurance, turning to his usher, said:—Well, I reckon, it's best to try
                  the case of Hornblower versus the herrins!' Down
                  he laid Justice's Guide. It seemed that on the previous night sundry fishing nets
                  had by some mysterious process been relieved of their burden. This, one of the
                  Squire's sons charged to the ingenuity, and, as he set forth without fear or
                  trembling, stealing propensities of one skipper Hornblower, who at this time
                  sailed a saucy-looking craft called the 'Virtue of Cape Cod.' This Hornblower was
                  one of the independent school, cared not seven coppers for anybody, nor had the
                  most virtuous respect for the nets of his neighbours; he looked the
                  pink-perfection of a Cape Cod fisherman. The skipper rose before his accusers; his
                  hard, weather-bleached face looking as if his intention to throw a harpoon into
                  somebody was the very best in the world. Then his dark eyes flashed lightning at
                  the Squire, who commanded the little Scotchman to read the indictment. This
                  suspicious looking document set forth that one skipper Hornblower, of the schooner
                  Virtue, had feloniously, and with malice aforethought, extracted from the nets of
                  one James Belhash, son by lawful wedlock of the presiding justice, sundry herring,
                  mackerel, and other fish—such as usually come into such nets, and are found on
                  these Her Majesty's shores. Here the Squire interrupted by commencing an essay on
                  the enormity of the crime; and concluded with the following pungent remark:—'Now,
                  Hornblower, I knows, without ginning a look in the law-book, you're guilty;
                  there's always stealin done when you're about the shore. Anyhow! what say ye for
                  yourself? Remember, you're in a Magistrate's Court—in the presence of a justice of
                  the peace!'
               "'So far as that is concerned, I'll knock under, Squire; but I just wants to see
                  yer prove a thing or two afore ye come possum over this salt-water citizen!'
                  returns Hornblower, spunkily, pulling from the pocket of his pea-coat a
                  fascinating wedge of tobacco, which so tempted the Squire that he could not resist
                  reaching out his hand and supplying his spacious mouth. As nature, ever erring,
                  should be generous to nature, so also did I interrupt here by offering to plead
                  Hornblower's case; to which meritorious object I commenced taking off my coat.
               "'Don't want nobody to soft-soap the case—especially a Yankee—for there's the law
                  in that ar' book (here the high functionary turned down the corner of the very
                  page on which it stood forcible to his mind), and I knows all about it—d—d if I
                  don't!'
               "'Swearin' ain't judiciary, Squire!' says I.
               "'Tain't none a' your business,' he rejoined, letting his anger get above his
                  caution. 'Call Jacob—he'll swar t' what he see'd the skipper do!' Here Jacob, a
                  younger son of the Squire, was called. Jacob had seen some seventeen summers; and
                  in addition to what larnin' the Squire had 'gin him,' was well up in the swearing
                  business, for the furtherance of which his abilities were frequently invoked.
               "'There is not a man long shore what don't know and respect Jacob,' continued the
                  Squire, shutting up his law book, angrily. Jacob 's a son a' mine—Jacob 's got
                  larnin, too—Jacob 's bin more nor two years to Master Jacques's school at the
                  corner; and he has taken Master Jacques's place many a time when that larned
                  gentleman had taken a drop too much. Now, Jacob, tell all you know; and let it be
                  just as straight!
               "'Well, Dad,' ejaculated Jacob, who, one might seriously have inferred, had been
                  raised on a guano bag, and slipped very unexpectedly into a suit of linsey-woolsey
                  grey mixed; I see'd the Virtue at anchor right broad off the nets, which the
                  skipper kept a facksinatin eye on, as he paced up and down the quarter-deck.'
               "'The devil you did!' Hornblower cried out, at the top of his deep, coarse voice,
                  letting fly a stream of juice that e'en most skinned the Squire's nasal organ.
               "'Dan'l!—d—mn it! bring a bucket here for the skipper!' interrupted the Squire. He
                  hoped Jacob would continue with the
                  remainder of his evidence. 'And the skipper looked so all-fired strong at the nets
                  that I couldn't help tellin Uncle Enoch how they'd be stripped afore morning. Sure
                  enough, just as I said, there warn't a herrin left in the mornin. Seeing how the
                  game war' going, I went aboard to take breakfast with the skipper; and there, if
                  his table warn't spread with the fattest fried fresh herrin—'
               "'That's all ye knows, ain't it, Jacob? That's more en enough; my own mind was
                  made up afore I read the law, and heard the testimony,' rejoined the Squire,
                  looking suddenly wise. 'Yes, dad!' emphatically returned Jacob, 'but I know'd they
                  were the very same herrin, by the taste on 'em: they tasted as if they wor
                  stolen!' And Jacob having delivered himself of this tart and somewhat strange
                  rejoinder, gave his shoulder a significant shrug, as he watched dad's eyes,
                  without faltering.'
               "'That's plump testimony—there's no coming yer Yankee twist over that! Ye see,
                  Hornblower, I knows the hang of the law, slap up. The public should know these
                  outrages; the Parliament should be apprised of such breaches of law and moral
                  honesty; the Home Government should know what cussed pests the Yankees are! We
                  don't want you here at all, Hornblower; you've turned pedler, and upset all our
                  trade—there now!' Here the Squire worked himself up into a perfect fever of
                  excitement, pressing his law-book firmly on the table while addressing his legal
                  observations to his auditory. 'I shall pronounce you guilty, Hornblower, and judge
                  you to pay a fine of twenty pounds currency, according to the sovereign law of
                  this Her Most Gracious Britannic Majesty's province.
               "I interrupted by telling him to go-ahead. 'Squire, if you warn't so fast, I'd try
                  to get a word in edgewise for Hornblower,' said I. But, before the Squire had time
                  to retort, Hornblower himself took up the weapon. Great Jehu—e! Squire,' he
                  ejaculated, 'you know no more about the law than Dobbin Dobson's donkey—ye hain't
                  worth two cents!' Hornblower's face blazed with red rage, and the Squire got
                  himself all on his pins.
               "'Keep your clapper shut, Hornblower,' returned the Squire, telling Hornblower,
                  how, if he doubted his capacity for the law business, he would read him
                  Haliburton's opinions, and convince him that they precisely conformed with his.
                  'Remember you're in the presence of a 'Justice of the Peace!' he added, as
                  Hornblower replied by informing him that so long as he was before him nothing more
                  was necessary to remind him of the fact. Then he begged the Squire to keep cool,
                  and not get into a fuzzle: and after he had bestowed some sharp retorts, in not
                  very fashionable language, which he hoped the Squire would not take as personal,
                  he made an explanation of the whole thing. 'Go on,' rejoined the Squire, getting
                  warmer and warmer.
               "'Well,' returned Hornblower; 'first I motion to adjourn the Court and go drink
                  all round, at your store; after which I further motion that Jacob and me go down
                  into the cellar of your house—'
               "'Into my cellar! interrupted the Squire, suddenly: not a step!—I'se settled the
                  case, and there's no moving judgment.' 
               "'Here Hornblower charged the Squire with having a suspicious quantity of fresh
                  herring in his own cellar. I don't say how they got there this morning afore
                  daylight, Squire,' said he, 'but there's a citizen not far off what will.
               "'It's the ram—d—d'st false ever told against a gentleman of my high
                  standing!'
               "'What is Squire?' interpolated Hornblower, keeping as cool as the face of a March
                  morning. Why!' returns the Squire, to say I stole 'em myself!'
               "'There can be no mistaking it Squire,' chimes in Hornblower; 'and the stronger
                  evidence is the fact of your being the only son of a man who has yet preferred the
                  charge of stealing them. 'Now, Squire, I'll stake the schooner Virtue, that on
                  proceeding into your cellar the herring will be recovered and injured justice
                  satisfied: just grant us a warrant to search your cellar, Squire.' Here Hornblower
                  looked thunder and lightning at the Squire whose wrath and misgiving seemed
                  carrying out a sad conflict in his heart. The result was a strange clatter of
                  tongues. Notwithstanding the Squire's estimate of his own popularity, the good
                  people on the coast well understood his singular process of doing up the law
                  business. You'll get your straight ups to jail, or pay the coin right down, Hornblower!' demanded the Squire,
                  making a flourish with his law-book, and preparing to adjourn for the purpose of
                  doing a small quantity of drinking.
               "'The Squire's a humbug!—he is!—I'll blow the Court to thunder. Just clar the
                  kitchen,' cried out the skipper, stripping off his coat, as if to have a tug and
                  hug with the Squire, who at that moment wanted to get a word in edgewise. The next
                  Smooth saw, the Squire was letting fly at Hornblower's head the law-book; which
                  rather summary demonstration was replied to by a stream of tobacco juice, with
                  which Hornblower blinded the Squire, setting him nearly frantic. By the way, the
                  law-book missed its intended object, and stormed the end of Uncle Seth Sprague's
                  nose, nearly knocking off an inch or two.
               "'Now, if that is Colonial law, Squire, I think how a little home-made Yankee
                  justice won't be a bad application,' said Hornblower, making ready to administer
                  the medicine; then he squared off, and sent his mauler right into the Squire's
                  dumplin depot, so sharp and strong, as to produce a decided conviction. At length
                  the Squire was floored, and found working the rule of three on the boards. Here
                  the diplomacy became so warm, that Smooth having the very highest regard for Mr.
                  Pierce and his fighting diplomatists who deemed getting up duels, and writing down
                  editors very necessary preliminaries to their mission, thought he would withdraw,
                  leaving the intricacy to Hornblower's settlement, seeing that he was producing the
                  strongest kind of notes and protocols."
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               SMOOTH SETTLES ALL INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTIES.
               "SMOOTH, on returning to the arms of Mr. Pierce, concluded it would not be bad
                  policy to touch at Halifax, meet Uncle John Bull's Commissioner, and with him make
                  a final settlement of all international questions. And now, being alongside of
                  George's Island, which rises abruptly in the centre of Halifax harbor, and nearly
                  opposite the old tower on Point Pleasant—and from which a splendid view of the
                  surrounding country may be obtained, I feel a desire to relate some scenes of
                  singular import which have been enacted in this place. My respect for the feelings
                  of great men and governors, however, causes me to withhold some few of them.
                  Indeed, my character for modesty being pretty well established, I am more than
                  cautions how I bring it in contact with the nervous system of such gentry.
                  Nevertheless, seeing that not uncommonly the greatest and most powerful nations
                  turn the smallest beings into very great men, and spend no end of money to do
                  nobody any good, a short, and I may say, a very modest account from the catalogue
                  of my experience, may not be out of place. Well, I, Smooth,
                     Minister-in-General to General Pierce, received, in addition to my
                  own previous conclusion, an incentive to the object in view, conveyed in a
                  dispatch from my Grandpapa Marcy, in which he advised the repairing immediately to
                  Halifax, there to witness the grand battle that was to for ever settle the fish
                  question, and give peace to fishermen and fish in general. It was sincerely hoped
                  that in the settlement of this long unsettled question, Mr. Pierce would keep his
                  black-pig at home. The result proved the mistake: war was declared. And the day on
                  which the great struggle would be decided ushered in upon a scene at once gloomy and ominous. Mysterious and fleecing
                  clouds now obscured the heavens, and again shadowed with their silvery mists the
                  surface of the sullen stream. A contest of mighty import was to be decided. The
                  hazard was great, but the point to be gained small indeed; and men moved along the
                  busy streets whispering their strong misgivings. Monster war-ships, with ponderous
                  engines supplied, rode like sleeping demons upon the water's leaden surface. An
                  hour of anxiety passed, a signal of war echoed forth, and murmured over the
                  landscape like distant thunder coursing along the heavens. Then the murmuring
                  sound re-echoed, as if the battlements above had opened upon the earth and sea.
                  Soon Britannia's wooden walls were seen veering into line and preparing for
                  action; America's ranged in the same order, waiting the dread moment. Anxious eyes
                  and thoughts strained in expectation of the bloody struggle; then the boatswain's
                  shrill whistle sounded forth, the leaden clouds overhead chased away, and bolder
                  outlined became the figures of venerable Admirals, who, immersed in glittering
                  uniforms, paced their quarter-decks. Again the ominous mouths of fierce cannon
                  suddenly protruded more savagely from the sides of the huge hulks, and the shrill
                  whistle sounded; all was bustle and confusion—eager thousands of both sexes
                  crowded wharves lining the shore, and many struggled for space to stand upon while
                  witnessing the terrible conflict. Again all was hushed into stillness; in
                  breathless suspense did excitement sit on every countenance, as if waiting for the
                  signal flash soon to break forth and turn everything into a chaos. A
                  quarter-master was seen passing a speaking trumpet to the burly old British
                  admiral, who, judging from his deportment, might have supplied the place of a rare
                  curiosity in any cabinet of ancient relics. With it in his hand the ancient
                  veteran mounted a gun on the starboard quarter, and shouted forth the ominous
                  sound: 'I accept your challenge—all ready?' A terrible movement was now
                  perceptible among the spectators on shore.
               "'You ill-treated myself and officers while on shore a few days ago; and you shall
                  pay the penalty of your insult. I'll lick you; I'll be damned if I don't,'
                  answered the American, saucily.
               "'You're spunk; but we'll take a little of it out, by the way of reducing your
                  pretensions—that's all. Now, my good cousin, just look out for the shivering of
                  your timbers. I'm going to load with grape, a jolly mixture I shall slap right
                  into you.'
               "That's e'en jist the medicine!' rejoined the Yankee: that's jist what I'm going
                  to load with; and if it won't kill, we'll take cogniac canister! But old fellow,
                  we'll larn ye how the Britishers can't take the spunk out of us Yankees: s'pose ye
                  come on board my craft, lay off yer old notions, and play the good fellow in the
                  jolly free-and-easy way. We'll then consider the horrors of war; and see if the
                  matter can't be discussed in a different way atween decks.'
               "'Well, seeing it's you—not a bad sort of a chap, by the way, I don't much care if
                  I do; but don't let go any grape until I gets under yer lee—perhaps we'd better
                  fight it out on your gun-deck. Captain, my dear fellow (here the captain looked as
                  good-natured as a turtle studying law) any way to suit your own canister!'
                  returned the rear-admiral of Uncle John's best blue.
               "I say, while you are about it, Admiral,' rejoined the Yankee, with a sort of half
                  flirtish, half earnest air—while you are about to come broad on, just bring all
                  the good folks with you—and don't forget the ladies; bring them, too. There's
                  nothing like plenty of fair faces when a strong battle is to be fought!' This was
                  a right good say on the part of Commodore Shubrick (such was the Yankee skipper's
                  name), who smiled all over his wrinkled face. It was quite enough. The gallant
                  Britisher's face, too, brightened up with good-nature, the boatswain sounded his
                  whistle, the savage guns disappeared in their ports; the yards were manned with
                  jolly tars, and away streaked the admiral in his barge, skimming the sullen water,
                  towards the Yankee, under a heavy cannonade of grape. The ladies, loving and
                  affectionate souls! couldn't stand it another minute, and, with a Joan of Arc
                  heroism, volunteered to follow the gallant admiral, for the purpose of seeing that
                  their sweethearts and husbands were not seriously wounded by the Commander's grape
                  and other missiles most dangerous. Again loud reports were heard—pop! pop!
                  pop!—ziz! ziz! ziz! went the shots of ordinary ary mixture: then whole broadsides began to be
                  poured into the belligerents in grand style. After a few hours' cannonading, all
                  was again bustle and confusion; wounded men were seen tumbling over the sides of
                  the ship, fair ladies became unfairly terrified, and then, disgusted with the
                  cowardice of their husbands and sweethearts, might be seen nearly fainting in the
                  arms of gallant officers. After the whole affair was over, a great many wounded
                  husbands, whose cases were extremely doubtful, were conveyed to their homes;
                  others dreaded the application of Caudle lecture medicine from wives who had long
                  preceded them to their domestic hearths. A facetious contemporary has described
                  this great affair in the following graphic manner:
               "On attempting to mount the stairs hung at the side, Commodore Shubrick, standing
                  on the quarter-deck, let drive a fish-ball, which he held in his hand, and struck
                  the Admiral a little below the left eye. The Admiral, nothing daunted, ran up the
                  steps, his officers following close behind, and seized the Commodore by the hand,
                  and gave him such a shaking as made him tremble again. General Gore, on reaching
                  the 'poop,' was grossly insulted by the first lieutenant of the Princeton, who, in
                  the most cool and deliberate manner, told him, if he would come below, he would
                  give him 'something to eat.'
               "The General, in reply, said he would like to catch him at it. And to show his
                  courage he went below, when one of the middies at the foot of the companion-way
                  took aim at the General with a champagne bottle, and let drive the contents into
                  the General's glass. The Mayor of Halifax, and members of the Corporation, got
                  into a skirmish with the marines. It seems that Alderman Nugent asked the
                  boatswain, in a sneering sort of way, if they had any turtle on board. The answer
                  was, 'No—but we've got turtle soup, if that will do for you.' The Mayor stepped
                  up, and said he would rather have turtle soup than fish any day. The
                  boatswain answered that he was tired of hearing so much said about fish. For his
                  own part, he didn't see anything in fish to fight about. If it was mutton, he was
                  on hand for anybody. One word led on to another—by this time the steamer was
                  crowded from stem to stern—until at length there was a general row; every man
                  became a body corporate, and pitched into himself with right good will.
               "The ladies got snappish on account of their husbands, and in turn pitched into
                  the officers of the Princeton with their—eyes. The sailors were piped to quarters.
                     Pistols were freely used. The 'big guns' were charged and fired,
                  doing much damage to the feelings of the company, in the way of compliments. In
                  short, it was the greatest battle ever fought in Halifax harbor, real or
                     sham. After quarrelling in this way, until eight o'clock in the
                  evening, and destroying all the eatables that could be found on board the
                  Princeton, the invaders retired, and left the Commodore and officers to their
                  reflections. The retreat was effected in gallant style—so say the
                  ladies. It is said that the Commodore has sent a despatch to Washington, informing
                  the authorities of the insult received. We earnestly entreat that our American
                  contemporaries will fully discuss this serious matter, on account of the honor of
                  the 'stars and stripes, to say nothing of the 'fish story.'
               "'Now, Mr. Pierce, in this manner was a very grave question—the fish question, in
                  which many millions had been spent for the purpose of pleasing diplomacy—put
                  through a course of settlement. When will the wisdom of the two most free and
                  enlightened nations of the earth devise some plan of mutual compromise, by which
                  the interests of their subjects may be settled without giving to pedantic
                  diplomatists the means to for ever keep alive an international agitation, which
                  can only give out food for the very smallest of demagogues? We cannot and must not
                  quarrel with Uncle John; no, our birthright, our freedom-loving spirit, our
                  indomitable energy, our kindred institutions, and the interests of our commerce,
                  should make stronger the bonds of peace. We must, in defiance of that pitiable
                  ambition of political tools, who so interrupt the harmony that should exist
                  between nations kindred in spirit and interests, continue our friendly relations.
                  Let England lay aside her restrictions on commerce; let her apply to a better
                  purpose those millions spent in useless attempts to enforce the observance of laws
                  which only serve to cripple her energies; and let a policy mutually liberal serve
                  to elevate that international forbearance which is the father of the greatest
                  good, thought I. At this juncture, Mr.
                  Pierce's black pig, always found where he was not wanted, was discovered in the
                  after cabin, which he disputed with every one who attempted to enter, until at
                  length it was voted that I should capture him, and convey him safely home to Mr.
                  Pierce at Washington:—which, be it understood, was done, though not without a
                  struggle."
