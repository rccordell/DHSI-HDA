            TO THE HONORABLE STEVENSON ARCHER, OF MARYLAND, This Volume is Inscribed, IN TOKEN OF
               A FRIENDSHIP WHICH HAS BEEN AS PLEASANT AS IT HAS BEEN LASTING.
         
         
            
            PREFACE.
            
               IT would perhaps be near the truth to say, that, outside of Louisiana
               and Texas, not a greater proportion than one in ten thousand of our citizens ever
               heard of the Gachupin War, which took place in the latter State nearly sixty years
               ago, and with which this story is intimately connected. Yet many of the events of
               that war are of the deepest interest; and it may not misbecome the author to state
               why, being of so much interest, they are not more widely known.
            One reason doubtless is, that nearly all the Americans who were engaged in it, fell
               on the different fields of battle. Then again, the war between the United States and
               Great Britain broke out simultaneously with this Gachupin war; in consequence of
               which coincidence the exciting events at home so absorbed the people and the press,
               that the fierce struggle which was raging just beyond our borders, commanded but
               little attention. The mails seldom penetrated into that wild and remote region;
               newspaper correspondents were exceedingly rare thereabouts, and newspapers themselves
               were almost unknown within several hundred miles of the scene of operations. Events,
               therefore, were but meagrely chronicled at the time.
            Moreover, it was then, as it still is, notoriously difficult cult to get out of those south-western border-men a
               connected and detailed account of their own exploits; and as they were even poorer
               writers than talkers when they themselves were the theme, they have since dropped
               off, one by one, without giving the public their experience,—until it is quite
               probable there is not now a single one remaining who served throughout that war.
            The above state of things, it is hoped, may serve, in some sort, as an apology for a
               larger proportion of historical matter being admitted into this story than is usually
               embraced in works of fiction not avowedly historical. There are only two notable
               instances in the volume of the author venturing to draw on his imagination to supply
               a hiatus existing in the records. One is the extraordinary conduct and the
               immediately following, if not resulting, death of Colonel Magee, the commander of the
               patriot army during the first half of the war: (one account says he died of
               consumption—another, that he killed himself.) The other instance is the butchery, in
               cold blood, at San Antonio de Bexar, of fourteen prominent Spanish officers and
               officials who had been captured, and the trial of the perpetrators thereof. In both
               these instances of the author's attempt to substitute invention for lost facts, it is
               hoped that the characterization of the individuals concerned is sufficiently
               consistent with their historical characters.
            A closing word regarding the title of the book. I had called it "The Neutralians;"
               and still think this the most appropriate name it could have had. But, with all the
               sensitiveness of a new author, I fancied that, if it should go forth so named, "The
               Hub Bub Boo Exterminator" (published in Hub Bub Boo City, by Allgood, Nobad &
               Co.) might perpetrate a critique on it, beginning somewhat after the following savage
               fashion, to wit:
            "It is evident that this fellow is on a new trail: hence he very
               fittingly calls his book, 'The Neutralians,'—which is, indeed, about the only
               original idea in the whole volume." And so on, and so forth.
            With this incubus of utter annihilation threatening, I was fain to change the title
               to "More Than She Could Bear." To be sure, the aforesaid literary Mohawk may object
               even to this. "Now, we don't exactly know," he may growl, "how much 'She
               Could Bear,' as we merely glance at the books which we criticise,—but we do know that
               this story is More Than We Could Bear, if we were to try our 'level
               best.'"
            Well, we will let the second name stand, anyhow. Perhaps the savage may not think of
               this, after all our tremor cordis. Nay,
               peradventure he may not even deign to notice us at all!

               INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.
               
                  
                     
                        There may be matter in it.
                     
                     
                        —Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  FEW persons now living, except those in the immediate vicinity, know
                  anything about the history of a certain narrow strip of territory lying between
                  Texas and Louisiana, which for fourteen years was designated as "The Neutral
                  Ground." Nay, few have ever heard of its existence; and yet, during a century and
                  a half, many interesting events occurred within its narrow bounds,—all the more
                  interesting, indeed, to such as are conversant with them, from the very fact that
                  they are known to but few. And inasmuch as the events of this story transpired for
                  the most part within its borders, it behooves me to treat of it here, so far as is
                  requisite to the proper understanding of what I have to relate: although what I
                  have to relate embraces but a year or two of its one hundred and fifty years of
                  eventful history.
               The very name, Neutral Ground, essentially implies that there has been, between
                  two or more parties, a dispute for territory, resulting in a compromise, temporary
                  or other. In this case, the contestants had been Spain and France. According to
                  the international laws agreed upon by European governments, and designed to have
                  special application to discoveries made in America, there can be no manner of doubt that France had
                  established a clear right to all the territory thereabouts. By those laws, if any
                  number of Europeans took possession of a coast, it gave the nation to which they
                  owed allegiance an enduring right to all the territory watered by streams
                  disemboguing along that coast, even to their minutest ramifications and their
                  fountain-heads.
               Robert Cavalier, a bold knight of Normandy, in France, and commonly known as La
                  Salle, left Canada in the year 1682 with a few companions, and, reaching the
                  headwaters of the Illinois, floated down that stream to the Mississippi and thence
                  to the mouth of the great river,—taking, as he went along, solemn and formal
                  possession in the name of his most serene and most august Majesty Louis XIV.
               That monarch was so well pleased with La Salle's exploit—which the latter took
                  precious good care to report at the court in person—that he fitted out for him a
                  fine fleet, having on board several hundred colonists, that he might extend still
                  further the already magnificent possessions of France. Accordingly, in the year
                  1684, La Salle sailed forth, and in due time landed, though unintentionally, on
                  the coast of Texas. Here he established his colony and built a fort for its
                  protection, which he called, in honor of his royal patron, Fort St. Louis. A few
                  years afterwards he was waylaid and basely murdered by two of his own men,
                  somewhere in the vicinity of the Neutral Ground, whilst engaged in exploring the
                  interior of the country.
               By these various acts of settlement and exploration the whole of Texas, as well as
                  Louisiana, became, beyond all question, according to the international law above
                  referred to, the rightful property of the French king.
               On the other hand, the Spaniards claimed that some "tall admiral" of theirs, a
                  hundred years before, had caught a glimpse of that coast through his spy-glass,
                  from the main-top, as he glided past with his fleet in search of the El Dorado.
                  This fleeting title was all they had to urge.
               To be sure, after a few years, the fort which La Salle had built was taken by the
                  Indians, and all the garrison, as well as the colonists, butchered, or carried off
                  into a hopeless captivity, leaving no French settler in all the land; while, soon
                  after the massacre, the Spaniards brought from Mexico a few soldiers and friars,
                  and established one or two missions in Western Texas for the conversion of the
                  wild Indians. In about three years, however, these missions were abandoned, and
                  for seventeen years Texas lapsed wholly under the aborigines. So that the original
                  claim, made good by La Salle, had certainly not been invalidated up to that
                  time.
               In the year 1714, Luis San Denis, a restless and daring Frenchman, was sent by the
                  French Governor of Louisiana to establish the post of Natchitoches, that country
                  being then a wilderness. Leaving a few men at that point, San Denis proceeded,
                  with about a dozen others, to the Rio Grande. Here he married a Spanish lady, and
                  soon afterwards prevailed upon some of her relations to accompany him back to
                  Louisiana, for the purpose of erecting a smuggling-post east of the Sabine, the
                  king of Spain having prohibited all manner of trade on pain of death.
               Along with these came other Spaniards, with the holier intention of founding
                  various missions. And there, right in the heart of what was subsequently the
                  Neutral Ground, smuggling and praying went swimmingly on, side by side, doubtless
                  aiding each other very materially. The post and mission were located at a place
                  called Adayes,—from the name of the surrounding tribe of Indians,—fifteen miles
                     directly rectly west from
                  Natchitoches, and about the same distance from the Sabine.
               Another post, and a mission, were soon established by the Spaniards near the
                  present town of Nacogdoches, about thirty miles from the eastern bank of the same
                  river; and, indeed, throughout the southern and western portions of Texas the
                  Franciscan friars re-established their old missions and built new ones. From that
                  time, Texas, although still rightfully—that is, by the law of nations—belonging to
                  France, was virtually wrested from her by Spanish occupation. San Denis, to be
                  sure, in 1719, drove the Spaniards from their post, at Adayes, and forced them
                  beyond the Sabine; but they soon returned, escorted by the Marquis of Aguayo,
                  Governor of Texas and Coahuila, at the head of five hundred mounted soldiers, and
                  ever afterwards claimed jurisdiction for Spain as far as the Arroyo Honda (Deep
                  Creek), in the eastern portion of the Neutral Ground, and only a few miles west of
                  Natchitoches.
               In 1761, France, finding herself fearfully prostrated by a long war with England,
                  which had been brought about by boundary disputes in America, applied to Spain,
                  her ally in that war, to protect Louisiana from British encroachments, then
                  threatening that territory. Spain being by this time reduced to a pitiable
                  condition, was not equal to the task of guarding her own huge, crumbling fabric,
                  much less could she afford to assume the dignity of a protectorate over another's
                  dominions. She, therefore, respectfully, but firmly, declined the meedless
                  honor.
               Accordingly, the French king, brought to still worse straits by the continuance of
                  the war, ceded to Spain all his immense territory west of the Mississippi, from
                  its head to its mouth, for the purpose, it would seem, of preventing its falling
                  into the hands of the British; for very soon afterwards she was forced to cede to
                  England all her possessions east of the river—out of which half a dozen powerful
                  States have since been carved—and Canada into the bargain.
               At this time the entire population of Texas, leaving out the roving savages, did
                  not amount to more than fifteen hundred, one half of whom were Europeans or of
                  European descent, the remainder being converted and domiciliated Indians.
               The annexation of Louisiana to Spain wrought quite a revolution in this remote
                  region. Nacogdoches, before but a missionary station, began to assume the
                  appearance of a town; and by means of an increasing commerce the citizens amassed
                  considerable wealth and improved in politeness. On the other hand, Adayes, which
                  contained about forty houses, began to languish, and continued to decline until
                  1790, when it was deserted by the whites; and as none remained but converted
                  Indians, these were sent to some distant mission. On the whole, Texas, at the
                  close of the eighteenth century, had advanced but little from her condition of
                  eighty years previous.
               In the year 1800, Spain and France made a secret treaty, by which the former
                  agreed to retrocede Louisiana so soon as the latter should have effected certain
                  political changes in Europe redounding to Spain's advantage. In the following
                  year, France having complied with her part of the specified terms, the promised
                  transfer was made, with the understanding, however, as there is good reason to
                  suppose, that there should be no transfer of the same by France to the United
                  States on any condition whatsoever.
               This retrocession was no doubt made, and this proviso inserted, by Spain, for the
                  express purpose of establishing a barrier between her own possessions and the
                  United States, whose citizens she very much feared would infuse into the oppressed masses of Mexico the dangerous
                  spirit of liberty that had actuated them to throw off the yoke of
                  Great Britain, which could not compare in severity with the yoke which she herself
                  was pressing upon the submissive necks of the Mexicans. In fact, when France had
                  offered her this magnificent present, in 1762, she was for a time loth to accept
                  it, for the very reason that its acceptance would remove the barrier, even then
                  desired, but which subsequent events had made absolutely essential, she thought,
                  to the retention of her colonial possessions. It was not long, however, before she
                  began to look this huge gift-horse in the mouth; and after a thirty years'
                  inspection she returned it as above stated.
               In 1803, Napoleon, who then ruled France, fancying he perceived certain signs that
                  Great Britain, with whom he was at war, was about to pounce upon his newly
                  acquired territory, came suddenly to terms with President Jefferson's agents, with
                  whom he had been higgling for some time, and through them sold Louisiana to the
                  United States for the sum of fifteen millions of dollars. This act displeased
                  Spain no little, inasmuch as it not only brought the pestilent Americans, whom she
                  so much dreaded, in direct contact with her impressible Mexican population, but at
                  the same time showed unmistakably that she had sustained a dead loss of no
                  inconsiderable amount, which might as well have gone, a year before, to replenish
                  her depleted coffers, as now those of France.

                  I AM sorry I cannot begin my story with the impressive spectacle of
                  the "Solitary Horseman." Having, with the hope of accomplishing that very
                  difficult artistic arrangement, racked my imagination even to a point at which I
                  feared the effect of any further strain upon it, I am forced to abandon it, though
                  very loth, and can only promise to come as near the genuine thing as my poor
                  abilities and the circumstances that environ the case will admit of. Should I,
                  however, at any future day trouble my gentle readers with another tale, I hope, by
                  the assiduous culture of my æsthetic sense in the meanwhile, to produce the
                  thorough-bred article, instead of the very mongrel affair to be now presented.
               About daybreak, one autumn morning sixty years ago, a Mexican, belonging evidently
                  to the lower classes of the "blanketed nation," sleekly attired in so far as
                  greasiness of apparel could constitute him so, and withal bestriding a very
                  scrawny mule, trotted briskly into Natchitoches, which was at that time the only
                  town on the western frontier of Louisiana.
               
               This man's object was to convey to the commandant of the United States forces in
                  the town a note, soliciting a detachment of his command to escort across the
                  "Neutral Ground" a considerable train of pack-mules, together with their drivers
                  and proprietors.
               This Neutral Ground was brought into existence about five or six years before, as
                  a temporary compromise of those heated boundary disputes between the United States
                  and Spain, which commenced soon after the former had purchased Louisiana from
                  France, and continued for about a year, the United States claiming to the Sabine,
                  the Spanish authorities declaring themselves unwilling to yield a single foot of
                  territory west of Red River.
               This controversy had been carried on, with more or less asperity, for nearly a
                  century, between the two European powers just named, so that the United States
                  merely took up the matter at the precise point at which France had left it.
               In the year 1805 numerous outrages were committed by Spanish troops on American
                  citizens within the territory claimed by the United States. A scientific party,
                  sent out during that year by the President to explore Red River, was arrested by
                  the Spanish authorities and sent home. On another occasion several Americans were
                  seized a few miles from Natchitoches, and sent under guard three hundred miles to
                  western Texas. Again, Spanish troops tore down the American flag, which was
                  displayed a short distance from the town just named, and trampled it under foot.
                  All these insulting acts were perpetrated at points clearly within the limits of
                  the new purchase, and could not be suffered to remain long unnoticed by the United
                  States government.
               Accordingly, the commander of the United States forces in that region was ordered
                  by his government to expel the offenders, unless they could be induced to withdraw
                  by peaceful negotiation.
               The correspondence which now passed between the respective commanders was spun out
                  to a year's duration. During this whole period the opposing armies confronted each
                  other, and there was more than once imminent danger of a bloody arbitrament.
                  Prudent counsels, however, in the end prevailed; and it was agreed that until the
                  two contending governments should establish a boundary that should be mutually
                  satisfactory, there should be a neutral territory not to be encroached upon by
                  either party, except in certain extraordinary cases, which were duly specified in
                  the agreement,—an arrangement which soon received the sanction of both
                  governments.
               The scope of country thus fixed upon to be kept inviolate was a wilderness almost
                  entirely covered with timber. It extended from the Sabine, on the west, to a
                  creek, called by the Spaniards the Arroyo Honda, on the east.
               This creek is the result of one of the many freaks of Red River. It is projected
                  from the parent stream just below the southern terminus of the Great Raft, and
                  after spreading out into an extensive sheet of water, then and perhaps still known
                  as Spanish Lake, courses sluggishly around in a sweep of some twenty miles, and
                  re-enters the river just below the town of Natchitoches, thus forming quite a
                  large island, on which that town is situated.
               Through the middle of this territory, and bearing nearly north and south, runs a
                  slightly elevated ridge, which slopes very gently on either side, the western
                  slope giving origin and passage to the numerous brooks which find their noiseless
                  way to the Sabine, while the eastern declivity accommodates such as flow into the
                  Arroyo Honda and into the other capricious wanderings of the great Red.
               From the Arroyo Honda to the Sabine—respectively the eastern and western limits of this neutral
                  territory—the distance was about twenty miles. Its extent from north to south, in
                  which direction the limits were rather vaguely defined, may have been about thirty
                  miles, so that the whole territory may be said to have approximated in extent two
                  counties of average size in the old States.
               The great road that led from Natchitoches directly west to Nacogdoches, which was
                  then the only town of any note in eastern Texas, ran through the heart of the
                  Neutral Ground. This part of the road was only a short section of the great
                  thoroughfare running from Natchez on the Mississippi entirely through to San
                  Antonio de Bexar in western Texas, and along which for nearly a hundred years had
                  passed all the illicit trade that was carried on between the citizens of Louisiana
                  on the one hand and the Spaniards and Mexicans on the other.
               No sooner had the exact nature of this transaction between the two nations spread
                  abroad, than adventurers of all kinds, and from all directions, flocked to the
                  Neutral Ground. Their motives for this immigration were various. The fugitive from
                  justice went thither, because, not having yet been able to find a country where
                  the law suited his peculiar bent, he would fain seek one where there was no law at
                  all. The would-be plunderer, whose feeble practical discrimination betwixt
                     meum and tuum had thus far triumphed only by reason of the constantly
                  overhanging terrors of justice, went from much the same motive. The desperado went
                  because he might reasonably hope to find there other desperadoes, with whom he
                  could cut and slash, day in and day out, to his heart's content. The romantic
                  youth went, because his heated fancy had limned it forth in pleasing guise, such
                  as it really was not. The stripling of ardent temperament, who had been reading
                  the wild tales of Robin Hood, Dick Turpin, et id omne
                     genus, went as the necessary consequence of such temperament and such
                  reading. And, though last, not by any means least, some of Lafitte's men, of all
                  nations and of all grades of ferocity, sated probably with the monotony of
                  Barrataria, at that time the great buccaneer's headquarters, and being resolved to
                  indulge in a little variety further in the interior of the country, deserted at
                  once their leader and their old haunts, and flew to the novelties of NEUTRALIA, as
                  I shall venture to call this wild region.
               Some of the men composing this heterogeneous mass brought with them their wives,
                  such as they were, and their mistresses, and there in the dense woods erected huts
                  to shelter them against that genial clime's few days of inclement weather.
               If these freebooters cultivated the soil at all, it was only to a very limited
                  extent. They were such men as would rather die by the hangman than live by the
                  sweat of their brows. Thus established, they at once fell to work, like the
                  earnest devils that they were, and drew their subsistence from the traders who, as
                  before stated, passed over the great thoroughfare which bisected the Neutral
                  Ground. Sometimes they only levied black-mail on them, and then let them go with
                  so much as was left; but much oftener they would appropriate to their own use the
                  whole available property captured.
               All this they could do with a slighter degree of compunction,—supposing such men
                  to know of degrees at all in any matter of the kind,—from the notorious fact that
                  the traders whom they plundered were not themselves engaged in a legitimate
                  business, the laws of Spain positively interdicting, under pain of death, all
                  kinds of trading whatsoever with citizens of the United States. This prohibition
                  arose mainly from the fear that intercourse with a free people might finally
                  engender among the ignorant classes of
                  Mexico rebellious notions against that lawful sovereign, who, although he ruled
                  them by "divine right," ruled them with almost diabolical severity.
               This has been called "the oyster policy"; and as the trader was engaged in opening
                  Spain's oysters, the freebooter could see no great harm in snatching them away,
                  when opened, from one to whom they did not really belong, and whom he regarded as
                  in no respect better than himself.
               To be sure, the Spanish authorities just over the border winked at the unlawful
                  trade thus carried on; but inasmuch as it was well known that connivance was
                  invariably purchased by the trader at no inconsiderable price, the freebooter
                  might argue, as a salve to his conscience, if indeed his conscience ever chafed on
                  such occasions, that this collusion, so far from mending the matter, only made it
                  worse for the other side. It proved that the Spanish official's moral record in
                  the case was even more blurred than his own, since he himself only fleeced the
                  trader, while the official not only did this, but fleeced his sovereign to boot,
                  and that, too, while professing for him the most "intense loyalty."
               Thus does man stray widely from the right path so soon as he repudiates the
                  guidings of conscience. Once arrived at that melancholy point when he is fain to
                  justify his own misdeeds by the mere citation of similar or even worse misdeeds of
                  those around him, with the view of a comparison favorable to himself, there comes
                  a speedy end to his moral sense.
               These bold mosstroopers, though to the last degree impatient of all the restraints
                  of law, could not long endure the complete state of anarchy in which they at first
                  found themselves,—every man acting for himself. They, therefore, soon organized,
                  by selecting a leader, who appointed his subordinates, and established his
                  outposts and his headquarters,—the last not expected to be permanent, but to be
                  shifted according to convenience, or as emergencies should arise.
               Their trespasses they confined almost entirely to Spanish and Mexican traders. In
                  fact, there were exceedingly few Americans who followed here the vocation of
                  trading, and these few scarcely ever suffered by such depredations, from the fact,
                  that the government to which they owed allegiance was held by the robbers in more
                  wholesome dread than that of Spain.
               Soon after they had fairly begun to show their hand, the Spanish force, stationed
                  on the west bank of the Sabine, crossed over and essayed the difficult task of
                  expelling them from the neutral limits. Being, however, sometimes boldly met, and
                  at other times ambuscaded amid the tangled growth of the country, with disastrous
                  result to themselves, they gave over the attempt.
               At length, on some American citizens being maltreated at their hands, a detachment
                  of United States troops was dispatched in pursuit of the offenders. But they were
                  nowhere to be found: the whole clan had vanished as effectually and mysteriously
                  as if some Roderick Dhu had waved them back to their sylvan fastnesses; and
                  although the troops swept the whole territory,—burning their houses and
                  fixtures,—they necessarily left the Ishmaelites themselves unscathed.
               Only a brief time elapsed before they were fixed as comfortably as ever, though
                  not in precisely the same localities,—the poor trader having meanwhile suffered
                  even more than before their punishment; for now they had not only to provide for
                  their present wants, but were also under the necessity of replacing their property
                  which had been destroyed by the military; and it was on the traders' possessions
                  alone that they would deign to draw for this purpose.
               
               The commander of the United States forces repeated this summary vengeance two or
                  three times; but finding that their habitations, which were mostly of the
                  flimsiest kind, sprang up again as if by magic, and were refitted and refurnished
                  solely at the poor trader's expense, he resolved to abandon the attempt,—at least
                  as long as they should confine their irregular levies to citizens of other
                  countries than his own; which, henceforward, for a long time, they were careful to
                  do.
               Under these circumstances, the only method promising safety to the trader, was, to
                  procure, at his own private expense, the services of an armed escort through the
                  Neutral Ground. The Spanish troops, having already had a rather bitter experience
                  in their several attempts to restrain the free action of those redoubtable heroes,
                  usually declined the honor of escorting,—unless, indeed, on such terms as the
                  trader could but ill afford; the amount demanded for their services, together with
                  the bribe claimed by the corrupt Spanish official, for his connivance at
                  smuggling—which it really was—being so exorbitant as not only to consume all the
                  profits, but to encroach very materially on the capital invested.
               The only really available plan, therefore, left for the trader was, to apply to
                  the United States commandant at Natchitoches for an escort. There were always some
                  dashing young officers at the post, who were willing to undertake this business by
                  turns, to relieve the monotony of garrison life on the frontier, as well as for
                  the sake of the adventure, and the dangers with which it was spiced. These
                  unsubstantial considerations were the officers' sole reward; though it was usually
                  understood that the trader should, to a reasonable extent, remunerate the men out
                  of his profits.
               It may, however, be here stated, that neither the officer nor his men regarded the
                  smuggler as occupying a place in the moral scale any great distance above the
                  pirates, from whose clutches they volunteered to protect him; and, in the event of
                  a collision, it could hardly be expected they would show any great stomach for the
                  fight, should there chance to be considerable odds against them, particularly if
                  their protégés—as they almost invariably
                  did—should take the precaution to hide their own precious bodies away in some safe
                  place, while the exciting sport was being indulged in.
               The messenger spoken of in the commencement of this chapter, had made his ride
                  across the Neutral Ground during the night wholly from prudential motives. He well
                  knew—as also did those who sent him—that the enterprising denizens thereof, should
                  they discover him in transitu, would introduce
                  themselves to him without form or ceremony, and force him to partake, for at least
                  several hours, of their peculiar hospitality, of which they were exceedingly
                  lavish so long as the fit was on them.
               Their usual mode of entertaining under such circumstances was to commence with
                  interrogatories, few in number, but very much to the point. In case of recusancy
                  on the part of the guest, he was suspended, first by the thumbs, then by the great
                  toes, and finally, should these methods fail to bring out what they had good
                  reason to believe was in him, by the neck. The queries propounded on such
                  occasions usually related to transactions in specie or bullion, in the movements
                  of which these "bulls" and "bears" of the forest seemed to take quite as intense
                  an interest as do the corresponding city brutes of the present day, who, by the
                  way, for aught that appears to the contrary, may be their lineal descendants.
               The Mexican rode up to a vacant lot opposite the commandant's headquarters, and
                  dismounting, hitched his mule and
                  disburdened him of the huge saddle. Rightly judging that there was no hope of
                  seeing, at so unseasonable an hour, the functionary whom he sought, he next set
                  about eating his breakfast, his night-long ride having doubtless given a keen edge
                  to his appetite. This breakfast consisted of a few tortillas, as the Mexicans call them, a peculiar sort of corn-cake,
                  heavy and unsavory, which he fished from his pocket.
               The mule, whose appetite may well be presumed to have been quite as keen as his
                  rider's, not getting anything to eat now, and apparently expecting nothing until
                  he should get back to the Sabine, some thirty miles distant, quietly lay down to
                  take a rest. His master soon followed his example, curling himself up on his
                  blanket, which he spread near the patient quadruped, using the saddle as a pillow.
                  So there, side by side, the one having had nothing at all to eat, the other as
                  near to nothing as may well be, they both fell asleep. The mule, like the true
                  philosopher that he seemed, no doubt considered this, with the single exception of
                  eating,—which was, in his own case at least, quite out of the question,—about as
                  well as could be done when suffering the pangs of hunger.
               One of the most astonishing things to Americans who have sojourned among Mexicans
                  is the small quantity, as well as the poor quality, of food which the lower
                  classes of that people consume. They seem to be content and even to thrive on a
                  diet that would bring an American to death's door. This extreme temperance on the
                  part of the Mexican results, doubtless, from his being too lazy to earn more by
                  labor than will barely supply his physical necessities, while on the other hand
                  there is no doubt that his more mercurial neighbor eats twice as much as is good
                  for him.
               But while the abstemiousness of the Mexican man is astonishing, that of his humble
                  servant the Mexican mule is little short of miraculous. He is caught feeding about
                  as seldom as the august emperor of Cathay, and appears to live, like the
                  ichneumon, by means of his lungs,—his stomach, if not an altogether useless
                  appendage, being designed only as the receptacle of such articles as no other
                  graminivorous animal will deign to touch.
               The Mexican was at length roused from his slumbers by the braying of the mule, who
                  having risen from the ground, took this method of announcing his readiness to go
                  back to the Sabine and get his breakfast.
               The sun by this time was two or three hours above the horizon, and the man,
                  starting to his elbow at the discordant sound made by the animal, and seeing the
                  commandant's office open, gave a great yawn, rose to his feet, shook himself,
                  donned his ragged sombrero, and with his long
                  matted hair standing out from beneath it in every direction, walked lazily across
                  the street and disappeared within the open door.

                           Sir, we are undone: these are the villains
                           That all the travellers do fear so much.

                        His incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be

                     —Twelfth Night.
                     
                  
               
               
                  AMONG the officers of the Natchitoches garrison at this time, the
                  fall of 1811, was Lieutenant Augustus Magee, who is said to have been remarkable
                  for his military talents, as well as for his energy of character and his
                     intrepidity trepidity. Happening to be
                  in the office when the commandant read the note which the Mexican handed him,
                  asking for an escort, the lieutenant forthwith volunteered to undertake the
                  service. His offer was at once accepted; and in less than an hour he was galloping
                  westward from the town, followed by half a dozen soldiers, together with the
                  bearer of the note, who, despite his vigorous efforts to urge on his lank and
                  graceless Rosinante—with the vision constantly before him of the grim outlaws that
                  might cut him off should he fail to keep pace with the rest,—was obliged to fall
                  far to the rear.
               The lieutenant found the Mexicans bivouacked at a place called Salitre Prairie, on
                  the Spanish side of the Sabine. Next morning at an early hour he started with his
                  convoy for Natchitoches.
               There was one piece of information regarding this convoy of which Magee was not
                  apprised,—the great amount, namely, of silver which was stowed away upon its dozen
                     aparejos, or pack-saddles. It would no doubt,
                  as the matter ended, have been greatly to the interest of the traders had they
                  imparted this secret to the commandant; for in that case Magee would most probably
                  have brought with him a much more numerous escort. But it was a part of their
                  standing policy to let no such precious secrets leak out, not even to the arrieros, or muleteers, who accompanied them
                  throughout the entire route. On the contrary, lest such rumor might reach the
                  acute ears of the Neutralians despite all honest precautions, they did not
                  hesitate, when approaching the dangerous locality, to resort to downright lying,
                  letting drop certain expressions, as if by sheer accident, to the effect that
                  their commodities were of unusually poor quality.
               It is nevertheless true that the men of the Neutral Ground generally knew, in
                  spite of these precautions, or perhaps sometimes by reason of them, when anything
                  promising much in the way of booty entered their territory. Peradventure they had
                  the same kind of "instinct" with regard to it which enabled Falstaff to recognize
                  the disguised prince. So often, indeed, did they pounce upon the silver-laden
                  trains, to the neglect of the less valuable ones, that it would seem the
                  traditional "little bird," which at times favors even the most abandoned of human
                  beings, had had his eye on the treasure from the time it was dug out of the bowels
                  of Mexico until it reached their borders, when he would fly across and sing to
                  them—not in greenbacks, but—in silvery notes, on which hint they would act.
               Be all this as it may, the party had scarcely got one third the distance to
                  Natchitoches before it was but too obvious that a transfer of the property to
                  other hands had become indispensable. This transfer took place in an incredibly
                  short space of time, within the horse-shoe bend of a little creek called La Nan.
                  The officer and his men, sauntering leisurely along, perhaps with too implicit
                  faith in the terror inspired by the great American name, had just crossed the
                  stream. When the traders had fairly entered the heel of the horse-shoe,—a
                  contented band of brothers, surrounded by their worldly possessions,—a score of
                  armed men suddenly advanced from the bank of the creek, and getting between the
                  train and the guard in front, fired a few shots, though probably with no intention
                  of hurting any one, since no one was struck.
               Magee of course glanced back on hearing these ominous reports in his rear; and
                  although he saw at once that he was greatly outnumbered by foes whose bravery he
                  could not question, would have made fight. In fact, he had faced his men about
                  with this view. Just then, however, he saw with chagrin every Mexican, instead of
                     attempting to use the arms with which
                  he was amply provided, leap, or rather tumble, from his saddle, and throw himself
                  flat and prone upon the ground,—a course which, as the lieutenant had before
                  heard, was habitually resorted to by the citizens of Mexico when surprised by
                  robbers, and which is even yet an every-day occurrence in that country, the object
                  of the peculiar procedure being not only to signify their entire submission, but
                  also that they would not even so much as look at their plunderers, and
                  consequently would not be able to identify them to the authorities.
               The brave officer, not a little disgusted by this come-put-your-foot-on-my-neck
                  conduct of those who doubtless hoped even at that moment that he would defend
                  their perishing property, as well as their miserable, cringing, crouching bodies,
                  wheeled his horse indignantly, with a contemptuous expression on his face, and
                  followed by his little squad, galloped back to Natchitoches.
               The robbers at once secured their plunder and hid it under the bank of the
                  adjoining creek; and after declaring that their "bank of La Nan," as they called
                  it with grim facetiousness, was closed for the present, went on their several ways
                  to await events. They very naturally supposed that the amount lost was large
                  enough to excite vigorous efforts for its recovery, as well as for the punishment
                  of the depredators themselves. Not the least of their fears was the apprehension
                  that a crisis in their financial affairs might be precipitated by what they termed
                  "a rush upon their newly established bank."
               It, however, very nearly came to pass that these apprehended efforts were not made
                  at all. The Spanish authorities affected to regard the whole responsibility—if,
                  indeed, there was any responsibility attaching to the protection of unlawful
                  trade—as resting solely with the Americans, who had undertaken the safe conduct of
                  this particular treasure; and that it was they, if any, who should make
                  amends.
               On the other hand, the American commandant cared but little about the matter,—its
                  only ugly feature being the precipitate flight of a United States officer without
                  striking a blow; which, although really justifiable, under the circumstances, when
                  fully explained, was liable to misinterpretation, unless redeemed by a return to
                  the charge, or in some other way. He, however, regarded this question as entirely
                  personal with Magee, whose courage he himself did not for a moment doubt. He
                  simply thought that if his lieutenant could stand it, he could.
               Magee on his part, had been so utterly disgusted by the cowardly conduct of those
                  whom he had deigned to take under the eagle's wing, that the bare thought of
                  returning to avenge their wrongs, or to restore their property, well-nigh
                  nauseated him. He was fain to let the whole thing go just as it stood, and
                  henceforth strove to dismiss it from his mind. The information which subsequently
                  reached Natchitoches, of the immense amount of treasure contained in the packs, so
                  far from bringing him regret for not having fought to save it, sent through his
                  breast something very like a thrill of satisfaction that so much treasure had
                  passed from such craven hands into those of men who, whatever their shortcomings,
                  had at least bravery to recommend them.
               The whole matter was in a fair way to terminate just here. Unfortunately, however,
                  a few days afterwards, Magee, on entering his room, which fronted on the street,
                  found, pushed under the door, a note, which he forthwith read, and found that it
                  was to the following effect: 
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "LA NAN, Sept. 3d, 1811.
                              
                              "LIEUT. MAGEE:—As I have business in town to-day, I will write you
                                 a few lines before leaving for that point, so that, in case I shall be prevented, by your
                                 absence, from conferring with you, I may leave at your office the
                                 substance of what I have to say.
                              "If your valuable services can be spared by your Government, I
                                 should like, of all things, to engage them for a season in a
                                 business for which I know, from recent representation, you are
                                 peculiarly fitted.
                              "We of the Neutral Ground, as you are probably aware, support
                                 ourselves (quite liberally too—so you need not decline my offer for
                                 fear of non-payment) by contributions levied on those rascally
                                 smugglers who infest our territory, and even threaten, at times, to
                                 corrupt its morals. Now, if you will only contract to act as
                                 permanent escort to those yellow-bellies, we can amass fortunes off
                                 of them in a short time, and you shall go snacks with us.
                              "Having every reason to think you will accept my offer, I shall
                                 proceed just as though the bargain was closed betwixt us, and give
                                 you some wholesome instructions. When you are escorting a treasure
                                 of unusual value, on approaching a point which affords peculiar
                                 facilities for an ambuscade, be sure to push on with your guard a
                                 considerable distance ahead of the convoy, and, as soon as two or
                                 three of us show ourselves, take your sabre in your hand and your
                                 heart in your mouth, instructing your men to do the same, and make
                                 off, quite out of the way, as if for dear life,—thus leaving the
                                 coast entirely clear for us to operate at our leisure.
                              "However, as I had the pleasure of hearing of your rare
                                 performances only a few days ago in this vicinity, which redounded
                                 so much to our advantage, any further directions could avail but
                                 little; and even those given above are perhaps superfluous. In
                                 fact, you played so beautifully into our hands on that occasion,
                                 that some of my boys make no doubt you expected the offer which I
                                 have just made you would follow as a matter of course. In other and
                                 plainer words, they think you acted as you did for the express
                                 purpose of securing said offer. I, however, choose to differ with
                                 them, and hope you will excuse me for saying, that I think it was
                                 sheer cowardice that carried you so rapidly from the scene.
                              "Had this not been my view of the case, I should never have
                                 ventured to make you this offer. We must have, for this business,
                                 such an arrant coward that he cannot possibly come up to the
                                 sticking point, however much his honor and his reputation may be
                                 staked on it; and I am convinced you can no more tarry in the face
                                 of danger, than night at the coming of the sun. So, you are the man
                                 for our money,—if, as I said before, your Government can only be
                                 induced to dispense with your valuable services.
                              
                                 "Hoping that you will soon report in person, "I have the
                                    honor to be "Your humble servant,
                                 "GATEWOOD."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "'Report in person'?" exclaimed Magee, rising from his seat with tremendous
                  energy. "I will, by ——!"
               I omit the oath, in consideration of the fact that the lieutenant was but little
                  addicted to the utterance of profane language,—hoping that the reader, if he
                  cannot quite pardon his isolated offence, will at least allow it to have been
                  materially extenuated by the circumstances which called it forth.
               Magee went straight to the commandant. Without allusion to the letter from the
                  lord of the Neutral Ground, and without betraying a sign of any unusual
                  excitement, he asked for twenty men, to do battle with the Ishmaelites. That
                  functionary—although surprised at his request, now that the whole thing had
                  settled down into comparative quiet—made no inquiry into the subject, but readily
                  granted the detachment, with the additional favor that he might pick his men.

                           Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
                           He did oppose his foe.

                        I'll be reveng'd on the whole pack of you.

                        Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?

                  MAGEE got his men together that same evening; and, after explaining
                  his object, and telling them they must expect no child's play, gave orders that
                  their arms should be put in perfect condition, and appointed the place of
                  rendezvous, and the time of meeting at daybreak next morning.
               He met them at the hour named, and they started on their expedition. As soon as
                  they were fairly beyond the outskirts of the town, he halted his little command at
                  a suitable spot, and drawing forth the insolent epistle, read it to them without
                  any comment whatever. In selecting his men, he had been careful to embrace all who
                  were with him on the unfortunate occasion of which the letter treated. On hearing
                  the contents of the communication, all were made very indignant at the charge of
                  cowardice, which they knew to be wholly unmerited, and in very emphatic terms
                  expressed their determination to prove the contrary, to the satisfaction even of
                  the maligner himself, if they could but come up with him.
               It was not long before an opportunity—though not altogether a fair one—presented,
                  for the relative test of mettle. After going a few miles, they met an unlucky
                  pedestrian, who had been overhauled by the outlaws. They had robbed him, he said,
                  of a valuable horse, but had taken nothing from his person; This man, an American,
                  on learning the object of the expedition, became at once eager to guide the squad
                  to the point where, about an hour before, he had involuntarily ceased to be an
                  equestrian. He said there were about fifty of them bivouacked around a spring;
                  that they had no guards out; and that they could be easily surprised.
               This was all very good news to Magee, and his men heard it with almost equal
                  satisfaction. The Lieutenant would have preferred a less disparity of force; for
                  his intention was, if he could have met Gatewood with anything like equal numbers,
                  to make a fair hand-to-hand fight, hoping himself to engage that redoubtable chief
                  in single combat, and wash out, with his blood, the base stigma which the latter
                  had essayed to cast upon his good name-or perish in the attempt. Inasmuch,
                  however, as they so greatly outnumbered his force, it would have been sheer
                  madness to attempt anything but a surprise, and that about as complete as it could
                  be made.
               The very helpless condition in which the brigands, usually so vigilant, were
                  found, arose probably from the fact that they had every reason to think the
                  retributive storm lately expected to burst upon them, had, by this time, blown
                  quietly over. At any rate, so defenceless did they appear to Magee, when he first
                  caught sight of them—strolling, and lying at random, about the woods, some talking
                  and laughing, a few of them asleep, the greater part at a distance from their
                  arms—that, although his first impulse was to order the discharge of a deadly
                  volley into their midst, his feelings revolted at what seemed to be little better
                  than a cold-blooded butchery. He therefore—in consideration, too, of their having
                  forborne to fire into his squad, at La Nan, under circumstances somewhat similar,
                  which they might easily have done had
                  they been at all blood-thirsty—after dismounting his men, ordered them to charge,
                  without firing, unless there was fair prospect of resistance,—but to capture as
                  many as possible.
               The freebooters were taken so completely by surprise, that they at once rushed off
                  into the tangled growth around, every man for himself,—most of them without so
                  much as taking their arms with them. About a dozen, under threat of being shot
                  down, stayed their headlong course and were secured as prisoners.
               Had resistance been made, and blood shed on both sides, it is probable Magee would
                  not have adopted the course which he now did. But so disappointed was he at not
                  having a fight with these bandits,—but more especially at the escape of their
                  leader, who, after branding him as a coward, did not see fit to tarry long enough
                  to allow him an opportunity to prove the reverse,—that, as a vent to his
                  feelings,—or, peradventure, as a salve to them,—he ordered his men to strip the
                  prisoners, tie them up to the various surrounding trees, and whip them in order to
                  make them divulge the hiding-place of the stolen silver. This order the men obeyed
                  with a will, hoping probably for a liberal share of the treasure.
               Whether this was justifiable or not, it was, to say the worst, only fighting the
                  devil with his own weapons,—since this identical mode had often been resorted to
                  by these same prisoners, when they were fain to extort disclosures of a kindred
                  character from such wayfaring wights as were unfortunate enough to fall into their
                  clutches.
               This flagellation failing to elicit the desired information, he next, with the
                  same view, directed a live coal to be passed along their naked backs divers times.
                  Still they kept firm hold of their secret, not divulging a single scrap of
                  information bearing in any way whatever on the question propounded; and although
                  they made but little moan during the proceeding, threats of vengeance were written
                  in black lines on their writhing faces far more clearly than if traced with
                  ink.
               It must here be made known that the Lieutenant was not at all dilatory in his
                  attempt to settle this little account with the freebooters. Knowing full well
                  that, should he tarry long in these sylvan abodes, the tables might be completely
                  turned on him,—and that, too, with a vengeance,— he dispatched the business in
                  hand with his usual energy.
               Struck with admiration, perhaps, at their unflinching fortitude, he thought at
                  first of releasing about half of them. Considering it his bounden duty, however,
                  to make a signal example of them in a more public way than he had already done by
                  means of his improvised inquisition, he concluded to take them with him to
                  Natchitoches, to be tried by the civil authorities.—Their trial soon resulted in
                  their being safely lodged in the penitentiary.
               This little raid of Magee's turned out much better than there was any good reason
                  to expect; for, although it was not the policy of the Neutralians to fight under
                  ordinary circumstances, if they could well avoid it, yet had that officer found
                  them on the alert, they would probably have worsted him in the conflict, even with
                  equal numbers. They were a band of brave men—many of them recklessly so—who not
                  only were well acquainted with all the intricacies of their stronghold, but who
                  thoroughly understood that peculiar mode of fighting, since designated as
                  bushwhacking, and with which—as it is not embraced in any work on tactics—neither
                  regular soldiers nor their officers could be expected to be very conversant.
               Notwithstanding his triumph over the powers of the Neutral Ground, Magee continued
                  to chafe under the charge of personal cowardice, which Gatewood had so
                     insolently preferred against him. So
                  that, a day or two after his affair with the brigands, he indited to that leader a
                  note of the following purport:

                              "CAPTAIN GATEWOOD: I did myself the honor to call on you the other
                                 day, to 'report for duty,' as you requested. Just at the precise
                                 moment, however, when I rode up to your headquarters, and had every
                                 reason to expect a warm reception, you had such a press of business
                                 in the opposite direction, and started off at such a rapid rate to
                                 attend to it, that I found it impossible to come up to you,
                                 although I spared no effort to do so.
                              "Inasmuch, however, as I don't think it well to allow my
                                 aspirations to be quenched by a single failure, I hope you may find
                                 it perfectly convenient to name to my friend, who will hand you
                                 this, a time and place when and where we may meet.
                              
                                 "Your ob't serv't,
                                 "AUGUSTUS W. MAGEE, "1st Lieut. U. S. A."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Here was a cartel of mortal defiance ready to be hurled at the grim chieftain of
                  the Neutral Ground, who had the name among his followers of being the best
                  swordsman and pistol-shot in the whole south-western country.
               The difficulty was now to get conveyance for the note; for it may well be believed
                  that few men would be willing thus to beard the lion in his den. Magee carried the
                  note in his pocket a whole day, during which time he solicited several of his
                  brother officers—separately and privately, of course—for a favor in that line.
                  They all, after some initiatory hemming and hawing, intimated that he would be
                  degrading himself to fight with a robber, whose proper place was the penitentiary;
                  that he had better let the matter drop; together with much other advice of the
                  same tenor; and invariably wound up by respectfully but firmly declining the
                  honor.
               As a last resort, he applied to the second lieutenant of his company, whose
                  interest it obviously was to bring the combatants together, since he would go up a
                  step, should the other "go up the spout." This officer also refusing to act, even
                  more emphatically than the others—perhaps for the very reason that it was his
                  interest not to refuse—Magee became greatly exercised as to the
                  course he should adopt.
               A day's incubation over the matter, however, hatched out a plan, which, desperate
                  though it seemed, he resolved to attempt at once. Relying upon the probability
                  that he was not well enough known to Gatewood, or to any of his men, to be
                  recognized by them, if disguised,—they having, so far as he knew, never yet seen
                  him, except at a distance,—he determined to deliver the challenge himself, as
                  Lieutenant Magee's friend. Accordingly, after cutting off his beard and much of
                  his long hair, he put aside his uniform, and donning citizen's dress, set off,
                  alone, in quest of his foe; having first obtained from the commandant the
                  necessary verbal leave of absence, with the gratuitous remark, thrown out as a
                  blind, that he was going to take a little jaunt into the country, by way of
                  variety.

                  AFTER a long search in that vicinity where the headquarters of the
                  bandits were reported to be, Magee came within full sight of the camp, at the same
                  time that he was halted by a sentinel, whom he had descried from a distance,
                  through the trees, pacing to and fro.
               This camp, called Camp Wildwood, embraced two or three dozen tents, pitched with
                  but little regard to order, in the wood, at a point where it had been made open by
                  the careful clearing away of the undergrowth. The men were engaged in all
                  conceivable modes of both action and inaction. Some were lounging on the ground,
                  sleeping, or smoking, or listlessly whiling away their time in the enjoyment of
                  such day-dreams as might arise without any exertion on their part, to beget them.
                  One or two groups were sitting on their blankets, spread beneath the trees,
                  betting excitedly over a game of poker, or seven up,—several bystanders looking as
                  intently over their shoulders as though life hung on the result. In front of one
                  of the tents a trim-looking youth was sitting on a log, sawing from a fiddle some
                  "double-quick" tune, while two other men, his exact opposites in appearance, were
                  hard at work on a ho-down down," kicking up in his face dust enough, one might
                  suppose, not only to clog the instrument, but to choke the performer to death.
                  Another musician, apparently more disposed to solitude, was sitting apart under a
                  sort of natural bower fantastically formed by a trailing vine, indulging in flute
                  exercise, the soft tones floating pleasantly in upon the discordant scene. One was
                  kindling a fire, probably for cooking the mid-day meal, as a companion was slicing
                  a few pieces from the fresh skinned carcass of a bear suspended from a limb near
                  at hand. Here one was re-stretching the ropes of his tent, which had become too
                  slack. Hard by him, another was tanning a deer-skin by the Indian process,—that
                  is, by smoking it underground; a small hole being dug for the purpose. Yonder, a
                  half-dozen whooping, rollicking fellows seemed to be having a good time over a
                  demijohn. They would now and then attempt snatches of song, but their tongues
                  having become quite too thick for harmonious utterance,—if, indeed, when at their
                  best, they had any music in their souls,—the attempt would end in a universal
                  shout, intended probably as a chorus, and the performers themselves being the
                  judges, no doubt answering every purpose as such.
               Yonder move two young women, once pretty, doubtless, but having now a hardened
                  cast of countenance. Each bears a rude basket on her arm, containing clothing for
                  men, or some handiwork, the result of her own industry. They are the mistresses or
                  wives of some of the men, and have just come in from the shanties,—where they are
                  kept, a mile or two from the camp,—with the hope of selling these trifles. Though
                  the men, as they sauntered along, were by no means choice either in their
                  language, or in the substance of what they said, or of the jokes they cracked with
                  them, their cheeks seemed callous, and showed no tinge of either shame or
                  indignation.
               
               There were a few horses tied to limbs or saplings in various parts of the woods,
                  while dogs of all degrees of hybridity, some the better and others evidently the
                  worse for the mixture, were stretched about the premises, or were snuffing among
                  the leaves for the remains of their masters' last feast.
               Such was the varied scene of which Magee caught a bird's-eye view as he passed
                  along.
               "I wish to see your leader," said he, by way of reply to a stern demand from the
                  guard before mentioned, for the watchword. "I have some important business with
                  him," he added, seeing that his confronter hesitated.
               The latter now gave a shrill whistle, as he did so turning his face in the
                  direction of an extensive area, where the undergrowth, not having been cleared
                  away, was so dense that, at the distance of a few paces from the margin, it was
                  impenetrable to the eye. Almost immediately a boy, in response, stepped from the
                  edge of the copse; but on a mysterious motion of the sentry's hand, and without a
                  word being said by either party, he disappeared at the exact spot whence he had
                  emerged. The guard then resumed his monotonous tramp up and down between the great
                  forest-trees that surrounded them on all sides.
               Presently a dapper little man came forth from the interior of the thicket.
               "If that's Gatewood," muttered Magee to himself, as he still sat on his horse,
                  "he's not much like the descriptions I have heard of him."
               As this man drew near, there was displayed such a degree of energy in all his
                  movements, and there was so much fire in his eye, that by the time he opened his
                  lips to speak, his diminutive form had dilated to quite respectable
                  proportions.
               "Can I be permitted to see Captain Gatewood?" asked Magee in his impatience, while
                  the other was still several steps distant.
               "I will report to the Captain whatever you have to say."
               "That cannot be, since what I have to say concerns no one here but him and
                  myself."
               "Private matters, eh? and not to be intrusted to any one?" said the
                  other, tapping his breast with his hand,—a motion which plainly said, "I am his
                  next in command."
               "Entirely private," returned Magee, "and not to be entrusted to any one else
                  whatsoever."
               "Step this way, then."
               The American officer, now dismounting, secured his horse and followed his guide
                  who led the way along the margin of the thick growth already referred to, without
                  entering it. When they had gone about far enough around it to describe a
                  semicircle, they came to a small opening in the mysterious hedge, which served as
                  an entrance. Through this, and past the sentinel who guarded it, the guide made
                  his way, Magee following close on his heels. From the interior all the brushwood
                  had been cleared away to the extent of about a quarter of an acre, leaving enough
                  of the hedgelike growth on the outer margin to screen the interior completely from
                  the gaze of outsiders.
               A tent stood between two immense oaks, near a little rill which meandered on its
                  noiseless way, while at the distance of about ten paces were two smaller tents,
                  which seemed at the present moment to be vacant.
               Passing around to the front of the largest tent, past an empty hammock swung to
                  the trees, they came abruptly on a man who was half reclining upon a bear-skin
                  spread on the ground, with a dog beside him, and was intently examining a file of
                  newspapers, probably just received from "the States." He was habited in an
                  elaborately embroidered suit of buckskin. On the approach of the two visitors,
                     the dog raised his head and uttered a
                  low growl. On hearing this his master looked in the direction indicated by the
                  watchful brute, and, perceiving the two so near, immediately rose to receive them.
                  As he did so, his large symmetrical form was brought into full view; and it was
                  evident at the first glance that he was a man of no common strength and activity,
                  and withal, from a certain wiriness of build, that he possessed an endurance
                  almost unbounded. His head was uncovered, and his hair, now in some disorder, was
                  as black as the raven's plumage, while his large eyes were scarcely less so. They
                  were evidently such eyes as can express the fiercer or softer feelings at will,
                  though on this occasion there was visible in them as yet a predominance of
                  neither, but only a sort of cool indifference blended with some doubt, and it may
                  have been with a very slight degree of surprise at the sudden intrusion. The
                  general smoothness of his exposed brow, which was both broad and high, showed
                  plainly that he had not passed his prime. A single deep furrow between his eyes
                  indicated the occasional workings of the darker passions. These could probably
                  have been read more clearly in lines around the mouth, had that feature been
                  visible; but it was ambushed in a heavy moustache, while beard of a dark-brown
                  color, very fine, and as glossy as silk, waved beneath it in great luxuriance, and
                  completed the mask of the lower portion of his face.
               Magee's guide, as soon as he had brought him fairly under the observation of the
                  Chief, withdrew; and, as the beat of the sentinel who guarded the entrance was at
                  a considerable distance, the brief conversation which now took place in subdued
                  tones, could not be overheard.
               Gatewood motioned the stranger to sit down on a log, which lay near his bear-skin,
                  and which, as it had been stripped of bark and squared on the upper side, was no
                  doubt intended to serve as a bench.
               "Thank you," said Magee.
               Without, however, availing himself of the invitation to be seated, he drew from
                  his pocket the note which the reader has already seen, and handed it to Gatewood,
                  who forthwith commenced reading it.
               During the short time of its perusal, Magee was engaged in wondering whether a
                  tremendous explosion would follow, and if so, how tremendous it would probably be,
                  and of what precise manner and with what result.
               As soon as Gatewood had finished, he raised his eyes, which flashed a
                  trifle,—scrutinized for an instant the face before him, and then quietly remarked,
                  glancing again at the note:
               "As Lieutenant Magee is guilty of an irregularity, in not saying here who his
                  friend is, I presume he himself is no stickler for the code. I
                  certainly am not. So, instead of writing a reply, I will just rely upon your
                  letting him know that I shall be happy to meet him, with small swords, at the
                  crossing of the Arroyo Honda, to-morrow, when the shadows are exactly with the
                  road, which, there, runs directly east and west. I keep no time-piece."
               Magee slightly bowed assent.
               "For reasons best known to myself," added the Chief, after looking down a moment,
                  as though reflecting, "I will commit the further irregularity of bringing no
                  second with me. In this respect, Lieutenant Magee can do as best suits him."
               "I doubt not," replied Magee, "these arrangements will meet with the Lieutenant's
                  entire approbation."
               With a polite bow, Magee now took himself off; while the Chief, having returned
                  the parting salutation in kind, lay down again on the bear-skin and resumed the
                  inspection of his late file—a treat seldom attainable on that wild frontier.
               
               Scarcely had the officer turned his back on the Chief's headquarters, when he met,
                  going in that direction, a girl, apparently not more than fourteen, who had at
                  that moment entered the opening in the hedge. She was attended by a very large
                  dog, and seemed to be just from the woods, since she bore on one arm several
                  wreaths of delicate wild vines, twined with exquisite taste, while in the other
                  hand she carried a beautifully arranged bouquet of forest-flowers. The face struck
                  him as being a very lovely one, yet so sad that he looked into it with a mingled
                  feeling of admiration and pity. She was a brunette, of about medium height, with
                  regular features and large dark eyes. Her long black hair, slightly wavy,
                  completely veiled her shoulders and her back as far as the slender waist. Her
                  person was arrayed with a good deal of taste, and she wore a gipsy hat.
               As they met, she shied a little from the path, and looked timidly up at the
                  stranger from her soft eyes—he shying quite as far in the opposite direction, to
                  avoid the formidable looking animal at her heels, which, however, passed him in
                  silence and without even deigning to notice him in any way.
               Being still but a few steps from the tent he had just left, he could not resist
                  the temptation to look back and see how she would be received by the grim lord of
                  these wild demesnes. He expected to witness a cold repulse, should she venture
                  near him—though he did not for a moment suppose she would venture
                  near him.
               She walked carelessly up to his side and threw at his feet the wreaths and flowers
                  she had gathered; whereupon he half rose from his position, and putting his great
                  brawny arm gently around her fragile form, drew her down by his side and kissed
                  her, while she nestled her sweet face—now beaming with smiles—in his broad
                  bosom.
               "Powers of the blest!" exclaimed Magee, as he went on his way; "what a place for a
                  girl! and such a girl! May heaven shield her, whether sweetheart, daughter, or
                  wife. She is too much unlike for his daughter. And what could such a man want with
                  a wife? Why he could n't brook Hymen's chains for a day. She must be ——. It makes
                  me shudder! God preserve her from harm! from further harm, I mean. I already half
                  repent of having challenged him. What would become of her, should he fall?"
               "I got through with it pretty well," thought Magee, as he mounted and rode off. "I
                  would rather, however, he had chosen pistols, though he has no advantage over me
                  with the sword other than his great strength must give him. In skill of fence, I
                  hold myself his equal; and in activity, I ——. Look well to your laurels, man!"
               As Magee rode back to town, he congratulated himself more than once on his success
                  in preserving his incognito.
               "Had that savage recognized me," thought he, "I don't suppose I should ever have
                  been heard of again in native land. But with such a change wrought in my
                  countenance, to say nothing of my dress, I don't believe my best friends would
                  know me at a little distance."
               Such were his meditations as he entered Natchitoches about sunset.
               "Yonder comes Overton," he continued, still in thought, as he saw the commandant
                  coming down the main street of the town, taking his usual evening walk a little
                  distance into the country. "I'll just test the matter on him."
               "There! I was certain he would not know me."
               By this time, they had fairly passed each other without a sign of recognition on
                  the Colonel's part. But the latter's grave, imperturbable look—so foreign to the
                  occasion—as he stared blankly into his intimate friend's face, struck Magee in
                  such a ridiculous light, that his gravity was quite upset; and although he was
                  fain to pass on unrecognized, he had to
                  laugh, and that so loud as to draw the other's attention.
               "Why, Colonel!" he said, as they both now turned about, "when did you learn to
                  pass an old friend with all the concentrated solemnity of an owl?"
               "Pray, when did you learn Proteus's trick of transformation?"
                  retorted the Colonel, as he recognized his subaltern, more by his voice than by
                  any remains he could, even now, see of the original.
               "But, Magee, what in the devil have you been doing out in this
                  direction? When you said you were going to take a little jaunt, I, of course,
                  thought you meant eastwardly. I know you can have no further business with those
                  Neutral-Ground folks; and as for pleasure, I don't exactly see how a man can ride,
                  for pleasure, through a country where the fingers of two or three hundred such
                  savages are itching for his scalp."
               "Oh, they would n't recognize me, Colonel. At least, you have no reason to think
                  so," said Magee, with a laugh.
               "True," replied the commandant, slightly echoing his friend's mirth. "But tell me,
                  did you see any of them?"
               Well, yes; but at such a distance, that I did n't think it worth while to disturb
                  them."
               "I should rather think not."
               "But by being absent, Magee," the commandant went on, "you have missed the news.
                  The town has been in a ferment all day."
               "Why?"
               "Why, just after you left, about a dozen refugees reached here, from Mexico. The
                  revolution there has failed, for the time,—probably for all time,—and the rebels
                  are flying from the bloody vengeance of the victors."
               "Do those who have reached here seem to be persons of any note?"
               "Yes. One of them, Bernardo, was a general in the patriot army, I believe. He is
                  certainly an untiring fellow in the cause. He has been here only a few hours, and
                  I really think he has sounded all the officers of the post except yourself,
                  touching their sympathies with the patriot cause. And he 'll be after
                     you, as soon as you dismount."
               "Ah, we all have 'sympathies' with them, as you know."
               "Yes—and that's about as far as we should be willing to go. But Bernardo wants
                  more substantial aid than that amounts to. A sprinkling of the Anglo-Saxon element
                  in their armies is what is really needed; and he seems fully aware of the
                  fact."
               "But, Magee," added the commandant, looking scrutinizingly at the other as though
                  expecting to see in his face something he wished not there,—"who's fool enough to
                  resign a commission under such a government as ours, for the purpose of accepting
                  one in a cause that is going to pieces after a six months' struggle? Be on your
                  guard: he's a very insinuating fellow, and will spare no pains to seduce you."
               With this parting admonition the Colonel resumed his walk; while his lieutenant
                  rode on towards the central portion of the town.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER V.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           From point to point now have you heard
                           The fundamental reasons of this war.
                        
                     
                     
                        All's Well That Ends Well.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Holy seems the quarrel
                           Upon your grace's part,—black and fearful
                           On the opposers.
                        
                     
                     
                        All's Well That Ends Well.
                     
                  
               
               
                  THE commandant's prediction was fully verified. The close of the day
                  found Bernardo and Magee in conference at the latter's quarters. The room was very
                  large, and a rather shabby one. The walls were as innocent of pictures—even the
                  commonest prints—as the windows were of curtains. There was no carpet on the floor
                  of the apartment, and it was but scantily furnished with a few chairs standing
                  about in disorder, while a small table, on which were a few books and some
                  scattered newspapers, together with writing materials, occupied the centre. At
                  opposite sides of this little table, the two gentlemen were seated.
               With the Lieutenant's personal appearance the reader is already, in a measure,
                  acquainted. Bernardo was a middle-aged man, much above the average size. His
                  complexion did not indicate a pure Spanish descent, but a very slight mixture with
                  some one of the darker races of Mexico. He had a remarkably intelligent face, and
                  a graceful and easy deportment; was evidently a man of rare mental endowments, and
                  on his address, the fascination of his manner became at once apparent.
               They had probably been in conference for some time.
               "Now, General," Magee was just then saying in his own tongue,—for Bernardo
                  understood and spoke English perfectly,—"the matter stands thus: As the authorized
                  agent of your party, you have proffered me terms more flattering, I must confess,
                  than I could have expected. You have also stated, in a general way, the prospects
                  of your party; and, so far as I can judge, they seem to promise ultimate success.
                  But before I can give up a position under my own government, on which I depend for
                  a livelihood, and which affords me many opportunities for scientific advancement,
                  as well as other important advantages, it is but natural I should require a more
                  detailed account of your affairs. And, first of all,—is your cause a
                  good one?"
               "If there ever has been a good cause, sir, since the creation of the world,"
                  replied Bernardo, with enthusiasm, "ours is a good one. The tyranny
                  of Spanish rule in Mexico, though it may have been paralleled, has certainly never
                  been exceeded. But, that you may fully understand our grievances, suppose I
                  recount them."
               "By all means, do so, General. I have paid but little attention to events in your
                  country; and, in common with thousands of my fellow-citizens, know almost nothing
                  about the policy pursued by Spain towards her American colonies."
               Bernardo then proceeded to give an account of the wrongs which Mexico had suffered
                  for many years at the hands of the mother country. Inasmuch, however, as he
                  entered into the full details of the matter, his recital would occupy entirely too
                  much space to be given, verbatim, in a novel. I shall therefore content myself—and
                  will, no doubt, by doing so, better satisfy my readers—with citing from the most
                  reliable historians (mainly from Kennedy and Yoakum—the former an Englishman) such
                  information on the subject as I deem essential to the intelligent perusal and
                  proper appreciation of this story. These two writers, who depicted the lamentable condition of things forty
                  and fifty years, respectively, after they occurred, will not be so obnoxious to
                  the reader's suspicion of magnifying the wrongs of the Mexicans as would Bernardo,
                  fresh as he was from the horrible scenes of butchery and general diabolism enacted
                  by the now triumphant royalists.
               First, as regards the form of government.
               "The Viceroy was at the head of the colonial government. He derived his commission
                  immediately from the throne. The Council of the Indies, which sat at Madrid, and
                  over which the king was presumed to preside—though he was seldom present in
                  person—ruled the colonies absolutely in all branches of government,—military,
                  ecclesiastical, civil, and commercial; that is, in all cases where they chose to
                  exercise jurisdiction. These instances were, however, comparatively few; and its
                  control was therefore mostly nominal, nearly the whole management of Mexican
                  affairs being left to the colonial machinery. And this was of the most despotic
                  character.
               "The highest tribunal was the Real Audencia, or
                  Royal Court—a sort of legislative body, of which the viceroy was president. Its
                  sessions were held in the city of Mexico. In each intendancy, or province,—of
                  which there were seven in all,—was an inferior audencia. These courts were composed entirely of generals and
                  bishops, all of whom were natives of Spain, and in whose selection the people had
                  no voice whatever. Such government as these mixed and ecclesiastical military
                  tribunals chose to give them, was all they had.
               "In the town and villages, the offices of alcalde, or magistrate, and regidor, or chief, composed the ayuntamiento, or municipal council. These offices were mostly
                  auctioned off, and the proceeds went into the royal treasury. Sometimes they were
                  conferred as a reward of military service,— the captain being made perpetual
                     alcalde; the first and second lieutenants,
                     regidores. The sergeant, or, in his absence,
                  the corporal, or in his absence, some private, was made procurador, or town-clerk. As these were the only courts of petty
                  jurisdiction, a corporal, or private sometimes, administered justice in villages
                  composed of respectable proprietors—the audencia
                  of the intendancy, the only tribunal for appeal, being often at a great distance,
                  and a resort to it being always uncertain and vexatious, to say the least, even
                  should just claims be established. Should an appeal fail to establish one's
                  claims, however, he was ruined by the immense expense which it necessarily
                  involved; the fees and perquisites wrung from every litigant by the government
                  vampires being enormous.
               "Mexico, in common with the other American colonies under the Spanish yoke, was
                  enfeebled and barbarized by many years of profligate misrule. Corruption and
                  peculation rioted openly in every department of the government, and clung to every
                  branch of the executive, from the representative of the king to the meanest
                  dependant of the customs. The fact that there were government offices to which no
                  salary was attached, speaks volumes. Every office was publicly sold, with the
                  exception of those that were bestowed upon court-minions as the reward of
                  disgraceful service. Men destitute of talent, education, and character, were
                  appointed to offices of the greatest responsibility in Church and State; and
                  panders and parasites were forced upon America to superintend the finances, and
                  preside in the supreme courts of appeal. For the colonists there was no respite
                  from official bloodsuckers. Each succeeding swarm of adventurers, in their
                  eagerness to indemnify themselves for the money expended in procuring their
                  places, increased the calamities of the provinces already wasted by the cupidity
                  of their predecessors. Truly might the
                  Hispano-American exclaim, 'That which the palmer-worm hath left, hath the locust
                  eaten; that which the locust hath left, hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which
                  the canker-worm hath left, hath the caterpillar eaten.'
               "The government strove by all the means in its power, and by every restriction
                  that could be invented, short of driving them to desperation, to keep up the
                  dependence of the people of Mexico upon the mother-country. The thousand ore-banks
                  were forbidden to be touched. The innumerable herds of sheep were virtually
                  forbidden to be shorn. Olive-orchards and vineyards were laid waste as soon as
                  their existence was reported by the hordes of government spies that infested every
                  nook and corner of the land, because, forsooth, all these things would have been
                  brought into competition with those sent across the ocean by the pampered Crœsuses
                  of Spain.
               "But of all the countless wrongs inflicted upon the Mexican people, the hardest to
                  bear was the practice, continued for three centuries, of conferring all the
                  lucrative offices on the hated Gachupins."
               The original meaning of this term was simply, a native of Spain. In addition to
                  this, it soon came to signify in the mouths of Mexicans, a cheat,—a thief,—a
                  liar,—in short, it included almost every human attribute that was particularly
                  mean; and in that sense was applied to such as, born in the mother-country,
                  flocked to New Spain to live at the expense of Mexican Creoles. In other words,
                  more easily understood by the reader of the present day, the Gachupins were the
                  carpet-baggers of Mexico.
               "Persons having no root in the soil were selected over those having ties of
                  interest and kindred, in order to advance the dignity and aggrandizement of the
                  mother-country. These Gachupins owned nearly all the wealth and wielded all the
                  territorial influence. Of the one hundred and sixty viceroys, and five hundred and
                  ninety captain-generals, governors, and presidents of the Real Audencia, only eighteen were born in the country, and these
                  were all reared and educated in Spain, and were appointed in European interests.
                  Judges of the Audencias were always
                  of European birth.
               "All the prizes in the church, the army, the navy, as well as all the facilities
                  for wealth and commerce, were clutched by the privileged caste. Ii vain did
                  Creoles try to bring offenders of that class to justice. So far was this blind
                  worship of native Spaniards carried, that the son of Spanish parents, born in
                  Mexico, was held by his own father inferior to his European book-keeper.
               "The fears of the tyrants lest the fires of revolution should be lighted, was so
                  great, that by the laws of the Indies, which governed the supreme courts of
                  Spanish America, it was made a capital crime for a foreigner to enter the
                  territory without a special license from his Catholic Majesty; and so particularly
                  apprehensive were they of the influence of citizens of the United States, that the
                  captain-general of one of the internal provinces declared that, if he had it in
                  his power to do so, he would prevent the very birds of the air from crossing the
                  borders, lest some of the dreaded liberal principles might be concealed in their
                  plumage and be diffused among the masses. Texas, one of the most lovely and most
                  fertile countries on the globe, had hitherto been purposely kept as a wilderness,
                  and even worse, that she might present a repulsive barrier between the Anglo-Saxon
                  and the people of Mexico. The missions which were planted in Texas nearly a
                  hundred and fifty years ago, under sanction of the government, by vagabond friars,
                  aided and protected from the savages by the most abandoned of the Spanish
                  soldiery, maintained themselves until
                  recently by the labors of the wretched Indians, whom they dragged from their
                  haunts in the forest or prairie. Under the pretence of bringing them in the fold
                  of the Church, they kept them in the most abject slavery; not only forcing them to
                  constant labor for the benefit of their lazy masters, but wringing from them, by
                  torture, an abjuration of their own religion, and a conformation to the rites of
                  the holy Catholic Church. No officer or soldier could marry but by special license
                  from his sovereign, and this the priests could easily turn into an interdict. This
                  enforced abstinence from wedlock by all—priests, of course, included—prevented
                  lawful increase, and produced, instead, a mestizo population. These communities of
                  expatriated friars, unprincipled soldiers, enthralled and savage Indians, with the
                  motley offspring of Mexican licentiousness, was well adapted to keep Texas a
                  barrier against the Anglo-Saxon."
               But, with all these precautions, Texas could not be forever kept in the condition
                  of a wilderness to serve a tyrant's purpose. And in the last year of the
                  eighteenth century, came Nolan and his companions to prepare the way for better
                  times.
               Philip Nolan was an adventurous American, who was engaged ostensibly in bringing
                  wild horses from Mexico and Texas, and disposing of them in the United
                  States,—having obtained from the Spanish Governor of Louisiana the proper permit
                  for that purpose. But that was a very small part of Nolan's object. It was, in
                  fact, only a cloak to the chief end he had in view—to diffuse liberal notions
                  among the Mexican masses, and to make ready the way for a revolution, which was to
                  be inaugurated by a force from the United States, as soon as the malcontents in
                  Mexico could be fully apprised of, and prepared for, the project. With a choice
                  band of about twenty, he was engaged for several years in this dangerous
                  business.
               At length, in 1800, after sowing the seeds of liberty broadcast over a large
                  portion of the land, his plans were divulged by some traitor. An overwhelming
                  force was sent against him, and although surrounded on all sides, he made a
                  gallant defence, in which he was slain. Several of his comrades were executed. The
                  remainder, ten or twelve in number, were sentenced, some to dungeons; others to
                  hard labor, for life, in mines in the interior of Mexico; and such of the latter
                  as were living at the time of our story, were supposed to be still at work in
                  those dreary caverns; the former, perhaps more fortunate, it was thought had
                  perished long ago behind their hideous grates. But of these more anon.
               Their brave leader was resting in his prairie grave, while the active ferment
                  which he had insinuated was leavening the whole lump.
               Nolan has, by many, been regarded as an unscrupulous adventurer, actuated solely
                  by selfish motives. By them, his main object is represented as having been to
                  amass a fortune,—or to make a name by his wild exploits. But whatever the
                  incentive which moved him, his efforts tended at least, to rouse the apathetic
                  Mexicans to a sense of their degradation, and to enlighten them as to the means
                  necessary for their regeneration. He may have been ambitious; he may even have
                  been selfish; I do not know,—no one but his God can know at this late day,—and I
                  choose, therefore, to cherish his memory as that of the earliest martyr to the
                  disenthralment of the lovely and fertile province of Texas, from the heaviest
                  tyranny that ever enchained a people.
               For several years after Nolan's death, emissaries were secretly sent from the
                  United States, by those who were then maturing a scheme for the invasion of
                  Mexico, with the view of wresting it from Spain, and, it has been thought, erecting it into a separate empire. In
                  1807, this scheme was brought to an abrupt termination by the arrest and trial of
                  Aaron Burr, its acknowledged head.
               But a potent element in the body politic of Mexico—an element which had hitherto
                  remained passive—was about being exercised in favor of freedom. This powerful
                  accession to the liberal cause was the inferior priesthood. Mexico was, at this
                  time, divided into four archbishoprics; these were subdivided, each, into several
                  dioceses; and these into innumerable cures and deaconries. All these orders were
                  accountable to the High Court of Inquisition in the capital, which issued edicts
                  against heresies and impious doctrines, both religious and political.
               In accordance with the universal proscription of the native-born, all the higher
                  church dignitaries, without exception, were selected from European Spaniards. In
                  fact, from the Archbishop of Mexico, whose salary amounted to one hundred and
                  fifty thousand dollars a year, down to those who received a sum barely sufficient
                  for their comfortable support, there was scarcely a Creole ecclesiastic.
               These last were to be found in every little village, or hacienda, or collection of
                  wretched hovels, in the vice-royalty. From their wide dispersion among the masses,
                  together with the almost unbounded influence which each one wielded over his small
                  flock, whether for good or ill, it may be readily conceived that their concerted
                  agency, if it could be brought about, would be no mean aid to any cause.
               These inferior priests, though mostly well educated, and many of them, in every
                  respect, far more competent than those above them to fill high offices in the
                  church, led, for the most part, wretched lives. Having no fixed salaries, they
                  were obliged to depend, for their support, on the precarious carious proceeds
                  derived from burials, baptisms, and marriages, among their flocks,—loving enough,
                  perhaps, and willing enough to contribute what they could to the support of their
                  ghostly advisers, but already so impoverished by oppressive taxation, and by the
                  extortions of unscrupulous officials, that they could scarcely procure for
                  themselves and their miserable children and superannuated parents that which would
                  keep alive the vital spark, and cover their nakedness.
               It may therefore well be believed that these priests often suffered for the
                  necessaries of life, and were obliged to go in rags. Nor could they see any hope
                  of relief from this pitiable condition,—on the contrary, they too well knew that,
                  like those who had filled the sacred post before them, there would be no respite
                  even in their old age, save only such as death would afford them. It is no matter
                  of wonder, then, that many of them were soured in their tempers, and alienated
                  from a government to which one half their sufferings were due, and from an
                  ecclesiastical polity to which the other half were justly chargeable.
               The crisis soon came; and, to the surprise of all, the man who first raised the
                  standard of revolt was a priest,—Don Miguel Hidalgo, curate of Dolores, in the
                  province of Guanaxuato. This man, though possessed of sound judgment, was by no
                  means a genius. It was a terrible risk to run. Such hazardous attempts, with their
                  fearful responsibility, usually fall to the lot of some military genius, long
                  accustomed to handle a well-disciplined army, and even such leaders as he often
                  lose their heads.
               But here was an obscure priest, unknown beyond the narrow bounds of his curacy,
                  ignorant of the first rudiments of military science, without a dollar in money,
                  and destitute of arms, ammunition and supplies, undertaking to excite a whole
                  nation, half stupefied by a long and rigorous bondage, to rise up against their oppressors, who
                  possessed all the usual means and appliances of war, as well as of oppression. It
                  looked like a desperate throw of the die: it looked, indeed, like the wild scheme
                  of a madman; and the fact that, in the face of all these disadvantages, the revolt
                  came so near triumphing, in a few brief months, shows how fearfully in earnest
                  must have been the masses in striving to cast off the tyranny which had been so
                  long grinding them, body and soul, into the dust.
               Making known his intentions to his three most intimate friends, Allende, Aldama,
                  and Abasolo,—all of them captains in a royal cavalry regiment in an adjoining
                  town—he took the field, inscribing on his banner, "For the protection of religion
                  and the redress of wrongs."
               He next declared for the abolition of the odious Indian tribute; and in a short
                  time, thousands of that race flew to his standard; nor had they forgotten the
                  revolting tortures and the wholesale murders practised upon their unoffending
                  ancestors by the Spaniards. Only a few days elapsed before he captured Guanaxuato,
                  a city containing eighty thousand inhabitants. Here he possessed himself of five
                  millions of the public funds. He remained here only long enough to arm and equip
                  his army, which as yet was but little better than a mob,—a large portion of them
                  being armed only with clubs, stones, slings, bows and arrows, axes, and machetas,
                  or heavy swords.
               About the middle of October, 1810, Hidalgo, at the head of an immense host of
                  Creoles, Mestizoes, and Indians, started for the capital, overthrowing everything
                  in his march. Towards the last of the same month, he reached Toluca, thirty or
                  forty miles from the city of Mexico, and moved up, soon afterwards, almost to its
                  suburbs.
               The authorities were thrown into the utmost consternation tion. Venegas, the
                  viceroy, had only two thousand men to defend the city, while his two principal
                  generals, Cadena, at Queretaro, and Calleja, at San Luis Potosi, were at so great
                  a distance that he could hope for no aid from them. Had Hidalgo taken immediate
                  advantage of this confused state of things, and moved boldly on the city, teeming
                  with malcontents, it must certainly have fallen into his hands. Such was Allende's
                  advice to him. He, however, remained here in a vacillating state of mind for two
                  or three days.
               Meanwhile the crafty viceroy, well knowing with what material he had to deal in
                  the superstitious masses who followed Hidalgo, caused him and his principal
                  generals to be solemnly excommunicated, and a special curse to be pronounced upon
                  them by the High Court of the Inquisition of Mexico.
               These awful tidings he found means to circulate throughout the patriot army. The
                  chief himself, unawed by the dread anathema, hurled back a defiant reply, in the
                  name of the holy cause which he represented, and had it read to his army as an
                  antidote to the fulmination of his enemies. Despite all this, however, his
                  benighted host were overawed by the threats of divine vengeance. They
                  murmured—they wavered—many of them seemed about to break out into open
                  mutiny—unless he would withdraw from the city which, they said, had been taken
                  under the special care of heaven. In accordance with their wishes, he now
                  commenced his retreat.
               Cadena and the bloody monster, Calleja, made forced marches, and, coming up with
                  Hidalgo, at Aculco, defeated him; then, again, at Guanaxuato, the scene of his
                  first exploits; and, in January, 1811, near Guadalaxara. Thence he retreated,
                  pursued by Calleja, to Zacetecas, and thence to San Luis Potosi,—his object being
                  to pass by way of Saltillo, to the
                  borders of Louisiana, where he intended to remain for a while, hoping to get
                  substantial aid from the United States and renew his attempt at revolution.
               Salcedo, the captain-general of the north-eastern provinces, dispatched a force to
                  cut him off in the direction of Saltillo, while Arredondo followed hotly in his
                  rear. But at Acatita de Bajan, in the month of March, 1811, he was basely betrayed
                  by Elisondo, one of his chief officers. Many of the leaders were executed on the
                  spot. Others, who had scattered, were slain wherever found.
               Hidalgo himself was taken to Chihuahua, and put to death on the 27th day of July,
                  meeting his fate with great coolness and bravery.
               There were also executed at Chihuahua, at various times, from the first of May to
                  the last of July, Allende, generalissimo; Aldama, lieutenant-general; Ximenes,
                  captain-general and governor of Monterey; besides three major-generals, two
                  brigadiers, and two or three colonels.
               One of Hidalgo's most prominent adherents, Colonel Delgado, was arrested at San
                  Antonio,—where he lived,—by order of Salcedo, (governor of Texas, and a near
                  relative of the captain-general of the same name,) executed, and his head stuck on
                  a pole, in a conspicuous part of the town. Another, General Bernardo Gutierrez,
                  escaped to Natchitoches, as we have already seen.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               
                  
                     
                        This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
                     
                     —Measure for Measure.
                     
                  
               
               
                  SUCH was the substance of the information which the Mexican general
                  communicated to his eager listener, during the many hours they were in
                  conference.
               "If I have depicted my native land in unlovely colors,"—he now continued, by way
                  of peroration,—"think not that my feelings are in any degree estranged from her. I
                  do it, because I want your aid and the aid of all you can influence to rescue her
                  from the pit of misery and degradation into which she has been dragged; and to
                  effect this end, I tell you the whole truth—but nothing more. God knows, it should
                  suffice to soften the heart of a fiend to sympathy, at least, if no further. There
                  is not a country in the world that can show more natural beauties, nor one that is
                  more favored by Nature with all that can contribute to man's happiness. Yet is
                  there none, at this moment, on which there seems to rest a deeper curse. It is
                  felt by all who have any feelings, from the boor to the most refined. The one can
                  find no happiness or pleasure in the society of his lowly family—that narrow
                  sphere which bounds his influence and his aspirations. The other, when he stirs
                  abroad, cannot glow at sight of the sweet valleys; nor can his soul dilate over
                  the grandeur of mountains, because the blight of chains is on the air. They cannot
                  always be seen—they do not always clank—but they are always there: they fetter the
                     mind. Though the treasures which her mines afford are exhaustless,
                     she swarms with beggars. Vainly do
                  teeming wild-flowers scent the air, for their fragrance, go where you will, is
                  mingled with the offensive reek of squalor.
               "Then as regards the people—I acknowledge the fact with humiliation, but not with
                  despair—they are stamped with the repulsive features of anarchy and
                  semi-barbarism. This could not but be the case, since the elements of which the
                  great masses of the population are composed consist of an aboriginal race content
                  to exist in unmolested indigence; a chaos of mongrel castes, stolid,
                  superstitious, and ignorant; a numerous Creole class, wealthy, though mortified
                  and discontented; and a compact phalanx of European officials, pampered menials of
                  the crown, whose chief concern is to profit by every iniquitous act of the
                  government."
               "But, General," said Magee, "is it possible for such a people, even if freed, to
                  govern themselves?"
               "I do not know," answered Bernardo; "no one, except their Creator, can know. But,
                  for God's sake, let them try; and if they fail, the only remaining hope for poor
                  Mexico, is to be taken under the protection of your own glorious country."
               "Yes," said Magee, "they certainly have a right to the experiment of
                  self-government; whether they succeed or not is another thing."
               "Well, General," the American went on, after a pause, "you have thoroughly
                  convinced me of the justice of your cause. I can also see that you had, at one
                  time, a very fair prospect of succeeding; but that series of disasters, winding up
                  with the execution of so many of your prominent leaders, seems to me to leave but
                  little hope of accomplishing anything—at least for the present."
               "The present, sir," answered Bernardo, "is the very time for action. Armies of
                  patriots are springing up all over the land. General Rayon and General Villagran,
                  with a large force, have, at this moment, possession of all the defiles leading
                  from the northern provinces to the city of Mexico; so that Calleja and Salcedo are
                  really cut off from the capital. Could Rayon have succeeded in reaching Hidalgo,
                  at Acatita de Bajan, before his disaster, all would have been well; but he was
                  intercepted, and forced to retire to the passes which he now commands. Then, there
                  is Morelos, a priest, like Hidalgo, and, I think, the most efficient of the
                  patriot leaders, unless it be his young lieutenant-general, Matamoras, also a
                  priest. These are working with all their might in the southern provinces. Another
                  army has blocked the way from the capital to Vera Cruz, the principal and almost
                  the only seaport-town of the vice-royalty. So, there is little doubt, the tyrants
                  will soon have their hands full.
               "You must reflect, sir, that scarcely a year ago we plunged suddenly into this
                  war, without money and without supplies, all of which we had to capture from the
                  enemy. And what was perhaps worse, we had no concert of action—no discipline—no
                  organization—no regular plans; but these things are progressively improving, and
                  all will come right in time.
               "I have no more doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in breaking the power of our
                  oppressors, than I have of my own sincerity in the cause. Ay, we can do it without
                  foreign aid, but not so speedily. If your countrymen do not assist, the struggle
                  may be protracted for years, and blood drench the land,—whole provinces be laid
                  waste,—and thousands of homes be draped in mourning for the dead and the
                  desolation around."
               "General," inquired Magee, "did none of your countrymen in the province of Texas
                  make any demonstration of throwing off the yoke during those bloody days?"
               "They did," replied Bernardo; "and, considering how few of them there are, a very gallant demonstration
                  it was. The Delgados, the Arochas, the Traviezos, the Leals, and others, who had
                  formed a privileged class in San Antonio de Bexar from the time their fathers came
                  from the Canary Isles, on the king's invitation, to people Texas, in 1730, were at
                  the head of the movement. They first found means to corrupt the troops, and
                  selected a young captain, Juan Casas, to command them. He marched at their head,
                  to the government-house, at night; and, seizing Governor Salcedo and other
                  officers, sent them off, in chains, to the interior of Mexico. Even while this was
                  being enacted, however, Hidalgo had already been defeated,—though the news had not
                  yet reached Texas. No sooner were those disastrous tidings known in San Antonio,
                  than a plot was set afoot to depose Casas from the command, and win the troops
                  back to the royal cause. Casas was accordingly seized, chained, and hurried away
                  to Chihuahua, where he was soon afterwards executed, and his head put into a sack
                  and dispatched to San Antonio, with the view of striking terror into the citizens
                  and the garrison of that place, and thus deterring them from following his
                  disloyal example."
               "This, however, proves," said Magee, "that there is at least some patriotism among
                  the Mexican population of Texas,—which was the main object of my inquiry."
               "As to that," returned Bernardo, "there is no doubt the people of that province
                  are only awaiting a favorable opportunity to strike for their freedom."
               "Now, General," said Magee,—after a long pause in the conversation, during which
                  both seemed, as they rose and paced the floor on opposites of the spacious room,
                  to be digesting what had already been said, or to be laying plans for the
                  future,—"how many Spanish troops do you suppose there are in the province of
                  Texas?"
               "Salcedo has about twelve hundred regulars at San Antonio. At the various
                  intervening posts there are probably eight hundred more. These are, I think, all
                  the Spaniards have east of the Rio Grande."
               "What force would it require to drive them out of the province?"
               "Five hundred Americans could, I doubt not, march from the Sabine to the vicinity
                  of San Antonio without serious opposition. Before surrendering that city, the
                  enemy would probably make a stand, as it is accounted the key to the whole
                  province. For that purpose, they would have—including the garrisons which the
                  Americans would drive before them—about two thousand well-disciplined troops."
               Magee next made many inquiries about the geography and topography of Texas; and
                  got Bernardo to explain the situation of the different military posts, together
                  with their several defences; all which things were the more easily explained, from
                  the fact that Bernardo produced from his pocket a map of Texas, which had been
                  made by Nolan—the first ever made of that country, then so little known.
               "Now," said Magee, as soon as his inquiries had been satisfactorily answered, "I
                  am enabled to submit, for your consideration, the outlines of a campaign; which,
                  provided we can raise three hundred Americans, I make no doubt can be successfully
                  carried out. It is a very simple plan, with little or no manœuvring, though
                  manœuvring enough may be required by unforeseen emergencies arising during its
                  execution.
               "First of all, we must not divide our forces, but must concentrate on every
                  position of the enemy in succession. Their small guard at the Sabine crossing,
                     here," continued the speaker, indicating that point on the map
                  spread out before them, "which we will
                  first encounter on our march, will, of course, offer but slight resistance, if
                  any,—but be either dispersed or captured.
               "Here, at Nacogdoches, which you say is forty miles further on, we
                  may meet with some resistance; but energy and bravery, with perhaps a little
                  strategy, to save blood, will soon overcome it. The taking of this
                  position—Spanish Bluff, here, on the Trinity, a hundred miles, you say, from
                  Nacogdoches—may, owing to the falling back upon it of the other two garrisons,
                  give us some severe fighting. Here, you say, we shall find ammunition and
                  supplies.
               "Having thus penetrated nearly a hundred and fifty miles into the interior, we can
                  afford to rest a while on our laurels; and may safely rely on the news of our
                  success bringing others to our standard. I do not believe we can raise more than
                  three hundred men, until we shall have, in this way, guaranteed our success to
                  others, who will then, no doubt, be eager to join us. Having received sufficient
                  accession to our force, we will then push on at once to San Antonio,—there being,
                  you say, no intervening garrison. Salcedo will either march out and meet us, or
                  stand on the defensive within the town. In either case, we shall probably have
                  some hot work. But I think we can beat him, and perhaps capture his whole force,
                  arms, ammunition and supplies.
               "At San Antonio we will again take a resting-spell. In fact, I tell you candidly
                  now, I think it very doubtful whether Americans will be willing to go further.
                  They will probably be content to hold such a large and attractive country as
                  Texas, and cannot be induced, by any offers you may extend to them, to cross the
                  Rio Grande."
               "Well," said Bernardo, "even if we can do no more than redeem Texas from the
                  Gachupins, that alone will be a glorious work. There will then be, at least, a
                  place to which the Mexican exile—when hunted down during the dark days that may
                  come again and again before the independence of his native country is secured—may
                  fly from the vengeance of his foe, and rest and recruit a while ere he plunges
                  once more into the struggle."
               "Once established at San Antonio," continued Magee, "the first step will be to
                  inaugurate a provisional government in the interest of the patriots. As we shall
                  then be among a Mexican population, it is my opinion that you yourself should be
                  placed at the head of the proposed government. By this, we not only conciliate the
                  native population in and about San Antonio, and secure their more cordial
                  co-operation; but, at the same time, we prove to the whole Mexican nation, that
                  American ambition and cupidity, of which they are very jealous—morbidly so, I
                  think—are not at the bottom of our project.
               "By such a course, too, matters will assume a permanent appearance to the
                  adventurous young men of the United States, and they will, at length, swell our
                  ranks to a degree that may justify an onward movement beyond the Rio Grande to
                  reinforce the patriot army. At least, we could establish the independence of
                  Texas, and make it a permanent rallying-ground, as you have said, for your
                  banished countrymen."
               "Your plan is well laid," said Bernardo, with enthusiasm, into which personal
                  ambition, peradventure, entered largely; "and I cannot doubt of its success."
               "You have proposed," Magee went on, "that I should command the republican force;
                  but there is—"
               "Yes," interrupted Bernardo, with some eagerness,—"almost as soon as I saw you, I
                  was convinced you were the proper person for that. And I can assure you, I was not
                  at all sorry that before I sought this conference all the other officers at the
                  post had declined to direct the campaign."
               
               "Well, be that as it may," resumed Magee, "I was about to remark, that, although I
                  would probably be more acceptable than yourself with Americans, you would, no
                  doubt, have equally the advantage over me, when we come to deal with your own
                  countrymen. I will, therefore, suggest this arrangement. Although it might be well
                  that I should be the real leader, so long as Americans alone, or chiefly
                  Americans, are concerned, you ought to be the nominal commander from the very
                  opening of the campaign. When we shall get possession of San Antonio, although I
                  think you should not only retain this nominal military leadership, but should be
                  placed at the head of the proposed civil government,—yet, let me say, we shall
                  expect you to advise with us, even then, touching the policy to be pursued in all
                  matters of moment."
               "Of course," replied Bernardo, "I shall always be glad to receive the opinion of
                  yourself and your countrymen; and can promise that I shall be largely influenced
                  by your judgment."
               "Now," said the American, "since we find we can agree on the general policy to be
                  pursued, we will arrange matters for initiating the campaign; or, rather, for
                  making up our little army and its equipments. There is one point we must never for
                  a single moment lose sight of,—and that is, to keep our movements, as much as
                  possible, a profound secret. We should communicate our objects to those only who
                  are to be engaged with us; we should employ as few agents, and as trustworthy
                  ones, as possible. In fact, I think it better that you and myself should attend
                  personally to everything in our power; for should the United States government
                  hear of our plans, they will have no alternative, since they are at peace with
                  Spain, but to stay our proceedings. Moreover, the governor of Louisiana, I
                  understand, has repeatedly declared, that he should consider himself constrained
                  to use every legitimate means to suppress all hostile demonstrations of the kind
                  from the borders of this State. I will go at once to New Orleans, and perhaps to
                  other points in the Southern States, and see what can be done in the way of
                  getting volunteers, as well as arms and supplies."
               "And, for my part," said Bernardo, "I will remain in this vicinity, and do what I
                  can here. I have an old friend, Colonel Davenport, an American, who settled
                  several years ago near Nacogdoches. From him I may reasonably hope to procure aid,
                  since I have often heard him say he would be willing to make almost any sacrifice
                  to break the Spanish rule in Texas. I will find means to communicate with him on
                  the subject; and out of his wealth, which is considerable, I am sure he will at
                  least contribute liberally, if, indeed, he will not lend us the aid of his
                  personal exertions and his excellent judgment."
               "I have often seen the Colonel about this place," said Magee, "but was not aware
                  he was one of the disaffected citizens of Texas. If he could be induced to accept
                  the position of quartermaster, he would make a most efficient one. By all means
                  secure his aid, if it can be done. I would suggest, however, that, instead of
                  going yourself to Nacogdoches, if such is your purpose, you send him a message by
                  some reliable person, to come here to confer with you. This would greatly lessen
                  the risk of exposing our scheme."
               "I shall certainly not go myself," returned the Mexican. "It would be as much as
                  my head is worth to venture to Nacogdoches, unless backed by an armed force."
               "Another great point," resumed Magee, "is, that we must act with energy, and raise
                  the proposed force as soon as possible. The longer we linger on this side of the
                  Sabine, the greater the danger that our expedition will be broken up. But once on
                  Spanish territory, with a force
                  sufficient to maintain ourselves there,—the United States government cannot reach
                  us. Once established in Nacogdoches, for instance, we can afford to wait until our
                  schemes are further matured and unorganized reinforcements arrive from the United
                  States."
               "There is," said Bernardo, after a pause, "another very important point to be
                  gained; which, as I have vainly waited for you to name, I will venture to do it
                  myself. In fact, could we secure the object to which I allude, we might make bold
                  to march as far as Nacogdoches at once, and await, outside the jurisdiction of the
                  United States, the accession of volunteers."
               "Do you suppose for a moment I had not thought of that? Why, General,
                  I have thought of it at least twenty times since this conference began."
               "Did you not consider it of sufficient moment even to mention it?"
               "It is of very great moment—I had almost said, vital; and I refrained from any
                  allusion to it, only because I knew it could never be accomplished—never, I am
                  exceedingly sorry to say."
               "I see no good reasons why it should not," said Bernardo, with surprise; "many
                  reasons why it should. You surely do not know to what I refer."
               "You can refer to but one thing: our securing the services of the Neutral Ground
                  men."
               "And what insurmountable obstacle is there to this?"
               Magee then detailed to the General his late transactions with the freebooters in
                  regard to the capture of the silver; only stopping short of his personal
                  difficulty with the Chief.
               "Truly a misfortune," said Bernardo, dejectedly.
               "And one," said the American officer, "which you may readily judge is irreparable,
                  when I tell you they have sworn to have my blood, come what may."
               "Nevertheless," Bernardo resumed, as soon as he had rallied from the shock of the
                  disappointment, "I will try what I can do in the way of tranquillizing them. I
                  will get them together and make such offers as I think best calculated to
                  reconcile them to your leadership. I will tell them not only of the fertile lands
                  and the wild horses they will be entitled to, but of the rich mines they shall
                  share if successful; and of the surplus of confiscated property which will fall to
                  their lot in the distribution, as well as the lucrative offices some of them may
                  hope to hold under the new government of the province. This will only be
                  forestalling the address which I shall probably deliver to all our forces, so soon
                  as we shall have fairly arrived on Spanish soil."
               "You may try all these things," said Magee; "they can do no harm. But I have no
                  hope of your succeeding. If I am to lead the invasion, we shall have to dispense
                  with their services,—which I much regret, as they are brave men,—and triumph, or
                  fail, as the case may be, without them. I should, however, advise you not to think
                  of mentioning the subject to any of the men. Speak only to Gatewood; for not only
                  can you influence them more through him than in any other way, but I am confident
                  that, if you will first get his pledge to secrecy, he will not divulge our plans.
                  On the other hand, if you confer with the men, some of them will be sure to betray
                  us: the government will then get wind of the expedition, and suppress it at
                  once."
               "True enough," said the Mexican; "as I spoke on the impulse of the moment, that
                  did not occur to me. Of course I shall make advances only to the Chief."
               "And here, General," said Magee,—"as I have not yet absolutely accepted the
                  command, but have only been discussing the merits of the matter in hand on the
                     assumption that I had
                  accepted,—I will now give you this conditional answer. In the first place, I will
                  accept the command, provided you can't get the freebooters to act under any one
                  else. If you can, I would advise you by all means to do so."
               "As I have not the most remote idea," replied Bernardo, "of trying to secure their
                  services except under your leadership, you may consider that objection to your
                  immediate acceptance removed.—What are your other conditions?"
               "There is but one other: that you will allow me until the middle of the afternoon,
                  to-morrow, to make my final decision. I ask this, because there may be a crisis in
                  my affairs to-morrow, about noon, that may render my acceptance impossible."
               "Certainly," replied the other; "digest the matter at your leisure."
               This last interchange of remarks seeming to bring the interview naturally to a
                  termination, Bernardo bade good-night and turned away from the threshold,
                  revolving in his mind the mysterious allusion couched in Magee's closing
                  speech.
               Day was now breaking, and the young American officer turned in to snatch what
                  repose he might in the brief time that remained before the wonted day-din of the
                  town should rise to disturb his slumbers.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Great Heaven! what vain beliefs
                           Have stirr'd the pulse and led the hopes of man,
                           As if that honor could be bought by blood.
                        
                     
                     —MISS LANDON.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           My brothers of the state
                           Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own.
                        
                     
                     —Othello.
                     
                  
               
               
                  ABOUT eleven o'clock, Magee was galloping alone through the western
                  outskirts of Natchitoches, on his way to the Arroyo Honda, six miles from the
                  town, to fill his deadly appointment with Gatewood. His dress and equipments—in
                  fact, everything about him—were much as on the previous day, when he delivered his
                  own challenge to that dreaded Chief,—the only exception being a small-sword
                  suspended from his belt.
               Up to the time of his interview with Bernardo, he had intended informing Gatewood,
                  as soon as they should meet on the appointed ground, of the deception practised
                  upon him with regard to his own identity,—explaining how, and under what peculiar
                  circumstances, the principal and his second who carried the challenge, came to be
                  one and the same person—namely, Augustus W. Magee, 1st lieutenant of the United
                  States Artillery; and that he was ready for the combat to begin.
               A great change, however, had, meanwhile, been wrought in his feelings. How low had
                  those personalities, which a few hours before had so grievously wounded his honor
                  and stimulated his pride and all his indignant manhood to resent them,—how low had
                  they sunk in his estimation, on the looming up of the glorious fame that awaited
                     him, should he lend his guidance to
                  his countrymen in their efforts to release ten millions of fellow-beings from a
                  debasing bondage. But yesterday, it seemed to him of prime importance that he
                  should wipe out, here, in the lonely forest, by the cold-blooded process of the
                  duello, the imputation of cowardice cast upon his fair name; while, on the other
                  hand, there was now a stage inviting him to act, from which the curtain was about
                  lifting,—a stage so wide that the whole world would be the witnesses of his
                  daring—the applauders of his heroism.
               So far, therefore, from being now, as he had been all along, eager for the
                  approaching combat, he fain would avert it, if it were possible to do so. He was
                  no less loth to spill the blood of a brave man,—who, else, might live to lend his
                  powerful aid to the same noble cause,—than he was to yield up his own breath in
                  this comparatively obscure way, when a career of true glory lured him on.
               In accordance with these feelings, as he neared the ground fixed on for the trial,
                  he resolved, as the last hope of averting the fatal issue of the meeting, to avail
                  himself of the advantages which his incognito afforded him for this purpose.
               Scarcely had he reached the eastern bank of the creek, and noted that the trees
                  cast their shadows exactly with the road, when he descried Gatewood approaching
                  the opposite bank, on foot. Magee did not draw rein on reaching the margin of the
                  stream; and by the time he had crossed to the other side, his foe was confronting
                  him.
               "You are, no doubt, surprised," began Magee, "that my friend is not here to answer
                  your acceptance of his challenge."
               "You are aware, I presume," was the reply, "that, by the code, you are required to
                  take your friend's place?"
               "Fully aware, sir; and quite ready, if you demand it," was the prompt response.
                  "But—"
               "Well, this is rather public, and we may be interrupted here. Let us withdraw from
                  the road, at least."
               "Lead the way to some suitable spot," said Magee, as he dismounted. "I presume you
                  know the ground hereabouts."
               "Every foot of it."
               With this, Gatewood turned aside into the woods, followed by the other, leading
                  his horse. They had advanced about a hundred yards, when Gatewood halted at an
                  opening in the timber.
               "This place will do, I think," said he.
               "There could be none better, whether our meeting is to end in words or war," said
                  Magee,—then retired to a little distance and secured his horse to a limb.
               The spot selected was an open, level space of thick sward, about ten paces across,
                  each way, flanked on one side by a pile of huge rocks, heaped there by nature's
                  hand; while on the other ran the creek. Against the largest rock, which beetled
                  over a little, there was a smirch of smoke spreading out, and gradually thinning
                  as it ascended along the gray granite surface, until, by the time it reached the
                  top, the mark was scarcely visible. This fuliginous deposit had no doubt been
                  caused by a fire kindled at the base of the rock by some roving Pariah, who had
                  bivouacked there,—perhaps tented there for a season,—most probably Gatewood
                  himself, since he found the place so readily on the present occasion.
               "Since I delivered you Lieutenant Magee's note," began Magee, as soon as he had
                  returned, "events have transpired which have caused him to regret the challenge.
                  With your indulgence, I will briefly recount those events."
               The Chief signified his assent.
               
               "Yesterday," Magee began, "a Mexican officer, of high rank, reached Natchitoches,
                  fresh from the scene of strife in Mexico. He represents the patriot cause as by no
                  means so desperate as previous reports made it—reports, which, of course, you have
                  heard. It is still making great headway in many portions of the country. All it
                  needs, to insure success, is a formidable diversion from this quarter. An
                  expedition is about being set on foot, to leave Natchitoches, as soon as it can be
                  got ready. This is intended to drive all Spaniards from Texas, declare her
                  independent, and set up a republican government. For this purpose, while we expect
                  to get the aid of many men from the United States, we do not feel sure of success,
                  unless we can secure the co-operation of the men of the Neutral Ground. If they
                  join us, their fame and fortunes will be made along with our own.
               "Lieutenant Magee, who has been selected to command the expedition, hopes to fight
                  side by side with them yet, and to rival their Chief in daring deeds on many a
                  glorious field, instead of seeking his heart's blood in a way that can bring honor
                  to neither. He bids me say to you that he very much regrets having suffered
                  himself to be goaded by your taunt, to the extent of inflicting a disgraceful
                  punishment on some of your men; and that he is willing to make amends to them in
                  every possible way. He also regrets exceedingly having sent the challenge, which
                  he did under the pressure of momentary anger; and authorizes me, not only to
                  withdraw it, but to apologize for its very offensive tone,—casting, as it did,
                  insinuations against your bravery, which neither he, nor any one else who has
                  heard but the simple truth of you, ever questioned."
               Throughout this interview, the two men were pacing to and fro the narrow bounds of
                  the greensward, often crossing each other's paths, their step quickened or
                  retarded, according as their feelings were excited or not, by their words.
               "And why is not Lieutenant Magee here, to tell me these things himself?" demanded
                  the stalwart freebooter, suddenly staying his step, and looking fiercely at his
                  disguised foe.
               So searching, indeed, was the look, that Magee began to think Gatewood suspected
                  his disguise,—or, rather, that he had really known him all this time, and
                  yesterday to boot. So convinced was he of this, for a moment, that he was on the
                  point of declaring his identity, and, as the only alternative left him, drawing
                  his sword without more ado. But reflecting, instantly, that he never had any great
                  cause of grievance against this man, and that what little he had was now sunk into
                  insignificance by the untold grievances of millions, so lately and so vividly
                  depicted to him by one just from the scene, he once more checked the deadly
                  impulse, and resolved, then and there, that, if this meeting was destined to
                  eventuate in hostilities, the moody Chieftain of the Neutral Ground, and not
                  himself, must initiate them.
               Nor were these reflections at all weakened by the fact that he found the grim
                  bandit gradually, though quite unintentionally, overcoming his prejudices and
                  gaining on his good opinion. When he visited his encampment, he expected to
                  encounter a monster of repulsive front. He found, instead, a man,
                  presenting not only a highly favored person and an attractive countenance, but
                  polite manners withal. Here, in this second meeting, with a mind already disposed
                  by late events to extenuate still further his misdeeds, he saw but a noble
                  leader—noble, provided he could only be induced to abjure the lawless life he now
                  led, and to direct his energies and his talents into a proper channel.
               Instead, therefore, of answering fiercely, he quietly replied,—still trusting that
                  his disguise had not been penetrated:
               
               "Lieutenant Magee's reasons for not giving you these explanations in person must
                  be obvious enough, when you consider that his main object is to avert a collision.
                  Were two men of such spirit to meet after the insults that have passed between
                  you, meeting would be but fighting."
               "What then," asked Gatewood, "becomes of my charge against him of cowardice?"
               This remark, though gently enough uttered, caused Magee's quick blood to mount to
                  his face, flushing it all over, while his gleaming eyes instantly shot a glance
                  into those before him, as he replied:
               "If this meeting, sir, is to end without bloodshed—"
               He had, during this heated moment of passion, forgotten that he was only Magee's
                  friend, and thought himself Magee, and thus came very near betraying his identity;
                  but suddenly recollecting how things really were, and curbing his wrath, he
                  continued,—stammering a little in the first words:
               "That is—I mean—if you intend settling this affair amicably with my friend through
                  me, the less said about that charge the better, unless you name it to withdraw it.
                  Now, the truth is, my friend had no reason whatever to think that you lacked
                  personal courage. His taunt was altogether the result of yours. He has withdrawn
                  the charge, and has freely acknowledged your bravery, although you must own he had
                  quite as much reason to question it as you had to question his. Why,
                  then, can you not act a generous part, and admit not that he is brave,—for, of
                  that you may know nothing,—but that you have no ground to deem him the
                  reverse?"
               There now ensued a painful pause; for Gatewood, instead of replying at once,
                  looked down for some moments, as if considering what answer to make. This
                  hesitation irritated Magee no little. He found it a trying task to await quietly
                  the decision of a man who was, even then, coolly revolving in his mind, whether or
                  not he who awaited that decision was a coward—deliberately weighing the pros and cons bearing upon that delicate question. He
                  resolved to cut the judgment short, let it be what it might.
               "Well, sir, this is truly hard to bear!" he broke out. "If you find it so very
                  difficult to decide that point, you and Lieutenant Magee shall yet confront each
                  other. If you do not know he is a brave man, you soon shall know that he is, at
                  least, brave enough to meet you, face to face and steel to steel.
                  Draw! for I am the man whom you insult."
               With this, Magee, transformed into a perfect tiger for energy, activity, and wrath
                  combined, whipped out his rapier and took position.
               Gatewood, much to his opponent's surprise, instead of responding, in kind, to this
                  tornado of word and manner, merely withdrew his eyes from the ground, and, fixing
                  them steadily on the stormy speaker before him, observed, in tones as calm as the
                  zephyr's breath:
               "Lieutenant Magee, if you expected, by making a few changes in your person, to
                  disguise yourself from me, all I can say, is, you knew little of me. I was once in
                  your company a moment. Where, or when, it matters not. I was in
                  disguise then. When I have once looked fairly into a man's eyes, and can get a
                  look into them again, great, indeed, must be the change that would make me mistake
                  him for a stranger. I knew you yesterday as soon as I saw you; and had I but given
                  the signal, my men would have torn you in pieces. Of course, I knew you to-day.
                  From the time I accepted your challenge, until a few moments ago, I made no doubt
                  one of us would fall in the appointed fight; for I had no reason to doubt you
                     were brave, and would meet me or would
                  have good cause for refusing. The insulting note I sent you did not express any
                  real sentiments. I penned it because irritated to think that the officers of a
                  great government would voluntarily condescend to protect smugglers, instead of
                  leaving, alike, all men who are committing unlawful acts, to protect
                  themselves,—as we of the Neutral Ground have done for years, and hope to do for
                  years to come.
               "And now I will say, that, although I came here fully resolved to shed your blood
                  if this arm could do it, I was soon made glad to find that you offered, instead of
                  deadly combat, a truce to hostilities. For it left me an opening for proposing
                  that which is much nearer my heart than fighting you."
               Long before the Chief had spoken thus far, Magee had not only pretty fairly caught
                  the contagion of his calmness, but felt, besides, no slight degree of that
                  confusion which comes over us when made unpleasantly conscious that we have quite
                  overdone a matter of passion. These circumstances, together with the conciliatory
                  tone of his opponent's remarks, had banished every appearance of menace from his
                  attitude, look, and manner, by the time his turn to speak had arrived.
               "You mean, then," said he, "that you will join our—"
               "No," replied Gatewood, "I was not thinking of your military plans. I will allude
                  to them presently. If you will but do all you can to have my men released, I
                  promise not only to forget all about the little matter which brought us here, but
                  to maintain your bravery on all occasions when it may be called in question. You
                  caused the poor fellows to be whipped and tortured, although they had never harmed
                  you or yours. God knows they have suffered enough already, for merely plundering
                  thieves; and if you will only effect their release, I think I can safely promise
                  that none of us will ever afterwards—I dare not say, bear you malice, for that we
                  shall probably carry to our graves—but that we will never seek to work you
                  personal harm, nor oppose the cause which you expect to engage in.
               "As to our co-operation with you in the proposed campaign, however, it is not to
                  be thought of; and the sooner you drop it from your calculations, the better both
                  for us and yourself. We may overlook the past, but we cannot forgive; and as
                  regards forgetting, it will be impossible even to try."
               "I pledge you my honor that I will exert all my influence to effect their
                  release," said Magee, somewhat moved at the Chief's unexpected display of feeling
                  in behalf of his men, though at the same time greatly discouraged to hear that
                  there was no hope of securing the important aid of the powers holding sway in
                  Neutralia.
               He would probably have renewed his attempt at persuasion—at least, would have
                  given Gatewood to understand that he still entertained hopes of his final
                  co-operation, as he called to mind the more definite and tangible offers which
                  Bernardo had pledged himself to make. As he was about to speak to that effect,
                  however, the Chief waved adieu; and thrusting aside the bushes which hedged in
                  their narrow stage, opposite the side they had entered, disappeared in the dense
                  wood, leaving the other no alternative but to mount his horse and turn
                  homeward.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Oh, why was woman made so fair, or man
                           So weak as to see that more than one had beauty?
                        
                     
                     —Festus.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I partly think
                           A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
                           Till he did look on me.
                        
                     
                     —Measure for Measure.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        As if for death, some lonely trumpet peal'd.
                     
                     —CAMPBELL.
                  
               
               
                  FOR many weeks, refugees, mostly persons of note, were passing
                  through the Neutral Ground, on their way to some place of safety. They knew too
                  well the nature of the foes with whom they had to deal to trust themselves within
                  their reach; for it has always been, that when Spaniards triumphed, after a
                  struggle with the oppressed, they have required more blood and persecution to
                  appease their vengeance—miscalled by them, justice—than any other enlightened
                  people on the face of the globe.
               Gatewood had given orders to his men that none of these unfortunates, of whatever
                  degree, should be disturbed while crossing his territory, or sojourning therein,
                  if they should choose to sojourn. Whatever his faults, or crimes, he never added
                  to the distresses of those already under affliction; and the same policy was on
                  all occasions inculcated upon his followers, though not quite so invariably
                  obeyed.
               One afternoon, he was returning, on horseback, to Camp Wildwood—which the reader
                  has already visited with Magee—from the inspection of a building that he had
                  lately caused to be erected for himself on the margin of a certain lake, presently
                  to be described, and standing in the heart of the Neutral Ground. Finding it more
                  convenient to leave, for the time, the net-work of by-paths which penetrated the
                  forest in every direction, and with the intricacies of which he, as well as most
                  of his men, was perfectly familiar, he emerged from one of these by-paths into the
                  main road, already more than once alluded to, intending, after passing along that
                  thoroughfare for the distance of a mile or two, to strike off in the direction of
                  the camp.
               It chanced that soon after he had entered the road and was moving westward, he met
                  a party of mounted refugees, consisting of five persons. In front, and riding
                  abreast, were an elderly man and a youth; while a few paces behind them came a
                  young lady. These three, evidently of pure Spanish descent, were all well mounted
                  on stylish horses.
               Bringing up the rear, were a Mexican man and woman, both somewhat stricken in
                  years, riding mules and driving before them two pack-animals of the same species,
                  one laden with a tent and blankets, together with provisions and a few
                  cooking-utensils, the other bearing various articles appertaining to
                  tent-life.
               The fiery-eyed, classic-featured youth wore upon his face a sternness altogether
                  alien to his years. He sat his horse in military style, was attired in a jacket
                  and nether garments of black velvet, with red cord running along their seams. The
                  former vestment was decorated by a row of silver buttons on each side in front;
                  the latter, after the Mexican fashion, by a row of the same extending from the
                  waist down, outside of each leg, to the foot, buttoned, however, only as far as
                  the knee, the lower portion flowing loose. A crimson silk sash was gracefully
                  knotted about his waist, the fringed ends pendent, and at times playing against
                  his horse's side. His slouched hat, of sombre hue, was garnished by a black
                  ostrich-feather. He carried the only weapons of the party,—namely, a pair of
                  richly mounted pistols, in his holsters,
                  and at his side a sabre with gold-plated hilt. The horse which he rode was
                  caparisoned in the most ornate fashion, the bridle, saddle, and housings, of the
                  best material, being elaborately wrought with gold and silver thread.
               The style of vestments worn by the elderly man told at once of his priestly
                  calling. These ecclesiastical trappings, apparently so ill-befitting the occasion,
                  may have been donned to throw a holy air around, not only his own person, but the
                  whole party, to the end, that none of them might suffer harm, or be subjected to
                  insult, during the perilous journey they had been making.
               The beauty of the lady—both in her oval face and her slender, yet well-rounded
                  person—would, at a glance, have struck the most indifferent beholder as of no
                  common order; while any one peculiarly susceptible to such influences might well
                  have been more than transiently impressed, even while passing,—though she were
                  never seen again.
               Her style bespoke the blending of Moorish with Castilian blood, though her dark
                  dress was, in nothing, different from that of an American lady, except that she
                  wore over her robe a rich scarf embroidered in sober hues. This, none but a
                  Spanish woman knows how to wear; and in her graceful handling alone is it really
                  beautiful. If she rides—and those of them who ride at all show splendid
                  horsemanship—she knows exactly when and how to gather up its folds, and when and
                  how to let them flow in rhythm with her movements. If she walks—and who can walk
                  like a Spanish woman?—it waves as gracefully about her as an angel's wing.
               Her hair,—except the eye, the chief pride of the Spanish beauty,—which had
                  probably been braided or coiled upon her head, now, as though glad to be released,
                  gambolled in the breeze, and being wavy, and flossy withal, was none the less
                  beautiful—nay, more so—for the disorder.
               The large, dark, changeful eyes betrayed, from beneath their jetty fringe, the
                  attributes of those southern climes where they had been born and nursed. They
                  could flash on you until you well might quail; they could pour forth on your
                  darker hours their soothing dew; but between these, they could languish on you a
                  twilight of such weird softness that you would pray to dwell in their gentle
                  radiance forever. The pencilled brows were drawn up into that arch which so surely
                  betokens sadness; and, indeed, there was wanting but an unrelieved pallor to make
                  that lovely face the saddest of pictures. Exercise, however, had brought a ruddy
                  tinge to the cheek, and the mouth was as fresh as the morning rose, the petals
                  whereof are just enough open to hint of pearly treasures within.
               Thus was this living tablet relieved from what else had caused a pang to the
                  gazer. It pains us to look upon the unbroken whiteness of a monument beneath which
                  we know bright hopes are buried, but not quite so much when we find that the
                  deathly pallor is relieved by a spot or two of vermeil moss upon its face.
               Much of all this Gatewood saw during the brief time that they paused to learn of
                  him the distance to Natchitoches, and whether or not (they being very travel-worn,
                  they said) there was any nearer available place of rest and refreshment; and, for
                  a moment, he was humbled by the sudden consciousness that in his stern breast
                  there was rising a wild tumult attended by heart-throbs of a sort he had not known
                  for years. Truth to say, he felt, just at the time, heartily ashamed of his
                  weakness,—as he thought it,—and rather abruptly—if not, indeed, impolitely—ended
                  the conference by touching his horse with the spur and moving off.
               
               He, however, soon had good cause to suspect that he had not conquered himself as
                  thoroughly as he had hoped. He was fain to cast a look behind at the retiring
                  group: then, provoked at having done so, he instantly withdrew his gaze. But again
                  he found himself looking back, and again, until at length, when a turn in the road
                  veiled the party from his view, he betrayed the true state of his feelings by
                  exclaiming, with a gesture well corresponding:
               "She never once looked back!"
               In fact, every time he had turned to look at her, he had hoped she would vouchsafe
                  to bestow upon him a single glance as a token of transient interest, at least,
                  however slight; and felt really chagrined that she did not.
               "Well," thought he, as he rode slowly along, "why should it concern me that she
                  did n't? Why, I can blow all this miserable, nonsensical stuff out of my breast by
                  one hearty sigh." And he suited the action to the thought—"sighing like a
                  furnace."
               But even while he did so, and inwardly laughed at his own unrefined conceit, he
                  felt that it was a genuine sigh nevertheless,—such a one as had long been a
                  stranger to that broad breast.
               "There now!" he muttered; "it's all over. What a deal of fuss some men do make
                  about a pretty woman—acting the fool for nothing—over head and ears for many a
                  long year—and all that!"
               But despite this arrogation of invulnerability, there remained proof enough that
                  the face of the fair stranger clung to his thoughts; for he had gone but little
                  further, before he heaved another deep sigh,—unconsciously this time,—muttering,
                  as he did so:
               "What a sad face it was! No doubt, she has lost many friends in that confounded
                  war. The youth I take to be her brother—they have the same cast of features. But
                  she may have lost one who was more than a brother; and if she—"
               The sentence on his lips was left unfinished. He had just then reached the point
                  where he was to diverge from the road into a bridle-path, to make, in a
                  south-western direction, his way through the forest to the encampment.
               He reined in suddenly, and sat in listening attitude. He appeared, from the
                  expression of his face and from the direction in which he kept it turned, to have
                  caught faintly some sound coming from the west, not altogether pleasant to his
                  ear; but, being still in doubt, he was marking it intently. It seemed, at first,
                  like the rushing and roaring of some distant body. Presently, it began to assume,
                  to his practised ear, a more distinct sound, not unlike the rapid tramp of
                  feet.
               "It is a squad of cavalry," he growled, instinctively placing his hand on the butt
                  of his pistol, though with no intention of using it just at the moment; then
                  driving his spurs into his horse, he darted into the thicket. "They are
                  pursued!"
               So saying, he turned his horse's head back towards the road,—only a deer's leap in
                  distance,—and, taking such a position as would enable him to see, through the
                  dense foliage, any who might pass,—without exposing himself to view,—awaited the
                  approach of the horsemen. Nearer and nearer they came, and louder grew their
                  multitudinous tramp, till, presently, they thundered by with clattering hoof and
                  rattling scabbard, in such a dense cloud of dust, however, which the horses' feet
                  drove up before them into the air, that he could see neither how many, nor of what
                  manner, they were. Yet he had a full view of the leading horseman, and saw that he
                  wore the uniform of a Spanish captain. Assuming that, in such a wide road, the men
                  were riding several abreast, he judged, by the extent of the veiling cloud, that they would number
                  about twenty.
               He seemed to muse a moment, as if in a quandary. It was but a moment.
               "They must be rescued!" he said, starting from his reverie.
               With this, he wheeled his horse and urged him at full speed down the path,—then,
                  putting to his lips a bugle which hung from his belt, he seemed about to sound
                  it.
               Gatewood and his officers had sound signals for certain purposes, and usually
                  carried their bugles with them. In fact, any other system of signalling must have
                  proved futile, owing to the fact that the surface of the country was nearly level
                  and covered by almost unbroken forest. The signal for rallying at the point where
                  the bugle was blown, was, three blasts in quick succession. That for rallying at
                  the encampment, was, an indefinite number at longer intervals,—the person who
                  signalled, unless already at the encampment, blowing as he flew thither. The
                  former usually indicated nothing more serious in the wind than a bear or a wolf to
                  be hunted, and was designed to summon only the few who might be scattered in the
                  vicinity and disposed to join in the sport. The other was of more momentous
                  import,—calling for a general rally, and that with all speed. Its ringing notes
                  sent a wild thrill to the hearts of all who heard them, being, in fact, equivalent
                  to the long-roll of the drum in large armies.
               The Chief, however, withdrew the bugle from his lips without sounding it. This
                  doubtless was done, because, on second thought, he recollected that the Spanish
                  troop must still be within hearing of it, and should they catch the sound, they
                  would think it ominous of no good, and being thus put on the alert, would hurry
                  back with the unlucky refugees,—whom, even by this time, they must have
                  captured,—and so escape across the Sabine before he could collect sufficient force
                  for the rescue—his camp being still several miles distant. He, however, only
                  postponed the signal until he should get beyond their hearing.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
                           Would I not undergo for one calm look.
                        
                     
                     
                        Two Gentlemen of Verona.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        Not so hot, good sir.
                     
                     —Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  IT being a fine day, and nothing particular on the tapis, or
                  expected, the men of Camp Wildwood had scattered abroad, many of them to distant
                  points; some to hunt, others to fish, and others to course the wild bee from those
                  natural lawn-like openings of small extent, which east of the Sabine began to
                  greet the traveller, increasing both in number and size as he journeyed westward,
                  until, in the region of the Trinity, they opened into Nature's grand
                  flower-fields, dotted here and there with clumps of trees—the delight of all who
                  beheld them. While east of the Sabine the bee's chief difficulty was to find
                  flowers from which to gather his hoard, west of the Trinity his great concern was
                  to find a tree suitable for his habitation and treasury.
               In consequence of this general dispersion, Gatewood found, on reaching the camp,
                  only about a dozen men. These were armed, and ready for any emergency, and others
                  were coming in almost every moment in answer to his signal; but all were on
                  foot.
               "More men than I want," said the Chief, as he galloped up to where they stood. "But why are you all on
                  foot? Where are the horses? I need the wings of the wind, this morning."
               There were not more than a score of horses kept by Gatewood's band. The nature of
                  the country did not admit of their being used to any great extent, nor was there
                  often a call for more than they had. Moreover, the difficulty of subsisting them
                  made them both inconvenient and unprofitable. Spots suitable for grazing were
                  sparse and of very contracted limits, as may be inferred from what has just been
                  said touching the bee's difficulties in this region.
               "The horses have been taken out several miles to graze," said one of the men. "But
                  we can have them here in an hour."
               "That will be too late," said Gatewood. Then, after a pause of reflection, "Have
                  the men gone yet, who got permission to hunt by the lake?"
               "They started about an hour ago."
               "Were they mounted?"
               "Yes, Captain; it's too long a tramp on foot."
               "If they heard my signal, it's time— Hark! they're coming!"
               Several agreed that the sound now heard was that of horses at full speed,—though,
                  muffled as it was by the surrounding wood, others were more cautious in giving
                  their opinion.
               So distinct, however, did the hoof-strokes soon become, that there remained no
                  longer any doubt on the subject; and, in a few minutes more, five horsemen were
                  descried coming at a tearing rate along one of the many bridle-paths converging to
                  the camp.
               "Are your pistols in order, Wynne?" asked Gatewood, as they reined in before
                  him.
               "Prime, Cap'n," replied a stout, grim-looking fellow,—with a great heavy beard,
                  somewhat grizzled, and a voice that rumbled not altogether unlike thunder,—to whom
                  the party seemed to accord, tacitly, a sort of leadership.
               "Loaded, too, for none of your small game—are you sure?"
               "For the biggest buck that's goin', and good for him at fifty steps,
                  in case Darlin' failed to fetch him."
               Here the speaker cast on the long rifle, which he held across the saddle-bow, in
                  his right hand, probably as fond a glance as he ever bestowed on the
                  "darlin'"—whoever she might be—in whose honor the murderous long-range was
                  named.
               "Then put up your rifles, and get your sabres. There's a chance to knock the rust
                  off them, if you can get them out of the scabbards."
               "Get 'em out o' the scabbards!" echoed Wynne,—as he dismounted and moved off, with
                  the others, towards the tent near at hand, which served as an armory,—but talking
                  back over his shoulder. "Why, Cap'n, they 're as bright as a paynter's eye: we
                  edged 'em off beautiful, yesterday; and if it's Spanish blood you 're on the hunt
                  of, they 'll leap out o' their sheths 'emselves, without bein' tetched—like a
                  thicket-wolf on to a fawn."
               "It is Spanish blood," replied the Captain, as the veteran
                  disappeared within the armory.
               "Davies—this way!" said Gatewood, calling to his side one of the most resolute,
                  but at the same time the most civilized-looking of the by-standing men. "Take this
                  to my tent," he said, handing him his small-sword, "and bring my sabre. But," he
                  continued in a very low tone, "keep the matter from Filly. You know how it is with
                  her: that's the reason I don't go myself."
               The man walked off rapidly with the sword. In a few minutes he returned, bringing
                  the desired weapon.
               
               "Did she ask any questions?" inquired Gatewood, in a subdued tone, as he girded
                  the deadly weapon about him.
               "She did n't see me at all. She was in the front hammock, reading: so I slipped in
                  the back way. She never looked up."
               "That 's well. Davies, should anything happen to me, you know you are to take her
                  to your mother in town."
               "I 'll never forget my promise to do that, Captain; and I 'll warrant, she 'll be
                  well cared for. The old lady took a great fancy to her, you know; and she's just
                  the kindest old lady in the world when she does take a fancy."
               By this time, the five men had returned.
               "Now, follow me!" said Gatewood, as soon as they had mounted. And, with this, he
                  flew along one of the bridle-paths leading in a north-westerly direction, followed
                  by the men in single file.
               When they had run at this break-neck rate for about three miles, Wynne, availing
                  himself of a long stretch that was wide enough for two horsemen to ride abreast in
                  the path, spurred suddenly up and laid his animal close alongside Gatewood's.
               "Cap'n," said he, in low confidential tones, "what is it that there 's such a d——d
                  hurry about? What's to be the end o' this business, anyhow?"
               Now, the Chief was a very reticent man, and seldom communicated his counsels to
                  any one except his lieutenants, and not often to them. Wynne, however, was a
                  privileged character, partly from his being one of the most efficient of the men,
                  in the three cardinal virtues of the Neutralians—hunting, wood-craft, and
                  fighting; and, also, from his being one of the few who could show a sprinkling of
                  gray about furrowed temples.
               But even the old woodsman was not much given to obtruding on his Chief's
                  reticence. On this occasion, however ever, Wynne thought he had never before seen
                  him look so "like mad," as he afterwards said, though he had seen him under
                  circumstances of an intensely exciting character. He was afraid this unwonted
                  hot-bloodedness—to whatever cause it was due—might prevent his doing the usual
                  cool thing, which Wynne himself never failed to do, and to enjoin strenuously on
                  others. His motto, so far as it could be gathered from his practice, seemed to be,
                  "If you 've got to spill blood, spill it; but no more 'n you can help, on either
                  side; and more 'specially if it 's your'n." His object, therefore, in
                  propounding the query, was, to elicit information on which to volunteer his
                  advice,—he being, as yet, almost wholly in the dark as to the matter in hand. Of
                  course, the Captain could adopt it, or not, as he should see fit.
               "When I say 'Follow!' at the beginning of a campaign like this," replied Gatewood,
                  "isn't it always 'Charge!' at the end of it?"
               "I reckon it is: leastways, ginerally; but it seems to me like as if this 'ere
                  campaign 's all charge, and a d——l of a long charge at that. If we go
                  on, this way, much further, our critters 'll be so blowed they won't have any wind
                  in 'em to charge with, and we mought git kind o' chawed up, if we
                  ain't too many for 'em when we find 'em."
               "They are about three or four to one," said Gatewood, seeming to wake up a little
                  to the true state of the case, and reining in slightly.
               By this time, the road became again so narrow, that Wynne had to fall back into
                  single file. The conversation was, nevertheless, kept up under these
                  disadvantages, though in a louder tone, that could, perhaps, be heard by one or
                  two of the other men. Whenever the path would widen out a little, Wynne would spur
                  forward to the Captain's side, and
                  their tones would again become inaudible to those in the rear.
               "Then, I say, we 'd better take it a little bit cooler 'n this."
               "But there 's no time to lose," said the Captain. "Wynne, I reckon I may as well
                  tell you all about this thing, and ask your advice: I may want it before we get
                  back."
               "Better late 'n never," thought Wynne. "Well, Cap'n," said he, "I b'lieve I
                     have helped to improve your campaigns oncet or twicet, afore
                  now."
               "So you have—yes, a dozen times. Well, the state of the case is just this: Only a
                  few minutes before you heard me blow, I met, on the Natchitoches road, about a
                  mile this side of the lake, a party of five refugees—a lady among them."
               "Aha! so there 's a woman mixed up with it," thought Wynne; "and that 's just what
                  's the matter. He always gives that sect a wide berth, 'cept when they 're hard
                  put to it. He don't love 'em overly, but he 'll fight for 'em like mad. But seems
                  now like as if he 's crazier 'n there 's any use for."
               Of course the veteran thought all this in a single moment, and did not, in
                  consequence of the mental episode, lose a jot of what the Captain was saying.
               "Just after I turned off the road," the latter continued, "I saw a squadron of
                  Spanish cavalry—about twenty—dash by at full speed, evidently in pursuit of them.
                  They must have been captured but a few minutes afterwards. Now, this path, you
                  know, comes into the main road, a few rods this side of the Sabine ferry. I
                  propose to get there before them; then to turn about eastwardly, and sweep the
                  road until we meet them. You know, as well as I do, what comes next. Now, can you
                  improve that plan? It has the merit, at least, of simplicity."
               "I think I can tetch it up, and make it look a leetle han'somer 'n that," replied
                  Wynne, after a brief space of thought. "I like it all well enough till we git to
                  the road—leastways, all 'cept blowin' the critters so bad. I think
                     that kind o' risky. But I don't like that idee o' your'n, Cap'n,
                  sweeping back, that a way, and half a dozen men charging twenty reg'lar Spaniards
                  fair and square up, in a big road. It'll cost blood."
               "Of course, it will," replied the Chief, slightly irritated; "and if you can plan
                  it so that it won't cost blood, suppose you do it."
               "I can easy fix it," said the veteran, "so it won't cost so much of our'n, and
                  more o' their'n."
               "That's very desirable—how would you do it?" said the Captain, evidently losing
                  his sharpness of manner, and becoming interested.
               "Well, Cap'n, I 'd take it Injin fashion."
               "That 's a mean, sneaking way of fighting, Wynne."
               "Not quite so mean, I reckon, as for the most of us to have to go under,—and then
                  let 'em git the gal, to boot."
               Wynne made this last remark upon the assumption that "the gal" was the main object
                  with Gatewood; and it is quite probable he judged correctly.
               "Sure enough they might do that. Well, we 'll lay an ambuscade,
                  then."
               "We 've got 'em now, sure's h-ll!" thought Wynne. "You see, Cap'n," said he, "we
                  fellows don't often miss when we draw a bead, all standin'. It's different,
                  though, dashin' up, full run. We 'll pick our men; and when the first smoke clears
                  away, there 'll be six less of 'em for our second shot; and then, mebby, ten less
                  (that's jist half, you see, if there 's the round twenty of 'em) for the sabre,
                  and none of our'n down yit. And it's but the fair thing, too, when there's three
                  to one."
               
               "To be sure it is, Wynne. I have never hesitated to adopt that very plan when I
                  could,—even where I have not been outnumbered by the enemy. But, really, I,
                  somehow, did n't think of it this time. I don't believe my brain is very cool and
                  clear this morning, if the truth was known."
               "That's jist what I was thinking, Cap'n; and I was tryin' to git you back to your
                  same old cool again. I don't b'lieve I ever saw you flustered afore."
               "Well it's all right now," said the Chief.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               
                  
                     
                        I would not be in some of your coats for twopence.
                     
                     —Twelfth Night.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        Truly, sir, I would advise you to clap into your prayers.
                     
                     
                        Measure for Measure.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        Revenge to me is sweeter far than life.
                     
                     —The Witch of Edmonton.
                     
                  
               
               
                  THE first thing, on reaching the road, was to assure themselves that
                  the pursuing Spaniards had not yet returned. This, to Wynne, skilled woodsman as
                  he was, was no difficult matter. On a mere glance at the surface of the highway,
                  he pronounced the intruders still on the Neutral Ground.
               They forthwith selected for their ambush, a point where the road made a short
                  semicircular sweep, to wind around a ravine; then stationed themselves among the
                  tangled growth, in the concavity of the bend, so as to be able, as the military
                  phrase goes, to move on shorter lines than the enemy; or, as Wynne expressed it,
                  with characteristic disregard alike of elegance and technicalities, "to git the
                  inside track on 'em."
               Scarcely were they in position, when they heard the familiar tramp of advancing
                  cavalry. Gatewood, for obvious reasons, had not dismounted his little band. The
                  well-trained horses, which, by this time, had recovered their wind, stood like
                  statues behind the leafy cover, and only by the excited gleam of their eyes did
                  they betray an inkling of what was about to happen.
               Presently, the Spaniards entered the bend of the road, and became visible to the
                  ambush through the many little natural windows afforded by the foliage, that were
                  so soon to serve, also, as embrasures through which to point the deadly tube, and
                  pour the deadly shot.
               As the cavalcade approached, their enemies, being close upon the road, could see
                  that its military part marched three abreast, in two squads of about equal
                  numbers. Between these squads, and about ten paces from each, moved the captured
                  party,—in much the same order as when Gatewood met them,—and flanked, on either
                  side, by an officer. Indeed, the only change which the Chief could discern, showed
                  itself in the present pitiable plight of the youth. Not only was he disarmed, but
                  his hands were tied behind him; and as, in this helpless condition, it would have
                  been impossible for him to guide his horse, the animal had been secured, by means
                  of the rein, to the priest's bit. The lady's face could not be seen: her head was
                  bowed down upon her hand, and she seemed to be weeping.
               At this time they were moving no faster than a brisk walk. Doubtless, they had
                  been making greater speed; but inasmuch as they had penetrated so far into the
                  Neutral Ground, and had come again so near their own soil, without a show of
                  danger, they perhaps thought it useless to hurry up any longer, and far more
                  becoming to enter the territory of his most serene Majesty with more serenity than a precipitate flight would
                  present. Or, perhaps, they did not fully comprehend and appreciate the peculiar
                  perils of the Neutral Ground. This, indeed, would seem to have been the true state
                  of the case, from the fact of their bringing away with them the unwieldy
                  pack-mules, which must have materially retarded their progress. Had they left
                  these behind, and made all haste to get back to their own country, no ambush would
                  have been awaiting them here. But, as it was, Spanish avarice outweighed even
                  Spanish prudence, and here they were, where, perhaps, neither prudence nor avarice
                  would long avail them.
               The first intimation they had of danger, was the startling sound of six
                  pistol-shots piercing their ears, and the ghastly and fearful spectacle shocking
                  their vision, of four of the front squad rolling from their saddles, and two more
                  spurring off at full speed, evidently wounded. The officers were not picked off
                  with the rest, for the very good reason that they were in range with the
                  prisoners, and the lives of the latter would thereby have been endangered.
               The rear squad, after wildly discharging a volley into the invisible ambush, with
                  no more serious damage than slightly wounding one man and one or two horses,
                  dashed forward among the prisoners and became so mixed up with them—purposely,
                  perhaps—that the second volley from the Neutralians—which Wynne, in the nice
                  calculation already figured up by him on the route, expected would reduce them "to
                  jist one half, if there 's the round twenty of 'em"—could not be availed of.
               Gatewood, seeing instantly this state of things, ordered his men to reserve their
                  remaining shot, and close, man to man, with the sabre,—which was done, in dashing
                  style. He himself singled out the Captain of the troop, who, however, was on the
                  far side of the road, so that, in order to reach him, the Chief was obliged first
                  to cut down a Spaniard iard, who crossed him, and then to thrust aside, by
                  charging upon them, the two pack-mules, which stood, fixed and trembling, directly
                  in his path.
               He did not reach his foe a moment too soon; for he found him in the dastardly act
                  of trying to murder, in cold blood, the helpless youth, who not only had his hands
                  tied behind him, but had been disarmed. The monster had already struck at him,
                  but, in order to avoid the blow, he had leaped from his horse; and, in doing so,
                  his back being, for a moment, turned towards his enemy, the weapon descended
                  between his arms, and touching, with the very point, the cord which bound his
                  wrists together, severed it clearly. Whereupon the youth, finding himself free,
                  instead of making off,—as he had intended doing,—snatched a sabre from one of the
                  dying Spaniards who lay upon the ground, and turned violently upon his foe. But
                  the latter, being still mounted, had greatly the advantage in his elevated
                  position, and would, no doubt, have soon dispatched the youth. Meanwhile, however,
                  Gatewood had made his way to the spot; and, parrying a deadly blow aimed at the
                  youth, ran his sabre, almost to the hilt, into and through the breast of the
                  Spaniard, who rolled to the ground a corpse.
               By this time, the crowd was pretty well thinned out. The spirited youth finding
                  his friend had taken the truculent Captain entirely off his hands, turned about,
                  and atoned for his constrained inactivity in the first part of the melée, by
                  attacking a dismounted Spaniard, much his superior in strength, and killing him
                  after a severe struggle.
               The priest,—whose horse had been shot from under him,—apparently forgetful of his
                  ghostly office, instead of hastening to offer the consolations of extreme unction
                  to the souls that were being disembodied all around him, fell to with a will, and
                  a pistol which he snatched up from the ground, and in the twinkling of an eye, released from all
                  earthly bondage a grim devil of a Gachupin, who was striving, with his sword, to
                  do the same office upon one of the Neutral Ground boys.
               Wynne and his fellow-freebooters, as may readily be believed, had killed and
                  disabled their share. One or two had escaped on foot to the bushes. So that there
                  were only two or three left as prisoners.
               The Mexican man and woman were missing; but, on search being made for them, they
                  were discovered behind the pack of one of the mules, which had been shot dead by
                  some random bullet, and had staggered off the road before falling. They were
                  crouched on the leeward side thereof, quite safe from the storm.
               As soon as Gatewood had settled accounts with the Captain, he had turned about for
                  another foe. Instead, however, of finding a foe, he turned just in time to catch
                  in his arms the lady; who, having sat her horse in the middle of the road during
                  those few terrible moments, too horrified to flee from the surrounding perils, or
                  even to utter a scream, now fainted away, and, but for his timely aid, must have
                  fallen to the ground. Dismounting, he bore her to the roadside, and laying her
                  gently on the sward, left her in charge of his Reverence, who hastened to her
                  side.
               Whilst this more peaceful scene was being enacted, Wynne, observing that the young
                  man—apparently resolved to make up what time he had lost during the first
                  onset—was about to put an end to one of the Spaniards, who had no arms with which
                  to defend himself, struck up the descending weapon with his sabre.
               "Young gent!" said he coolly, "this here fight 's over now. No cold blood, if you
                     please.
               The young man's frenzied heat was so thoroughly calmed down by the quiet tone and
                  manner of the veteran, that he not only desisted at once from his murderous
                  intention, but appeared quite overcome with confusion, as he turned away and
                  sheathed his sword.
               One of the Neutralians was killed, and three others were slightly wounded. Wynne,
                  somehow or other, got a considerable scratch behind, which being fain to conceal,
                  he said nothing about it,—although it must have smarted him a good deal,—hoping it
                  would not be discovered, as, in that case, it would probably be made—owing to its
                  particular locality—the subject of an ugly joke, by the other men.
               He and the three surviving men were standing in a group apart from the rest of the
                  party, talking over the fight. Two of them were displaying their wounds, and
                  seemed rather proud of them, as they related the manner in which they were
                  received. Wynne, with an unscathed front,—which he managed to keep towards them
                  whilst discussing the matter,—was saying, in rather a derogatory tone:
               "Boys, it ain't the gittin' of wounds that 's to be proud of, as I 've always told
                  ye: it's keepin' clare of 'em that's the thing. It 's a heap wuss on the inemy,
                  and easier on ourse'ves."
               "Somehow or 'nother, you 're always moughty lucky, Wynne," said one of his
                  companions.
               "Yes, boys—as I jist now said, the raal thing is, to git through without gittin'
                  hurt at all. And d——d greeny can git a vein sprung, if he 's a mind to."
               One of them, however, chancing to notice his persistent maintenance of one
                  position while the rest were constantly shifting about in free and easy style, and
                  not knowing exactly how to account for this unwonted stiffness, took it into his
                  suspicious and waggish head to investigate the matter a
                     posteriori. No sooner, however, did he commence to walk around the
                  grim veteran, for the purpose of inspecting in that quarter, than the latter began
                  to make a corresponding gyration, on a pivot, as it were. This confirming the
                  wag's suspicions of something wrong, he continued his circumambulation.
               This movement soon revolving Wynne far enough to expose his rear to the others,
                  discovered, to them, through a long, clean cut in his nether garments, the little
                  trickling stream which he was so jealously endeavoring to guard from observation.
                  Of course, an uproarious laugh, at his expense, was the immediate consequence—an
                  opportunity to run the rig upon Wynne being by no means an every-day affair, and
                  not to be foregone.
               "Boys," said the veteran, nothing abashed, and examining now, with his hand, for
                  the first time, the extent of the injury, "I s'pose you 're pokin' fun at me
                  'cause I got my hurt in my behind-parts, instead o' before, like your'n. But I
                  don't see what's to hinder 'most anybody from gittin' hurt in the rare, now and
                  then. A fellow can't see what's goin' on thar—so thar's no chance to fend off.
                  But, boys, thar 's no excuse gittin' hurt in front, whar you can see exac'ly what
                  the inemy 's doin'. This cut behind here, in my buckskins and so on, was made
                  while I was tryin' to do the right thing in front. It was done by a stray whisk of
                  some fellow's edge-tool, while he was handlin' of it rather careless. Bein' as it
                  come unbeknowns to me, how in the devil was I to fend off, I'd like to know?"
               This, as Wynne probably intended it should, only made the mirth more
                  explosive.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Madam, this service have I done for you,
                           To hazard life and rescue you.
                           
                           Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look.
                        
                     
                     
                        Two Gentlemen of Verona.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I am angling now,
                           Though you perceive me not how I give line.
                        
                     
                     
                        Much Ado About Nothing.
                     
                  
               
               
                  MEANWHILE, a very different scene was going forward in another part
                  of this narrow field.
               No sooner had the priest seen that the young lady was reviving from her swoon,
                  than he hurried to Gatewood,—who had been standing, a little apart, evidently an
                  interested spectator of their proceedings,—and at once, with all the thorough
                  politeness of a man of the world, introduced himself as the Padre Clemente
                  Delgado, of San Antonio; and then, as openly and as politely, inquired by what
                  name he should have the honor to address him.
               "My name, Padre, is Gatewood," replied the chief.
               "Captain Gatewood," said the priest, leading him (nothing loth) forward to where
                  the lady lay, with her head by this time on her brother's knee, "allow me to
                  introduce to you to my nephew, Don Juan Delgado—and his sister, the Señorita
                  Isabella."
               Young Delgado half rose from his cramped position, and most cordially shook the
                  Captain's hand.
               "Excuse my rising," said the lady, in a faint, sweet voice, at the same time
                  raising herself to her elbow and extending her hand. "I am yet too weak for
                  that."
               Is it any wonder that the stern Captain's cheek was a trifle redder for the touch
                  of that soft hand?
               
               How it came about that these Creole Spaniards could speak English almost as well
                  as their own language, shall appear in due time.
               "Isabella," said the priest, "it is to this gentleman mainly that we are indebted
                  for our rescue."
               "Oh, sir," said she, "I shall never be able to thank you enough. You don't know
                  the half your brave comrades and yourself have done for us. You saved, with your
                  own hand, my dear brother's life; for I saw you kill the man who was about to
                  murder him in cold blood. But you do not know that the fiend had told my brother,
                  only a few moments before, that he should be hung in presence of my uncle and
                  myself, as soon as we should reach the west bank of the Sabine. Oh, how
                  dreadful!"
               At the bare thought of witnessing such a spectacle, the lady's cheek, which had
                  begun to show the flush of reaction, grew exceedingly pale again, and she would,
                  no doubt, have relapsed into a swooning condition, had she not sunk back on the
                  grass—her head still resting on her brother's lap.
               Soon, however, regaining her previous degree of strength, she again propped
                  herself on her elbow.
               "I hope," said she, casting a sad, inquiring look at the Captain, "none of your
                  noble little band were killed."
               "There lies one, Señorita, who will never get up again," replied the Chief,
                  indicating, by a glance, the direction of the body.
               "Poor fellow!" she exclaimed, as her eye followed the Captain's. "He died for
                  us!"
               "Uncle, did you shrive him?" she said in Spanish, after a brief silence.
               "No, Isabella," replied the priest, in the same tongue; "it was impossible—he was
                  killed dead on the spot."
               "Ah me! war is a sad thing!" she said, with a deep sigh. "Captain Gatewood," she
                  went on in English, "were any of your men wounded, who need attention? I am not
                  unskilled in dressing wounds; I have had a good deal to do with them in our army.
                  Perhaps I could—"
               "None badly hurt," replied the Captain, touching his hat and bowing slightly.
                  "Besides, I have a man in camp who calls himself Doctor. I believe
                  he is capable of attending to all ordinary cases. So, we can dispense with those
                  kind attentions which your feeble condition would scarcely justify. Your offer,
                  however, is none the less appreciated, because declined.
               "Moreover," resumed the Captain, after a pause, "I have to suggest, for your
                  consideration, gentlemen, that, as soon as the Señorita is able, you should be on
                  the move. This is not, by any means, the safest place in the world,
                  notwithstanding our victory seems so complete. There is a considerable body of
                  Spanish troops only a mile distant, on the west bank of the river; and as several
                  of our enemies escaped in that direction, they may soon be down upon us with a
                  great force, if we remain here."
               "Mercy on us!" exclaimed the lady, shuddering, as she thought what scenes might be
                  enacted again, if they tarried.
               "I am able to move now—this very moment!"
               With this, she rose to her feet, though with some difficulty.
               "Let us, for heaven's, sake," she said, "stay no longer in this dreadful
                  spot."
               When Gatewood commenced his warning of the new dangers to which they were exposed,
                  the worthy Padre was just about stepping away to give what spiritual consolation
                  he might, to one or two dying Gachupins, who were writhing and groaning near at
                  hand; and, if their frame of mind should justify it, to administer to them the
                  holy viaticum, to the end that, having been devils long enough in this world, they
                  should not continue to be such  in the
                  next. One of these, he felt more than ordinary obligations to assist in that
                  way,—his recent dealings with him having been of a nature very unusual, not to say
                  delicate, for a priest. In short, this was the fellow whom he had shot down with
                  his own hand. Having himself given him his quietus—perhaps, anticipated the
                  gallows by several years, during which time the wretch might possibly have amended
                  his life—his Reverence felt doubly bound to provide him with a passport that
                  should take him through the right gate, when it should be known in the other world
                  who had sent him thither. Gatewood's last words, however, so damped the
                  ecclesiastical ardor, that he decided to let the poor sinner take his chance, as
                  he was; and at once set himself about preparing to place a greater distance
                  between his own party and the merciless foe, in whose hands it was but too evident
                  that even a priest could, by no means, feel safe.
               Gatewood now addressed himself to the three prisoners, who were bestowing on their
                  wounded comrades what attention they could.
               "You are welcome to go free," he said, in Spanish,—of which he had a very
                  respectable knowledge,—"but I must emphatically advise you never again to set foot
                  this side the Sabine, except it be to minister to your wounded friends here, or to
                  bear them away to your own people. Of course, you will bury your own dead."
               "Wynne," said he, next,—as he advanced towards the hilarious group above
                  described,—"you will see that our unfortunate friend, there, is properly
                  buried."
               "We'll try to do the right thing by Girdle, Cap'n, since he's hit his last lick,"
                  replied the old freebooter, with something wondrous like compassion in the tones
                  of his deep voice.
               "Then," pursued the Chief, "after concealing in the thicket the arms that are
                  lying about, and the horses, with their equipments, you will hurry in to camp, and
                  let the Lieutenant know: he is to bring half our force up, at once, to guard the
                  road, as near this point as he can find a good camping-place. Tell him, he will
                  suffer no more refugees to be followed into our territory under any circumstances
                  whatever."
               By Gatewood's orders, his men now assisted the Mexican in transferring the pack
                  from the dead mule to one of the other mules,—the delighted Mexican himself being
                  promoted to the back of one of the captured horses.
               Whilst this transfer was going on, Gatewood informed the rescued party that, owing
                  to the distance, it would be impossible for them to reach Natchitoches that night,
                  especially after the fatigues they had already undergone. And, as there was no
                  intermediate stopping-place, he proposed that they should consent to lodge in a
                  house which he had just built, he said, and furnished for himself. He added the
                  information, that it had never yet been occupied, and that it stood about midway
                  on the route to town.
               To this proposition—worn down, as they were, by the severity of their trials, no
                  less than by the physical strain to which they had so long been subjected—they
                  consented readily, and with no slight show of gratitude.
               "The house is a considerable distance off the road," said Gatewood, "and
                  accessible only by a bridle-path, which you could not follow without great
                  difficulty, if at all. If you will accept my services, however, I will do myself
                  the honor to guide you to the spot."
               This last offer being accepted, the whole party mounted and moved off in pairs;
                  the young lady and her brother taking the lead. The Mexican and his wife—for such
                  the woman proved to be—with their charge, came next; for they had been left so
                  nervous by the recent conflict, that
                  they could not be persuaded to bring up the rear—a duty which, therefore, fell to
                  the lot of Gatewood and the priest.
               The latter, not knowing what might again turn up of a sinister nature, had taken
                  the precaution to secure, from among the slain, a belt containing pistols and a
                  sword, and had girded the same about him, outside his ecclesiastical robe; so that
                  he had lost, in a measure, his resemblance to the heavenly messenger that he was,
                  bearing tidings of "peace on earth, and good will to men." He looked, indeed, far
                  more as if commissioned to carry out that other motto, "Peaceably, if we
                  can—forcibly, if we must;" which, while it whispers full softly to us of heaven,
                  smells, at times, loudly enough of hell and gunpowder to have been compounded by
                  the grand Adversary himself, for the use of his special vicegerents on
                  earth—tyrants—both monocrats and oligarchs.
               On the route, the Señorita and her brother—who had been fortunate enough to
                  recover his own sword and pistols, which hung again at his belt—conversed, in
                  Spanish, of the dangers they had escaped, and of the future prospects of the
                  patriot cause, as well as of their own individual hopes and fears.
               "If we ever get back to San Antonio," said he, as the colloquy warmed, "what debts
                  of vengeance will I have to pay!"
               "Brother," replied the lady, "I would rather hear you talk more of the cause, and
                  less of vengeance."
               "Not talk of vengeance!" he exclaimed, his brow disturbed by a scowl, doubtless
                  intended far more for certain invisible foes than for his gentle sister. "I not
                  talk of it? Not even talk of that which I hope so soon to
                     act? Why, Isabella! have you then forgotten our poor father?"
               "Oh, no—Juan!"
               "Have you forgotten what our mother was forced to witness before she died?"
               "Oh, no—no!"
               "Have you forgotten, that, at this very moment, I should be feeding the buzzards,
                  from a gibbet, but for—"
               The sentence was broken off by the lady bursting into tears.
               "Oh, do not speak of those dreadful things!" she cried.
               "Then for God's sake let me speak of others, which I have sworn to do more than
                     speak of, if victory ever hovers around our standard again. Thus
                  far, I have fought only for the cause. But now, I will tell you, Isabella,—I would
                  rather be avenged on those fiends, than that all Mexico should be free. It was as
                  much as I could do, to keep my hands off the prisoners we took in this fight. Had
                  they been officers, I should have cut their throats on the spot."
               As there was no reply made to these last remarks, the young man said nothing
                  further, and the conversation ceased.
               The Mexican and his spouse had still remaining in them too much of the paralyzing
                  influence of terror to wag their tongues to any tune whatever, except such
                  occasional expletives as were necessary to keep the pack-animals at their best
                  gait; and the utterance of even these few uncouth words was entirely mechanical,
                  or they had, most probably, not been uttered.
               Gatewood and his Reverence discussed politics and war exclusively. The
                  indefatigable Padre elicited from his companion more information touching himself,
                  his men, his mode of life, his relations with the two governments between which he
                  was situated, and the amount of force under his command, than that Chief had ever
                  before deigned to impart to any one person since he had held sway in Neutralia.
                  Nor is it at all likely he would have been so communicative on this occasion, but
                  that he already knew pretty well what his Reverence was after in propounding his interrogatories—the looking,
                  namely, for an opportunity to advance the interests of the discomfited
                  patriots—and that he himself, when the auspicious time should arrive, might expect
                  of his querist certain favors tending to the furtherance of his own individual
                  interests in a particular direction—the holy man's influence, he made no doubt,
                  having great weight in that quarter.
               It must not, however, be supposed, for a moment, that the usually reticent Chief
                  told all—or even the half—about himself. He, in fact, told only such things as
                  might not tend to disparage him in the good man's eyes. Without once declining to
                  answer a query, yet never descending to downright falsehood, he managed to gloze
                  things over, to reduce deeds of questionable morality to a fair seeming, and to
                  round off into a shapely form—if not into the true wave-line of moral
                  beauty—certain ugly salient points, so that he of the alb set him down, in a
                  corner of his heart, as a hero without a cause—a deficiency which he thought could
                  easily enough be supplied.
               Gatewood, for his part, as soon as he had posted the Padre as fully as he dare do
                  with regard to himself, set about inquiring into Mexican affairs, with a zeal
                  altogether beyond his wont. It is perhaps not too much to say, that, during the
                  next half hour, he obtained, in this way, more information on these matters than
                  he had before done from all sources since the breaking out of the revolution—or,
                  indeed, had cared to do. The intensity of his present interest in poor Mexico's
                  welfare seemed to be proportioned to the extreme suddenness with which it had
                  sprung up. By the time they had reached the point where Gatewood's services were
                  needed to lead the party through the dense timber, his well-known prejudices
                  against the priesthood may be said to have quite died out; while the righteous
                  indignation which his Reverence had nursed, during his whole life, and had
                  faithfully inculcated upon others to nurse, against those who could not see as
                  distinctly as they might, the difference betwixt meum and tuum, had, in this one
                  case, at least, come to nought.
               When they reached the point where the path which they were to pursue diverged from
                  the road, Gatewood assumed the personal direction of the party.
               "Now, if you will but follow me along this path," he said, "your fatigues will
                  soon be ended for the day."
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               
                  
                     
                        Love hath chas'd sleep from my enthralléd eyes.
                     
                     
                        Two Gentlemen of Verona.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I stalk about her door,
                           Like a strange soul upon the Stygian bank,
                           Staying for waftage.
                        
                     
                     
                        Troilus and Cressida.
                     
                  
               
               
                  AFTER riding a mile or two, they came, about dark, to a more open
                  place in the wood; the timber having apparently been trimmed away and thinned out.
                  They now saw, a few rods ahead, a fire on the ground, and could distinguish the
                  forms of two men sitting near it. These, on hearing the approaching steps, rose
                  and came forward.
               "Those are the men I left here to guard the premises," explained Gatewood.
               As soon as the two men recognized and saluted their Chief, they returned to their
                  seats on the ground, and, after their first surprise was over, took little further
                  notice of the party.
               By this time, it was too dark, here among the trees, to distinguish more than the outlines of a double,
                  one-story house, with a covered way connecting the two portions. The ends of this
                  passage-way were entirely open to the outer air. This, a common plan of building
                  in that latitude, was designed not only to afford a convenient place to spread the
                  meal, but, also, to catch the refreshing breezes as they flew.
               Whatever points of attraction the place may have presented, they could not, at
                  that late hour, be recognized. Nor is it probable they would have been duly
                  appreciated, even had enough daylight remained to display them to advantage; for
                  the travellers were so completely worn out, that they all sought their several
                  places of rest for the night, without even waiting for anything to stay their
                  hunger, although this must have been considerable, and although the host assured
                  them that there was the wherewithal on the premises to provide a very good supper,
                  if they would only have patience.
               The Señorita was shown to a comfortable bed in a room by herself. Two mattresses,
                  on the floor of the only other apartment, fell to the lot of the Padre and his
                  nephew. The Mexican couple, as soon as they could unpack the animals, and pitch
                  the tent which composed part of their load, crept in on their customary
                  blankets,—and soon the entire party were wrapped in that profound slumber, which,
                  in a perfectly healthy person, always succeeds excessive fatigue—except under
                  certain circumstances, presently to be most signally instanced.
               The Captain, after directing the men to take care of the horses, set about
                  regaling himself on the remains of the supper, which they had just finished
                  discussing, consisting of bread and honey, together with some dried venison. He
                  then brought away from the porch a buffalo-robe, and, spreading it beneath a tree,
                  and divesting himself only of his coat and belt, lay down, and endeavored to
                  compose himself to sleep. Vain, however, were his efforts. To be sure, the
                  physical man was ready and willing enough, but there seemed to be some disquieting
                  mental element, which, rebelling against the drowsy god, scorned his fetters.
               Rarely, indeed, was it that this man, with his grandly healthy physique, had to
                  woo long for the recuperative favors of sleep. It mattered little how exciting had
                  been the environments of the day; he could turn, fresh from the stirring chase, or
                  the din of arms, to the bare earth, with a surety of speedy repose.
               It was, however, to no purpose that he now closed his eyes and lay quiet: the mind
                  still walked abroad. To no purpose that he essayed to compromise the state of
                  things, by tossing and turning about in harmony with the mental workings: they
                  would not be lulled by such rocking. To no purpose that he threw out, one by one,
                  his brawny limbs, for coolness, and turned his burning brow to the breeze, for
                  relief.
               For many long hours he lay with the unwonted fever tingling through his veins; and
                  if he slept at last, it was unconsciously. His thoughts ran so imperceptibly into
                  tangible dreams; and, when he woke, the dreams glided so naturally back into
                  thoughts not a whit more tangible, that he knew not when he had passed, and
                  repassed, the misty barrier between the sleeping and waking worlds. The burden
                  alike of all those thoughts and dreams was the sweet face he had, that morning,
                  encountered on the highway,—the soft, rounded form he had so lately borne in his
                  arms.
               About midnight the last-quarter moon rose, making everything about these premises
                  much more distinct. Among other objects to have been then and there seen, was the stricken Captain, walking to
                  and fro beneath the majestic trees. What little sleep he had been able to snatch
                  had, long ago, flown his eyelids, and these had lifted, in good, wide earnest, to
                  all the reality of his new situation. In the reaction which now took place, he
                  felt chagrined—perhaps I may venture to say disgusted—with himself, partly on
                  account of a very foolish resolution he had made, years ago, never to suffer his
                  feelings to get into their present pitiable plight—as he thought it, or affected
                  to think it—and partly for reasons which shall hereinafter appear.
               For several hours did he continue his lonely promenade and his humiliating
                  cogitations, like a proud lion chafing even while he suffers the toiler's net to
                  close about his free limbs. Two or three times did he betake himself to his rude
                  bed,—perhaps mechanically, for, no sooner did he find himself without the motion
                  which had aided in working off some of his gathering nervousness, than he would
                  spring up again and resume his strides with atoning energy.
               "I will go back to camp at once, and never see these strangers again," thought he,
                  snatching up his coat, and hastily putting it on. "That's the way to end
                  this—whatever it is."
               Poor, weak creature—though at times so mighty in his manliness—affecting not to
                  know what this was!
               Here, I am very loth to record of Captain Gatewood a joke of so serious a nature,
                  that, had his stoical men ever found it out, would doubtless have lessened him
                  materially in their estimation. Inasmuch, however, as it is altogether likely that
                  not a single one of them is now living, or, if living, is, long since, in his
                  dotage and will not be able to appreciate the joke,—and, moreover, as the
                  recording thereof appertains to my duty as a faithful chronicler of events that
                  transpired in the evanescent kingdom of Neutralia tralia,—I do not very clearly
                  see how I am to shirk that duty.
               In fact, now that I come to think the matter over again, this incident, trivial as
                  it may seem, is the hinge, as it were, on which my whole narrative turns; for, had
                  it not occurred, the Captain would never have seen the Señorita again,—in which
                  case this story would have been rendered entirely too barren and uninteresting to
                  come before you, the gentle reader.
               What I hint of, then, is neither more nor less than an instance of the Chief's
                  absent-mindedness; which, considering the cause of it, no less than its extent,
                  would possibly have sufficed to depose him from absolute sway in his dominions.
                  And it will do more to show the reader into what a forlorn condition this grim
                  bandit was lapsing, and that, too, at no very tardy rate—in fact, had already
                  lapsed—than whole pages, devoted to the dreary topic, could possibly effect.
               Having resolved to fly to Camp Wildwood for safety from this new danger, he girded
                  his armed belt about him, and struck off through the woods, on foot,
                  exclaiming, as he did so:
               "Never will I set eye on her again—for if I do, I shall henceforth be her vassal,
                  and follow her to the ends of the earth."
               He had gone some two miles, with rapid stride, when he stopped short in his
                  path.
               "My horse! By the eternal powers! I 've forgotten my horse," he exclaimed,
                  bringing his fist down upon the air with a force which, but for the accompanying
                  oath, would well have become some fashionably thundering pulpit-orator.
                  "Abstracted—mazed—my very wits in riot—I do verily believe."
               Now, it is but simple justice to the bewildered Captain, to say, that he travelled much oftener on foot than
                  on horseback through these haunts, because they were densely timbered, and could,
                  in that way, be much more easily threaded, and the short cuts be more readily
                  availed of. Force of habit, therefore, had much to do with his forgetting his
                  horse on the present occasion,—though the peculiar state of the inner man had
                  undoubtedly its share of influence. One thing is certain, that he was never before
                  guilty of such a gross blunder, nor of anything akin to it.
               "It's very clear I must return." He thus mused, as he stood halting between two
                  opinions. "It would be a pretty story, indeed, to go the round of camp. 'The
                  Captain forgot his horse.' 'Walked ten miles before he found it out.' 'Why, he 's
                  crazy—that 's just the long and short of it.' This is what they will say. And then
                  the worst of it is, they may guess at the cause of it all. 'What! a woman upset
                     him? Never.' 'You may pooh-pooh as much as you please, but I tell
                  you it's so.' 'How changed he must be, then!' 'Changed! I rather
                  reckon he is changed. Why, he just ain't the same man.'
               "Yes—I must go back. But, then, there are the two boys. They 'll be stirring by
                  the time I get there; and what, in heaven's name, would they think, to see me
                  coming in at peep of day? How account to them?
               "Ah, yes—I have it now: happy thought! It's about the hour for game; I see the day
                  is just breaking. A deer on the lake-shore. No—that's rather uncertain. The
                  turkey-roost, then, that I passed a few rods back: how will that do? The very
                  thing! I 'll take in, with me, a brace of fine fat gobblers, for breakfast. And
                  who 'll suspect I got what I did n't go in search of?" So musing, he retraced his
                  steps.
               "But, then," thought he, "I shall again come under the spell of those bewitching
                  eyes." On thinking of this, he stopped. Only for a moment, however. "But I know
                  not"—here he started off again—"whether to be glad or grieved for
                     that. Well, be it so, since fate so wills it.—Poor Filly! you
                  little know, you sweet little pet! what a rival you are to have in these coming
                  days. I thought I liked Filly about as much as I could ever like anybody.
                  But—pshaw!"
               When he reached the turkey-roost, he could see the birds sitting aloft, in fancied
                  security; but there was not yet quite daylight enough in the dense woods to afford
                  him a sure aim. He, therefore, instead of waiting for more light from that source,
                  availed himself of the moon, which was sailing aloft, about one-fourth of its
                  allotted distance across the heavens.
               This is a very common device among frontiersmen,—sometimes even in the middle of
                  the night,—the time being chosen according to the position of the moon. Gatewood,
                  by shifting his own position to suit, put one of the largest and plumpest-looking
                  of his intended victims exactly between himself and the orb above, and, drawing a
                  pistol, brought him to the ground, with scarcely a flap of the wings. This roost
                  having, probably, never before been fired into, nearly all the birds, remained
                     in situ; so, the Captain had no trouble in
                  securing another. Then, connecting their legs by means of a piece of bark stripped
                  from a young pecan shoot, he swung them over his shoulder and resumed his way.
               As he strode up to the house, he found the Mexican and his wife,—who had probably
                  been awakened thus early by the gnawings of hunger after their long
                  fast,—conferring with the two men, who understood a little Spanish. In fact, all
                  the Neutralians, for their own convenience, had managed to pick up a more or less
                  imperfect knowledge of that tongue. The conversation which was going on touched the amount and quality of raw material
                  available for the morning meal, and its whereabouts; the Mexicans, wishing, they
                  said, to prepare breakfast for all concerned.
               "Dress these fowls," said Gatewood, laying the same on the leaves before the
                  Mexicans. "Breadstuffs and coffee you 'll find in the house."
               "Boys," said he,—though he turned to the men, as he said it,—"can't
                  you manage to catch some fish in the lake?"
               "If we only had the tackle, Captain."
               "You 'll find that in the boat."
               The men moved off at once toward the lake, while their Chief, seeking again his
                  bed under the trees, actually succeeded in getting an hour or two of good, sound
                  sleep. The balmy morning air, in which he had been so freely circulating, seemed
                  to have quieted, a little, the tumult of his breast.

                           I like this place,

                           I will believe thou hast a mind that suits

                  THE travellers did not wake until Stefanita, the Mexican woman,
                  knocked at their respective doors, announcing breakfast ready to be dished. It
                  being a mild autumn morning, she had spread the table beneath the trees, so that,
                  when they all sat down to the repast, a good opportunity presented to view their
                  surroundings.
               "What a beautiful prospect you have here, Captain Gatewood," exclaimed the
                  Señorita, after the morning greeting, as she seated herself and looked down and
                  out upon the lake near at hand,—brought into pretty full view, from that elevated
                  point, by a judicious trimming of the intervening timber.
               "Yes, Señorita," replied the Chief; "the prospect is a fine one; though this
                  country, being so nearly level as it is, affords but few attractive situations—at
                  least to any one accustomed to a more diversified surface. I think that, for
                  beauty and convenience combined, this is preferable to any between the Red and the
                  Sabine. I believe I know almost every foot of territory between the two rivers,
                  and I selected this over them all without any hesitation."
               That was truly a beautiful view before them; and the lady, good as her physical
                  appetite must have been, seemed to forget her hunger for some minutes, and to be
                  revelling in the æsthetic feast spread before her.
               The length of the lake, from the northern extremity, at which the house was
                  situated, to the farthest southern limit, was probably six miles; its width, made
                  very irregular by innumerable indentations of the land, varied from half a mile to
                  three miles. The woods girded it about in one unbroken circuit, and adapted their
                  embrace to every freakish meander of its shore. Water-loving cypresses composed
                  its immediate fringe, to the exclusion of all other kinds of trees, touching
                  gently its face with their dark drooping boughs, like a mother soothing her
                  nursling to rest.
               Back of this gloomy growth, and rising gradually above it as the ground became
                  more elevated further from the lake, stood a variety of deciduous trees still
                  retaining their leaves,—all the more lovely from their gorgeous autumn hues.
               The sun had risen high enough to touch the leafy slope of the western shore, and impinged so brightly upon
                  the leaves as to make them glow and fairly kindle until, indeed, you would almost
                  have thought the gold and crimson would start into flame.
               There being, at this early hour, not a breath of air to ruffle the lake, its
                  glassy surface doubled this mass of gorgeous foliage with such perfect
                  distinctness in all its minutest details, that it was impossible for the nicest
                  eye to draw the line dividing the real object from its image in the water.
               Still further variety was afforded by the many indentations of the shore; while
                  numerous little cypress-grown islands, some isolated, others in clusters, seemed
                  like so many emeralds set in the facet of a diamond—itself being set around with
                  emerald, and ruby, and gold.
               "Oh, uncle!" said Isabella, starting abruptly from the survey which had, for a few
                  minutes, been engrossing her attention, to the exclusion of her speech, "don't you
                  think we might find some such place for our sojourn in this region, instead of
                  going into the town? I should like it so much better; and we all would, I
                  think."
               This suggestion was made on the impulse of the moment, and without the most remote
                  intention of conveying any sort of hint whatever to their guest. The fair speaker
                  was, therefore, perceptibly confused when the latter said, without awaiting the
                  priest's reply:
               "When the Señorita spoke, I was just about to submit a proposition bearing on that
                  very point. In fact, I thought of doing so yesterday, and concluded to defer it
                  only because you would all be better prepared to entertain it after seeing for
                  yourselves these premises and their surroundings. This house is entirely at your
                  service, from this moment, with everything in it,—just as long as you choose to
                  stay here."
               "Captain, I did not mean—I only meant—" began the lady, coloring.
               "I know exactly how it was," said Gatewood, as she hesitated. "You merely meant,
                  that if an eligible place could be found, you would prefer it to the town; and you
                     did n't mean to give the least hint in the world. In other words,"
                  continued he, smiling, as though he considered her mistake as a rather good little
                  joke at her expense, "you not only meant all you said, but you said all you meant.
                  And allow me to hope that your merely seeming to give a hint, when we
                  all know that not the shadow of one was intended, may not weigh to determine you
                  against this offer, which I make in good faith."
               The young man glanced at his uncle, as though he thought it the latter's place to
                  answer, but seeing that he looked much more as if revolving the proposition in his
                  mind than thinking of a reply, took it upon himself—inasmuch as a pause, just
                  here, would be exceedingly embarrassing—to say:
               "Captain, you are too kind. We owe you too much already. We would, indeed, put up
                  with many inconveniences before we would think of turning you out of your house
                  for our own accommodation."
               "Of course," said Isabella, in tones which implied that she was somewhat indignant
                  that such a thing should for a moment be thought of.
               "Oh," replied the Chief, smiling pleasantly, "it would not be turning me out, for
                  I have never yet occupied the house, and what is more, I had no very definite
                  plans on the subject. I had the building put up, because I am occasionally seized
                  with hankerings after the scenes of civilization, which I left years ago. I
                  thought that, whenever these fits should return, I might resort to this
                  place,—perhaps with a friend or two,—and spend a few days, when I have no doubt satiety would again drive me
                  back to the wild woods. I can assure you, that, if it will serve your purpose in
                  the slightest degree, your remaining here would put me to no manner of
                  inconvenience. Moreover, you will find all the houses in town filled to their
                  utmost capacity by your unfortunate countrymen. A tent, or some miserable shed,
                  would be the only habitation you could hope to secure there at present."
               "Taking all things into consideration," said the Padre,—emerging out of what
                  seemed to be a brown study, and yet passing so easily into the discussion that it
                  was evident he had heard all that had been said,—"it seems to me that our friend's
                  generous offer had better be availed of. That is, on the two conditions, that he
                  will agree to rent the house to us, and that he will be our guest whenever he
                  feels an inclination to cheer us with his society."
               From subsequent developments, it is quite probable that both the man of war and
                  the man of peace had their ulterior objects—the one in making, the other in
                  accepting, this offer. Nor is it by any means impossible that each knew pretty
                  well what the other's object was,—though neither could have suspected that the
                  other knew. The brother and sister, for their part, must have supposed that the
                  Captain's sympathy with their misfortunes was his only motive in the generous act;
                  that he would have done as much for any one else under like circumstances; and
                  that their uncle's recommendation to abide here, arose from his thinking, after
                  mature reflection, that nothing else could well be done, at least for the
                  present.
               "Padre," replied Gatewood, coloring, "even were I sordid enough to accept, from
                  persons who are so unfortunate as to have neither home nor country, pay for what
                  takes nothing out of my own pocket, I should find that the latter part of your
                  proposition transfers the burden of debt entirely upon me."
               "Then, Captain," replied the priest, "since these young people have put themselves
                  under my charge during our banishment, I will venture to say, in behalf of our
                  whole party, that we will most gladly accept your offer, and make your house our
                  home, if you will likewise make it yours whenever your duties or your inclinations
                  do not call you elsewhere."
               "I shall look in upon you, whenever I can," replied the Captain; "and when I do
                  so, I make no doubt the place will appear to me, as much as any place in the world
                  ever can again appear, like home; for though that was once a magic word with me,
                  it has long since lost its peculiar charms,—and, I am afraid, will never regain
                  them."
               All were struck with the speaker's sadness, as he uttered these words; and this
                  being the first time they had noticed any exhibition of the kind on his part, a
                  considerable pause ensued upon the sudden transition.
               At length the Señorita—who, probably, had not yet entirely recovered from the
                  shock which her maidenly modesty had, some time back, sustained—suggested a new
                  difficulty, apparently by way of proving that she was not so anxious to abide here
                  as her unlucky "hint" might seem to imply.
               "But, uncle," said she, "do you think we would be safe here from the
                  Gachupins?"
               "Oh," said Gatewood, anticipating the priest's reply, "I have already provided
                  against that. Intending—as I believe I before remarked—to make this very
                  proposition, as soon as yesterday's fight was over, I sent an order to my
                  lieutenant, to move half our force to a position suitable for guarding the road. I
                  have no doubt the order has already been carried out. So, you may rest assured,
                  Señorita, there can be no further danger."
               At this point, therefore, the matter of residence was definitely settled; and the three fugitives became
                  adopted citizens of Neutralia.
               The reader will, no doubt, have noticed that Gatewood's manner, during the
                  breakfast-scene, indicated that he had already rallied in a wonderful, not to say
                  unnatural, degree, from his previous forlorn and abstracted condition. This abrupt
                  transformation was, in great measure, brought about by his having suddenly emerged
                  from a distressing state of uncertainty, and his having resolved, irrevocably, on
                  a definite plan of action. He was already bound by a tie previously hinted at,
                  which, although it was comparatively feeble, he was very loth to sever, from the
                  downright cruelty which the act would involve; and it was the remorse felt by him
                  at the thought of rending this connection, to give place to another, that had
                  played no small part in his previous bewilderment. But, once resolved on this
                  unjust course, which an inexorable fate seemed—so at least he thought—to have
                  marked out for him, he thrust the unlovely subject from his mind with that stern
                  force of habit, which one, with such abnormal surroundings as his, almost
                  inevitably acquires.
               Henceforth, he was to lead a sort of double life, so to speak: was to have one
                  style of manners for the camp—much the same old style that we have already
                  seen—and another for this cottage by the lake. Nor was it at all difficult for him
                  to play these two parts, widely diverse though they may seem. In the one, he but
                  continued what he had been acting for years, with the wilds for a stage; in the
                  other, he but went back to the time when he was the cynosure of lovely eyes, amid
                  drawing-room splendors. And the latter came to him so naturally now, that, of the
                  two, it seemed the least like acting.
               There had once been a chord in his heart, which gave forth sweet music. He long
                  had deemed the chord shattered— the music stilled forever. Now, he found that the
                  one had but slept, because the other had been untuned by a cruel, careless hand.
                  Here, where she was least to be expected, a fair Euterpe had seized upon the
                  harp-like instrument, attuned it anew, and awakened again the olden tones, whose
                  echo even he had long ceased to recall,—for, years ago, his love—or what he had
                  but too fondly deemed such—had settled into hate.

                  THE Padre having learned from Gatewood, in their conversation of the
                  preceding day, that Bernardo Gutierrez had reached Natchitoches, resolved to seek
                  him out with the view of conferring about the cause that lay so near their hearts.
                  He, accordingly, set out for that purpose soon after breakfast.
               Bernardo and his Reverence met like the friends that they had long been, and as
                  becomes brothers in a common cause. As soon as they had recounted to each other
                  their adventures in escaping from the enemy, the main subject which had brought
                  them together was discussed; the General enlightening the Padre with reference to
                  matters recently put in train for an invasion of Texas. Magee, who was to direct
                  the campaign, had already gone to New Orleans to secure volunteers and solicit
                  means to carry on the war. One part of the arrangement was, that, on his way, he was to stop at Alexandria, on
                  Red River, and bring to bear all the influence he could command to have Gatewood's
                  men released from confinement,—they having been sent to that point for trial,
                  which had resulted, as we have before said, in their being sentenced to the
                  penitentiary.
               This, he hoped, would prove to be one step towards reconciling the outraged lords
                  of the Neutral Ground. Whether or not their co-operation could be then secured,
                  was another question, Bernardo said, and, he feared, a very doubtful one,—he
                  himself having had a conference with their Chief, on the subject, and having found
                  him wholly irreconcilable, although he had brought to bear upon him all the offers
                  and inducements he could think of. Apparently irritated by the General's
                  persistence, he, at last, abruptly closed the interview, with the declaration that
                  nothing on God's earth would induce him to ask his men to serve under Magee; and
                  that he well knew they would never do so without his solicitation.
               Colonel Davenport—whose co-operation was alluded to in a previous chapter as
                  probable—had promised, not only to act as quartermaster to the proposed
                  expedition, but also to expend liberally from his own funds, in raising supplies.
                  He had, moreover, pledged himself to carry out a suggestion of his own, approved
                  by Bernardo,—namely, to secure the services of the Cushatta Indians, a friendly
                  tribe, whose village was about fifty miles north of Natchitoches. To be sure, they
                  had been reduced, by incessant wars, to the pitiful number of about twenty braves,
                  but as these were accounted among the most fearless of all the southern tribes,
                  and, as they nursed the bitterest hostility against the Spaniards, their
                  co-operation was considered material, when it was but too evident that, at the
                  very best, only a meagre force could be raised. For, by the latest gazettes from
                  the United States, it appeared that they themselves were on the eve of being
                  invaded by Great Britain. Of course, comparatively few would be willing to leave
                  their native country, at such a crisis, to take up arms in a foreign cause.
               Manchaca, a bold Mexican of Nacogdoches, possessing unbounded energy, with a
                  strong, though uncultivated, mind, and having great influence with his countrymen
                  throughout the province of Texas, was already at work intriguing against the
                  Spanish authorities.
               "I shall go myself to Washington, in a few days," said Bernardo, "to sound the
                  government there on the subject. If they will give us no material aid—and I can
                  hardly hope they will—I shall endeavor to secure some sort of pledge, that they
                  will, at least, not interfere with our operations, which, in case they do, must
                  necessarily abort."
               "I wish, General," said the Padre, rather abruptly, "you would take my nephew,
                  Juan, with you. I have good reason to think he is hatching some rash plot of
                  private vengeance."
               "God knows, he has sufficient reason," replied Bernardo.
               "But, General, such acts never advance a cause like ours; though it is consoling
                  to know that tyrants sometimes get their dues in that way."
               "What particular scheme do you think Juan is concocting?"
               "How he can get at Salcedo, to assassinate him. I believe he thinks of little
                  else, day or night."
               "That is sheer madness. He could not accomplish it—and would only lose his own
                  life in the attempt. Tell him, I should like him to accompany me. Indeed, I see
                  not wherein he can render aid here, while, on the other hand, his fine personal
                  appearance, and his fascinating manners—if he chooses to make good use of
                  them—will do much to enlist the sympathies of such as we may meet at the seat of government. Yes—by all means, Padre,
                  tell him he must go with me—he will be of great service. And if you are willing to
                  accept the charge, I will leave our interests in this quarter in your care until
                  my return. I know they could not be placed in better hands, provided you can see
                  your way clearly to accept the trust. Our cause owes so much already to men of
                  your calling, that I cannot but hope—"
               "Have no doubt, General, but that I will give you my most earnest aid. I shrink
                  from nothing that will tend to advance the cause. I desire no rest from labor,
                  mental or bodily, until Texas, at least, is free—if not all Mexico. Use me as you
                  will."
               "Well, then, Father, I must say that, despite the ominous rebuffs we have received
                  from Gatewood, I should like you to try your powers of persuasion upon him. His
                  co-operation is so important—indeed, I may say, vital—to our success, that I am
                  loth to give him up without at least one more effort. Perhaps, in your
                  ecclesiastical capacity, you might—"
               "Nay—I am well assured I can do nothing in the matter, with him, or his, as a
                  priest. They are all godless heathens or heretics, I warrant you, and would laugh
                  my efforts to scorn, since they would at once penetrate my object, imperfectly
                  cloaked as, in that case, it would be, by religion. In the course of my late
                  dealings with the Chief, however,—if I be not greatly mistaken,—I observed that in
                  him on which I may venture to hang a hope, if adroitly dealt with and carefully
                  fostered. But it will require time, even assuming the truth of my suspicions. So,
                  you must have patience. I assure you, however, there shall be no delay in
                  initiating my scheme; nor shall any opportunity to forward it be lost. By the time
                  you shall have returned from your contemplated journey, I hope to have things in
                  train for a favorable issue of my project—or, shall be prepared to pronounce it
                  utterly hopeless."
               With this understanding—based on a mysterious hint which left Bernardo utterly in
                  the dark as to the means to be used—the soldier and the priest separated.
               The Padre Clemente Delgado was one of those thousand malcontent priests of whom,
                  and of whose grievances, Bernardo, in his interview with Lieutenant Magee, gave a
                  somewhat minute account. Let it not be imagined, however, that the Father was an
                  ordinary priest,—or, for the matter of that, an ordinary person, in any sense. He
                  was a man of uncommon natural abilities. These had been expanded by a thorough
                  education in the best colleges of Mexico; and had been made infinitely more
                  available by an easy address and insinuating manners acquired by spending several
                  years among the first circles of the capital, which, at that time, reflected all
                  the courtly accomplishments of Madrid.
               Not only was he talented and well-bred, but he possessed, likewise, much energy,
                  great tenacity of purpose, and an unbounded ambition,—or, rather, of the
                  last-named attribute, it may perhaps be more correctly said to have possessed
                     him.
               I am sorry to confirm the suspicions which have probably already been awakened in
                  the mind of the reader by this description,—namely, that his Reverence's
                  patriotism, although not begotten of motives of personal preferment, was
                  nevertheless greatly intensified thereby. He, who, with all his rare endowments,
                  would, if the present state of things continued, be doomed to an humble chasuble,
                  all his days, longed to wield a bishop's staff, or even an archiepiscopal crosier.
                  Nor of the many aspirants thereto,—and it may safely be said, "their name was
                     legion"— could there, probably, have
                  been found, in all Mexico, one more worthy of the dignity.
               This, to be sure, is no great compliment to the priesthood of that country; but,
                  so far as one can judge from such sources of information as are at present
                  accessible, it is quite as flattering a notice as that body deserve, or, indeed,
                  are likely to get from any unprejudiced chronicler.
               But unless the patriot cause could be sustained to its final triumph, there was no
                  earthly hope that his Reverence would ever become a high church-dignitary.
               With such an ambition, he was, of course, always on the alert for means tending to
                  its gratification. Among these means, he had already reckoned the probabilities of
                  Gatewood becoming attached to Isabella. Indeed, from the moment he had learned,
                  from the Chieftain's own lips, the formidable force at his disposal, he had
                  resolved to avail himself of every advantage which such an attachment would afford
                  to win him to the patriot cause. So, common a thing was it for both young and
                  middle-aged men to fall in love with his beautiful niece, that he looked with much
                  certainty to such a termination of this affair, provided only he could so manœuvre
                  as to throw them two or three times into each other's society.
               This being the case, it may readily be conceived that he was much pleased at the
                  turn affairs had taken concerning the occupation of the house on the lake. Of
                  course, it did not enter into his calculations that Isabella would reciprocate the
                  feeling. It would be no proper match for her, he well knew. But, then, she might
                  be induced to lead him on, step by step,—as gifted women too often do,—throwing
                  out a lure of hope now and then, with however no intention, on the one side at
                  least, of its ever being realized,—until, at length, when the main goal should be
                  gained, and there should be no longer any need of deception, the mask she had worn
                  and the heart she had won could be, alike, thrown aside.
               It was, in short, to be the old tale over again, of love, coquetry, and politics;
                  and had the holy man, when he prayed for the success of his scheme, prayed, also,
                  that it might not finally prove calamitous to the parties involved, he would,
                  probably, have made better work, in the end,—in the sight of both God and man.
               Gatewood was not a man to postpone long what he had once fully resolved on. He
                  very naturally judged that one occupying his anomalous relation to the world, and
                  to society, could nurse no reasonable hope of ever winning, by ordinary means
                  alone,—such as proofs of steadfast devotion, and the setting off and display of
                  personal comeliness and accomplishments,—the fair hand he aspired to. At least, he
                  had no notion of trusting to such means, alone, to effect an object so vital to
                  his future happiness as he had found this object to be. He was, however, as well
                  aware as any, that, often, where unselfish love cannot be returned in kind,
                  ambition and interests, adroitly wrought upon by a suitor, become powerful
                  auxiliaries in winning the hand—the heart (ah, hazardous experiment that makes so
                  many wrecks!) to be won afterwards, by that closer communion which wedlock
                  affords.
               Scarcely, therefore, had the Padre left for Natchitoches, before Gatewood set
                  himself about ascertaining the most salient points in the character of the young
                  lady, and—though rather incidentally—in that of her brother, with the view of
                  subserving what was to be henceforth the end and aim of his hitherto all but
                  aimless life. These assailable points, being duly reconnoitred, he would bring to
                  bear upon them all he possessed of love's enginery and fixtures, or he would
                  capture the fortress of her heart by slow approaches proaches, by storm, or, if all these should fail
                  him, even by the forlorn hope itself—whatever that might prove to be, in this
                  particular case.
               He had already abundant reason to suspect that ambition was the Padre's ruling
                  passion. He now ascertained, beyond all doubt, in the conversation which he held
                  with the brother and sister, on the all-engrossing subject of the revolution in
                  Mexico, that vengeance for the murder of his friends and relatives held absolute
                  sway in the former's heart,—while in the case of the sister, pure love of her
                  country, and a desire to accomplish its independence, occupied her bosom to the
                  exclusion of almost everything else.
               During the brief time that he was eliciting this information, Gatewood betrayed
                  much interest in the fate of Mexico, and still more in that of Texas, the
                  Señorita's native province; and it soon became evident that his sympathies were
                  fairly enlisted. Fearing, however, that the next step would be to solicit his
                  substantial aid, and not feeling that the proper time had arrived in his affairs
                  for the profitable discussion of that particular branch of the subject, he took
                  himself off rather abruptly,—promising, however, at their earnest invitation, to
                  visit them before many days.
               "Between the ambition of the priest, the fierce passions of the brother, and the
                  Señorita's patriotism"—such were the meditations of the Captain as he rode back to
                  camp,—"my chances are not so very desperate. I believe that woman will do anything
                  to see her native province free: she is clearly an enthusiast on the subject.
                  Well, if she will but smile on my suit, Texas shall be free, or it
                  shall be no fault of mine.
               "The Padre, too, shall have his crozier, and Juan his fill of blood. Her hand is
                  my price, and for that I would sell myself to the very Devil. But then, there is
                  another question, Will she sell to the Devil? I know myself unworthy
                  of her, yet would I move earth and hell to win her. The other place, I can never
                  hope to move—nor can the like of me."
               Such were the speculations that occupied the Captain, as he approached Camp
                  Wildwood. Indeed, during his whole lonely ride through the forest, on that
                  eventful morning, his new acquaintances formed the staple of his thoughts.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
                           Ran on the green sward; nothing she does or seems
                           But smacks of something greater than herself,
                           Too noble for this place.
                        
                     
                     
                        Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        By 'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
                     
                     —Twelfth Night.
                     
                  
               
               
                  OH, what a beautiful morning!" exclaimed Filly, as she roused from
                  her slumbers, in the tent appropriated to her special use, and peered out through
                  a loophole. "I'm so glad! 'Happy the bride the sun shines on.' I must gather my
                  flowers before Señor returns. They said he would be back by noon.
               "Suppose he had been killed in that horrid fight! Oh, what should I have done? I
                  should have been praying, now, to die too, instead of being so happy. Why should
                  there be any bloodshed on the earth? Why can't men live at peace with each other?
                  How I do wish Señor would change his wild ways, and live a quiet life. Ah me! I
                  can only hope and trust the time may soon come when he will."
               
               The girl soon made her toilet, and hastened to dispatch the breakfast prepared and
                  spread for her by the wife of one of the men, who occupied an adjoining tent. She
                  was the only woman who was allowed to remain within the purlieus of the camp,—her
                  main office, while there, being to attend upon the girl.
               Alas, poor Filly! that wild camp, and one other far wilder even than that, made up
                  nearly all she had ever yet seen of the wide, wide world.
               The girl was soon on her way to the wood, accompanied by Grim, an immense dog,
                  with short, black hair, bearing on his broad face and brawny breast many a scar,
                  which marked him as the veteran of a thousand tooth-and-claw battles with the wild
                  beasts of Neutralia.
               This formidable-looking dog carried Filly's basket in his mouth, having
                  volunteered to perform that supererogatory duty,—his regular functions, on such
                  occasions, going no further than simply protecting his young mistress from the
                  various dangers to which so frail a wanderer through such howling wilds must
                  necessarily be, at times, exposed.
               Grim was a mystery, and always had been, from the start. His origin was a mystery.
                  He was, in short, a canine foundling. The earliest authentic account of him was,
                  that he turned up, one morning, in the rear of the Captain's tent, without any
                  credentials whatsoever touching his ancestry. Grim was then in the first blush of
                  puppyhood, his eyes not having opened upon this wicked world. But his mouth had
                  opened,—and to some purpose, since it was by its aid that he was enabled to rouse
                  the Captain from his slumbers at an untimely hour.
               The latter, on hearing the unwonted din, right under his nose, rushed out, and
                  finding an ugly, and, withal, as mongrel-looking a piece of dog-flesh as is often
                  seen, (the Captain was very particular about the breed of his pups,) was so
                  incensed that he snatched down a keen cutlass, snatched up the pup by the back of
                  its neck, and was about to stop the ill-timed serenade, by the summary process of
                  slitting the noisy gullet that gave it passage.
               At this terrible crisis in Grim's affairs, Filly rushed forth from the tent, like
                  his good angel, to the rescue. With her usual tones, looks, and gestures of
                  eloquence, she insisted on the poor thing's life being spared. The infuriated
                  Captain arrested the deadly weapon midway in its sweep, to consider; and for him
                  to consider what Filly proposed, was, with scarcely an exception, to grant it. He
                  made no exception to the rule on this occasion, but, at the same time, gave her to
                  understand, that the sentence which had just been revoked, should be instantly
                  carried into execution if that foundling's voice should ever be heard again, to
                  his annoyance.
               Filly's first care was to take the pup out of the Captain's sight and hearing. She
                  next prevailed on one of the men to fashion, somewhere away off in the wood, a
                  rude kennel of earth and logs. There she kept him, and fed him regularly with her
                  own hands, until he had attained a very great size; when—relying perhaps on his
                  muscle for his vindication—she ventured one day to take him back to the tent.
               The Captain had, by this time, forgotten all about the well-nigh tragic
                  occurrence; and so, the girl had to introduce to him her protégé as the poor
                  orphan pup whom she had saved from a bloody execution.
               "But," said she, "he has no name yet, Señor: what shall we call him?"
               "Well, Filly," replied the Captain, after a little time to think, during which he
                  closely eyed the quadrupedal giant before him, "he is so very ugly,
                  suppose we call him Grim."
               Filly, who invariably deferred to the Captain's taste in matters of that sort, agreed at once, and it was
                  "Grim" from that day forth.
               The Captain, in consideration of the dog's extraordinary size, for his years—or
                  rather, months, his first anniversary not having yet come about—as
                  well as his sagacity, his courage, and last, though not least, his remarkably good
                  temper when not foiled in his manifest rights,—all which traits the huge pup soon
                  proved, beyond cavil, that he possessed,—took,him into high favor. The height of
                  the Captain's ambition, in the matter of dogs, had been, all along, to find one
                  that could grapple, single-handed, with the largest bears, panthers, wolves, and,
                  in fact, with any animal that frequented the Neutral Ground, including man
                  himself, provided be had only his natural weapons, or, at most, a bludgeon; and
                  when he looked upon Grim, and thought what he was likely to be, when fully
                  developed both in mind and body, he concluded that, if there ever was, or ever
                  would be, a dog that could "fill the bill," Grim was the dog. So, as I said, Grim
                  was taken into favor; and, from that auspicious moment, he had the run of the
                  camp: though, whenever Filly wanted his services, he was, somehow, always in
                  readiness to attend her. He always slept just outside the door of her tent.
               Grim developed his efficiency for hunting much earlier than is usual with his
                  race. Indeed, from the very first time he was called on to wage war against the
                  wild animals of Neutralia, he became the favorite of the men over all the other
                  dogs, of whatever breed, age, sex, or condition. These had to be taught,—but
                     he seemed to take to the business as though he had a natural
                  genius for it. And he had.
               One of Grim's most wonderful traits, was his imperturbable coolness: he seemed
                  never to get excited. Even when lying on the ground, (a most trying position for a
                  dog, when danger threatens,) any number of strange dogs might approach him, with
                  every appearance of hostile intent, strut about him, growl, fume, splutter, bully,
                  and assume all sorts of menacing attitudes; yet, not only would he scorn to rise
                  from the defenceless posture, but often would not so much as lift his head, and
                  would sometimes crown his contempt for them by closing his eyes, and, for all a
                  bystander could know to the contrary, go to sleep, while the storm was raging
                  around and threatening to break upon him at any moment. But, if it
                     did break, woe betide the unlucky dog, or dogs, that had raised
                  it!
               Another very remarkable thing about Grim, was, that he never barked. Not only was
                  this the case when about the camp, but even throughout the exciting time of a
                  hunt. This was about the only fault that could be urged against Grim. He had the
                  truest of noses, and would tree, or bring to bay, more wild animals than all the
                  other dogs put together. But, then, the hunters had no way of knowing when, or
                  where, he had treed, or brought to bay; for he never proclaimed it, but just stood
                  there, or lay down, (according as he felt,) and watched, in silence, until some of
                  the other dogs would come up, on his trail, and do the "tonguing"—thus proving
                  himself emphatically a dog of deeds rather than of words. In fact, he seemed to
                  have exhausted his voice on the eventful occasion when the Captain came so near
                  sacrificing him—as a "crying nuisance"—for his own peace' sake.
               For two reasons, one might almost suspect Grim of having Quaker blood in his
                  veins: first, on account of his never losing his temper, as already stated; and,
                  secondly, because, when the time came to "pitch in," he invariably made for the
                  throat of his victim.
               After a little successful practice with tiger-cats, leopard-cats, and
                  catamounts—each individual one of which can whip off a whole pack of ordinary dogs—Grim did not
                  hesitate to engage in single combat with panthers, wolves, and even bears,
                  wherever these could be come at without any very great disadvantages to himself.
                  It was a sight to see—that of Grim and a black or brown bear, of the largest
                  size—an ursa major of the forest—come together in mortal strife. And such were, in
                  fact, the only occasions on which the dog displayed—and, even then, in the
                  slightest possible degree—the usual signs of canine excitement. Just before
                  rushing in, he could be seen to raise his bristles a little, while a whine or two,
                  barely audible, would escape him, if the bear was an uncommonly large one, as
                  though just a "leetle bit" anxious about the result of the affair. In these
                  desperate combats, he was never known to miss the throat, reaching that vital
                  point almost on the first onset; though, in getting there, he sometimes sustained
                  lacerations of the visage, which, even after they healed, made him look both older
                  and uglier.
               Perhaps, after all, the most remarkable of this dog's traits, was his constant
                  devotion to the girl who had saved his life. Of this merciful act of hers, it is
                  hard to conceive that a dog, even of Grim's unusual sagacity, could know
                  anything,—for he could not have seen her face at the time, his organs of vision
                  being, then, wax-tight in early puppyhood. To be sure, he may have heard the
                  pleading tones of her voice; and, indeed, that voice had, ever afterwards, a magic
                  influence over him; for, not only would he, on hearing her call, leave all else
                  and hurry to her side, but, even when the men were going on a hunt, and when Grim
                  well knew they were going—their arms in their hands, and all the other dogs
                  leaping and baying about them in the wildest excitement—they could never, by any
                  means they could use, induce him to accompany them, much as he liked the sport,
                  until she would signify her willingness to dispense, for a while, with his
                  services, by saying, "Go, Grim!" when he was off with a bound.
               Grim could not talk,—although, as I before hinted, he went so far in that
                  direction as to disdain to bark.
               Such was the sole escort which the girl had, in her frequent strolls through the
                  surrounding woods, or, indeed, cared to have, so far as it regarded security from
                  harm.
               There was not any great variety of flowers in those densely timbered haunts,
                  particularly at that late season; but of such as there were, Filly soon gathered
                  her basketful; and of graceful vines and creepers, besides mosses of different
                  kinds, feathery ferns, and autumn-leaves of almost every hue, she procured more
                  than she well knew how to dispose of.
               As she walked eagerly on, gathering these, lured from spot to spot by the new
                  beauties which the luxuriant vegetation successively presented, she talked, at
                  times, now to herself, and now to Grim, who kept close to her side, although her
                  short trips from flower to flower, and her sudden starts and stoppings, one would
                  suppose, must have annoyed him no little.
               Occasionally she would stay her steps a moment, to listen to some bird that would
                  break into song near her. Then herself would pour forth snatches of some wild
                  ballad which she had heard about Camp Wildwood. The burden of her utterances,
                  however, seemed to be the line she had quoted on first waking in the tent and
                  finding the day so bright and lovely, "Happy the bride the sun shines on." She had
                  improvised a sort of tune, to which she hummed the joyous sentiment during almost
                  every brief trip she made between knolls. Occasionally, she would hum it forth
                  right into Grim's honest but otherwise ill-favored visage, which he often thrust
                  close to her own, as she stooped to her work. But, as he responded only by staring blankly into her face, never
                  once smiling, or even so much as changing countenance, it was very evident that he
                  either did not at all comprehend the sentiment thus thrown into his teeth, or did
                  not appreciate it, or, like the reader, perhaps, failed as yet to see why so
                  frequent a repetition of it was appropriate to the present occasion.
               After quite a long roaming up and down the woods, the girl came to a gurgling
                  rill, just at the point where it was crossed by a bridle-path; and being
                  reminded—as one often is—by the sight of the running water, that she was
                  thirsty,—her attention to this physical want having been hitherto diverted by her
                  pleasing pursuit, and still more pleasing thoughts,—she plucked a few large
                  leaves, fashioned them, with great dexterity, into a cup, and, laying aside her
                  hat, stooped down and quenched her thirst. She then seated herself on a large
                  mossy log, which, lying directly across the little stream, formed a sort of rustic
                  bridge, and set to work, twining wreaths and arranging bouquets out of the diverse
                  material she had gathered.
               Among other wreaths she made one out of a rare species of wild clematis, with
                  blossoms as white as snow, and of surpassing delicacy both of shape and fragrance.
                  She seemed, for some reason, to bestow especial care on this; and, when finished,
                  its construction was so deft, and its arrangement so tasteful, that it was really
                  a masterpiece of its kind. She then placed it upon her head, and, drawing forth
                  from her belt a little looking-glass of quaint workmanship, carefully surveyed her
                  floral crown; and, doubtless, also the beaming face of this young Queen of
                  Neutralia.
               "Why should brides," she said aloud, "always wear orange wreaths, as Señor says
                  they do? I never saw an orange wreath, but I am quite sure it cannot possibly look
                  sweeter or purer than my clematis wreath. I do wish he could see it."

                           Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
                        
                        
                           Ros.

                           Celia.

                  IT had been well for the girl if the next wish she was destined to
                  make could have been as easily gratified as this one. "Señor" himself, as she had
                  long been accustomed to call Gatewood, stood, at that very moment, but a few paces
                  off, watching her movements. He had, when yet at a distance, caught sight of Grim
                  lying in the path along which he was making his way to the camp, and seeing a
                  flower-basket by the dog's side, supposed Filly was somewhere near, and resolved
                  to surprise her. For this purpose he dismounted, and leaving his horse standing in
                  the path, walked noiselessly forward on tiptoe. Grim having spied his master from
                  afar, and having recognized him at first sight, suffered him—as, indeed, he
                  invariably did any one whom he knew and liked—to approach without himself making
                  the least demonstration of the fact that he was at hand.
               "He does see it," said Gatewood, now stepping forward, "and thinks it
                  very becoming."
               "Oh, Señor! how you frightened me!" she exclaimed, starting up from her seat and
                  clasping her hands over her heart.
               By this time he had reached the spot, and after seating himself on the fallen tree, took her gently by the
                  arm and bade her sit down beside him. It most probably flashed across the girl's
                  mind as strange, that he did not kiss her, as he always had done at junctures
                  kindred to this. If so, however, she was not long in dismissing the thought; at
                  least for the present; and, seeing that he himself did not speak further, she at
                  once took up—perhaps for want of a more appropriate topic of conversation—her
                  recent train of reflection, as near the point at which his sudden obtrusion had
                  broken it off, as her startled and embarrassed condition would admit of.
               "You said brides always wore orange wreaths, Señor. Is n't this just as pretty?"
                  she asked, still crowned, and turning her blushing face up to his.
               "It's very pretty, Filly," he replied, kindly enough, but in a rather
                  compassionate tone, which, however, the girl, in her unsuspecting confidence, and
                  the exuberance of her present joy, did not observe.
               "And then, too, when I get my splendid jewels on, which you gave me—"
               Gatewood, painfully aware how cruel it would be to let her run on longer in this
                  strain of joyous anticipation, only to meet finally with a bitter disappointment,
                  thought it best to give her at once a hint of what was impending.
               "But Filly," he said, with this view, "you will not have need of such things quite
                  as soon as we thought."
               "Why, Señor?" she timidly demanded, looking at him with an expression of
                  countenance which, from having been all joy, was now wofully downcast. "This was
                  the day: I certainly have n't mistaken the day. You said—"
               "Yes—you are right about that, Filly, but—but—"
               "But what, Señor?" she asked, as he shrank momentarily, as well he might, from
                  telling her the cruel truth.
               "I have been obliged to change my plans," he replied.
               "Obliged to change your plans, Señor?"
               "Filly, did they tell you of the refugees we rescued yesterday from the
                  Spaniards?"
               "Oh, yes—Mr. Davies told me all about it; and I'm so glad you did such a noble
                  deed," exclaimed the girl, for the moment forgetting her own grievance in the
                  glory of her heart's idol.
               "And he said, too," she went on, "the lady was as fine as a queen."
               "Well—they are now living in the cottage."
               "Not living in our cottage, Señor?" said she, with a sudden start of
                  surprise.
               "Yes, Filly. All the buildings in the town were full of refugees, and they could
                  get no house there to go into; and I could n't suffer them to be exposed to the
                  weather you know, with all their misfortunes, too,—and a lady among them.
               "What else would you have me do?" he demanded, seeing that, instead of replying to
                  his attempted extenuation of his conduct, she remained silent, and covered her
                  face with her hand.
               "I'm so sorry," she said at length, repiningly. "I had my heart set on going to
                  the lake to live. It's so beautiful there. I chose that spot for building the
                  house because we could see so far. And you seemed to like it so much, Señor—and
                  said we would be happy there. But now I suppose I shall have to spend all my life
                  in these dreary old woods, where I can see only a few steps before me. I want to
                  go to the lake, where I can see out, for miles. I'm tired of the old woods. I hate
                  them. I just hate them!"
               Here the girl burst into tears; and although Gatewood attempted to draw her to him
                  for the purpose of allaying, so far as he might be able, the storm of emotions
                  which he had raised in her impulsive breast, she did what she had never done before, broke his gentle hold, and, in a
                  tumult of mingled grief and sense of wrong, rushed from his side, and, prostrating
                  herself in the leaves, buried her face in her hands, and gave free vent—child that
                  she was—to her passionate sobs.
               But the heaviest blow had not yet descended. To Gatewood, scenes which roused his
                  sensibilities, even in a slight degree, were always painful. He, however, had been
                  unaccustomed to them of late, and against the few which he had witnessed he had
                  been enabled by natural firmness and force of habit to steel himself, at least to
                  all outward seeming. Inasmuch, therefore, as the distress in the present instance
                  had already affected him to the verge of the melting mood,—affected him, too,
                  infinitely more from the consciousness of his having deliberately caused it
                  all,—he resolved that there should be no repetition of such a scene; but that now,
                  since the flood-gates of grief were fairly open, he would go on even to the bitter
                  end, that the gushing fountain might, if possible, be at once drained to the
                  bottom.
               The reader shall, in due time I hope, hear from her own lips the previous part of
                  this girl's story—at least what little was known of it. Suffice it to say here,
                  that she came under the Captain's charge when she was supposed to be about ten
                  years of age, though, truth to say, there was no accurate information whatever on
                  the subject of her birth. And this was the reason why she was known only as
                  Filly—a name conferred by Gatewood in mere sport, but retained for the rest of her
                  life. She had no family name at all, nor had she the slightest recollection of her
                  parents, having been separated from them—whoever they were—by one of those
                  terrible strokes of fate which shroud in gloom the prospects of such as they come
                  upon, but which are fortunately of rare occurrence. The Captain had rescued her
                  from a doom worse than death.
               The camp had been her home. Her rescuer not only treated her, at all times, with
                  the utmost kindness and consideration, but himself taught her, in the first place,
                  to speak the English language—of which she knew not a word—and afterwards to read
                  and write it with considerable accuracy; a task which, under his peculiar
                  circumstances, must have cost him no little trouble and patience.
               The result was, her knowledge of the world was confined almost entirely to such
                  books as he, from time to time, placed at her disposal,—consisting mostly of
                  novels,—and to such peeps behind the curtain of society as he chose to afford her
                  by his conversation. She rarely ever communicated with any one about the camp
                  except the woman whose duty it was to serve her, as before mentioned. This was an
                  honest, simple-hearted soul, who had been selected from among the camp-women for
                  those very qualities; and inasmuch as she herself had had but few opportunities of
                  seeing anything of the great world, she knew little of its ways; and not being at
                  all communicative or gossipy, she kept to herself well-nigh all she did know.
               The girl's personal charms, even amid the fearful surroundings from which Gatewood
                  had rescued her, blighting as these usually are to all natural beauty, and
                  hopelessly precluding the possibility of its cultivation, were nevertheless
                  considerable; and so fascinating did she become as she ripened into womanhood,
                  that for the last year he had resolved to make her his wife. Let it be recorded to
                  the credit of this in some respects remarkable man, that, notwithstanding he was
                  away off here in this howling wilderness, where no law ever reached, he had
                  hitherto refrained from availing himself of his position to take advantage of the
                  youth and innocence of this lone girl, and of her ignorance of the world's ways
                  touching virtue, for the purpose of wronging her, and then throwing her aside as
                     a ruined bauble which purity and
                  worth would henceforth spurn as they passed, should she ever dare show her face
                  within the pale of civilization. His resolution to assume this honorable relation
                  towards the friendless girl, outcast though he was, and surrounded by associates
                  of brutal instincts, who held the fair fame of woman in special contempt, showed
                  at least that he had not altogether forgotten the dictates of honor and his duties
                  to society.
               "Filly," he said, as he now walked up to where she was lying with her face towards
                  the earth, and attempted to lift her to a sitting posture, "get up and sit by me
                  on the leaves—I want to talk to you."
               She, however, resisted his efforts, and fell back to her position, still weeping
                  as though her heart would break.
               "Filly," said he at length, "you must go to town and stay with old Mrs.
                  Davies."
               It now became evident that, thus far, much of the girl's demonstration of emotion
                  had been put on with the hope of effecting her purpose by its violence, since she
                  probably thought there was no other way of carrying her long-nursed pet project of
                  living by the lake. For although she had just been accusing her fate for being
                  compelled to abide longer in the woods, she now clung to these wild scenes with an
                  earnestness which it was pitiful to look upon. This infinitely greater grief
                  wholly annihilated the less.
               On hearing the Captain's words, she instantly lifted her face from the leaves.
               "Oh, no—Señor! don't do that—don't send me away—anything but that"—she cried,
                  falling into his lap where he now sat on the ground, and burying her face in his
                  bosom. "I am sorry I said what I did. I 'll never do so again, if you will only
                  let me stay. I 'm willing to live here in the woods—anywhere—oh! anywhere in the
                  world, with you. Don't send me away!"
               It was plain that her grief was no longer put on. The tears that streamed forth
                  now were clearly those of genuine anguish. Gatewood became suddenly aware, ere he
                  had time to think, that his resolution was fast oozing out at his eyes, and at the
                  next breath he felt the big drops—the first for many a long year—course scaldingly
                  down his cheek. The girl, however, did not observe this: her head was still bowed
                  down, and she thought not once of looking into those fierce eyes for such tender
                  witnesses of his relenting. Long ere she looked up from where she rested they were
                  cleared of all moisture, and showed no signs whatever of yielding.
               The struggle in Gatewood's breast during this brief time,—to his honor be it
                  recorded,—was such as to well-nigh subvert all the plans and hopes of the new
                  happiness which he had just been cherishing for himself, even up to the very
                  moment when he had descried her in his homeward path. And indeed had he known, at
                  this time, the depth of her devotion for him, it is not impossible that the result
                  of that struggle might have been different. But he thought, and not without some
                  show of reason, that her love arose partly from gratitude, but more from her
                  isolated position, she never having really been acquainted with any of the sterner
                  sex but himself. He judged that, if she went to live in the town, as he had just
                  proposed, she would soon meet with some one far worthier of her than he felt
                  himself to be, and that she would then be but too glad to forget the wild haunts
                  of her childhood and her bandit lover, in the novelty and pleasure which her new
                  situation would afford in the untold raptures of mutual affection.
               But although he had now resolved, for the second time during the last
                  half-hour,—and this time inexorably,—to send her off, he thought it more humane to
                  be less sudden with her. He therefore determined to afford her an opportunity tunity to argue the matter with him for
                  a short time, during which he would give her to understand in a gradual way what
                  she was to expect.
               "Yes, Filly—you must go," he said in kindly tones, raising her face gently toward
                  his with both his hands so soon as he felt assured that all signs of his recent
                  emotion had dried from his eyes. "You know, you are no longer a child, but have
                  grown to be a woman; and it is not proper for a man and woman to live together
                  unless they are husband and wife."
               "Why, Señor—is that all? I'm sure there can be no great harm in that. Who says
                  it's wrong, Señor?"
               "The world says so, Filly," he replied, forgetting that the world's opinion—that
                  great bugbear which dictates more or less to us all, though unfortunately not
                  always so correctly as in this instance—could have but few terrors for this
                  unsophisticated child of nature.
               "The world, indeed! Why should I care for what the world says, Señor?"
               "But you may care some day, Filly,—when you come to live in it."
               "Do you, then, expect to take me to live in the world some day?"
               "I—I may. You know, any one who leads the life I do, can't always tell exactly
                  what he 's going to do."
               "But, Señor, you said, if I was your wife, the world would n't think it wrong that
                  we should live together—even here in the woods, I suppose."
               "Yes."
               "Then what 's the use of separating? I'm willing to live anywhere, or anyhow, so
                  you don't send me away, or leave me. I 'll take back all I said before: I don't
                  want to go to the lake: if you will only let me stay here, I shall be happy."
               "Filly, I suppose I may as well tell you, once for all, everything about my
                  reasons for sending you into town. I know you never repeat what I tell you, and
                  you must n't repeat this, for it is a great secret. I expect to go on an
                  expedition and take all my men with me."
               "When, Señor?" asked the girl, greatly startled at the tidings,—as might have been
                  seen in the sudden blanching of her cheek, and heard in the gasping, half
                  whispered tones in which she spoke those two little words.
               "That, I can't tell precisely—before a very great while, though."
               Nothing was said for some time, during which the girl seemed to be absorbed in
                  dejected reverie.
               "How long will you be gone, Señor?" she asked at length.
               "Oh—maybe a long while."
               "Then, Señor, that is the very reason you ought to let me stay with you while you
                  are here," said she; and the thought of his going away, most probably into danger,
                  caused her tears to flow, afresh. But she was now too deeply interested in arguing
                  and in imagining she had yet some hope of carrying her point, to wipe them away.
                  So they welled up from her heart and were allowed to trickle unheeded, one after
                  another, down her now flushed cheeks. "For all I know you may be going into war,
                  and I may never see you again."
               "But, Filly," he replied, "I shall have to be away from camp a great deal,
                  sometimes for days together, getting things ready for the expedition."
               "Well, if you will only let me stay, I can see you whenever you are
                  there. But if I go to town, I shall never see you." How speedily may
                  circumstances reverse feelings we have nursed for years. Heretofore the Chief had
                  most jealously kept the girl, whose heart (and soul too) he had won, away from the town, lest she should there meet
                  with some one who might lure her from him. But now he hoped with all his heart not
                  only that she would be willing to go thither, but that some worthy youth would
                  soon—he cared not how soon—win her to stay.
               "Why, it will not be safe for you in camp, while I'm away so long at a time."
               "Grim will take care of me," said she, putting her arm around the great neck of
                  the dog, who had long before come and lain down near her. "Won't you, Grim?"
               To this Grim did not respond with his voice, as indeed he never did,—but no one
                  could have doubted, from the affectionate look which he bestowed upon the girl as
                  he raised his claw-scarred visage, that, if need were, he would defend her to the
                  death.
               "No, Filly—you must give it up," said Gatewood, this time, with more decision in
                  his tone,—finding probably that she was growing too hopeful, and to say the truth,
                  was, at times, getting the better of him in the debate. "Davies will take you to
                  town in the morning. You have no idea how many more charms the town will have for
                  you than the woods. The big houses will cause you to forget our poor tents; the
                  gardens and flowers will make you wonder how you ever could have admired these
                  thickets where you can see little or nothing; and"—here he twined his arm around
                  her slender waist—"when you go into society and get acquainted with the
                  fine-looking men you will meet there, you 'll say to yourself, 'Why, how much more
                  agreeable they are than Señor: if I had only seen them first, I—'"
               "Oh, how can you say that?" she exclaimed, burying her face in her hands. "That is
                  cruel—too cruel!"
               This outburst was so unexpected to him and so unquestionably genuine, that
                  Gatewood was alarmed at the effect of his words, and hastened to atone for them so
                  far as was in his power—and, alas! in the end, too far for her own good.
               "You must n't think me in earnest always, Filly. I only meant that when you once
                  get settled in the town, you'll find everything much better than out here. I know
                  you 'll not forget Señor. I was only joking about that, sweet. Look up, and let me
                  see you—and kiss you too. There, now! I know you 'll be ready to go, in the
                  morning, like a good girl. And then you can muse just as much as you please, and
                  dream, too, if you like, of my coming back from our expedition and making you
                  happy."
               These deceptive words, which he endeavored to think himself justified in uttering
                  with the view of accomplishing quietly, rather than by force, that which had
                  become with him a foregone conclusion, produced the effect intended. The poor
                  girl's face, which grief had so overcast, cleared at once—the matter had ended on
                  terms so much less hard than she had, a few moments ago, expected.
               Rising, he assisted her from the ground.
               "Come, now," he said, "you shall ride my horse to camp."
               Saying which, he led her to where the animal was standing in the bridle-path, and
                  throwing the right stirrup over, lifted her to the saddle, and giving her the
                  rein, walked on, while she followed—Grim, with the basket of flowers, bringing up
                  the rear.
               "Señor, you will let me take Grim with me?" said she, when they had nearly reached
                  the camp—glancing back at her most humble obedient servant.
               "What folly, child? Why, Grim is as indispensable in camp as—as I am. You
                  certainly would n't wish to spoil all our splendid hunts just for the sake of
                  having the dog chained in a little back-yard that you might look at him through the window. Even the slight
                  gratification this would afford you would be destroyed; for you would be always
                  thinking how cruel it was to the dog to keep him cramped up in that way. Why, I
                  believe it would kill Grim outright. And then it would never do for him to run
                  loose in the streets,—he would frighten everybody to death. Moreover, I'm certain
                  old Mrs. Davies would n't endure him in the house. So, you see, while the dog is
                  all in all to us in the woods, he could be of no use whatever in town. And then,
                  as for his being at all ornamental—well, you know, Filly, as well as I do, that
                  Grim was never accused of that, even in his more youthful days; and
                  the unsightly marks which the bears and cats have set on his countenance since,
                  have done more to excuse his notorious ugliness than to improve his
                  appearance."
               "Señor," said the girl, not altogether liking these free comments on the personal
                  appearance of her faithful friend and constant attendant,—in his hearing, too; for
                  Filly had an idea that Grim could about half comprehend any ordinary
                  conversation,—"Señor, I don't think Grim so very ugly."
               "You don't think Grim very ugly?" exclaimed the Captain, stopping suddenly and
                  looking back, on hearing this preposterous opinion, as he most assuredly thought
                  it.
               "No—I do not," persisted the girl, in a firm and somewhat indignant tone.
               "Perhaps you don't think him at all ugly?"
               "I can't say I do."
               "Well, maybe you think him pretty?"
               "Sometimes."
               "Do you ever think him beautiful, Filly?"
               "Well—not—often," replied Filly, though with such evident reluctance, that the
                  Captain, after a glance at the dog—who seemed, each time that he looked at him,
                  much uglier even than he expected—was fain to laugh aloud. The girl, however, not
                  only did not join in his merriment at her favorite's expense, but looked a little
                  piqued, and as though by way of offset to the derogatory remarks, said, as she
                  gazed back compassionately at him:
               "Don't believe what Señor says about you, Grim. Come along, you good
                  old fellow!"
               "'Good,' I grant you," said the Captain, starting on again; "but not in the least
                  beautiful.
               "Sometimes, Filly," he resumed after a short silence, "when we see a very pretty
                  person and don't wish to attach too much importance to mere comeliness, which we
                  know to be a very perishable thing, we say, 'Beauty is only skin-deep.' Now, as I
                  don't wish Grim's misfortune to depreciate him in our estimation, I will modify
                  the saying—to his advantage, as I think—and put it, 'Ugliness is only
                  skin-deep.'"

                  THE Delgados, as I have already said, were from San Antonio de
                  Bexar, which their ancestors had assisted in founding nearly a hundred years
                  before. And here a brief sketch of the founding of that city—which has always been
                  the leading one in Texas until Galveston recently became a formidable rival in
                  growth and prosperity—may prove not
                  uninteresting to the reader, because it was the home of the family whose
                  adventures are related in this story; but more especially because it is to be
                  made, in due time, the theatre of some of the most prominent historical events
                  which we shall attempt to depict.
               From the year 1691, when the first regular Spanish settlements were made in Texas
                  in the guise of Missions for the conversion of the wild Indians to Christianity,
                  till 1730, Texas could scarcely be said to have made, on the whole, any progress
                  whatever in the ways of civilization. Each of those Missions—of which there were
                  some half-dozen in all, situated at different points in the province,—was
                  conducted and controlled by a few Franciscan friars, who, during their peculiar
                  operations among the savages, were protected by a small garrison of Spanish
                  soldiers. The friars, however, jealous, it would seem, of the military's power and
                  influence,—which they knew would be ultimately much increased if they were allowed
                  to marry and have families in the regular way,—succeeded in virtually abolishing
                  marriage among them; which "sacrament," indeed, had always, even before this
                  priestly interdiction, been exceedingly difficult to bring about, owing to the
                  necessity of every officer and soldier getting the King's assent as a condition
                  preliminary to taking a wife unto himself. The almost necessary result, among a
                  soldiery already proverbially deficient in bridling their baser passions, was a
                  promiscuous intercourse with the Indian women in and about the Missions.
               It was mainly owing to the degraded character of the population springing from
                  this licentiousness, that Texas, as above stated, made no progress for forty
                  years. On this lamentable state of things being made known to the King of Spain,
                  he signified his wish that a large number of the families residing in the Canary
                  Islands, who were among his best subjects, should migrate to this province, as
                  richly favored by nature as it had been hitherto cursed by the innate viciousness
                  and the religious fanaticism which were so fatally blended in the persons of the
                  first settlers.
               Although liberal inducements were offered, with the view of effecting the
                  migration contemplated by his Majesty, comparatively few could be prevailed upon
                  to cast their lot in this distant though fertile wilderness. In the year 1730,
                  however, ten or fifteen families of the Islanders reached Texas. These emigrants,
                  who were expected to initiate a more auspicious career for the hitherto
                  unfortunate province, went to work on the head-waters of a beautiful river and
                  founded the city of San Antonio—or, as it was called at first, San Fernando.
               These Islanders were noted not only for their regular habits,—on which his Majesty
                  no doubt reckoned largely as an element of success in the enterprise he had
                  originated,—but also for the respect in which they held the weaker sex, their
                  chivalry towards all their fellow-beings, and their religious fervor.
               Upon the head of each of these families the King conferred the title of Hidalgo,—a
                  dignity which invested the recipient with certain privileges and immunities. He
                  could, for example, plead his title in bar of any suit brought by the common
                  citizen for the restitution of property, even though illegally seized, or for the
                  punishment of outrages committed against personal rights, or liberty, or even life
                  itself. These, one may well suppose, were dangerous prerogatives; and it is
                  difficult to conceive why they should have been conferred at all, except indeed as
                  a blow aimed directly at the manifest rights of the people. It is to the
                  everlasting credit of those so clothed, that they seldom abused their powers.
               Among the families in San Antonio who, at the time we commemorate, regarded themselves as the nobles of
                  the country, and were so regarded by others,—in so far at least as nobility was by
                  that time recognized at all,—and who, at any rate, formed, practically, a much
                  privileged class, was that of the Delgados, their ancestors having been among
                  those who had migrated from the Canary Islands in response to the King's
                  desire.
               Colonel Delgado, the father of Isabella and Juan, and brother of the Padre, was a
                  native of San Antonio. He was a man of wealth and intelligence, had received a
                  superior education, and being gifted with a fine person and fascinating manners,
                  was not only a leader in society, but his influence was co-extensive with his
                  native province. Many of his relatives having removed from Texas, in the by-gone
                  time, to the various other provinces, and some to the capital, the name had become
                  pretty well known throughout Mexico.
               Colonel Delgado had early imbibed the spirit of our Revolution, and was fain to
                  imitate our example; but the thinly settled frontier where he lived was not a
                  point at which he could hope to initiate such a struggle with any prospect of
                  success. He was therefore obliged to bide his time. Meanwhile, however, he was by
                  no means idle. Not only did he avail himself of every safe opportunity to
                  inculcate by conversation the immortal principles of liberty, but he went to great
                  expense in educating his children with a constant eye to the advancement of those
                  principles.
               Isabella and Juan, after several years spent in the famous schools of
                  Queretaro—the priests who conducted the institutions there, being widely known for
                  their liberal political views—were sent to the United States to spend the last
                  year of their education, to the end that the germ of freedom, so auspiciously
                  awakened within them at home, not only should lose nothing in its growth, but
                  should absorb from that genial soil such nutriment as might expand it into a
                  sturdy plant which could defy the storms of despotism. Here, they not only learned
                  the English language, but met and conversed daily with Americans of the best
                  society, read their history, and studied their institutions. They returned to
                  their native land just on the eve of that brief military campaign, which, under
                  the direction of the earnest though inexperienced Cura Hidalgo, opened, as we have
                  seen, near the centre of the country with such unprecedented success, and closed
                  so disastrously on the circumference, in the province contiguous to Texas.
               During this bloody campaign Colonel Delgado and his son did good service in the
                  cause of the patriots,—the former as a prominent officer, the latter as ensign in
                  a company from his native town. The father escaped, for a short season, the
                  fearful fate of his illustrious leaders, so many of whom were inhumanly executed
                  at Chihuahua in short instalments; namely, on the first of May, 1811, one
                  major-general and one brigadier; on the 11th of the same month, one major-general
                  and one colonel; on the 6th of June, one major-general and one colonel; on the
                  26th of the same month, the generalissimo, the captain-general and governor of
                  Monterey, and one lieutenant-general; on the 27th of the same month, an
                  influential lawyer, an army intendant, and a brigadier; and finally, on the 27th
                  of July, the Curate Hidalgo himself—the Chief of the rebellion.
               Colonel Delgado was, however, soon afterwards captured at San Antonio and very
                  summarily disposed of, his head being cut off, stuck on a pole, and exposed in the
                  most public part of the town. Young Juan had also been taken, and he and his
                  mother were both forced by the inhuman Salcedo, the commandant of the
                  north-eastern provinces, to be present at the execution, and by order of the
                  monster, the blood which streamed from the neck of his brave victim, was sprinkled over the person of his
                  swooning wife.
               Is it any wonder, therefore, that the thoughts of the youth—who managed to make
                  his escape before his turn came to die—dwelt ever afterwards on this diabolical
                  scene? Is it any wonder that schemes of vengeance were nursed in his heart to the
                  very verge of frenzy? Or is it any wonder that his spirited sister, so far from
                  allowing such deeds to beget in her breast an apathy to oppression, should have
                  been converted by them into an enthusiast in the cause of her country's
                  independence?
               The truth is, that, during the fierce conflicts of this revolution,—which up to
                  the time of Hidalgo's capture occupied only about six months,—there were many acts
                  of cruelty perpetrated on both sides. There was, however, this extenuating, though
                  by no means justifying, excuse to be urged by the patriots, which could not be
                  pleaded by their more intelligent enemies, namely, that their army was made up of
                  the most ignorant of the notoriously ignorant masses of Mexico. These finding
                  themselves suddenly free after such a long and terrible oppression—their ancestors
                  too having suffered for three hundred years before them—it was quite impossible
                  for their leaders to control them when the favorable moment for vengeance arrived.
                  Now, inasmuch as the debasing ignorance in which they had been purposely kept by
                  the Spaniards, was really the cause of these barbarities, the tyrannical masters
                  were themselves, in a great measure, responsible for the atrocities committed.
               "Juan," said the Padre,—as the three took their seats at the breakfast-table the
                  morning after the uncle had returned from Natchitoches,—"of course you will go
                  with the General to Washington?"
               On the previous evening, while detailing his conversation with Bernardo, the
                  priest had informed his nephew of the General's request, that he would accompany
                  him on his contemplated journey. At that time however he made no reply; hence the
                  renewal of the proposition in the morning.
               "I had laid other plans," replied Juan curtly.
               "Other plans!" echoed his Reverence. "What are they?"
               The information which the priest had—that his nephew intended returning to San
                  Antonio to assassinate Salcedo—was not positive, though sufficient to justify the
                  strongest suspicions. Moreover, young Delgado was wholly ignorant that his uncle
                  had any idea of such a plot being in existence. Hence the latter's affectation of
                  ignorance, as implied in the foregoing interrogatory. He did not wish Juan to
                  think—just yet, at least—that he had already heard such a rumor.
               "Well," replied the young man,—though not until a good while after the question
                  had been propounded,—"perhaps it don't matter, uncle, what they were. Let them go
                  for the present; the time for them will yet come. As Bernardo is our acknowledged
                  leader while here, if he thinks I can serve the cause better by going to
                  Washington with him than in any other way, why, I suppose I ought to go."
               "Certainly you ought," said the Padre eagerly. "I knew, that, after you had the
                  whole night to think over the proposition, you could not but act reasonably in the
                  matter. And, Juan, you ought not to tarry long. The General starts very
                  soon,—probably to-morrow or next day, and you know a journey like that will
                  require some preparation after you get to town."
               "Oh," replied the nephew, "you need n't fear much dallying on my part: I have
                  already told Miguel to saddle my horse,
                  and I shall start as soon as I have swallowed my breakfast."
               So tenacious of his purposes had Juan always proved himself, and so yielding did
                  he now seem, that his uncle thought, at once, he must have been misinformed with
                  regard to the bloody machinations of his nephew, and was, of course, rejoiced to
                  find him, for once, so reasonable.
               The priest, himself probably possessed of as much tenacity as his nephew, had
                  resolved to use all the means he could think of to deter him from a scheme which
                  he was confident would only eventuate in the sacrifice of his own life with no
                  good result to the cause; and, as the very last resort, he had determined to bring
                  to bear upon him—after extorting a confession of guilt in the matter of the
                  contemplated assassination—those spiritual terrors which appertain peculiarly to
                  the priestly office, by virtue of which, according to the creed of his Church, he
                  could call down the anathemas of heaven.
               The true secret of young Delgado's yielding so readily is to be found in the fact
                  that he had overheard one of the Spanish officers who captured the party say,
                  incidentally,—though in such a connection as to leave on his mind no doubt of its
                  truth,—that the monster whose blood he so fiercely sought had been called by the
                  Viceroy temporarily to the capital. This of course rendered it, for the time,
                  impossible for the youth to reach him.

                           The help of mine own eyes.
                        
                     
                     —All's Well That Ends Well.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           My integrity ne'er knew the crafts
                           That you do charge me with.
                        
                     
                     —All's Well That Ends Well.
                     
                  
               
               
                  NO sooner had Juan ridden away, than the Padre—impatient to put into
                  operation his project for winning over the Chief of the Neutral Ground through the
                  influence which he doubted not his niece would be able to wield over him,—broached
                  the subject to her at once. Truth to say, it is not at all improbable that his
                  reason for urging his nephew to a speedy departure was attributable more to his
                  impatience to carry out this plan than to any well-grounded fear that he would be
                  too late.
               "Isabella," he began, as they sat under the trees, "did you hold any conversation
                  with Captain Gatewood about the republican cause?"
               "Of course I did, uncle. You know I never let any such opportunity escape me," she
                  replied, with a slight laugh.
               "Did he seem interested in the subject?"
               "Oh, yes—he appeared to sympathize very warmly with us."
               "Well, did you ask him to do more than sympathize?"
               "No—I thought we were already under too many obligations to him to begin begging
                  so soon for additional favors, particularly as he promised to visit us again
                  before long."
               
               "But the favors we have to ask now," replied the priest, "are not of a personal
                  character: they are for our country. That, you know, is very different. I suppose,
                  though, you were right in not hurrying matters too much, He should have time to
                  digest what we have told him. But when he comes again, I hope, Isabella, you
                  will—"
               "Why put it upon me to do this, uncle?" interrupted the Señorita. "With all
                  respect, I must say I should think you the more proper person to
                  influence any one in political discussion."
               "So far as regards the politics of the matter," replied the priest, "you are
                  probably right in your opinion; but sentiment, you know, goes a great
                  way with some persons."
               "Very true," said Isabella; "but I should judge that in a man of Captain
                  Gatewood's cast of mind, sentiment, though it might have its weight, would be at
                  all times subservient to reason."
               "Not at all times: there is just where you are mistaken. In this case
                  sentiment predominates," said the Padre; then added, leaning over towards her and
                  speaking in a very low tone, as though afraid the very trees might hear, since it
                  was quite evident there was no human being within ear-shot, "And let me tell you,
                  you have great influence over him."
               "Great influence over Captain Gatewood?" exclaimed Isabella, astonished not more
                  by the assertion than by the confidential tone in which it was communicated. "Why,
                  uncle, I cannot think I have any influence whatever over him, except so far as my
                  misfortunes may excite his compassion and his desire to relieve them; and I have
                  no doubt it would be the same with regard to any other woman in my situation. If I
                  had rescued him from a set of merciless butchers, as he has rescued us, why, then
                  indeed, I might naturally expect to hold over him such influence as gratitude
                  would beget—but certainly nothing more. Having done nothing of the kind, however,
                  I am utterly at a loss to understand your meaning. Let me say, I think that, for
                  once, uncle, you have got things strangely confused. Instead of recognizing our
                  immense indebtedness to the brave Captain, one might suppose you thought
                     him the debtor."
               "Isabella," said the priest, "can it be possible that you, who have been so
                  accustomed to such matters and so observant of them, should not yet have perceived
                  that he is deeply in love with you?"
               "Why, uncle!" she exclaimed, coloring. "Indeed you were never so mistaken in your
                  life. Nor do I wonder at it. Not only are you wholly excluded by your vows from
                  the indulgence of the tender passion yourself, but your calling must afford you
                  very few facilities for noting its workings in others. So, I suppose you are
                  excusable for such gross blunders when you step out of your legitimate sphere.
                  But, if you will pardon me, I hardly think the stepping out excusable. Uncle, do
                  let me dare once advise you to refrain in future."
               "It is you who have made the mistake, Isabella," calmly replied the priest, "and a
                  very common mistake it is. It consists in supposing that my office is incompatible
                  with a thorough knowledge of the passion in question. The truth is, there is not
                  in the whole world a situation more favorable than the priestly function to the
                  study, not only of love, but of all the passions which bless and curse our kind.
                  Very rarely indeed have I formed a wrong opinion on such a subject; and I am
                  absolutely certain that my judgment in the present particular is correct."
               "I never dreamed of such a thing," said the Señorita in all sincerity, though now
                  beginning to think there might be
                  something in it. Nor was it with less sincerity that she added, after a pause,
                  "No, indeed—my heart was too full of gratitude to him to think of anything else. I
                  thought of his bravery—his nobleness—but not once of his love."
               "Well, Isabella," said his Reverence, "I have only to say, it is high time that
                  you should think of it, and of the almost unbounded influence it will
                  give you over him for the furtherance of our cause."
               "Uncle, you certainly do not mean—"
               Here the Señorita stopped; and her uncle well knew that the sentence, unfinished
                  as it was, was but a delicate mode of inquiring what he really did mean.
               "I mean," he replied emphatically, "that Captain Gatewood has under his complete
                  control a body of men who could sweep Texas from one end to the other, and expel
                  every villain of a Gachupin beyond the Rio Grande."
               Here it is but proper to explain that the Padre probably stretched a little his
                  belief in the prowess of the Neutralians, the better to impress upon his niece the
                  importance of securing their services.
               "I did n't know so much as that about it," replied the lady. "I was aware, though,
                  that he commanded a very brave and very formidable band. But even had I known what
                  you state—nay, had I known that the whole force of the United States was at his
                  beck, and that on a word from him they would rush forth and drive every enemy of
                  our freedom into the western ocean—even that could not induce or enable me to do
                  an impossibility."
               "You mean you could not love him?"
               "That is exactly what I mean."
               "But, Isabella, I don't ask you to do that."
               "What, then, in heaven's name, am I to infer from your remarks?" demanded the
                  Señorita, coloring, to think that she had probably made a gross blunder on so
                  delicate a subject.
               "I mean merely," replied her uncle; "that the Chief's feelings toward you must be
                  availed of to secure his co-operation in the coming campaign. I am convinced that
                  without him we shall never succeed in an expedition from these borders. We
                  expected, as you know, to get a great many volunteers from the United States. But
                  that power, as we learn from the latest files, is in constant expectation of an
                  invasion by England; and as long as such danger threatens them at home, we cannot
                  hope for any large number of men from that quarter.
               "That Gatewood cannot be induced by ordinary means to aid us has been rendered
                  certain, or you may be sure I should not have approached you with a proposition
                  which I know must be more or less revolting to your better feelings. Since
                  Americans are to form our invading army, of course they will have to be commanded
                  by one of their own countrymen. And now comes the difficulty: the officer selected
                  for this purpose—the only one whose services we were able to secure, but who, I
                  doubt not, is the best qualified of them all—not long ago had a collision with a
                  party of Gatewood's men, which resulted in the capture of a number of them. The
                  officer, Colonel Magee, thinking—whether justly or not I am unable to say—that
                  they had been engaged in some unlawful acts, caused them to be tied up and
                  flogged. As soon as Gatewood heard of this transaction he swore eternal hostility
                  to that officer."
               "What else could have been expected?" said the Señorita, becoming interested in
                  the story. "I am sure Captain Gatewood's spirit in thus resenting such an insult
                  to his men is much to be admired."
               "Since that occurrence," the Padre went on without heeding her remark, "every plan
                  of conciliation has been tried on him in vain. The justice of our cause has
                     been explained to him; he has been
                  plied with promises of reward to himself and his men in the shape of money, lands,
                  and office, but he has invariably repelled them with anger or contempt. Colonel
                  Magee has lately addressed himself to the task of atoning in some measure for his
                  offence, by using his influence in effecting the release of the men on whom he
                  inflicted so degrading a punishment, and who are now in the custody of the United
                  States authorities, awaiting their transportation to the penitentiary—having
                  already been sentenced. Should they be freed by Magee's instrumentality, it is
                  thought Gatewood's active hostility may be neutralized. But that is the extent of
                  our expectations: he will not, even then, assist us: he will only remain, at best,
                  an idle spectator of our operations."
               "Now, uncle," said the Señorita as soon as the Padre had paused, "I have purposely
                  refrained from interrupting you, hoping you would make your object clear. Have you
                  finished?"
               "Yes—at least I thought so—that is, I supposed you understood me."
               "Not at all, uncle; and if you will but deign to be a little more explicit, you
                  shall have my thanks. It was but a moment ago that you said I misinterpreted your
                  meaning, and I have no idea of so soon subjecting myself to the same charge. I own
                  that my failure to comprehend you may be due to dulness; but to show you that it
                  is not owing to want of attention, I recollect distinctly your last words bearing
                  on the subject of my supposed influence with the Captain, and what you would have
                  me do in the matter. I can quote your exact words. (All you have spoken since,
                  though interesting enough as matter of fact, does not, so far as I can see, affect
                  me personally; nor does it indicate what you wish my course to be.) You said then
                  that his feelings towards me must be availed of to secure his co-operation. Now,
                  pray tell me precisely the meaning of that—of course, taking into consideration
                  what I told you before—that to love him was impossible."
               Up to this point in the colloquy, the Padre had voluntarily stood on his usual
                  familiar level with the Señorita: he had purposely refrained from elevating
                  himself upon any such vantage-ground as age, guardianship, and his sacred calling
                  gave him over her. It may have been that he hoped and preferred to convince her
                  while they stood on this equal footing. It is more probable, however, when we
                  consider the character of the man, that those advantages had been kept in the
                  background for much the same reason that a skilful general reserves his best
                  forces not only during the skirmishing, but until the crisis has arrived,—when he
                  brings them up in full force, often to his opponent's discomfiture. Moreover, his
                  Reverence was a little nettled that she should avail herself of his condescension
                  thus to display her wilfulness,—as he chose to think it,—and a certain air of what
                  he took to be downright effrontery.
               "Isabella," he now began, on this new ground,—transformed almost instantly from
                  the free and easy companion that he had assumed to be, into the old man, the
                  priest, and the protector that he was of right,—"your affectation of ignorance and
                  innocence compels me to tell you what you are doubtless not aware of—that I am
                  acquainted with your past career as a belle. That, although I have not seen you, I
                  have heard of you through others,—leading your captives in triumphal procession
                  for days, weeks, or months, according to the estimated value of the conquest, then
                  throwing them lightly aside, humbled, blighted, and still in chains. Need I remind
                  you how artfully you have, a hundred times, thrown out the lure of a look, a
                  smile, or a word, to the unsuspecting youth, who else had never come within the
                  sphere of your attraction? Of the fatal whirlpool pool which you kept ever in motion about you,
                  invisible to your blinded victims, and felt by them only when too late? Need I
                  recall the especial delight you have so often taken in seducing young men from the
                  side of the faithful maidens to whom they were plighted, and to whom, but for you,
                  they would have been happily wedded? And yet with all this human ruin about you,
                  you could smile, and feast, and dance, and revel—ay, and pray to your God—no, not
                  to your god, for that was heartless Fashion, but to the one God in
                  heaven—as though, instead of pangs, you had been the dispenser of blessings in the
                  circles where you moved. So, you schemed, and plotted, and played the
                  hypocrite—and for what? Merely to gratify your personal vanity—and this, but for a
                  moment; for such conduct could only make for you, among those whose good opinion
                  alone is worth securing—the true and virtuous—to say the least, a very
                  questionable reputation. Such, then, was the stake for which you were so eager to
                  play a game at once cruel to others and dangerous to yourself. Yet now, when the
                  glorious ambition presents of serving your country by practising, for a little
                  season, the same course toward a single individual, you can plead, in excuse, that
                  it would shock your moral sensibilities and all your nice womanly feelings! To be
                  sure, you did not say this in so many words, but it is plain enough you could have
                  had no other meaning."
               His Reverence having said his say, paused for an answer. It was, however, very
                  evident that he had mistaken the character of the girl with whom he was dealing.
                  Instead of showing signs of penitence, as he quite expected she would on hearing
                  this sharp rebuke and this formidable exposition—bursting into tears, and then
                  falling impulsively at his feet, craving his forgiveness in his spiritual as well
                  as his social capacity—she did nothing of the sort; but, after listening to him
                  throughout, apparently unmoved either by the severity of his remarks or the bitter
                  tone in which they were expressed, she calmly said:
               "Uncle, while I confess, to my shame, that too much of what you have said is true
                  in spirit, I must explain wherein you have been entirely too hard on your niece.
                  Now, I don't mean to doubt for a moment that you have heard all this; but I am
                  very sorry you could bring yourself to believe such a story of me. My conduct in
                  society has been most grossly misrepresented to you—from what motive I scorn to
                  conjecture, as I scorn to ask, and indeed care not to know, the source whence the
                  damaging gossip came. I have never gone further than to array, in all the
                  attractiveness which I could summon, such charms as nature gave me, and to display
                  them before those I met, perhaps without due regard to consequences. But as to
                  that aggressive policy of deliberate conquest with which you charge me, I have
                  never been guilty of it—never. I confess that I have set my tongue to honeyed
                  phrases, my lips have coined their sweetest smile, my eyes have looked their
                  sweetest looks, hoping—cruelly if you choose—that victims would fall at my feet,
                  and knowing full well the pangs that I caused the while; but I uttered no false
                  words—did no false acts in all my career—and never once have I, as you have
                  accused me, attempted to lure a lover from his plight; that, I would
                  scorn to do.
               "Such is a truthful picture of my career in the gay cities of Mexico—the capital
                  included—where so much attention was lavished on me by those who petted, and as I
                  freely own, spoiled me too. I do not ask or expect you to pardon even these
                  violations of sincerity, trivial though they are in comparison with those you have
                  held me guilty of: I know they were wrong. Yet is it due not only to myself but to
                  you, to say that, if you knew what caused all this—if you could read the secret which rankled in
                  my bosom and drove me to such a course, with the hope of temporary relief, though
                  I must say the relief did not come—you could not find it in your heart to heap on
                  me reproaches which otherwise I might well deserve."
               "Why, Isabella," said the Padre, whose expression, from being stern, had suddenly
                  become deeply touched with compassion—for he really loved his niece—"I never heard
                  a hint of anything of the kind: I always thought you a gay and heartless
                  flirt."
               "And so did others," was the reply; "nor do I wonder much. Heaven knows I tried to
                  appear so. As to my secret, of course you never heard of that. There is only one
                  person in the world—if, indeed, even that person is living—who knows of it, or, so
                  far as I am aware, so much as suspects it.
               "But, uncle," she added, after a pause, "there is, just now, so much pity in your
                  face,—so different from what was to be seen there a few moments ago,—that I begin
                  to feel like laying bare my heart to you; partly that you may never make me such a
                  proposition as you have made to-day, and partly that you may afford me, if
                  possible, some spiritual comfort."
               "Certainly, Isabella: by all means do so. I think it quite time I should learn
                  something of your life during the years you were separated from me, since it seems
                  I know nothing of it—at least so little as to have grossly wronged you."

                     —As You Like It.
                     
                  
               
               "DO you remember, uncle," the Señorita began, "when those brave
                  Americans—Nolan's men—were marched into San Antonio, as prisoners, ten years
                  ago?"
               "Certainly I do. I saw them enter the plaza under guard, with their hands tied
                  behind them."
               And you know how much father thought of Nolan, who so often risked his life, and
                  at last lost it, in laying the foundation of our liberties? Well, father took
                  me—child though I was—to the plaza to see them. I think, however, I could have
                  seen only one of them. At any rate, I have no recollection whatever of the others.
                  That one was quite a youth; and although he was ragged—for he had been captured
                  nearly a year before—and his beautiful hair was tangled and matted from long
                  neglect, I thought at once he was the handsomest man, both in face and form, I had
                  ever seen.
               "While father held me by the hand, I stood in front of the stranger, as he sat
                  himself on a stone to rest, and, without knowing what I did, stared at him in
                  silent admiration. At length, when I saw that my father was engaged in
                  conversation with one of the other prisoners, I could not resist the temptation to
                  slip my hand out of his and steal away from him into the young man's lap. He
                  seemed to have taken possession of my very soul, and I could think of nothing else. I asked him his name. He told me
                  in the richest tones, and I blushed as I told him mine. It did not at first occur
                  to me even to pity him. Indeed, I should have thought—had I thought at all about
                  it—myself the more pitiable of the two.
               "At last, while longing to have him put his arm around me and caress me, and
                  wondering why he did not,—thinking him a cold, unloving creature,—I saw that his
                  hands were tied tight behind him. The tears then rushed to my eyes—and to his,
                  too, as I vainly tried to unloose the cords that bound him. Seeing the condition
                  of his hair, I took the comb from my head and combed out his tangled tresses of
                  gold. I knew nothing of what was going on around me until I was awakened from my
                  childish dream of—well, I know not what it was, since it could not have been love
                  at that tender age, I suppose,—by the guard tearing him away from me, to resume
                  their weary tramp to the distant provinces, where the mine or the dungeon awaited
                  them all. I watched them as they filed on through the town. He looked back once,
                  with a long gaze, at us—at me, I fondly hoped it was—and the moment
                  he disappeared around the street-corner I rushed into my father's arms and burst
                  into tears, quite regardless of the crowd. I wept the whole way home, and fretted
                  myself into a fever, of which I was ill for weeks, and which came near bringing me
                  to my grave.
               "The prisoners were marched to Chihuahua; and my father, who feared they would be
                  put to death, embraced every opportunity to learn their fate. It would have been
                  vain for him, belonging, as he did, to the liberal party, to make any efforts for
                  their release: it would have been far worse than vain—it would have made their
                  release altogether hopeless. For more than two years they were kept in prison
                  without a trial; and when at last they were arraigned, the evidence against them
                  was found to be so very slight that the judge ordered them to be set at liberty.
                  But Salcedo, who commanded the northern provinces, remanded them immediately to
                  prison, and sent a copy of the proceedings to the King of Spain.
               "Three years afterwards a royal decree was received, ordering that the judge who
                  had released them should be removed from office, and that one out of every five of
                  them should be put to death. As there were only ten at first, and as one had since
                  died, it was decided, after much debate, that but one should be executed. After
                  being caused to kneel around a drum, on which stood a tumbler and dice, the nine
                  were all blindfolded and made to throw by turns—the one throwing the least number
                  to be the victim. I recollect so well when father read aloud to us the account of
                  it from the gazette he had received, which gave the sad details of the affair.
               "At this time I was fourteen years of age, and the image which had at first sight,
                  six years before, taken such complete possession of my fancy, so far from fading
                  away with time, had become more vivid to me than ever, whether dreaming or musing;
                  and I waked at last to the consciousness that the intervening years had changed
                  the pity of childhood into love,—which, hopeless though it seemed, was all in all
                  to me—constantly occupying my thoughts and shaping all my visions of happiness;
                  for, that I could be happy in the love of any other seemed to me utterly
                  impossible.
               "Following this minute description of the arrangement for throwing the dice, came
                  the name of each and the respective numbers thrown. Of course I knew but one name
                  of them all. It stood very far down on the list, and I thought my father, as he
                  read, would never get to it; and yet when he came to it, how I feared the result!
                  The first man had thrown very low numbers—three and one; the next five or six did much
                  better; and when he read, at last, the name of my favorite, my heart throbbed, my
                  brain grew dizzy, and I almost sank to the floor for fear his throw would be lower
                  than the lowest, and so seal his doom; but when it was announced four and one, I could scarcely refrain from clapping my hands for
                  joy. The poor fellow was executed.
               "The remaining eight were sentenced to ten years' imprisonment—making altogether
                  eighteen dreary years. They were sent to different prisons; and our country—as you
                  know, uncle—is cursed with so many of those gloomy piles that we could never learn
                  where the poor victims were.
               "Soon afterwards I went to the beautiful city of Queretaro, and entered the
                  convent-school. That unfortunate prisoner was still the burden of my thoughts. I
                  resolved if possible, to search every cell in the city-prison. The fathers who had
                  charge of our school often visited the prisoners to give them such spiritual aid
                  as they required. I accompanied them whenever they would suffer me to do so. There
                  was one good old father—Father Cabaso,—with whom I was a great favorite,—who
                  always allowed me to go with him. The girls, as well as the teachers, and indeed
                  all my friends, thought—and it was surely not unreasonable they should—that it was
                  a strange freak for a young lady to frequent such forlorn and filthy places: I but
                  smiled when they so expressed themselves, and let it pass as a freak,—telling no
                  one that it was really the sole aim and hope of my life.
               "As soon as we were fairly inside the walls, and the Padre had left me and sought
                  the cell of some lone sufferer, I always threw off my naturally grave manner, and
                  commenced humming strange tunes, and tripping along the dark and narrow passages,
                  intending that the sentinels and keepers should thus be made to think me some
                  half-witted thing not worth their watching; and, as they knew moreover that I came
                  with the priest, they put but little restraint on my movements; so, I soon had the
                  run of the prison. In this way, I had an opportunity, in the course of several
                  months, to peep, between the bars, into nearly all the cells, one by one, and get
                  a glimpse of their inmates. Besides, I would always get Father Cabaso to tell me
                  the names of those he visited.
               "One day, when far in the interior of the vast prison, I somehow became
                  bewildered, and, I suppose, in trying to make my way out, took a wrong turn and
                  went still further into the mazes of the building. The deeper I penetrated the
                  greater grew my confusion, and I began to be seriously alarmed lest I should never
                  get out, but perish in those gloomy recesses. You may know, there was no acting
                  now—no humming snatches of song, as heretofore,—no tripping along the stony
                  floors,—no playing the idiot-girl. All this was forgotten: nay, I should have
                  started at the least sound of even my own voice: the lightest echo of my footsteps
                  along those dreary vaults made my heart throb wildly and my flesh creep with the
                  chill of fear.
               "At length I found myself in a low arched passage. This was so dark and damp that,
                  when I recollected I had descended several flights of stairs in my eagerness to
                  find some outlet from the dreadful place, I concluded that I must be then far
                  under ground. Here I stopped, for the first time, and listened breathlessly,
                  hoping to hear a voice, or at least a noise of some kind from one of the
                  apartments over my head, or from some one passing in the street—forgetting how
                  thick were the dismal walls. Not a sound of any kind could I hear.
               "My eyes, during the time I was standing here, were of course getting gradually
                  accustomed to the darkness. I could at
                  first distinguish nothing whatever; then, I could see the gray walls around and
                  above me, though still so indistinctly that I thought them some impalpable
                  illusion within the eye itself or upon the brain, until I cautiously put forth my
                  hand and touched the cold hard surface, down which the beaded damps were
                  trickling—each minute being marked by a drop falling sullenly on the chilly floor.
                  Here I stood, with this cheerless timepiece ticking in my ear, trying to
                  distinguish surrounding objects, which were becoming more and more visible, until
                  at length I could see several great iron bars fixed across a loophole in the wall,
                  while two small points of light shone between them, seeming to come through the
                  opposite wall of a cell to whose interior the loophole led. I stepped nearer,
                  resolved to peep, even at such a time, into that hideous place: he
                  might be even there. Scarcely had I done so, when I found that the two points of
                  light, which I had imagined to come from the outer air, were a pair of eyeballs
                  glaring close upon me through the grate. I stood transfixed to the spot. I
                  trembled in every limb, but still gazed, as though spellbound, on those glowering
                  orbs. The next moment, I heard my name come forth from the dungeon before me,
                  distinct enough indeed, but in tones so hollow and unnatural that I screamed at
                  the top of my voice and ran away, well-nigh frenzied with terror. It seemed to me,
                  at the moment, that no mere human eye could have recognized my features in such
                  dense darkness; and as the voice was so unearthly, I thought the whole thing the
                  nightmare of some horrible dream. But when I found my scream did not wake me, I
                  concluded this was no dream indeed, but that supernatural powers were at work in
                  this Stygian air. I had no time then to reflect, as I afterwards did, that eyes
                  long immured in such a place could accommodate themselves even to such Cimmerian
                  darkness as there surrounded me.
               "I rushed at random along the windings of that dismal
                  labyrinth—turning—ascending—descending—wherever there was a way clear before me. I
                  had no object in view but that of motion,—afraid that if I stopped only for a
                  moment, a cold ghastly hand would be laid upon my bare shoulder—an icy breath
                  would din dreadful words into my ear. Although I could not have been thus occupied
                  longer than a few minutes at most, it seemed an age. But my scream had been heard
                  by those who had already descended to those subterranean depths in search of me;
                  for Father Cabaso having missed me, had given the alarm. The faint sound of
                  approaching steps and the dim glimmer of a lantern sufficed to stay my wild flight
                  from the spectre of my terrified fancy. No sooner was I assured of aid at hand
                  than I swooned away. When I recovered, I found myself in one of the upper
                  apartments, with Father Cabaso bending over me. He very naturally attributed my
                  completely unnerved condition solely to my getting lost in the dreary mazes below;
                  and as that was amply sufficient to account for it, I did not then choose to
                  enlighten him further. As soon as we reached the convent, however, I told him all
                  about my prison adventure—who I thought the prisoner was, and how, years before, I
                  had chanced to meet with him in my native town. Then, falling at his feet, I
                  implored him, in the name of heaven and humanity, to visit, if possible, the
                  suffering victim.
               "Father Cabaso had a soft heart, and was easily persuaded on this occasion.
                  Indeed, to do him justice, I cannot suppose he would have required any persuasion,
                  but only a simple statement of the facts. I thought, however, in my anxiety, that
                  a show of interest on my part—as I knew I had influence with him—would be the
                  safer plan—at least, could do no harm. He returned to the prison immediately, and,
                  on questioning the keeper of the
                  underground cells, he admitted—evidently with much reluctance—that there was a
                  political convict there, whom no one but himself ever visited, and he only to
                  place his food and drink at the grate.
               "The good Father expressed great indignation that the priests had never been told
                  of such an inmate, that they might administer to his comfort. The inhuman keeper
                  replied that, as the prisoner was a heretic as well as a traitor, he supposed the
                  holy men would, of course, take no interest in him,—and so he had never mentioned
                  him in their presence. There he had been, in that dreadful hole, for three
                  years!
               "After persuasion and threats had alike failed to secure his admission to the
                  prisoner, the Father succeeded at last in gaining entrance by bribing the keeper
                  with a large sum of money, which I gave him for the purpose,—having sold some of
                  my jewels to procure it. When he entered the cell, he found, by aid of a lantern,
                  that starvation and inhuman treatment, and their necessary result—a low form of
                  fever—had so far done their work on the unfortunate victim, that he could live but
                  a few days longer if allowed to remain in that condition.
               "Relieving his immediate wants as well as he could amid the discouraging
                  surroundings, Father Cabaso next set himself about the task—and a very formidable
                  one it was—of influencing the authorities to allow the prisoner to be sent to the
                  city hospital. At length, after a great many interviews with the Governor and the
                  Captain-General, and much importunity and earnest solicitation, assisted by the
                  certificate of an influential physician,—that the prisoner's life might be still
                  saved by the course proposed, but that otherwise he must die in a very short
                  time,—the Padre carried his point, and the poor prisoner was transferred to the
                  hospital.
               "When I first visited him there, although he recognized me immediately on my
                  entrance,—putting forth from the couch where he lay his thin, trembling hand, and
                  smiling,—I could not for the life of me bring myself to believe, at once, that
                  this was the beau-ideal of my childhood,—and, indeed, if the truth must be told,
                  of all my intervening years. Unfortunately, I had not thought very seriously of
                  the sad changes which his trying situation must necessarily have wrought in his
                  appearance. It may have been very thoughtless—or if you choose, very foolish—in
                  me, but I really half expected to see him the handsome hero that he was six years
                  before; for his image had been kept as fresh in my memory during all those years
                  as it was on the first and only day I had seen him. I was ill prepared, therefore,
                  as you may well know, for the shock which I was destined to receive on this
                  memorable occasion.
               "On my first look at his face, I stood and stared at him, much as I had done in
                  the plaza at San Antonio; but, oh,—except the pity which I felt in both
                  instances,—with what different feelings! There was not a single trace of his
                  beautiful self. He was so emaciated, that the skin seemed resting directly against
                  the bones, with no intervening flesh. His eyes shone with a sort of phosphorescent
                  light; and, as the pupils had not yet contracted from the unnatural size which
                  they had attained in the dark of his dungeon, I seemed, while gazing into their
                  depths, to be looking into a cavern, where I could see a soul struggling to be
                  free from its fleshy shred. Through those enlarged windows I could almost imagine
                  I saw all the secret thoughts of the unhappy man.
               "Despite the fever which wore him, there was no trace of color in his hollow
                  cheek. His long beard was unkempt and scrawny. His hair had lost, in that vile den
                  of blackness, its sunny hue and sheen as completely as if directly dependent for these on day's glorious orb. It was
                  dry, harsh, and frizzled—like hair that has been shrivelled dead by a whisk of
                  flame: it looked as though, if shaken, it would fly off into dust. Indeed, the
                  mould of death seemed to rest over hair, beard, and face alike. Oh! as I saw all
                  this, I wondered how he could be alive.
               "He still continued to hold out his hand, and seeing that I did not come forward
                  at once—doubtless little knowing himself how fearfully he was changed—he called my
                  name in a subdued and gentle tone. His voice, as he did so, seemed to have lost
                  much of that appalling hollowness which had so shocked me when echoed from the
                  walls of the dungeon, and in it alone, of all that was before me, could I
                  recognize any trace of my hero. His calling my name broke the spell by which I was
                  bound to the spot where I stood, and I rushed at once to his side.
               "It is useless to say how faithfully I nursed him through the long weary days and
                  nights during which his life hung on a frail thread. He seemed, all this time, to
                  grow neither better nor worse. When, at last, the scale turned a little in his
                  favor, how anxiously did I watch for the first dawning on his face of those manly
                  beauties of old, which I knew the recovery of his health must needs give him back.
                  One by one they came: but, oh, how slowly!—at first, scarcely to be seen,—then,
                  flitting away and returning like an escaped bird loth to be retaken,—but remaining
                  longer and longer, each time, till settled at last.
               "But it was weeks after this, before he could even rise from his couch; and as
                  soon as he did so, the cruel wretches began to talk of putting him back into that
                  horrible cell,—as though, indeed, they had suffered him to be taken out of it for
                  the sole purpose of prolonging his life, that they might have the delight of
                  torturing him again, instead of the trouble of burying him.
               "It was too dreadful to think of! To see those eyes that had but just got used to
                  the upper light, to which the all-wise God had so well adapted them, go down again
                  to those hideous shades; that manly form, which He had made erect to walk His
                  beautiful earth, to be now consigned to the narrow bounds of a living tomb,—there
                  to be dwarfed, and shrivelled, and distorted from the proud comeliness of the
                  image of God!
               "I therefore proposed to him—desperate though the plan seemed, in his weak
                  condition—to attempt an escape from the hospital before he should be
                  transferred—offering to aid him all in my power. He at first refused,—saying, he
                  would rather go back to prison and run all its fearful risks, than implicate me in
                  so grave a political offence. But that very night he lay awake and concocted a
                  plan, in which, although I was to give my assistance, it was not at all probable
                  that I should ever be detected.
               "The guard of the hospital was to be bribed to let him pass, about sunset. By the
                  aid of a friend, he was to be disguised as a Mexican citizen, that the corrupted
                  guard might have a plausible pretext for not stopping him as he should pass out.
                  The hospital was in the eastern suburbs; he was to make his way on foot, until he
                  had cleared all the houses. He was then to turn off into the woods and secrete
                  himself. When night should come, in order to elude his pursuers, he was to make a
                  circuit around the city and enter on the side opposite the point at which he had
                  left it. I was to be in waiting for him at the public fountain,—which, as you
                  know, is near the western suburb,—and guide him to the house of a faithful friend
                  whose kind offices I was to secure to shelter him under her roof until he should
                  regain his full strength. Then, when all pursuit and all hope of re-capturing him
                  should have subsided, his difficulties would have but fairly commenced: he was
                     to attempt the herculean task of
                  making his way to the United States, through Texas, on foot—a distance of fifteen
                  hundred miles—travelling only by night.
               "This plan was carried out. I had sold all my remaining jewels, and had given him
                  the gold they brought, to bear him on his dreary journey. Whether he ever
                  succeeded in reaching his native land or not, I have never been able to learn; nor
                  do I even know whether he is now alive. I never saw him after the night I guided
                  him to the house where he was to sojourn. A vague rumor had, somehow, got abroad
                  that he had never left the city. I was suspected of having indirectly aided in his
                  escape from the hospital, and was therefore closely watched day and night by the
                  official spies,—so that an interview would have been extremely hazardous to
                  both.
               "I may as well say, however, that, while in the hospital, as soon as he had begun
                  fairly to recover from his prostrate condition and to be himself again, he had
                  told me of his love; and I suppose it is almost useless to add that it was fully
                  returned.
               "For weeks and months my suspense was dreadful, wholly ignorant, as I was, of his
                  fate,—whether he had made good his way out of the miserable country, or had
                  perished of cold or starvation in the long stretch of mountain and desert which he
                  had to traverse; or whether some of the many bands of robbers that infest the way,
                  had plundered and murdered him; ;or whether—and this would indeed have been the
                  worst fate of all—he was retaken on the route, perhaps just as he was getting
                  home, and plunged once more into the gloom of some dungeon.
               "When I was sent to New Orleans to finish my education, I used every effort to
                  ascertain his fate. Among other means, I advertised in the gazettes of the
                  country, requesting to be informed, by any one who might know, whether or not he
                  was still living—and where. But I never could learn a word of him; and when the
                  time came to return home I was still in the depths of despair.
               "Up to this time, I had not recovered my flesh and strength and my olden flow of
                  spirits, which, from the day of our parting, I began to lose. My eye had grown
                  dim, they said; the color had left my cheek, and I could not enjoy the society
                  even of my dearest friends. It seemed, indeed, that the longer I lived the more
                  miserable I became.
               "At length came an invitation from my aunt, to visit her at the Capital. It seemed
                  indeed like the very mockery of woe to accept such a bid: yet I did accept it. The
                  truth is, grief had by this time told so terribly on my health, that I felt I must
                  do something to divert my mind from brooding over these untold sorrows—or I must
                  die; and as for death, I doubt not you will believe me, uncle, when I tell you I
                  knew full well I was not fit for that. So, strange as it may seem, I
                  caught eagerly at a season to be spent at the Capital to snatch me from the grave.
                  My dear parents could not fail to see—as, indeed, no one could—that my strength
                  and health were sinking day by day, and they were seriously alarmed; but little
                  did they dream of the cause of my decline. They urged me to go—hoping benefit from
                  the change.
               "My kind father gave me a splendid outfit, and soon I was on my way to the city of
                  Mexico. When I reached it, I plunged at once into its gayeties, and was soon
                  whirling in the vortex of its social splendors. But, uncle, what you have already
                  recounted of my career must have referred to this season at the Capital. Though,
                  as I said, you did me gross wrong in many respects, in others your picture was a
                  true one. Inasmuch, however, as I corrected your misapprehensions at the time you
                  uttered them, I will not here repeat what I then said. Yet I will further
                     explain plain that my sole object
                  was not vanity, as you charged, but the distraction of my wretched thoughts,—and I
                  was only too willing to embrace anything that seemed to promise such
                  a boon. When one of your sex meets with a grievous disappointment of that kind, he
                  is fain to seek the bloody field, even in an unjust cause, and wade in wild
                  carnage—ay, and gloat as he wades. And although his conquests are
                  really achieved to ease the pangs of a stricken heart, they are all set down, to
                  his honor—his name is bruited abroad, and he is made a hero. I have known many
                  such instances. But when woman would strive to forget her broken heart in the
                  bloodless conquest of gay cavaliers, whose wounds are soon healed by other eyes as
                  bright, and other lips perchance as false in the end, she, forsooth,
                  is branded as a heartless flirt.
               "Still, uncle, I know I was wrong. I knew it at the time—and all the time; nor, if
                  it is any comfort to you to hear it, did I escape the just punishment even then;
                  for that season of revel, and dance, and song, and of all that was gay and
                  gorgeous, was, I think, without exception, the most miserable of my whole
                  miserable life.
               "Then came the Revolution; and it was a great relief to me individually, even
                  apart from the hopes which it held out for our freedom. For I now put aside at
                  once my jewels and laces, my wiles and revels, and took my stand by the cheerless
                  couches of our wounded heroes. Nor have I felt, for one moment since, the least
                  desire to return to those empty ways and baubles of fashion. They have lost their
                  attraction, and never more can they have charms for me. And yet you would force
                  them back upon me now—or something most unpleasantly akin to them. And for what?
                  Why—with shame be it said!—that I may wrong one who has proved our benefactor to
                  such degree that our eternal gratitude is due him, instead."
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I have unclasp'd
                           To thee the book even of my secret soul.
                        
                     
                     —Twelfth Night.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
                           But qualify the fires of extreme rage,
                           Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
                        
                     
                     
                        Two Gentlemen of Verona.
                     
                  
               
               
                  THE Señorita recounted her story with much feeling throughout,—so
                  that, by the time she had ended, her heart was filled well-nigh to overflowing
                  with its various emotions. The Padre was really much moved by her recital; but,
                  for policy's sake, not wishing to appear so, he had affected, from beginning to
                  end, an indifference, to the extent, at times, even of appearing bored. This
                  coldness on the part of her relative annoyed her no little; but she was resolved
                  that it should not chill the current of her narrative when once begun. This seemed
                  to flow forth like lava from her breast, where all the elements of her nature—the
                  dross no less than the gold—were molten down together by the heat of a passion
                  which this sad retrospection had rekindled in all its original intensity.
               During the latter part, the Padre was carrying on in his mind a sort of double
                  process. He was not only listening to every word of the fair speaker, but at the
                  same time was thinking what course he should pursue when she should have finished:
                  so that, no sooner had she paused, than he was ready to begin.
               "Isabella," he said, "although this was, beyond all doubt, a case of true love on
                  your part, I can see no very good ground for supposing that the gentleman himself
                  felt more than gratitude. He could scarcely do less than say
                   he loved you, after your unwavering
                  devotion for so many years, crowned by your noble efforts to save his life, by
                  sacrifices, too, which imperilled your own."
               "How, sir, can you be so cruel? It is not so: it cannot be so. Oh, no—no—he loved
                  me!" exclaimed the Señorita, bursting into tears.
               "Well, then," calmly replied the priest, "why has he not visited you since, at San
                  Antonio?"
               "He visit me at San Antonio?" echoed the lady—repressing her tears,
                  plainly with great effort. "Why, uncle, you surely did not hear my story. What
                  would life have been worth had he dared show himself there for a moment?"
               "True!" said the Padre promptly,—seeing his blunder, though nowise disconcerted
                  thereby. "But, at any rate, Isabella, the least he could do would have been to
                  communicate with you, and let you know that he still loved you."
               "Uncle," replied the Señorita, "surely you either have a bad cause, or you plead
                  it very loosely. Have you then forgotten—I know he has not forgotten
                  it—that our tyrants have their swarms of spies, who search every stranger and open
                  every letter that enters the country; and that, had he written, not only would I
                  have been implicated, but my whole family must have shared the fearful
                  consequences?"
               The uncle did not reflect that his niece had probably run, a hundred times a day,
                  over all the pros and cons bearing on this and every
                  kindred subject; and that she must, therefore, have greatly the advantage of him
                  in discussing such questions.
               "Perhaps this is even so. But, Isabella," pursued his Reverence—finding she had
                  got the better of him on these points, and resolved on a diversion to secure his
                  triumph in this controversial arena, upon which, as was made sufficiently evident
                  some time back, he had entered as a special pleader, and not at all for truth's
                  sake—"But, Isabella, I was arguing only on the violent assumption that he is still
                  living,—which, however, I have no idea is really the case. Nor can I conceive how
                  you can so hope against hope. If he attempted his escape by land, the arid wastes
                  that he had to traverse, and the bleak and desolate mountains that lie directly
                  across his track, are obstacles which, even if no savage robbers frequented them,
                  it would be utterly impossible that one in his feeble condition could surmount. On
                  the other hand, should he look to the water for transit and succeed in making his
                  way to the Gulf,—which would be in itself no easy matter,—there would even then
                  not be one chance in a hundred that a ship would be found there to convey him to a
                  friendly shore.
               "No, Isabella," the Padre went on after a pause. "I have little doubt that your
                  friend—or lover, as you choose to call him—has long since succumbed to famine or
                  violence, and that his bones are bleaching somewhere along the thousand miles or
                  more which, in his desperation, he essayed to traverse."
               "Uncle, I cannot think it!" said the Señorita,—the tears starting afresh at the
                  horrible idea. "I have an abiding hope that he escaped."
               "I know you have," the other replied; "and it is just because I do not wish you to
                  hope any longer against hope and drag out your life in one unbroken, bitter
                  disappointment, that I give you the only view which a reasonable being—one not
                  wholly blinded, like yourself, by passion—can take.
               "And now, my dear niece," added his Reverence, more in a tone of soothing
                  compassion than he had before shown, "between the probability, on the one hand,
                  amounting almost to a certainty, that he has perished,—and on the other, the supposition—very reasonable, to say
                  the least—that, if he did escape, he has already led to the altar some one of his
                  fair countrywomen, to atone, in the quiet of domestic happiness for his prolonged
                  and horrible sufferings;—with this view of the case, I must say I think you had
                  much better give up these desperate longings, which can only end in being dashed
                  at last. Should you ever meet with him in the future, I doubt not you will find
                  him exceedingly grateful for your noble efforts in his behalf—but no more. And
                  pray tell me, what comfort could mere gratitude, even the warmest, afford one in
                  your state of mind—craving the intensest love?
               "It amounts to this, then," he continued, after awaiting a reply for a little
                  while, during which she wept, but said not a word: "If he lost his life in his
                  attempt to escape, or afterward, from the exposure to which the attempt subjected
                  him, you can, of course, never hope to see him again this side the grave; while,
                  if he is still living, and wedded to another, you would not, or at least should
                  not, wish ever to meet with him again. Let me advise you, therefore: make up your
                  mind to assume at once the same relative position to the world that you would now
                  occupy had he never lived, or had you never met him. Forget him, or, if you cannot
                  do that, at least think of him only as one who is in the other world, or beyond
                  your reach in this."
               "Uncle," she at length replied, "I do indeed begin to think, with you, that he
                  must have perished; but let me say, you make little impression on me when you
                  intimate that, if still alive, he does not love me. I am quite as certain not only
                  that he loved me then, but that he loves me still, as I am that there is a God in
                  heaven."
               "Well, my child, grant that he did love you, and does love you still, even as
                  devotedly as you believe," said the Padre,—gracefully abandoning his previous
                  position, since, to hold it in the face of a faith so earnest was next to
                  hopeless, "do you not see, nevertheless, that the impossibility of his ever
                  reaching you or of communicating with you,—as you so lately explained, to my
                  entire satisfaction,—would cancel the betrothal, and justify his wedding with some
                  one else, even though he could not love her with the same devotion?"
               "If he is another's," she exclaimed with passion, "then, indeed, I do
                  not wish to meet him ever again. Nor, then, could I bear to mix longer with the
                  world.
               "Oh, uncle!" she cried in her agony, at the thought of that love which she had so
                  long and so fondly cherished, proving at last hopeless, at the same time throwing
                  herself at the Padre's feet and clasping his knees, "I long to retire from this
                  wretched world: it is so full of sin and suffering—love blighted—hopes
                  crushed—-friends murdered! I long for the quiet shades of the convent, where I may
                  forget all but heaven, where such things cannot come."
               "Why may I not go there?" she demanded, looking up pleadingly in his face. "Is
                  there any reason why I should not?"
               "Yes, my child," replied the priest; "the convent is no place for you now. It is
                  intended for such as have no further mission in the outside world."
               "And what have I yet to do or suffer in this groaning world?" she
                  asked. "Tell me—and I will hasten to do and endure my portion, that I may be free
                  to bid such scenes farewell forever."
               "I fear, Isabella," replied the priest, "that you are not the heroine I had hoped
                  you were, when you can allow your ravings over an utterly hopeless passion to
                  neutralize so much that is available in you for good. You seem, in this momentary
                  blindness, to have lost sight of the fact that our bleeding country calls all her
                  true children to her aid. Yea—all—not
                  only such as can strike bloody blows for her freedom, but those, too, who can urge
                  others to strike, who else would but look idly on. Rise, then, above this one
                  private grief," continued the holy man, assisting her from her lowly attitude.
                  "Think of the millions that suffer—of the unborn millions that are yet to suffer,
                  if tyranny be not struck down in our wretched land. Think no more of the convent.
                  Though the desolation of the struggle might never reach your eye in those hushed
                  recesses, nor the shriek of its victims your ear, yet rumors of the strife could
                  not be wholly shut out; and when you heard them there, you would have to nurse the
                  sharp remorse that you shrank from your duty, turned a deaf ear to your country in
                  her sorest need, and selfishly sequestered yourself—leaving your fellow-citizens
                  and friends to breast the merciless torrent without you—yet for you. Then, dry
                  your tears, my child: go to your room, think on what I have said, and I doubt not
                  your cooler reflections will induce you to forgo this folly, and to do all you can
                  for the cause. I doubt not that in the end you will leave no stone unturned to
                  influence this noble Chieftain and his brave fellows to render that aid which I am
                  well convinced is vital to our success. Your duty, not only to your country, but
                  to God, demands this of you; and in so doing, should you commit any peccadillos,
                  think of them lightly: the glorious end we have in view shall justify them all. Or
                  should your conscience whisper you, at any time, that heaven is not fully
                  appeased, you have but to come to me, and confess wherein you doubt, and I will
                  give you free absolution for all."
               Isabella, without making reply, sought her room, leaving her uncle to his
                  meditations on what had passed. Once in the solitude of her own chamber, she began
                  to recall the conversation,—which, indeed, she had little difficulty in doing,
                  inasmuch as every word had been vividly impressed on her mind at the time of its
                  utterance. She dwelt more particularly on what had been said of the painful
                  past—the Padre's theory, namely,—that her lover either had died, or had forgotten
                  her. During the interview—especially the latter part of it—she had well-nigh given
                  him up as forever lost to her in one or the other of those almost equally dreadful
                  modes,—the latter perhaps the more dreadful. But now that she came to think the
                  matter over, her heart clung so yearningly to its memory of him, that she felt it
                  would be the laceration of her very soul to abandon all hope of ever meeting him
                  again—and then not as another's—but all her own—just as in the olden time.
               "If still living and loving me,"—such were her thoughts as she lay on her couch
                  near the window, looking out on the waters of the lake, which, sporting, as they
                  were just then, with the noonday beams, may have aided in inspiring her with the
                  fleeting hope which she now indulged,—"he will surely join our standard on these
                  borders as soon as he hears of this projected invasion. It will be his first
                  chance to reach my home, where he has every reason to suppose I am at this time. I
                  do not wonder in the least that he has never yet attempted to reach it: indeed, I
                  should have been alarmed for him had I heard of his making any such desperate
                  effort heretofore. But if he hears of what is now on foot hereabouts, he surely
                  ought to fly hither from any part of the world. I am certain I would do as much to
                  meet with him. Ah! have I not already done as much?
               "But, then, if his own country is in danger from a foreign foe—as they say it
                  is—would he come then? Could he be expected to leave his country in
                  her time of trial? Ought he to prefer me to his country? Would I prefer him to my country?
                  Why, I would die for my country, if my death could save it. Well, so would I die
                  for him. Their claims seem equal: so, too, are the chances of his
                  coming or not—that is, if he is still alive. But, alas! my uncle says his bones
                  are whitening in the desert!
               "I fear there is indeed no hope. Henceforth, then, must I be in love only with
                  freedom; and if that be torn from me too, and my poor country be made hideous with
                  the sweep of desolation and the clanking of chains, then, with no duty left me to
                  perform in the outer world, the sombre shades of Queretaro's convent may at last
                  receive me, with no danger from the stings of remorse for having neglected my
                  mission."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               
                  
                     
                        He hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
                     
                     
                        Twelfth Night.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I am Cressid's uncle,
                           That dare leave two together: fare you well.
                        
                     
                     
                        All's Well That Ends Well.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        If I help, what do you promise me?
                     
                     
                        All's Well That Ends Well.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        Do't, and thou hast the one-half of my heart.
                     
                     
                        Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  FOR reasons best known to himself—though I suspect policy formed
                  their basis—several days elapsed before Gatewood again visited the lake. By this
                  time all traces of the impression which the conversation with her uncle had
                  produced upon the Señorita, were erased—at least to outward seeming. She received
                  the Captain just as she would have done had she never told the priest her sad
                  story and heard his discouraging comment thereon, or his expressed opinion which
                  led to the recital of that story; namely, that their guest was smitten with her
                  charms. Even under ordinary circumstances it would have been a debatable question
                  whether or not she would have been justifiable in repelling him by the coldness of
                  her manner, on an intimation received from a third party of near kinship, that the
                  Captain looked upon her as dearer than a mere friend. But, taking into
                  consideration how much she owed this stranger—how much they all owed him—such
                  restraint would not have been impolite merely—but rude and ungrateful. It would be
                  ample time, surely, when he himself should make known to her with his own lips,
                  any feeling which he might entertain warmer than friendship—it would surely be
                  time enough then to reveal her true sentiments in the matter.
               So the Captain's visit passed off without the least stiffness or restraint on the
                  part of any. The Padre,—after the all-engrossing subject of politics had been
                  exhausted,—like the man of varied reading and observation that he was, made
                  himself agreeable on the many topics which came up, failing not, as he proceeded,
                  to glean from his well-informed guest facts, both useful and entertaining,
                  touching the history and condition of his own country. Isabella proved herself an
                  appreciative listener; though not in that passive capacity alone was she content
                  to contribute to the general entertainment,—but occasionally unfolded from her
                  well-stored mind such glimpses of knowledge concerning the themes under discussion
                  as gave earnest of her mental wealth.
               From this time forth, the Captain visited these agreeable strangers every day or
                  two, and at length scarcely a day passed that he did not seek their society. In a
                     month more he may be said to have
                  almost made it his home; and, to all appearance, never was guest domiciliated in a
                  way more agreeable not only to himself but likewise to his entertainers.
               At length he ventured, at intervals, to make the Señorita certain
                  presents—trifling, at first, to be sure, though all very handsome of their
                  kind—which he doubtless had peculiar facilities for procuring from New Orleans. He
                  began with such as he thought would contribute to her amusement and diversion; for
                  he naturally judged that, in her situation, time must pass but tardily. These were
                  chess, backgammon, cards, et cetera. Then, there must needs be some one to play
                  with her. This want he, of course, was at no loss to supply—and that, too, very
                  far short of the Crescent City. At another time, he brought a splendid hammock,
                  and hung it himself picturesquely beneath the trees. Soon afterwards he brought
                  certain fruits of the chase—not such, indeed, as were either meet or meat for the
                  table; for to supply the strangers with such was, with him, an every-day
                  matter—but beautifully ornamented skins, taken from wild animals which he had
                  killed with his own hand. He well knew that the Spaniards and their descendants
                  were a lazy people, fond of taking things calmly and coolly, and much given to
                  lolling about in free and easy style. So, these skins,—which, after being tanned,
                  he had caused to be tastefully garnished, most probably by some of the women who
                  frequented the camp—soon took their places beneath the trees, in the immediate
                  vicinity of the suspended hammock. One of them had been taken from a black bear,
                  through whose skull Gatewood had thought it best to send a pistol-ball, by way of
                  assisting Grim, who was paying his respects to the powerful creature's throat: for
                  this bear was so unusually large, that, for once, the hunter was afraid that
                  doughty canine might not be able to hold his own in the struggle.
               The two remaining robes were composed, each, of a half-dozen skins—the one, of
                  tiger-cats—the other, of leopard-cats. These beautiful animals—presenting the
                  brightest spots and stripes that can be conceived—differ, in no respect, from the
                  Bengal tiger and the African leopard, excepting, of course, that they are much
                  smaller—as indeed the adjunct implies—and proportionately less formidable, though,
                  still, next to the panther, the most formidable animal in that region.
               And here beneath the trees might often be seen a lounging trio: the Señorita
                  swinging in listless repose in her tasselled hammock, while the Padre and the
                  Captain were reclining near on their respective robes,—the weather, even in
                  winter, being seldom such as to drive them to the shelter of the house. Then again
                  the guest would challenge the lady to cards or backgammon, and they would sit on
                  the robes and play by the hour.
               One day, Gatewood brought his hostess a very welcome gift in the shape of a
                  guitar, not only deftly constructed and exceedingly comely to look on, but of
                  passing richness of tone. On this she often accompanied herself, singing some
                  Spanish ballad, usually of the patriotic sort, and invariably composed in a
                  plaintive strain. Sometimes the Chief would give the aid of his deep voice,
                  proving himself no contemptible singer,—though he usually refrained from joining
                  her, vastly preferring, he said, that her tones alone should 
                     he
                     be
                   heard. This admiration may have shown somewhat his partiality as a
                  lover, yet it proved likewise his good taste, for, truth to say, there were but
                  few who could excel the Señorita in quality of singing, while her touch upon the
                  guitar was something exquisite, and to be thought of long after the tones she
                  evoked had died away.
               She did not see proper to refuse any of these presents, in great measure, doubtless, because a refusal might
                  tend to wound the feelings of the donor, which, for reasons already sufficiently
                  dwelt upon, she was loth to do. When, at last, however, he brought her a beautiful
                  and costly set of jewelry, she would not accept it.
               "Captain Gatewood, I know, will excuse me," she said to him on the occasion of his
                  proffering it, "when I tell him that, on the breaking out of the war in my native
                  country, I parted with all my jewelry for two reasons: In the first place, I
                  wanted to aid the patriots to the amount it would bring in currency; and then I
                  did not feel as though I ought to display about my person such emblems of gayety
                  while there was so much suffering among my friends, and so much of their precious
                  blood was being shed. I therefore made a resolution that I would indulge in no
                  display of the kind while the dreadful struggle lasted."
               To such reasonable grounds for rejecting his offer, the Captain could scarcely
                  have found it in his heart to object, even had he been looking for some cause of
                  quarrel with his fair hostess,—which, I am confident, the reader will believe me
                  when I say he was far from doing.
               It is worthy of note, perhaps, that the Captain, with all his presents to the
                  lady, never once gave her a single book, although such a gift would
                  probably—taking all things into consideration—have been more appropriate, as it
                  would certainly have been more appreciated, than any other. Now, the truth is, a
                  present of books was the first thing he thought of and noted down while sending
                  his orders to the city. But, on second sober thought, he argued within himself,
                  that, even as it was, he would find difficulties enough in the way of winning the
                  Señorita, and that with agreeable books as his rivals (himself to introduce them,
                  too!) he would not stand half the chance he otherwise might do, to gain her
                  affections. So, the many books which he had at first set down—very interesting
                  ones, too—were erased from the list, and he selfishly confined his orders to such
                  articles as she should be, in a measure, constrained to share with him, to the end
                  that she might enjoy them herself.
               While these two were getting into the way of conversing, singing, and gaming
                  together, the Padre was, somehow, getting—though not quite so gradually—into the
                  way of going daily into town, to learn the news, not only for his own
                  gratification, he said, but that his niece also might be properly informed of what
                  was transpiring in the busy world, from which fate had so signally cut them both
                  off. The Señorita thought it not altogether the right thing that he who was now as
                  a father to her, should leave her so much with the stranger. Once, she went so far
                  as to remonstrate gently with him touching the matter. He, in explanation of his
                  seemingly negligent conduct, represented to her how, during Magee's and Bernardo's
                  absence, the entire duty and responsibility of looking after the interests of the
                  cause had been devolved upon his surpliced shoulders. How there were often tidings
                  to be gathered in town, on which immediate action must be taken. How there were
                  daily arrivals there of persons from the United States, whom it was absolutely
                  necessary that he should see, as temporary head of the concern, in order to
                  expedite the organization of the impending campaign. And so forth and so on.
               These various excuses—and it is perhaps not too much to say, that, had a hundred
                  others been needed to carry the holy man's end, they would all have been
                  forthcoming—seemed to Isabella so plausible that she never again ventured to
                  trouble him on that score. Now, the simple truth is, his Reverence—so far as any
                  or all the above pleas for thus unseasonably absenting himself were concerned— need not have gone into Natchitoches
                  oftener than once a week, at most. His real object—to his shame, cloth and all, be
                  it said (cloth in particular)—was not only to throw the two together as much as
                  possible, without the restraint of his presence, but also to make Gatewood's
                  company—since she had no other—well-nigh indispensable to his niece, to the end
                  that the love-masked petard, which he supposed would some day inevitably hoist the
                  Captain, might not be prematurely exploded to the infinite detriment of the
                  cause.
               In justice to the Señorita, we would say here, once for all, that although she was
                  by no means blameless in this matter, there is much to be urged in extenuation of
                  her conduct. Here is a young lady accustomed, all her life, not only to the very
                  best society, but likewise to all those means afforded by wealth to make the
                  heavy-winged hours glide pleasantly away. She suddenly finds herself transported,
                  by the fortunes of war, from such luxurious scenes, and set down in the midst of a
                  howling wilderness. As though this was not in itself a hard enough blow of fate,
                  she is next deserted by those who alone could have made her existence tolerable
                  under such trying circumstances— for none of my readers will, I hope, for a moment
                  suppose that the two old Mexican servants, steeped as they were in ignorance and
                  superstition, could do more than supply her mere bodily wants. Here, too, is a
                  young,—or, at most, a middle-aged man,—who is trying his best to make her time
                  pass pleasantly. He is intelligent, handsome, agreeable; nay, more—he is, so far
                  as she can judge, and for aught she has ever heard to the contrary, a man of noble
                  impulses. And even more than that, again,—more, at least, to her,—he has saved
                  herself and her dearest friends from a tragic fate.
               What then was she to do? Was she very much to blame, think you really, for merely
                  giving him a most capital chance to fall in love with her, if he was so
                  disposed?
               And even after she found out—not, indeed, by word of mouth, but by the more
                  subtile test of look and manner—that this was already even so, should she be very
                  harshly censured that she did not, even then, do that which would at once have
                  driven him from her, and have thrown her back again on her own slender resources
                  for whiling away the weary hours? More than once he had absented himself for a day
                  or two, and she thought, each time, that the late evening hour, which always
                  brought her uncle back to break her solitude, would never come.
               Is it to be wondered, even that, once or twice, when he introduced the subject of
                  love in a general way, and she had good reason to think he designed giving it
                  presently a personal turn, that he might learn his fate once for all,—is it matter
                  of wonder, I say, that she averted the crisis by abruptly changing the subject?
                  Thus did she put him off from day to day, from week to week, from month to month,
                  though she must have known, all the time, full well—as woman does—that the
                  will-o'-the-wisp—which, if she had not kindled it and set it a-going, in the first
                  place for his delusion, she had at least taken special care not to extinguish—was
                  leading him, each one of those days, and weeks, and months, still deeper into the
                  slough, where she, even now, intended that, at no very distant day, she would
                  leave him in his despair.
               At length, however, one moonlight night, when they sat under the trees as
                  usual,—the Padre having early sought his couch on the plea of weariness,—Gatewood
                  opened the subject so abruptly, and, from his manner of doing it, seemed so firmly
                  resolved to be heard then and there, that she was in a measure obliged to allow
                  him to proceed.
               "Señorita," he began, "justice to myself, even if you will admit no other plea, absolutely demands that I
                  should tell you before we separate to-night, of the feelings which I have
                  cherished towards you from the moment of our first meeting, and of the hopes to
                  which they have given birth. I have already attempted this more than once; but you
                  have always evaded the matter. I beg of you, as you value my happiness, let there
                  be an end of all this suspense, one way or the other. Let there be no more
                  subterfuge—if I may be allowed the expression—no more parrying of my words, as
                  though you thought them poisoned daggers aimed at your life. But I find I have
                  already told you my secret,—if, indeed, it has been any secret to you from the
                  first. Need I say more? Alas! I find that the fullest heart may be the least
                  eloquent of its precious burden. Just when I hoped my passion would inspire me to
                  plead my cause in befitting language, my tongue is well-nigh paralyzed. But what
                  matters it, Señorita? You well know what my heart would say, though my lips
                  refuse."
               Gatewood, considering how deeply he was smitten, got on with the first two or
                  three sentences of his little petition quite as glibly as he could have expected.
                  But, instead of improving as he warmed with the momentous theme, and pouring
                  forth, at the last, an irresistible torrent of passion, that would, he hoped, bear
                  down every obstacle, he hesitated—stammered—and, indeed, broke down so signally in
                  the end, that he not only became painfully conscious of failure, but fairly
                  trembled with the intensity of his emotion—doubtless made the more intense by
                  being smouldered within for want of the vent of expression. His fiery burst was
                  much like that of the over-laden volcano, which, striving to give vent to the
                  molten mass that burns and burdens it, chokes with very fulness, and sends nothing
                  forth, but heaves and trembles with the workings of the pent-up lava.
               The lady addressed, however,—as was but too evident,—partook of his emotions to a
                  very limited extent only.
               "Captain," she coolly replied, "I will not affect ignorance of what your manner,
                  much more than your language, has told me, not only to-night, but for months. I do
                  not pretend to judge how serious such matters may prove to your sex: it may be
                  that you can throw them off lightly from your hearts, or they may be all in all to
                  you. But I do know that it is a momentous thing for a woman to bestow
                  her heart and her hand. You censure me for putting you off at various times
                  without a hearing. I then knew full well that I could not return your love. Now,
                  do you think it very cruel, that instead of telling you so—as I should have been
                  compelled to do had I spoken then—I changed the subject again and again, that I
                  might have longer time to consider?"
               "Then," said the ardent suitor,—drawing near under the influence of the hope which
                  he thought was implied in her words, and taking her hand gently in his own,—"let
                  me trust that you are ready now to decide what is so essential to my
                  happiness."
               "But," she replied, extricating her hand from his, "what, if I say that, if you
                  insist on an answer now, it must still be adverse? while if you allow me the
                  opportunity of a longer acquaintance, it may be auspicious?"
               "On such terms I am willing to postpone the matter still further," replied
                  Gatewood, fancying he perceived considerable encouragement in her words.
               "But in the meantime," he added, after a pause, "if there is anything I can do,
                  either to win your love or to prove still further my own, let me know, that I may
                  be favored in the one case, or tested in the other."
               Now, it chanced that the Señorita had resolved that if a favorable opportunity
                  should ever present, she would broach
                  the subject of his aiding that cause with which all her interests and all her
                  thoughts were so closely identified; and she was just then planning the best mode
                  of accomplishing it without seeming to rush abruptly into a matter, which, it was
                  but too evident, was one of bargain and sale. She was glad, therefore, that his
                  last remark offered her so good an opening. Nor is it by any means impossible that
                  the Captain designed this remark as an introduction to what he himself had
                  presently to say on that very subject. Or, on the other hand, he may only have
                  thrown it out as a lure, to lead the lady first to introduce the topic. Be this as
                  it may, she did not suffer the opportunity to go long unavailed of.
               "Why, Captain, how much would you be willing to do?" she asked, carelessly.
               "Anything, Señorita," he replied, with no little earnestness: "anything at all,
                  that is possible, will I do, or at least try to do, to win you or to prove myself
                  worthy of you. Hercules' labors would scarcely be too much to undertake for such a
                  meed, if it could not be gained with less."
               "Prove yourself worthy of me, indeed! That, at least, no longer remains for you to
                  do. No, indeed,—you have done that long since. God forbid that I should so far
                  forget the claims of gratitude, as to put to such a test one who has already
                  snatched me—at the fearful risk of his own life—and those as dear to me as myself,
                  from so much suffering, and even from death. But as regards my love,
                  there is only one way in which that can be won by mortal."
               "And that is—"
               Although Gatewood's conjecture as to what she meant was quite correct, yet not
                  wishing to incur the risk of a blunder on so vital a point, he broke off the
                  sentence, designedly throwing the fragment into the interrogatory form by his mode
                  of emphasizing it.
               "Devotion to my country's cause, to be sure," replied Isabella.
               "Henceforth then," exclaimed the Chief, with enthusiasm, genuine or marvellously
                  well assumed, "I am your country's champion."
               "Yet do not misapprehend me," she rejoined instantly: "I don't say that will
                  certainly do it—but only that nothing else possibly can."
               "I conceive that your terms are exceeding hard, Señorita," said the lover
                  despondingly, "if you mean that it is barely possible you may smile on me after
                  all the sacrifices I may make in the cause, and the many hardships I may
                  endure—the many dangers I may encounter."
               "Nevertheless, I do mean," replied the lady, who, now that her country was the
                  theme, had lost the cool apathy with which she had discussed love, and was all
                  aglow with patriotic fervor, "that no one who refuses to strike for Mexico—or, at
                  least, for Texas—can by any possibility hope for such favor from me. On the other
                  hand, I do not now see how I could find it in my heart to frown on the suit of one
                  who should prove himself one of the chief heroes in establishing the freedom of my
                  native province. It would, of course, turn on the degree of love I should by that
                  time bear him; and although I cannot be expected to decide prospectively how much
                  that would be, yet I think I can venture to say, it must needs be great."
               "Then am I a champion of your cause from this time forth," said the Chief with
                  enthusiastic eagerness.
               "On the other hand," she went on, without seeming to heed the impulsive
                  interruption, "should we fail—should the darkness and blight of despotism settle
                  again on my country, and on my beloved Texas, I shall seek the lifelong seclusion
                  of the convent."
               "It shall be no fault of mine," said he, passionately, as soon as he had rallied from the momentary shock
                  which this sudden announcement gave him, "if so much excellence is lost to the
                  world."
               It may be as well that the reader here be told, that both the parties to this
                  interview had gone somewhat further than they intended; or, rather, that, under
                  the sway of feelings, which had but a transient operation, they had gone further
                  than subsequent cool reflection sanctioned. If the lady's conduct, or her
                  language, was shaped at all in this instance by the motive which, as we have
                  already endeavored to explain, influenced her before,—namely, that she felt his
                  companionship well-nigh indispensable to the beguilement of her lonely hours,—it
                  must have been in an exceedingly slight degree. The true explanation of such
                  encouragement as she now gave Gatewood is to be found chiefly in the fact, that
                  she chanced to be, at the time, in one of those despairing moods that occasionally
                  came over her,—during which she abandoned all hope of ever again meeting with her
                  lost lover, and was fain to act just as though she knew he was no longer in
                  existence.
               At such times, her reflections were much in this strain: "I can never love as I
                  once did. But if I am to give my hand to any, why not to one who will do as much
                  for my poor country as he has already done for me and mine? His present manner of
                  life, to be sure, is of a questionable order. On his former life, for aught I yet
                  know to the contrary, some stigma may rest; I have not yet heard his story—not
                  even his own version of it. Nor need I seek to know it: it is enough to know that
                  he loves me with such true devotion that I shall be able not only to win him from
                  the wild life he now leads, but to influence him so to live in the future, as to
                  atone for any stain that may have marked his past career, and to be once more the
                  ornament to society, that, I doubt not, he was in the by-gone time."
               It is, however, not at all improbable that there lurked in the woof of all this
                  tangled web of ratiocination—though she may not have been conscious of it—the
                  policy so strenuously inculcated upon her by her uncle and ghostly
                  counsellor;—which was, to all intents and purposes, neither more nor less than the
                  infamously notorious Jesuitical dogma, "The end justifies the means,"—the end
                  being, in the present instance, the independence of Mexico. To this may as well be
                  added an end incidental to the main one,—though this part of the programme had
                  been sedulously kept out of the Señorita's sight,—the investiture, namely, of the
                  counsellor aforesaid, with the dignity of an archbishopric. This advice, I repeat,
                  coming from the source it did, could not but have influenced the lady in some
                  degree, however little she may have suspected it, or, if suspected, however loth
                  she may have been to own it, even to herself. Nor is it to be denied that her holy
                  kinsman's promise of absolution, should she be conscience-smitten for having
                  shaped her conduct by policy rather than by truthfulness and candor, may have had
                  its weight in the matter.
               No sooner had she lapsed, after their parting for the night, into her more common
                  mood of thinking that her former lover still lived, and would, in due time, come,
                  with the rest, to the rescue of her native land, than she sorely repented the
                  extent to which her zeal had led her to commit herself to the Chief,—her regret
                  for the hasty words going even to the length of weeping over them as faithless to
                  her early plight. Inasmuch, however, as they had been spoken, she concluded her
                  painful reverie by resolving not to recall them, but to let them stand just as
                  they had been uttered, until ample time should have been allowed the really loved
                  one to make his appearance upon the scene. To this determination she was the more
                  easily reconciled from the fact that her promises to this last lover were only conditional, and might be retracted
                  without any great stretch of conscience, should the other event—which she, one
                  day, joyfully anticipated, and perhaps the very next, hopelessly despaired of—ever
                  come about.
               Gatewood, also, found, on mature reflection, that he had promised more than he
                  intended when he said, without due qualification, that he would champion the
                  Señorita's cause. The truth is, he had been so suddenly elevated by her last
                  words, from the pit into which her first had sunk him, that, in the glow of
                  reaction, he had closed a rash bargain. His only alternative, he thought, was to
                  make better terms when the time should come—as come it must—that would enable
                  him,—not to sue feebly for them, as heretofore,—but to demand them in the proud
                  right of might.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               
                  
                     
                        I must bring you to our captain's cave.
                     
                     
                        Two Gentlemen of Verona.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           These are my mates, that make their will their law,
                           Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
                           They love me well, yet I have much to do
                           To keep them from uncivil outrages.
                        
                     
                     
                        Two Gentlemen of Verona.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        If he is not in love with some woman, there is no believing old
                           signs.
                     
                     
                        Much Ado About Nothing.
                     
                  
               
               
                  HAVING brought matters thus far with the Señorita, Gatewood thought
                  it high time to give the camp-people an inkling of what was in the wind, so that,
                  when the time should arrive to make their actual arrangements for the campaign,
                  which must now be soon, if at all, his band should not be scandalized by
                  dissensions, but that all who should prove irreconcilable to his sudden
                  somersault, might leave the premises and bear with them all discordant
                  elements.
               All this he could now essay with the better grace, inasmuch as Magee had made good
                  his promise, to influence the civil authorities to release the men whom he had
                  arrested and turned over to their jurisdiction. These had reached camp several
                  days before—Magee having taken precious good care to let it be known that their
                  release had been effected through his instrumentality.
               One morning Gatewood summoned Wynne to his tent—an event, indeed, not so very
                  unusual as to excite suspicion that anything extraordinary was going on or in
                  contemplation; for that veteran was well known to be the Captain's right-hand man
                  in all cases where an officer's agency was not essential. After explaining to him
                  his intentions, he desired him to make them known to all the men, in a gradual
                  way, as though he had heard of them, not directly from his Chief, but by sheer
                  accident. The exact mode of doing this, he did not prescribe, but left it entirely
                  to the discretion of the veteran, on whose judgment, in such matters, he well
                  knew, from past experience, he could implicitly rely.
               His instructions were confined to the substance of what he wished his men to know.
                  Wynne was to inform them fully about the peculiar beauties and the attractiveness
                  of the province of Texas, of which the Chief himself had only heard, but of which
                  Wynne knew more, probably, than any other American within the limits of
                  Neutralia—he having traversed, in his younger days, nearly every portion of it,
                  lassoed wild horses on the prairies, and sojourned, at various times, in the
                  renowned city of San Antonio de Bexar. He was to tell them, too, of the rich lands that were to fall to their share,
                  should the expedition prove successful; the mines they would come into possession
                  of; and any other advantages which he thought the conquest and occupation of the
                  country would give them—for that the projected invasion would end in conquest and
                  occupation by the Anglo-Saxon portion of the little army, Gatewood made no
                  doubt.
               Touching his real motive for reversing his determination, previously promulgated
                  among them—not to have anything to do with an expedition which the hated Magee
                  should command—of course, he did not divulge this, even to the faithful agent he
                  had chosen to negotiate betwixt him and his men; though it is quite likely he
                  thought that not only Wynne, but the other men as well, had already right
                  suspicions concerning it. And here it is proper to remark, that, although the
                  Chief, since he had come under the glamour of the Señorita's eyes, had absented
                  himself from camp much more than formerly, yet when there, no one could perceive
                  that he was in the least changed. All signs (which they would have deemed unmanly)
                  of the deep passion that had taken such complete possession of his breast, however
                  marked they might have been a few moments before, had always vanished when he came
                  into their presence; and he seemed, to their critical eyes, the same ready,
                  energetic, stern chieftain that he had ever heretofore proved himself. They were
                  fain to believe that he was merely wantoning with this beautiful woman—the fame of
                  her beauty had long since spread through the camp—and that the result could not
                  but prove disastrous to her virtue.
               Could they have once seen him sink—as they would have deemed it—the warrior in the
                  humble suitor; could they have seen him unbend before her,—pay her respectful
                  court,—hang on her words,—dim, or brighten, beneath her frown, or smile,—they
                  would doubtless have thought him so sadly lapsed from his proud estate as to be no
                  longer a fit chieftain of the fierce spirits who now gloried in owning his
                  supremacy, and were ever ready to do his behests.
               The reasons that he chose to assign for joining this expedition, which they all
                  had so lately sworn, in their heart of hearts, to give the go-by, if no worse, may
                  perhaps be best explained in his own words to Wynne.
               "Tell them," said he, "that, as Magee has done all he could do to atone for the
                  outrage he committed, there is no further use for enmity,—especially, since the
                  longer it is kept up, the more it will work against their own interests. He now
                  proposes to make still further amends, by leading them on to the attainment of all
                  they can desire. If they refuse, they thereby reject the only way he has to prove
                  to them that he regrets what he has done. And that he does regret it—sincerely,
                  too, I have every reason to think—I have had from his own lips. As for any
                  vengeance they may cherish against him, now that he has returned within their
                  reach, you can tell them that my word of honor, which I pledged him on condition
                  that he would effect their release, shall forever be proof against
                     that."
               "I'll jist ride in to town," thought Wynne, as he left Gatewood's tent, "and when
                  I come back, I'll have lots o' news to tell the boys; and I can bring in, 'long
                  with the rest, what the Cap'n jist now told me."
               About sunset of the same day, Wynne returned from Natchitoches. When he neared
                  camp, he had the good luck to find about twenty of the men assembled, watching the
                  operation, which was being performed by two others, of roping a pair of stout cubs
                  captured by them and just brought in, after being reduced to a state of
                     orphanage, and their happy homestead
                  being otherwise desolated—all in that merciless fashion universal with
                  frontiermen.
               Wynne was rejoiced that so good a chance presented to speed throughout the camp
                  what news he had, without his appearing to be anxious that it should be made
                  known. He had gathered enough real news to serve his purpose, without being driven
                  to the questionable expedient of manufacturing the requisite quantity, or even of
                  greatly coloring its texture—neither of which things he would, in all probability,
                  have scrupled to do, had he thought his Chief's interests called for it.
               As he now approached the group, there were peals of laughter going up from among
                  them, at very short intervals, sometimes at the expense of the youthful
                  captives—the Messrs. Bruin—though much oftener at the expense of the two men, who
                  were vainly trying to lasso them, and were getting an occasional slap from a paw,
                  which, though young, was by no means velvety, and which tore a hole in the
                  garments, or the skin, of the captors, according to their nearness when the
                  resenting blow was struck.
               "There comes Wynne," said one of the group, who chanced to spy the veteran at a
                  distance. This discovery closed the menagerie, so far as the audience was
                  concerned, and secured the exhibitors from any further mortification of a laugh;
                  for all the spectators, as they invariably did when they knew he had been to town,
                  turned their attention exclusively to Wynne, who, previous to setting out in the
                  morning, had taken especial care to let it be known whither he was going.
               "What news, Wynne?" demanded the one who had first seen him, and who now took the
                  lead, as they moved away a few steps to meet him.
               News?" he echoed, as he rode up amongst them. "Why, town's jist full o' news
                  to-day—fuller 'n I ever knowed it."
               "Well, give us a little."
               "Thar's a young army jist got in from the States," he replied, dismounting, and
                  proceeding, with great deliberation, to unsaddle his horse.
               No one made any comment on this announcement—which, by the by, was no invention of
                  Wynne's, but only the simple truth. It was, however, easy to see that all looked
                  somewhat startled.
               "You needn't, all o' you, be skeered to death: they ain't comin' after us
                  Neutral-Grounders," resumed Wynne, reading, at once, the prevailing apprehension,
                  that the United States government had sent a force, as it had done several times
                  before, to expel them from their fastnesses. "They 're after no sich small game as
                  we folks."
               "It's the force that's to invade Texas, then?" conjectured one, with the confident
                  tone and air of having made a plausible guess.
               "Yes."
               Wynne said no more than the simple monosyllable, for the very good reason, that he
                  wanted, first, to ascertain how these wild pulses beat with reference to such an
                  expedition.
               "I'm glad of that," said one. "I hope Gatewood will join 'em, and take us with
                  him."
               "So do I," said two or three others.
               "I'm d——d if I do then—not if that d——d Magee's to command," said one
                  of those whom that officer had caused to be whipped, and who had just been
                  released from the civil clutches.
               "I should reckon not," said another. "You'll carry his mark to your grave, Hardy.
                  I don't see how any of us can forget that matter—so soon, too! It might just as
                  well ha' been me. If he'd ha' caught me, he'd ha' served me the same
                  way—or you—or you—or you." As he said this, he jerked his head excitedly in
                  the direction of those immediately about him.
               "Oh, nobody expects them to go that he treated that way," said the
                  first speaker. "I 'm sure I would n't, if he 'd ha' whipped
                     me. They can just stay here and suck their paws."
               "I think they 're the very ones that ought to go," said a great, ferocious-looking
                  fellow, who had not before spoken. "I'm one o' them that he whipped—and all hell
                  would n't stop me from goin'."
               "Why, Crabtree," exclaimed, in a very excited tone and manner, the one who had
                  shared with him the scorching and flagellation, "if you do, we 'll brand you as a
                  d——d traitor. You swore vengeance against Magee oftener 'n all the rest of us put
                  together. You said, if you ever got a chance—"
               "And it's just to git a chance that I 'm goin'," interrupted the other. "If I
                  don't put a ball through him before the campaign 's half over, it'll be because
                  I'll have a chance to do still better."
               "What's that?"
               "Split his d——d weasand on the sly. And that I'll do—so help me God! So, you may
                  put me down for that expedition, shore."
               The speaker said no more. One might well think he had said enough; but I should
                  rather he had uttered a dozen such things of me, than have laughed at me that
                  deadly laugh. It seemed like a continuation of his vengeful threat—nay, it seemed
                  like the veritable execution of it—causing a shudder to come over more than one of
                  those who knew Crabtree well.
               "What are you going to do, Wynne?" asked one of those who had
                  expressed themselves in favor of co-operating, in good faith, with the proposed
                  movement. For when anything novel or exciting was on foot, these wild fellows
                  always wanted to know what "the old boy," as they sometimes called Wynne, was
                  going to do—their course in the matter being mostly shaped by his.
               Wynne, during the whole of this running conversation, had assumed an air of the
                  most supreme indifference, and, without appearing to listen to anything that was
                  said, had heard every word. Thinking he had, by this time, caught, with tolerable
                  accuracy, the key-note of the crowd around him, and that they were quite a fair
                  specimen of Gatewood's entire band, he resolved that this was a good time for him
                  to speak in the interest of the Captain. So, without directly answering the query
                  propounded to him, as to what his own individual course would be, he went on to
                  give more of the news he had heard, together with his own views of the matter
                  under consideration,—well aware that his opinion and the course he should adopt,
                  would have no little weight in determining others.
               "They say in town, we're all expected to jine when the time comes to move. And,
                  then, there 's a rumor that the Cap'n 's been spoke to about it, and said, as
                  Texas is goin' to be run over anyhow by them folks from the States, he did n't see
                  why his boys should n't have a hand in it and git their share o' the
                  spiles, 'long with the rest. It's my private opinion we ought to jine. Boys, I've
                  been all through Texas—and that's more 'n any of you can say—and I jist tell you,
                  God A'mighty never made sich another country."
               He then went on to depict Texas, in his rough way, as an earthly Elysium. He
                  represented the rolling prairies as always covered with flowers, and as there was
                  plenty of timber along the water-courses, bees and honey were abundant; the
                  streams as well filled with the finest fish, and never getting muddy, since the
                  rain ran altogether through grass and
                  flowers to reach them; all kinds of game as abounding, from the stately buffalo
                  and wild horse down, through a hundred intermediate sorts—many of which he
                  specified—to the insignificant grouse and hare, which, he said, you might knock
                  over either with a stick or a d——d shot-gun, whichever you chose—but, of the two,
                  for his part, he should always prefer the stick. Then there was no end of the
                  mines of gold and silver in the mountains; and all to be done, to get their
                  treasures, was to drive out the d——d Indians. He wound up his description by
                  depicting the women of San Antonio as something marvellous in the way of charms,
                  and as being particularly partial to men of American blood.
               To such as have visited Texas, this rude outlaw's picture will hardly seem
                  overdrawn.
               "Now, boys," Wynne went on, "the question is just narrowed down to this: Shall we
                  stay here in this d——d Neutral Ground, whar we can't see ten foot ahead of us—and
                  then none the puttiest sights nuther—or go to lord it over sich as I have
                  described? Here we've been squatted down in this miser'ble thicket, this ever so
                  many years, ketchin' sich little dribbles as a counterband trade mought happen to
                  bring from Texas,—and now when thar's a clean chance to git the whole thing, Texas
                  and all, some o' you want to hold back, and look on, and growl, while them other
                  fellows 'll take every d——d bit of it—trade and all."
               With these indignant words, Wynne, without more ado, walked off to his tent and
                  left the group—still divided in their opinions—to discuss the subject among
                  themselves as long as they might choose.
               "I b'lieve that Spanish girl 's at the bottom o' this whole d——d business," said
                  one of that portion among them who were not very clear, in their perverted
                  consciences, about the propriety of so readily forgiving Magee.
               "How do you mean?" asked another.
               "Why, I mean, she 's got the Captain so bad, that she can do pretty much as she
                  pleases with him—and, so she's made him do this—don't you see?"
               "Pooh! I'd just like to see the woman that could do anything with him
                  when he's once made up his mind."
               "I should ha' thought so, too, if I had n't come on 'em once, unbeknowns. I tell
                  you he wa'n't the same Gatewood then as he is here among us—not by a long one. I
                  was in puppy-love with a girl myself oncet, but I wa'n't quite as big a pup as
                  you'd ha' thought him, if you'd only seen him watchin' her, and not darin' to put
                  his hand on her. They did n't see me; so I stood and looked at 'em a right smart
                  while, and then left—my mind made up that Cap'n Gatewood was done for. That's the
                  secret, you may depend, and he'll marry her too—that's, if he can git her—which
                  I'm in doubts about."
               "She git him, you mean, more like," remarked
                  another.
               "Well," said one who had not yet spoken, "what does it matter if she
                     does get him, so we get Texas? I, for one, would be willing for
                  such a swop; 'specially, if there's a few more such pretty women there as she
                  is."
               With a few closing remarks, which seemed to taper off the debate, they gradually
                  dispersed to their respective quarters, to digest these tidings, of so much moment
                  to all Neutralians.
               It was, however, very evident that Wynne had brought the most of them into such a
                  plastic state, that, by means of one or two more little speeches, he would be able
                  to knead them as so much dough, and to leaven, into the bargain, the whole lump to
                  the Captain's taste.

                  WHEN the Padre returned from Natchitoches that evening—which he did
                  about sunset—he searched in vain for his niece, in the house, and under the trees
                  where he usually found her. At length, descrying her sitting on the shore of the
                  lake, looking out on the beautiful expanse of water, which a light breeze was
                  crisping into wavelets and sending them to ripple softly along the smooth,
                  glistening beach at her feet, he hurried down the slope to where she sat.
               The Señorita had felt more than usually lonely this evening. She had been thinking
                  of the time—now probably near at hand—when she would be left, for months, with no
                  company except the old Mexican couple. How, without books, and confined within
                  very narrow limits by the fear of venturing into the forest, could she possibly
                  manage to while away so many idle hours?
               "I shall have nothing to do," she said aloud, "but to eat and sleep, like the wild
                  animals around me. I shall be almost like one in solitary confinement in some
                  prison-house."
               Prison-house, indeed! How could she call this a prison-house, when
                  she recollected one to which this were an Eden? What a sad echo that one little
                  gloomy word awakened in her breast! Not such an echo as was ever around her
                  here,—leaping forth like the wild deer, far along the green vistas of forest
                  growth, till every trace died away in the free and still open distance. Ah! no—but
                  the dreary, dismal echo that quickens in the dungeon's womb, and is stifled there,
                  even while yet struggling to make its way into the outer world.
               It awakened thoughts of Queretaro—and such thoughts could not but be sad. It
                  recalled all the sufferings of her lover, together with the perils she had
                  voluntarily encountered, and the sacrifices she had made, in his behalf. Oh, what
                  would she not give for an opportunity to brave the same perils, and make the same
                  sacrifices, or even greater, to serve him now! What would she not give to know
                  merely that he still lived, even though they should never—never meet again! She
                  felt that it would be somewhat comforting to know that he was in the same world
                  with her, and not have to think him in that other unknown world, which must remain
                  ever dark and forbidding until our time shall come to explore it in the
                  disembodied spirit. "It would be something," she thought, "to know that we breathe
                  the same air,—wear the same flesh, frail though it be,—that we look out on the
                  same sun, and moon, and starry skies,—and, above all, that he sometimes thinks of
                  me, wherever he is."
               "And what of this other one—this ardent suitor? who, I verily believe, loves me as
                  his life. I cannot love him in turn. And yet, if he, my long lost
                  lover, comes not soon, I shall be fain to take the irrevocable step for my
                  country's sake."
               The Señorita was relieved from the agony, now coming upon her,—of contemplating,
                  in detail, a loveless wedded life,—by her uncle's approach.
               
               "Isabella," said he, as he seated himself by her side, "you look very lonely
                  here."
               "Lonely as I am, uncle," she replied, with a very dejected air, that could not
                  have failed to move a more stoical heart than his, "I fear I shall be much more so
                  when you all leave."
               "Tut! girl," he said, with affected indifference, "you must not give way thus. You
                  must be more of a heroine than that. Surely, for freedom's sake, if for no other,
                  you can bear it a little while."
               "Well, I suppose I can," she replied, looking a trifle ashamed of her weakness.
                  "At least I will try."
               "But that will not do: you must bear it."
               "Well then, I will," she said, resolutely. "And I am sorry that I betrayed any
                  such unworthy shrinking from duty. Believe me, there shall be no more of it. What
                  news do you bring, this evening?"
               "A great deal. Magee has reached Natchitoches with a hundred and fifty men."
               "A hundred and fifty men, indeed! A mere handful! Is that all he could get? I hope
                  we shall have more than that, uncle."
               "I am sorry to say, there is very little prospect of many now. He could have got
                  all we want: in fact, several other companies were ready to start, but news came,
                  just then, that there was every probability of a war between the United States and
                  England. Indeed, I believe, no one doubts that hostilities will soon commence.
                  Many, therefore, changed their minds, and resolved to remain to fight for their
                  own country."
               "They surely cannot be blamed for that," said the Señorita. "Still it grieves me
                  that it is so. Have you any tidings of Bernardo and Juan?"
               "Yes—through Magee. He left them in New Orleans. They will be on in a few
                  days—having stopped there only long enough to make certain purchases for the
                  campaign. Perhaps the worst of the news is, that both the President of the United
                  States and the Governor of Louisiana, in view of the war impending with Great
                  Britain, have resolved to adopt prompt and vigorous measures to stop our
                  operations on this frontier."
               "That would, indeed, be unfortunate," said Isabella. "But I suppose it is
                  reasonable they should want these men for their own defence. Uncle, do you really
                  think there will be only a hundred and fifty men from the States?"
               "There are about fifty more," replied the priest, "who have engaged positively to
                  come on in a few days. Two hundred will, I am confident, embrace all we can hope
                  for from that source. So, you see, Isabella, how much depends on you."
               This was the first time the Padre had made any allusion whatever, directly or
                  indirectly, to her peculiar relations to Gatewood, since she had told him her sad
                  story, and he had volunteered his advice on the subject. During the interval,
                  however, he had been, without appearing to be so, closely and anxiously observant
                  of their intercourse with each other, and, as the result of his surveillance, had
                  the very best grounds for supposing that matters were going forward to his entire
                  satisfaction. Hence, his silence on the subject, until now, when it admitted of no
                  further delay
               In answer to his remark, the Señorita did not say a word, but instantly withdrew
                  her eyes from his and directed them upon the sands at her feet.
               "The good of the cause, Isabella," he resumed, seeing that she was not likely to
                  speak, "demands that I should know what you have really been able to effect in
                  enlisting in our behalf the brave Chief of the Neutral Ground."
               
               She suddenly fixed on him her glorious eyes, slightly flashing with indignation. A
                  sense of shame, or it may have been humiliation, flushed her cheek,, while her
                  beautiful lip—as if to give the lie to the shameful glow that mantled above—curled
                  proudly as she replied:
               "Uncle, that is a painful subject to me—exceedingly so. I had hoped that the first
                  time you ever introduced it would also have been the last."
               Saying this, she rose abruptly and was about turning to the house. But the Padre
                  had yet more to say to her, and he was a man not easily balked of his purpose.
               "As you please, Isabella," he remarked calmly. "But this much I have to add, be
                  your pain, or mine, ever so great—that, whatever is to be done here for the cause,
                  must be done forthwith, or may as well be abandoned altogether. If Gatewood shall
                  not join his force with Magee's within a very short time, our hopes on this
                  frontier are ruined. The only plan that Magee can possibly adopt to clear himself
                  of the United States territory and of liability to arrest, is, to enter Texas at
                  once. This he cannot do with the few men he has, without risk of being cut off by
                  the Gachupins before others can join him. If he does not enter that province
                  within a few days—a fortnight, at most—the Governor of Louisiana has declared that
                  the men shall be dispersed and the expedition broken up.
               "But here is something more tangible," he continued, drawing from his pocket a
                  folded paper. "It may aid in determining your future course in this matter. This
                  list comprises the name of every American whatsoever who has enlisted or promised
                  to enlist under our banner. I have further only to observe, what you will readily
                  find out by inspection—that the name of your lover is not of them."
               Now, during this conversation, the Señorita had longed —not once only, but over
                  and over again—to know whether or not her lover had come on with this little army.
                  In fact, it was her very first thought on hearing the news of their arrival. It
                  had then occurred to her to ask her uncle about it, but this, for two reasons, she
                  decided not to do: First, because he had before endeavored—somewhat cruelly, she
                  thought—to crush out what little hope she herself was striving with all her might
                  to keep alive, as the one fond hope of her existence, and therefore she did not
                  care to renew, now, the unpleasant theme; and, secondly, because she judged that
                  he had most probably heard nothing bearing upon the matter, and, even if he had,
                  that he would be very apt to volunteer the telling of it before the colloquy
                  should close. Then, almost immediately, there rose in her mind a doubt, whether
                  her uncle—although prompt enough, she well knew, to impart unfavorable tidings on
                  that subject—would not be far more likely to suppress than communicate the fact of
                  her lover's arrival, should he have heard of it. Still she shrank from propounding
                  the question directly, and at the moment when he produced the list from his
                  pocket, she had determined upon the plan of dispatching Miguel to town, betimes,
                  on the morrow, that he might make an effort to get the information she so much
                  desired.
               All necessity for this, however, was done away with by the Padre's last act of
                  handing her the paper, and by the accompanying dreadful words, "His
                  name is not of them."
               Not wishing—despite her indignation—to be guilty of the gross rudeness of leaving
                  her uncle while he was yet talking to her, Isabella had paused to hear him to the
                  end. When he had finished, she said nothing in reply; but as she put out her hand
                  and took the proffered list, it trembled perceptibly in her grasp; and as she
                  turned to the house, a cold shudder ran through her frame. It seemed to her that, at that moment, her one last and
                  only hope took wing and left her, so far as love was concerned, in all the
                  blackness of despair.
               Gatewood, having waited long enough to make sure that the Padre had detailed to
                  his niece all the late momentous news, (regarding which he also had, of course,
                  kept himself duly posted,) and that the two had exchanged such views on the
                  subject as they well might prefer to do during his absence, resumed his visits. If
                  he had before entertained moderate hopes of winning the Señorita's hand on the
                  ground of policy, he must have felt quite well assured of it now, when it had
                  become plain that policy absolutely demanded her assent, the only alternative
                  being the utter breaking down of the patriot cause in this quarter. The effect of
                  the threatened war in the United States, in limiting the volunteers to the pitiful
                  number of two hundred, when at least a thousand were looked for, rendered
                  indispensable his assistance, which had, a few months before, under better
                  auspices, been regarded not by any means essential, but only highly desirable in
                  order to secure the success of the projected movement beyond all manner of doubt,
                  and with as little loss of life as possible. He was resolved, however, if it could
                  be done, to win her pledge of marriage, without any allusion to his services,
                  either past or to come. It must be, he thought, already but too evident to her
                  proud spirit, whenever she was led to dwell on the painful theme, that she was
                  simply selling herself for a price—to benefit her country, to be sure, but it was
                  none the less, for that, a sale. So, the less said about it the better.
               It was with no slight degree of satisfaction, that, on the occasion of renewing
                  his intercourse with the lady, after an absence of several days, he was able to
                  discover in her manner towards him certain little signs, which bespoke his final
                  triumph; and it was still more gratifying to him to find that these trivial
                  indications increased every day as the time drew near when they were to part.
                  Before, she would only sit with him beneath the trees, or, at most, stroll within
                  full sight of the house, where they were liable to be seen and heard at almost any
                  moment by the two Mexican servants. Now, however, she acceded to his request to
                  walk with him into the surrounding woods. At first, these walks were very limited;
                  but they were gradually extended, until at length the wanderers began to gather
                  flowers wherever these could be found, without much note of either bearing or
                  distance. At other times, they would ensconce themselves within some arbor which
                  nature had fantastically fashioned out of her wild vines and creepers,—and on
                  which the eye of mortal had probably never before rested,—where they would
                  converse about that world from whose communion an untoward destiny had so
                  effectually shut them out. By way of varying all this ere it should cloy, they
                  sometimes took long rides together on horseback,—now along the main road,—now up
                  and down the wild bridle-paths, where they often met some of those grim denizens
                  of Neutralia whom it had become her main object to win, through their Chief, for
                  the maintenance of the cause she had espoused.
               At length, one day, he prevailed on her to go with him on the lake. This became
                  henceforward their favorite diversion,—the rides and strolls by land being now
                  seldom resorted to,—for the water has charms above everything else, as all who
                  have tried it must know. The little boat was a beautiful one, and Gatewood managed
                  it most deftly. Sometimes the Señorita would go with him when he went to catch a
                  mess of fish—as he did nearly every day. At other times they would visit the
                  cluster of little wooded islands which
                  lay out a cable's length or so from the shore, and gliding leisurely from one to
                  the other, tarry a few moments under the shadow of each, to inspect and admire its
                  peculiar beauties, then skim away to some distant point of land whose attractions
                  chanced to strike their fancy. Thence coasting slowly along, they would comment in
                  detail on the lovely surroundings—the blending beauties of the wood and water
                  below, and the sky, with its ever-shifting clouds, above them.
               Fitting scenes these, the reader may think, to inspire with love, and tempting
                  environments amid which to make it known,—yet not one word of love had thus far
                  been spoken.
               At last, however, while gliding, on one occasion, thus listlessly along, following
                  the fantastic indentations of the leafy fringe that encircled the lake, Gatewood
                  suddenly directed the boat shoreward, adjusted the oars in the bottom, and,
                  pushing aside the drooping boughs of the cypress-trees that dipped gracefully in
                  the water, the dainty little craft, under the impulse she had received, was
                  beached on the golden sands.
               Whether the Chief did this deliberately, with an eye to what was so soon to
                  follow, I know not. Be that as it may, however, thus much is certain: scarcely had
                  the keel scraped upon the sands, when he took her hand in his—gently—ever so
                  gently—as though giving her time to consider whether she would allow him such a
                  priceless privilege. And during that brief interval, she did
                  consider: asking herself, "If I am to marry this man, in heaven's name, why should
                  I shrink from his touch?" The consequence was, the hand was not withdrawn—but her
                  eyes were cast down—her cheek owned the contact with a faint blush—her breathing
                  was slightly quickened.
               Where passion was concerned, Gatewood was not the man to do things by halves; so
                  that, scarcely a moment more had passed, before she was folded in his
                  embrace,—lying pliant enough against his broad breast, that throbbed wildly
                  now—almost madly, indeed—while, as may well be imagined, his eager lips were not
                  idle with such a delicious treat before them. He at last held in his arms the
                  woman whom he had held so long in his heart.
               Before they left that spot the Señorita had pledged herself to marry him, at San
                  Antonio, as soon as Texas, her native province, should be free by his aid.
               Ah, how blind we are, at times, to all the eloquent emblems which kind Nature
                  spreads out so profusely about us, that we may read in them our fate, if we only
                     will! These two saw not that heaven's smile upon their plight was
                  quite shut out by the gloomy canopy of cypress above their devoted heads.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
                           The lass I spoke of.
                        
                     
                     
                        All's Well That Ends Well.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           What should it be that he respects in her
                           But I can make respective in myself,
                           If this fond love were not a blinded god?
                        
                     
                     
                        Two Gentlemen of Verona.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Claudio.
                           —Nay, but I know one who loves him.
                        
                        
                           Don Pedro.
                           —I warrant, one that knows him not.
                        
                        
                           Claudio.
                           —Yes, and his ill conditions, and in despite of all, dies for him.
                        
                        
                           Don Pedro.
                           —She shall be buried with her face upwards.
                        
                     
                     
                        Much Ado About Nothing.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        Show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, and so no more
                           ado.
                     
                     
                        Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  GATEWOOD having now fully decided to join Magee with all his
                  available force—only about a half-dozen, in the end, refusing to serve, on any
                  condition whatsoever, under a commander who had once put them to the
                  torture—sought out that officer in order to learn his plan of the campaign.
               On consultation, it was decided that, as Gatewood was ready to start, he should
                  cross the Sabine without delay, and, pushing on to Nacogdoches, take that place at
                  once—there being great danger that, unless they were thus prompt and energetic,
                  the Spanish garrison there might hear of the contemplated movement, and fortify
                  the town to such an extent that many lives would have to be sacrificed in its
                  capture.
               The evening before the Neutralians broke camp, Davies—the man whose wife, it will
                  be recollected, waited on Filly at Camp Wildwood—paid his aged mother a farewell
                  well visit before departing on the campaign. He spent the night at the old lady's
                  house, leaving, however, early the next morning—so that the girl did not see him,
                  except for a few moments.
               "Filly," said Mrs. Davies, as the girl, with a countenance which was now
                  habitually sad, entered the little room where the ancient dame was spinning, "as
                  you and Captain Gatewood were always great friends, I 'll tell you some news that
                  Will gave me about him."
               "Oh, don't tell me, Mrs. Davies—please! I know what it is: it's something about
                  that horrid war." And two big tears stood in the poor girl's eyes.
               "Oh, no, it is n't, honey; it's good news—it 'll cheer you up," said the old lady,
                  smiling.
               "What is it, then? Good news is so scarce nowadays."
               "The Captain's going to marry the rich and beautiful Señorita that lives in his
                  house by the lake."
               Now, Mrs. Davies had never once thought of such a thing as Filly's being in love
                  with Gatewood. In truth, she had always supposed they stood much in the same
                  relation to each other as father and daughter—though she well knew that they were
                     not father and daughter. Great was her astonishment, therefore,
                  when the girl, on hearing this announcement, gave vent to a flood of tears and
                  rushed away to her room. Even with this impulsive burst of feeling to assist in
                  the discovery of the tender secret that lay like a hidden jewel at the maiden's
                  heart, the old lady still failed even so much as to suspect such a state of
                  affairs—attributing the girl's emotion to a sudden fear on her part, that, if her
                  protector should indeed marry, he would have no more favors and caresses to lavish
                  on his little pet: another would get them all.
               Mrs. Davies, being a kind-hearted woman, was much moved by the girl's exhibition
                  of grief, and in a few minutes utes
                  followed her to her room, with the hope of contributing in some way to her
                  relief.
               "Don't take on so, Filly," she said, softly, as she entered and found her lying
                  prone on the bed. "I'm sure I did n't mean to make you cry: there's no need of all
                  these tears, if you'll only look at the thing in the right way. Why, Filly, I've
                  no doubt Captain Gatewood would like to have you live with them in the Señorita's
                  fine house in San Antonio; and I'm sure, too, he'll treat you as he has always
                  done. And they say she is a splendid lady, and there's not a bit of doubt but
                  she'd like to have your company when the Captain 's away from home—and while he's
                  there, too, for that matter. Now, child—"
               "Oh, Mrs. Davies, do please let me be, and leave me to myself!" exclaimed the
                  girl, breaking out into a fresh torrent of tears, and burying her face deep in the
                  pillow, wholly overcome by agony, as each of these words, intended in all
                  kindness, pierced her very heart like a dagger. "Oh, please, don't say any more
                  about it! I want to go to sleep—if you 'll only let me."
               Mrs. Davies was not slow to adopt the only alternative left her. She stole from
                  the apartment, closing the door as gently behind her as though already afraid of
                  disturbing the girl's slumbers.
               Ah, it was many a long and weary hour before sleep came to relieve those aching
                  eyeballs and soothe that throbbing heart!
               The first thing Filly thought of, on awaking, was a certain resolution she had
                  formed after Mrs. Davies left her, and which, now, on conning it over a second
                  time, she determined to carry out without delay—since, if postponed, it might be
                  too late.
               Before getting to sleep she had gone over, mentally, her last interview with
                  Gatewood. This she could the more easily do, as she had recalled it a full hundred
                  times since. The latter part of it, indeed,—in which he gave her to understand
                  that he would marry her on his return,—had been almost constantly on her mind
                  since she came to the town: had been, in fact, the one sole thing that made her
                  separation from him at all endurable.
               Filly's beauty had been much admired by the youth of the town, as well as by the
                  younger officers of the garrison; and she would doubtless have been quite a belle,
                  had her ambition run in that very questionable line. So far, however, from going
                  into society, or mixing at all with the gay little parties of the place, she
                  mostly confined herself to Mrs. Davies's contracted premises, and preferred to
                  remain unseen by her admirers, except such transient glimpses as they could catch
                  of her when they chanced to meet her tripping gracefully along the street, or a
                  little distance into the country, on her daily walk of mere recreation. When any
                  one called at the old lady's, Filly kept close to her own room, where she spent
                  her time partly in reading such newspapers or books as she could get access to
                  through Mrs. Davies's intercourse with the citizens, but chiefly in musing of
                  Gatewood, and in speculating what their future life would be when he should
                  return—if, indeed, he should ever return—from this miserable war. The possibility
                  of his being killed hung like a shadow over her and kept her spirits constantly at
                  a low ebb. Hence, she invariably sent her "excuses" to such of her hostess's
                  visitors of both sexes as expressed a desire to make the acquaintance of the young
                  forest beauty.
               Leading the secluded life she now did, she might almost as well have remained in
                  the woods, so far as regards any knowledge she gained here of the world and its
                  ways. Lest the assertion that she was happy, under these trying circumstances, should seem rather incredible, I
                  shall only venture to say that she was at least contented. But the preservation of
                  her feelings even in this comparatively negative state of happiness was wholly
                  dependent on hope. When that key-stone was struck from the rainbow
                  arch which her busy fancy had been so long building up, and which love had so
                  fondly tinted with his own peculiar hues, the whole illusive fabric fell and
                  vanished at once from view, leaving her only the menacing cloud against which it
                  had been so beautifully but treacherously set.
               The hopeful promise which Gatewood had made to her at that last meeting,—"When I
                  come back I will make you happy,"—had been ever in her thoughts. Her impulsive
                  tongue often repeated it in the solitude of her chamber, and her innermost
                  heart-cell echoed back, each time, its glad music. But these fond words now
                  suddenly gave place to those later ones, which, though far too dreadful for her
                  tongue to utter, constantly rang through her heart, not in music's tones, indeed,
                  but like voices in a vault—"When he comes back he will marry another."
               On second thought, she could not quite believe the disastrous news—though that
                  there was far too much foundation for it, she did not doubt. Her only remaining
                  hope was the seemingly forlorn one of proving it false—and to prove it so, she
                  resolved to spare no effort.
               "I will go to the lady herself," she thought, "and if I can find out in no other
                  way, I will just ask her downright whether this is so. If she will not tell me,
                  why, then, I'll demand it as the right of one he had long ago promised to make his
                  wife. That, I rather think, will bring the proud lady down:
                     that will shame her: that will bring her to terms—if
                  anything will. They say she's so grand, and rich, and all that—and I've no doubt
                  they might call her stuck up, too, without straying very far from the truth. But
                  I'm not at all afraid of her great ladyship; and if I don't humble her it will be
                  strange, indeed. To be sure, I should n't like to undertake such a thing, here in
                  town, where people have grades to society, just as they have stories to their
                  houses, and steps to go up—queer ones, too, sometimes, it seems to me. But out in
                  the wild woods yonder, where all are on the tent-floor level, with no upper story
                  to mount to, I 'm not a bit afraid she'll get the better of me—with such a good
                  cause as I have, too.
               "Let me see: how shall I go about it? Let Mrs. Davies know where I'm going? No,
                  indeed! that would never do. I'll just slip off from her: I needn't be gone long:
                  I think it's only about fifteen miles. I can walk there to-day, if I take the
                  whole day for it—stay all night—and then come back to-morrow. I reckon the great
                  lady's hardly so proud she won't let me stay all night in her house.
                     Her house, indeed! It's my house: it was built and
                  furnished on purpose for me. Yes—she's living in my house, and I'm going to tell
                  her so, too. I wonder how her ladyship, with all her money, and finery, and
                  jewels, and all, will like to hear that piece of news? for I've no
                  doubt it will be news to her. He never told her that—never in the
                  world, for all the long rambles and talks they must have had together around that
                  beautiful lake. Oh, I do wish he had told her!"
               This musing over what was now, and its contrast with what might have been, brought
                  the poor girl back again to her tears. She soon rallied, however; and, long before
                  the middle of the day, was off on her venturesome journey. Taking the main road
                  leading directly west, she got along very well the first two or three miles. Her
                  life, as far back as she could remember, had been so wild, and not seldom beset
                  with perils, that she now took but little forethought of any dangers she might
                     encounter,—though, once fairly on
                  her way, she found herself wishing, with all her heart, for Grim—as much perhaps
                  for his agreeable company's sake as for his protectorship. She had been so long
                  accustomed, while in the woods, to the society of this faithful friend, that now,
                  when she had again entered them, she could not but think his absence from her side
                  quite unnatural, to say the least.
               She had gone probably not more than fourth the distance, when she began to grow
                  quite weary. She now reflected, for the first time, as she sat down on a log by
                  the roadside to rest, that her comparatively inactive life in the town, for
                  several months, had unfitted her for undergoing the great amount of exertion to
                  which she had inured herself when in camp, by long and frequent strolls through
                  the forest. After she had jogged along about a mile further, she began to despair
                  of carrying out her project, and was beginning to think seriously of returning. Of
                  course, she did not know exactly how far she had already come, but, like all
                  persons who have lived much in the woods, she had a tolerably correct idea of both
                  time and distance. As she sat on her second resting-log, she reasoned within
                  herself somewhat after this fashion:
               "I'm now about one-third the way to the lake. It will be impossible to make the
                  other ten miles—at least without a night's rest. But there's no house on the way,,
                  and if I attempt to spend the night in the woods, a pack of wolves way make their
                  supper on me. No—it's very plain I shall have to return to town. It's not more
                  than about five miles. I'll manage to get to the lake some other time, and some
                  better way."
               She accordingly started on her way back. She had gone only some two or three
                  hundred steps, however, when she met—mounted, each, on a mule—two Mexicans, one of
                  them a very old man, the other, to judge from a strong resemblance in feature,
                  most probably his son.
               Filly, though she had by no means a thorough knowledge of Spanish, could speak it
                  well enough, she thought, to converse with these men—by the aid of a few natural
                  signs—to the limited extent of her present necessities.
               "Will you take me, behind you, to the by-path that leads to the lake?" she asked
                  of the old man. In order to supply her linguistic deficiencies—of which she was
                  fully aware—she pointed, as she said this, first, to herself, then to the croup of
                  the old man's mule, and lastly in the direction she wished to go.
               Both the men had reined in as soon as she began to speak.
               "No, Señorita," replied the old man, with surly tone and manner, and from the
                  expression of his face, not a little astonished withal that a young girl should be
                  found in such a wild, out-of-the-way place without a protector.
               "But I must go," insisted Filly. "I undertook to walk from
                  Natchitoches to the lake, but found I could n't get all the way to-night,—and so,
                  I just now turned back.
               I must go," she repeated, when she saw no sign of the Mexican
                  yielding.
               "No, Señorita," said the man again, at the same time digging his ponderous spurs
                  into the mule's sides and spurting off in a jog-trot—his companion following.
               It is quite likely the man did not comprehend a word our heroine said—beyond the
                  first request for transportation. But even had he comprehended her throughout, the
                  result would no doubt have been the same. It was enough for this grizzled brute to
                  know that she wanted to ride behind him,—an arrangement which he thought could
                  benefit no one but herself,—and thus knowing and thinking, he spurred off in order
                  to get at once beyond the reach of her importunities. It soon became evident,
                     however, that somebody had
                  blundered—the girl's chance for a ride was, after all, by no means so desperate as
                  he would have her think, for she had in her possession a talisman of which he
                  little dreamed.
               "I'll give you this, if you'll only take me," she cried, trotting up alongside the
                  mule, despite her weariness, and holding aloft—by its extreme outer edge, between
                  her forefinger and thumb, so as to display it to the greatest advantage—a new,
                  glittering silver dollar, which she had that moment drawn from her pocket.
               Gatewood, on parting with her, had given her more money than she well knew what to
                  do with, and she usually kept a few loose dollars about her person,—more because
                  they were his gift, than for any use she thought they might ever be to her.
               
                  That was the spell required! That little silver rim formed the magic
                  circle beyond which the sordid Mexican found himself utterly powerless to move.
                  There was an instant truce to spurs. The slackened rein was tightened, with a
                  sudden snap against the animal's neck, and was then so lustily drawn on, that its
                  integrity was for a while seriously endangered.
               The Mexican—become now all politeness—drew his blanket from under him and spread
                  it out behind the saddle, and the girl, having transferred the glittering coin to
                  his horny hand, was, with a little assistance from him, soon in the seat prepared
                  for her accommodation—and they started off.
               "Magic dollar!" thought Filly, "that can so soon humanize a heartless brute."
               Such unflattering thoughts, however, she of course kept to herself.
               The sun was yet several hours high when they reached the path which diverged to
                  the lake. Filly dismounted, and lost no time in making her way thitherward through
                  the woods by the same route along which she had once before travelled so happily
                  with Gatewood. And now, when she had come almost within sight of the spot she had
                  so eagerly sought, her heart began to fail her. It may have been that the
                  excessive fatigue she had undergone had somewhat unnerved her,—or it may have been
                  on the principle, that what often seems to us quite insignificant at a good, safe
                  distance, grows to be decidedly formidable as the critical spot or the critical
                  period is approached. As an apt illustration of this—so far, at least as a
                  revulsion of our mere physical feeling is concerned—a visit to the dentist may
                  occur to some of my odontalgic readers.
               "I can't go right up to the lady," she began to think, "and ask her at once about
                  this thing—as I thought I could. Why, it would be real rude. Besides, they say
                  she's such a nice person, and I don't want to hurt any nice person's feelings—nice
                  persons are scarce. Then, she knows nothing at all about what Señor promised me.
                  How should she know it? Of course he would n't tell her. I dare say the lady never
                  heard of poor little me. How, then, is she to blame, I'd just like to know? Not at
                  all, that I can see. Strange, this didn't occur to me before. What in the name of
                  sense could I have been thinking about all this time? Here I've come this whole
                  distance—stole off from Mrs. Davies, too—and after all, don't know what to do. But
                  I must do something: I 'm nearly there now. I 'll sit down on this log and think
                  about it." With this, she seated herself.
               "Oh yes, I know what to do now," she said aloud, after a little while. "I'll tell
                  the lady I started from Natchitoches, with some other persons, to go over to
                  Nacogdoches. To be sure, that's not quite true; but if I were to tell her I
                  started out on such a trip by myself, she would hardly believe lieve me: why, I reckon it's a hundred
                  miles to Nacogdoches—on foot, too. And if I tell her I started to come to the
                  lake, I should have to tell her the whole story as it really is; for, except that,
                  what business have I got coming to the lake at all? Well, then, I 'll
                  tell her I started for Nacogdoches, and got separated from the rest of the party.
                  And did n't I? I'm sure I got separated from those mean, good-for-nothing
                  Mexicans—and was glad enough of it, too—for they're nasty folks: but that don't
                  make it any the less true. Well, then, I got separated from them, just where the
                  path leading to the lake leaves the great road; and, having heard there was a
                  house at the lake—and I'm sure I've heard that many a time—I made my
                  way—"

                  FILLY left the sentence unfinished, as well she might: for she had
                  caught what was, in a wood like that, and to an unprotected girl, a truly ominous
                  sound. It came from the direction in which she herself had just come. It was like
                  the rushing of some huge beast, or beasts, through the dense undergrowth. She
                  could distinctly hear the heavy feet come down against the ground at every leap:
                  could hear the noise of the dry leaves below, and the quick rustle of the green
                  branches suddenly pushed aside, above and around—sounds, all of which, as they
                  increased in loudness at each repetition of them, told her practised ear that some
                  ferocious beast, or perhaps a whole herd of hungry wolves, were on her track.
               Whatever it might be, it was not yet in sight, for she cast a hurried look in that
                  direction and saw nothing; yet she could hear it more plainly than before,
                  bursting through the thicket near at hand. For once, she was frightened almost to
                  death. What would she not have given, at that moment, if the faithful Grim could
                  but have been with her, to interpose his terrible, burly front betwixt her and
                  this sudden peril.
               She knew it was useless to run. She thought of climbing a tree; but, looking
                  quickly around, saw none she could hope to climb, even had the tremor of her limbs
                  admitted of a feat to which they were wholly unaccustomed. She did not faint: most
                  probably was not one of the fainting kind; for had she been, here was surely
                  sufficient cause for it. She had never seen any one go off in that interesting
                  way. In fact, all she knew about the swooning process she had learned from novels,
                  and in these the cause assigned was usually so wholly inadequate to produce what
                  she supposed was a sort of temporary death, that the entire thing, from beginning
                  to end, remained a mystery to her. She only wished she could
                  faint—and so be snatched, by this transient suspension of life, from witnessing,
                  or, rather, feeling, the horrible tragedy now so plainly imminent:
                  and, if it must be enacted—let her wake no more. The poor girl,
                  incredible as it may seem, actually made a sort of effort at a swoon; but was by
                  no means so successful as some of those daughters of luxury and fashion who know,
                  to a hair, how to do the thing, no less than when. The consequence
                  was, she held on to her senses and was vividly conscious, to the last, of
                  everything going on around her.
               
               Casting one more look in the direction of the danger, she caught a partial glimpse
                  of the side of a great black beast, rushing athwart an opening in the thicket.
               "It's a bear!" she exclaimed. "Oh! to be eaten up by a bear!" and sinking to the
                  ground, she buried her face in her hands and in the dead leaves, and awaited her
                  dreadful doom.
               From this time, she saw nothing, for she did not once look up. She, however, heard
                  every bound the animal made in its swift career. Nearer—nearer—nearer it came.
                  That last leap could be only a few feet from her: yet so quick is thought under
                  such appalling circumstances, she had time to think that, at the next instant, she
                  would feel its merciless fangs crunching through her frame. Much to her
                  astonishment, however, and no less to her temporary relief, she felt, instead,
                  only a warm breath panted forth into her face. That it could not be wolves, she
                  had already decided, from the entire absence of the hideous noises always made by
                  those cowardly animals when they draw very near their prey.
               The ferocious beast—now snuffing around her, as a preliminary to gorging himself
                  on her dainty limbs, as a child retains, for a little while, a tidbit for its very
                  deliciousness—could, she thought, be no other than a remorseless bear. She came to
                  this conclusion from the fact of having often read of this animal—when not urged
                  on by keen hunger to destroy his prey instantly—being sometimes induced to forego
                  his destructive instinct by the feigning of death on the part of his intended
                  victim, which mistaking for real death, he would be content to pass on his way
                  with bloodless tooth and claw. And now, as she recalled this stratagem, she
                  concluded to adopt it herself, as her only remaining hope, desperate though it
                  seemed. Once resolved on this plan, it may readily be believed that she exerted
                  herself to don the disguise of the King of Terrors, just in the proportion in
                  which she dreaded the real king himself. Indeed, she did this so royally well—lay
                  so very still, and breathed so very little, and so softly—slowly—gently—when she
                  breathed at all, that scarcely could old Æsculapius himself—without placing his
                  finger on her pulse—have pronounced whether or not the vital spark had still its
                  home in the beautiful flesh before him. Much less, therefore, could Bruin; for,
                  although he might have quite as much brain and quite as refined manners as some of
                  the lineal descendants of the venerable old demi-god, he could not be supposed to
                  possess enough of the tactus eruditus to detect
                  an arterial pulsation.
               She lay in this dreadful way—oh! it seemed to her for hours, though it was
                  probably only for minutes. At any rate, she lay so long that she thought she must
                  soon die outright of the terrible suspense, if something could not be done. But,
                  then, in the name of heaven, what could be done? Why did the pitiless
                  brute gloat so long in fond anticipation over the precious morsels he was to tear
                  from her slender bones? Why did he not leave her, or—eat her up at once and have
                  done with it? Could it be possible that, not being very hungry just now, he was
                  waiting there for the return of his voracious appetite? Yes—that was it! for he
                  had actually lain down near her: she heard him, just then, throw himself on the
                  ground close at hand. He was waiting—yes, deliberately waiting for a degree of
                  hunger that would enable him to take the whole of her into his capacious maw, and
                  leave not even a trace to tell of her fate. And he might wait thus for hours!
               She now—since she could endure no longer this killing state of things—ventured to
                  open that eye which was half buried in the leaves: she felt that she could not,
                  for the world, have opened the other eye. What, look directly into the glaring orbs of the savage monster before
                  her? So she opened, by very slow degrees, the one that was half hid in the
                  leaves—a little—ever so little—at first—then wider—wider still—until, at last, it
                  was staring at full width. But there was nothing within its sweep more
                  formidable-looking than the luxuriant growth of the forest, which only waved in
                  the gentle breeze, and seemed to tell mockingly of peace and safety around, where
                  terror already stalked and destruction was soon to be let loose.
               The range of that eye being very limited, she now thought she would venture—in
                  fact, must venture— to open the other, which would necessarily
                  embrace the terrible object of her dread. The very first glimpse through the half
                  separated lashes fully confirmed her fears of the hopelessness of her situation.
                  She had only time to see that a great, black, hairy mass lay there almost touching
                  her, when her eye closed instantly, and almost of itself, as though with an
                  instinctive shrinking from the horrible object. Several minutes passed in this
                  way. At length, she heard the animal stir slightly among the dead leaves. The
                  merest chink was again ventured in the eye; and this time the poor girl descried,
                  standing directly over her,—not the ferocious foe she had expected,—but the very
                  best friend, peradventure, that she had in all the wide world. This, of course,
                  could be no other than the ever mysterious, silent, honest Grim.
               Now it is but fair to say, had the girl been better acquainted with Bruin, she
                  might have known, that, although he does occasionally indulge those carnivorous
                  propensities with which Nature has feebly endowed him, he vastly prefers, as a
                  general thing, fruits, plants, and above all, honey—when it can be had without too
                  great sacrifice of his feelings: moreover, that the stories of his standing so
                  long over his victims,—like some grim detective bent on finding out whether they
                  are counterfeiting,—though they may do well enough to place in the Little
                  Red-Ridinghood Series, to frighten children with, are, nevertheless, the merest
                  fudge. The truth is, although the girl's surroundings had afforded her many
                  facilities to do so, she had never availed herself of them to learn much about the
                  habits of wild animals—choosing rather to glean her information about them from
                  books written by persons who actually know little or nothing of what they presume
                  to teach others. The inevitable result was, she remained in lamentable ignorance
                  touching many points of Natural History.
               "Oh, what a relief!" thought Filly, "to be snatched from the very jaws of
                  death—even from the imaginary jaws of such a horrible death—and suddenly delivered
                  over to the caresses of this ever-faithful brute!"
               She could not contain herself. Prostrated though she had just been by the effects
                  of an extreme terror, she now sprang up, and rushing upon the dog, threw her arms
                  around his great brawny neck and hugged him until he had to struggle hard to get
                  his breath. She would have been glad enough to see him, even under circumstances
                  far less trying; but the sudden and complete reaction of feeling, caused by her
                  emerging from death into life, as it were, well-nigh frenzied her, for the time,
                  with excess of joy.
               As for the dog, so long as his mistress lay in such good counterfeit of death, he
                  was sorely puzzled and much exercised to know whether or not all was right with
                  her—fearing, probably, that some accident might have befallen her to make her lie
                  so still. He, therefore, since he could do no better, had taken his station by her
                  side, and, without once withdrawing his eye from her, had watched anxiously for
                  the least movement she might make, and pricking up his ears, and, ever and anon casting his head
                  askance, listened as tenderly as a mother over her expiring babe, hoping to catch
                  the slightest sound that might tell of yet lingering life.
               No sooner, however, did she start up, than his joy knew no bounds. To be sure, he
                  waited, with all due courtesy, to receive her first embrace; but just as soon
                  thereafter as he could extricate himself from her grasp without undue rudeness,
                  and had sufficiently recovered breath from the severe throttling she had given
                  him, he leaped away, and for the first time since his memorable puppyhood, gave
                  his Stoic philosophy to the winds. He wheeled about her—now this way—now that
                  way—at every jump sending the dry leaves whirling in all directions through the
                  air. It was in vain that she called him to her in fond tones—in vain that she
                  scolded him soundly for so unceremoniously leaving her side after their long
                  separation.
               "Why, Grim, are you crazy?" she exclaimed at last, seeing he did not mind a word
                  she said to him, but continued his strange antics.
               "Come here, Grim, and tell me why you frightened me so?
               For the first time in their long acquaintance, the dog refused to come at her
                  bidding. He seemed to be resolved on taking a jubilee to himself, and doing as he
                  pleased for this once, if never again. He shot off into the woods like an arrow,
                  until almost out of sight, cutting up the virgin soil with his great hind claws,
                  and scattering it broadcast, until it pattered like raindrops on the dead leaves,
                  or struck against his mistress's face, to the great danger of her eyes. Turning,
                  he came back at about the same rate, and whizzing past her, stayed not his steps a
                  moment, but darted away in the opposite direction. Coming up again to where she
                  stood, he described a semicircle about her, sweeping so close as almost to touch
                  her person—like the Olympian of old turning the goal—and in a trice was off again
                  into the woods.
               He soon came back and performed in a few short spurts—then zigzag—the while
                  tearing up the soil, like the black thunderbolt that he was—and like it, too, in
                  running the thing quite into the ground—at least in his mistress's opinion. He
                  made a succession of leaps into the air, as though clearing imaginary obstacles.
                  He sprang, too, over real ones, such as logs, low-hanging branches, or any object
                  that chanced to be across his course; and his mistress feared, on more than one
                  occasion,—when he approached very close to her with this leap-frog fit on
                  him,—that he was going to be guilty of the signal disrespect of jumping quite over
                  her head. It is, however, due to Grim's uniform good manners to say, that,
                  although such a thought might have flashed through his bewildered brain at some
                  time during these impulsive gambols, his politeness restrained him from any such
                  gross indignity.
               A most astonishing thing is, that, during these varied performances, Grim's
                  long-lost voice was gradually coming back to him. He began with a scarcely audible
                  whine, or whimper, while he was yet making his first curvetings round about his
                  mistress—like the first shufflings of an old-time plantation darkey, when he would
                  fain get the hang of a "ho-down" which he is going to dance. This whine became
                  louder and louder, and at the same time shorter and shorter, until, towards the
                  end of his wonderful feats—to which, indeed, one might think it was designed as an
                  accompaniment—there might have been recognized in it some of the rudiments of a
                  genuine bark—which a pup with his eyes just fairly open might not have been
                  ashamed to own. And inasmuch as his eyes were well-nigh ready to open on the
                  memorable occasion when he had lost his
                  voice, it would seem that he was now trying to resume it at the precise point
                  where he had then so unaccountably left off.
               Now, whether the sagacious dog got this exhibition up for the special purpose of
                  diverting his beloved mistress, and thus beguiling her from the wretched state
                  into which, in his super-canine sagacity, he may have seen (who knows?) that
                  terror had thrown her, or whether he was but obeying an instinctive impulse, that
                  was simply irresistible, to work off, by means of these excessive muscular
                  exertions, the exuberance of his joy at meeting once more with her whom he had
                  long since given up as forever lost to him, or whether both these conjectures are
                  in some degree correct, I cannot say. At any rate, both objects seem to have been
                  gained. So far as the girl's diversion was concerned, there was certainly no lack
                  of it. At first, her feeling was that of simple astonishment, mixed perhaps with a
                  transient apprehension that her four-footed friend, heretofore so wholly
                  undemonstrative, must have taken leave of his senses, or he would never, in his
                  old days, fall to capering in this most ridiculous fashion. After he had made a
                  few turns, however, she began to smile,—after a few more, she laughed
                  outright,—and long before he was done with it, she was under the influence of
                  mirth to such an extent that the forest rang with her merry peals, as they came
                  forth one after another, while the tears streamed down her cheeks. At last she was
                  compelled, not only to hold her sides, with very pain, but to avert her eyes
                  occasionally from the ludicrous feats which caused it.
               Grim's unwonted behavior served likewise as a vent to his superfluity of spirits,
                  for when he brought his unique pantomime to a close—which he did quite as abruptly
                  as he had opened it—he relapsed so completely into his olden imperturbable way,
                  that his mistress chid him smartly for running into such extremes: she thought an
                  intermediate stage highly desirable at times. Particularly would she have liked
                  him to preserve that embryo yelp which he had just now favored her with. She was
                  not without hope that, with assiduous care, it might be yet cultivated into a most
                  dogly voice. The only fault, indeed, which she ever had to urge against him was,
                  that, however much he might feel, he never had anything at all to say on any
                  subject that came up between them in these solitudes, where the stillness was
                  often so profound as to be oppressive, and even painful, to her unrelieved
                  ear.
               Poor girl! she was fated never to hear his unmelodious notes again. Poor dog!
                  never more, but once, did he vex with them these wild solitudes—and then in a far
                  different key from this, the joyous day of their meeting.
               Filly now resumed her journey—the dog, as was his wont, following close behind,
                  though occasionally moving up to her side. She had, since she grew up, retained a
                  foolish habit, contracted in childhood, of putting into words and addressing them
                  to him, such thoughts as others often indulge in, but would never dream of shaping
                  into speech for the benefit of any animal whatever, human or other.
               "Grim," she now said, putting her hand on his head, as they walked along, "look at
                  me, sir, and say how you happened to find me? How in the world did you, Grim?"
               Grim looked up, as desired—but said nothing.
               Then she began to speculate as to how the thing had happened.
               "Oh, I know: when they broke up camp and went away, instead of taking you with
                  them to that horrid war, where you could n't have been of any use, they turned you
                  over to those half-dozen men that stayed behind. Some of these were going into
                  town this evening, and had you with
                  them. Well, when you got to where this path leaves the great road, you struck my
                  trail, where I had just passed along. Of course you would then leave them—or
                  anybody else—and come to me. That was the way. Was n't it, old fellow?
               "Yes—that was the way," she continued, nodding her head as the dog gave an upward
                  glance, which she at once interpreted as an affirmative answer—like an over-fond
                  mamma explaining the first unmeaning accents and gestures of her babe,—or, rather,
                  substituting in their stead something of real meaning,—for her own diversion, and
                  too often, whether intentional or not, with the effect of boring some crusty—and
                  it is probably not too much to add, envious—old bachelor, bystanding.
               These speculations gave Filly a hint which she now resolved to make use of in
                  framing a story to mislead the Señorita about her manner of getting to the lake.
                  At the moment when the great fright came upon her, the reader may recollect—though
                  Filly did not, for that scare had knocked every trace of it out of her head
                  forever—that she was just "fixing up" the old lost-child story—revamping it to
                  suit the case—and had nearly completed it, when the mighty Grim, regardless of
                  consequences, came rushing down upon her, clothed with something as much like
                  death to her as anything could well be short of the pale monster himself—except,
                  that, in this case, he was not pale, but very black.
               "I'll just pretend," she thought, "that, when they broke up camp yesterday, they
                  left me Grim for a protector, and told me to shift for myself; and that I came
                  here because I thought it was such a pretty place. That will do very well to begin
                  with. It's not exactly true, to be sure, but I begin to think truth is getting
                  rather scarce, anyhow. So that, if I keep on dealing in it altogether—gold, I
                  believe some of them call it—and never use the baser currency in my dealings, I
                  shall be brought very low at last.
               "But I must take care to tell the lady nothing about my having lived on such close
                  terms with Señor. That would never do. I'll pass myself off as the daughter of one
                  of his married men. And, pray, whose child am I? Nobody knows. I must have a name
                  ready, though: she might ask me what it was—and that would be awkward. Ah, me! I
                  have no name but Filly. A few months ago I hoped it would be Filly Gatewood. And
                  it may be that yet. Who can tell?
               "Let me see: there is Whishton. He and his wife (or whatever she is—or
                     was, rather—I believe she's dead now) are about the best behaved
                  among them, I 've heard Señor say. Then let it be Whishton, when the great lady
                  comes to ask me about—"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I do believe thee:
                           Give me thy hand.
                        
                     
                     
                        Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           With thoughts so qualified as your charities
                           Shall best instruct you; measure me.
                        
                     
                     
                        Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  MERCIFUL heavens! Grim—there's the house!" exclaimed the girl,
                  staying her steps as suddenly as her speculations. Stooping down, she peered
                  through the trees at the unpretending cottage, now only a few rods distant. Her
                  heart throbbed violently for a while; but, nerving herself, she succeeded in
                  reducing it to comparative quiet, and went on.
               
               As she walked up to the house she saw no one. Noticing, however, that the doors
                  were open, and some of the windows hoisted, she concluded that the premises were
                  probably not altogether deserted; so she stepped around to that side of the house
                  which looked towards the lake. There, she came upon a lady half reclining in a
                  hammock, with that listless ease and abandoned grace of attitude which none know
                  so well as a Spanish woman how to assume—if indeed, it is not, in her, a natural
                  gift, not at all needing to be assumed. Now and then she touched the ground with
                  the toe of her dainty foot, which, clothed in a well-fitted slipper, was pendent
                  from the hammock's side, thus giving her suspended cradle a barely perceptible
                  motion to and fro, which contributed much to the luxurious air of the scene.
               As Filly approached, the lady's back was towards her. For all the girl could tell,
                  she might have been in a deep reverie; or she might have been gazing in fixed
                  admiration on the beauties which always clustered, at the sunset-hour, around the
                  lovely crystal-clear sheet of water before her. All this looked so luxurious and
                  queenly to Filly, who had now stolen up until almost in contact with the lady—not
                  directly behind her, but somewhat to one side—that she felt no little
                  embarrassment, and did not know exactly in what manner to proceed. After standing
                  there, however, for nearly a minute, she began to feel so foolish that she
                  resolved to make an attempt.
               "I should like you to tell me, Señorita," she said, in a soft, low tone, "if I
                  may—stay here—all night?"
               The lady, startled in the midst of her abstraction by such an unusual sound in
                  these parts as a sweet, feminine voice, was almost ready to think, for the
                  moment,—since no human being was yet visible,—that an angel had asked to tarry
                  with her. She at once leaped from the hammock, and faced about, to get a look at
                  this wholly unexpected visitor. Seeing before her a beautiful girl, neatly, even
                  tastefully dressed,—though more than a trifle bedraggled—a condition for which in
                  these parts she had long since learned to make due allowance,—and, withal, in
                  every way prepossessing, she came forward as soon as her first surprise was over,
                  and proffered her hand, glad enough, no doubt, to have a guest promising so
                  agreeable a breaking-in upon her loneliness, which, indeed, had been the burden of
                  her interrupted meditations.
               "I should be glad truly, to have you stay," she said, in tones which seemed to
                  come from her heart. "But who is it—if you will let me ask—that is to be my guest
                  to-night?"
               "I—I—came from—"
               The girl was so overcome by this unlooked-for kindness of manner, and so impressed
                  with the Señorita's superiority to any lady she had yet seen, that she could not,
                  for her life, recollect her manufactured story, and so came very near telling the
                  real one. She was on the point of saying she had just come from the town,—which,
                  for obvious reasons, must have materially damaged her project. But the Señorita,
                  seeing her hesitation, and very naturally attributing it wholly to bashfulness,
                  came graciously to her relief.
               "I suppose you have lost your way?" she suggested.
               "Yes—not exactly, either. I came from the camp—Camp Wildwood, you know."
               "Why, I thought Captain—"
               Here the Señorita, in her turn, seemed a little confused,—which served to reassure
                  Filly, since it tended to bring them towards the same level.
               "That is," resumed Isabella, correcting herself, "I understood they were all to
                  leave the camp yesterday."
               
               "And so they did," explained Filly. "And this morning I started for town. But by
                  the time I got to where your lake-road leaves the other, I felt so tired, and
                  night was so near, I thought I would come here, where I had heard you were living,
                  and ask you—"
               "Not left in the wilderness by yourself?" interrupted the Señorita. "How could
                  they all be so heartless?"
               "Not quite by myself," replied Filly, stepping a little aside, by which movement
                  Grim was unveiled to the lady's view—for he had kept close at his mistress's
                  heels. "Here is my escort."
               The Señorita started back a step on beholding this huge apparition.
               "Is that your protector? Why, if he were mine, I shouldn't know
                  whether to be most afraid of him, or of the wolves. He has such a ferocious
                  look."
               Now, as the expression of Grim's face was not at all that of ferocity, but merely
                  an habitual, imperturbable calmness, such as can arise only from the consciousness
                  of being equal to any emergency, whenever, wherever, and however it may be sprung,
                  it is more than probable the Señorita only meant that, from his great size, he
                  would be exceedingly formidable as a foe, and that she would, of all things,
                  deprecate the forfeiture of his good will.
               "They say he's not pretty," said Filly, supposing the lady meant, in substance,
                  the same thing—only in a very exaggerated degree.
               "That opinion is surely correct," observed Isabella, drily, as she again looked at
                  the dog.
               "Poor old fellow!" said Filly, patting the dog's great head with her shapely hand
                  of dazzling whiteness, on which glittered several valuable and showy rings—the
                  gift of that faithless lover, to reinstate herself in whose favor was her sole
                  business here.
               Now there are not many objects more beautiful than such a hand, so decorated; and
                  the girl could have done nothing that would have tended more than this simple act
                  to mar what little beauty there was in Grim's physiognomy, and at the same time to
                  set off to advantage the caressing hand. It was, if possible, worse than the toad
                  with a jewel in his head, or the Ethiop with one in his ear—the contrast, at
                  least, was more striking. She was, however, very far from intending any such
                  thing; for, not only was Grim a favorite whom she could not for a moment think of
                  derogating in any way whatsoever, but, moreover, vanity was not one of her
                  foibles.
               Isabella, with her usual quickness, saw and appreciated all this at a glance, and
                  now became afraid she had hurt the girl's feelings. It certainly speaks well for
                  her kindness of heart, that, although the dog, under the disadvantage of the
                  contrast which his mistress had so unwittingly brought notice, looked to her eyes,
                  many fold uglier than before, she now tried to find in his face something to
                  offset her very uncomplimentary remark.
               "He has a good face, though," she said, looking, or pretending to
                  look, more closely at him: "there is nothing sneaking about it. Now I come to see
                  his expression better, I'll venture to say there's no honester dog to be found
                  anywhere."
               "You never spoke truer words, Señorita," said Filly, evidently reconciled,—and, to
                  say truth, a little touched.
               "But I want to know something about yourself," said Isabella. "What little you
                  have told me of your story only awakens my interest, and makes me wish to learn
                  more. Come—let us sit down here, and talk until supper is ready."
               Saying which, she took a seat on one of the skins— which, except during a shower,
                  or when the leaves were still wet, were
                  kept constantly beneath the trees, from an early hour until bed-time—while Filly
                  perched herself on the other one, hard by.
               "Why did you prefer to stay at the camp? I didn't know that any of our sex ever
                  stayed there?"
               "Oh, yes—a few. I—I am the daughter of one of the men."
               "Indeed!" exclaimed the Señorita, as though surprised that such a corrupt tree
                  could bring forth such fruit. "And your mother—is she living?"
               "No," replied Filly, looking down; "my mother is dead."
               "No mother—no home—and her father gone away into a bloody war!" said the Señorita,
                  in a very low tone, and in a half musing mood, as she looked away and turned her
                  gaze—it may have been mechanically, from long habit—on the lake.
               "My dear," she resumed—after a little pause—in louder tones, and again fixing her
                  eyes on the girl, "your fortunes, thus far, are much like my own—only, I think,
                  you are even more to be pitied. At least more to be pitied in some respects," she
                  added, when she thought of the lamentable condition of her heart-affairs. "I, as
                  well as yourself, have no mother. We are alike, too, in having no home; for, as
                  you may know, I have been driven from mine. I am living here now—or, rather,
                  sojourning for a little while—by the kindness of a friend, who offered me the use
                  of his house."
               "But your father's living, I suppose?" said Filly—by this time much
                  interested.
               "Alas'! no," exclaimed Isabella, glad of the melancholy luxury—rare in those
                  solitudes—of pouring her heavy sorrows into a sympathizing ear. "And that is one
                  of the strokes of fate which I find it hardest to bear: not merely that he is
                  dead—but the dreadful way in which he was butchered."
               "Butchered!" exclaimed Filly, aghast.
               "Yes—by those bloody Gachupins," replied Isabella, with a look of ineffable
                  sadness. "And not satisfied even with that," she added,—after a short pause, which
                  was compelled by a choking sensation, while her large dark eyes glistened with
                  moisture,—"they treated his poor lifeless body, like the savages that they are.
                  And as for my dear—dear mother, I have every reason to think she died from the
                  effect of these atrocities. It is certain she never rallied from the shock."
               "It seems to me, Señorita," said Filly,—with all her naturally strong sympathies
                  roused for the sad lady confronting her, yet with a certain air of hesitation, as
                  though she scarcely knew whether to say it or not,—"that you had not very good
                  ground for saying I was more to be pitied than yourself."
               "You mean, I suppose, because your father is still living? True enough. But
                  besides these, there are other things which—"
               The Señorita left the sentence unfinished, for the present—much to Filly's
                  regret—and looking away again, went off into a reverie. Great as was the girl's
                  desire to hear the rest of it, she shrank from the rudeness of asking what the
                  lady evidently wished to withhold. She could not, however, refrain from
                  speculating on what those "other things" probably were. Hope, at that moment,
                  sprang up full-fledged in her heart.
               "She can only mean,"—thus she fondly mused,—"that, although she is in love with
                  Señor, he has deserted her, instead of returning her love. And I
                  ought to know what that means!"
               "But you haven't told me your name yet. What shall I call you?" asked Isabella, rousing from her
                  absent mood.
               "My name is Filly—Whishton. Call me Filly—that's the name I've been used to."
               "Well, Filly, I am truly glad you 've come to see me. But I hope you'll stay
                  longer than to-night—much longer. Why do you wish to go to Natchitoches? Have you
                  any very particular friends there?"
               "Oh, no—I just thought it a better place for me to stay, than out there in the
                  woods; and you know I had no home to go to."
               "And so it is a better place. But, if that is all, I hope to persuade
                  you to stay with me—at least until your father comes back,—or just as long as you
                  can. I have no one at all for company now, except two old servants, and you know
                  how dull that must be. My uncle and my brother left, yesterday, for Texas, and
                  will not return until the war is over. To be sure, if we drive the Gachupins out
                  of the province, I may go back to my home near San Antonio,—but, then, it may be a
                  long time before that is done. You can't imagine how lonely I have felt ever since
                  my uncle and brother left me; and if you had n't come, I really don't think I
                  could have endured it much longer. When you came so suddenly on me a little while
                  ago, I was thinking seriously of breaking up here, and going to Natchitoches
                  myself,—as much as I dislike the thought of leaving such a beautiful place as
                  this. But if you will only promise to stay with me, I would much rather remain
                  here just as long as I can keep you: I don't like to live in a town. Will you
                  promise me?"
               "I should be delighted to do so," replied the girl,—who hated, even worse than the
                  Señorita, to be cramped up in town. "But—"
               "But what—dear?"
               Filly, as we have seen, had had sharp compunctions about leaving her kind old
                  friend, Mrs. Davies, in suspense about her, even for one night only; and now, when
                  she thought how cruel it would be to protract that suspense to an indefinite
                  period, she saw the necessity of at least letting her know where she had resolved
                  to cast her lot. This reflection it was which had arrested her tongue in the
                  middle of the sentence.
               "There's something I shall have to attend to in town before I can make that
                  promise," replied Filly.
               "Is it something that requires your personal attention? or can I send Miguel in
                  with a note from you," said the Señorita,—"or a message," she added, as she
                  thought of the very great probability that the poor girl could neither read nor
                  write.
               "Perhaps that would do," said Filly.
               "Oh, no—it wouldn't," she continued when it occurred to her, that she owed it to
                  her old friend in town, after running away from her, not only to go in person and
                  explain her conduct, but to bid her good-bye, before separating from her for,
                  probably, a long time. "I have something else to do there, that I must do
                  myself."
               "Well, when will you be obliged to go? Put it off as long as you can."
               "Oh, I can't possibly put it off longer than to-morrow."
               "But you will come back to me soon?"
               "Yes; Grim and I can walk in," she said, laying her hand affectionately on the
                  neck of the dog, who, making himself at home, as was his wont, wherever he chanced
                  to be, had lain down beside his mistress on the skin of that same dreadful bear,
                  which, with the Captain's timely assistance, he had slain nearly a year before.
                  "And if I'm not too tired we can come back the next day."
               "Do you never ride on horseback, Filly?"
               
               "Oh yes—whenever I get a chance. I think it's splendid to be on a horse. But I
                  never had a horse; and, so, I've learned to take long walks. I can ride pretty
                  well, though: I often rode Señor's horse."
               "Who is Señor?"
               "He 's—one of the men."
               "A Spaniard, I suppose: Señor is a Spanish word."
               "Oh, no—he's an American," replied Filly, by this time blushing, and looking quite
                  confused, into the bargain.
               Instantly seeing this, the Señorita very considerately forbore to pursue any
                  further the fortuitous investigation, and returned to the original subject. The
                  impression, however, was, then and there, made upon her—which, indeed, remained to
                  the last—that this mysterious "Señor," whatever his right name might be, was the
                  girl's lover, and one, too, on whom she had most probably deigned to smile. It
                  was, in itself, a trivial circumstance; but served, through the mysterious
                  workings of sympathy, to draw the lone girl still closer into her favor.
               "Now, I have a nice pony," said Isabella; "and you must n't think of walking so
                  far. Miguel will go in with you to-morrow morning; and I don't see why you can't
                  return in the afternoon."
               "Why, yes," replied the girl, delighted at the prospect of such a rare treat: "if
                  I ride, there's nothing to prevent my coming back to-morrow."
               By this time it was nearly dark. Stefanita now came out to announce supper, and
                  the ladies withdrew to the house.
               Filly's was one of those natures which are subject to abrupt transitions, from
                  cheerfulness to despondency, and the reverse, (though her cheerfulness, of late
                  days, seldom came in a very demonstrative guise,) often without adequate cause,
                  and, indeed, at times with no cause at all, so far as a person of greater
                  equanimity might have been able to judge. From having been, just now, so hopeful
                  that Gatewood cared more for her than he did for the Señorita, she soon found
                  herself plunged again into the depths of despair. All she had yet seen of this
                  lady had impressed her not only favorably, but almost to the verge of adoration.
                  The beauty of her person, the marvellous sweetness of her expression, her charming
                  manners, her exquisite grace, her gentleness, her rich, low, winsome voice,—and,
                  above all, the ever kind turn of her sentiments,—had sunk so deeply into her
                  simple heart, that she no longer presumed to think for a moment, that she herself,
                  who had never enjoyed any of those inestimable advantages, which contact with the
                  world of fashion gives its votaries—if they will but properly avail themselves of
                  them, instead of, as they too often do, so mixing with it, that it proves a curse
                  rather than a blessing—I say, she did not presume to think that she could bear off
                  the palm from any such rival in love as this. On her way to town, next day, her
                  musings showed that her sole bright hope of the previous evening was already
                  gloomed over.
               "Her sadness cannot be—as I thought it was—for want of Señor's love: I have no
                  longer any doubt that he loves her. He must love her. How could any
                  man be with such a woman, as much as they say he has been with her, and not lose
                  his heart? I used to think he loved me: he told me so—often, and
                  often; and I suppose he was sincere. But from the moment he met with
                     her, (it could not have been otherwise,) I was undone! Well, how
                  could he help it? He had eyes, and she had all these charms. I shall have to
                  forgive him: but ah, it will be hard to do! Forget him, I never can.
               "I should like to live with her all my life. Yes—even after they are married—if
                  only as a friend to both. I would be willing to do almost anything—make almost
                     any sacrifice—to win her love, and
                  keep it. Ah! the greatest sacrifice is already made.
               "Here am I, thinking about winning her love, when I have already deceived her so.
                  I'm so sorry I told her such stories—and she, all the time, so kind. It was
                  cruel—it was treacherous. To tell her that Señor was one of the men! To tell her,
                  too, that I was the daughter of one of the men! And that my father was still
                  living! Well, he may be living, for anything I know; but I shall never see him,
                  nor know who he is—never.
               "I wish, so much, I had told her the truth—or not told her anything at all. But I
                  had to say something. Oh, I do wish I had stayed where I was, and not
                  gone near her. I can never tell her the truth about it, now; for that would be
                  owning that I told a lie before,—and with all her kindness to me, that would never
                  do. But I'll do this much: I'll go back to her and cheer her lonely hours as well
                  as I can.
               "May it not be, after all, that she does not return Señor's love? No—no—what woman
                  is there in the world that would n't love him? There is nothing left
                  me but to bear it as best I can."
               It must be owned that the girl rather complicated than improved her heart-affairs,
                  by this venturesome visit to the lake, which, before starting out, she had so
                  fondly flattered herself would better her prospects. When she came, she was in
                  love with but one; whereas, she now found herself deeply smitten with another—and
                  that, a rival—one, too, who would most probably bear off the palm.

                  ACCORDING to promise, Filly returned that evening to the lake, "bag
                  and baggage,"—prepared to stay with her new-made friend. She had found Mrs. Davies
                  in great distress over her sudden and mysterious disappearance. The old lady, on
                  missing her, had lost not a moment in causing thorough search to be made, not only
                  in the town, but some distance in the surrounding country; while, at the same
                  time, she dispatched to the site of the late camp an emissary, who was instructed
                  to extend his investigations thereabouts, and as far beyond as the miserable
                  shanties in which most of the wives and wantons of Gatewood's men were hived
                  during the absence of the latter toward Texas. To have sent, for this purpose,
                  into the unpeopled wilderness, at large,—houseless—pathless—limitless—as it
                  was,—would have been the height of madness.
               These various searches having proved alike futile, the old dame, although still
                  sorely wrung, had begun to feel in her heart a little of that comfort which always
                  comes from having done one's best in a good cause, when, in stepped Filly and put
                  an instant end—for the time at least—to her solicitude. Her first joy over, she
                  listened absorbedly to the girl's story, of which the latter, of course, told only
                  so much as her ancient friend had a
                  clear right to know. Then came the reprimand—which, on the whole, was not a very
                  crushing one—and next, the startling announcement from Filly, that she was going
                  to return to the lake that very evening, by urgent invitation of the Señorita, to
                  stay with her while her friends were absent on military business.
               Mrs. Davies was a good deal shocked (in her way) to hear this, which she thought
                  savored somewhat of ingratitude. But when she came to recollect that Filly, in
                  taking this course, was but doing the very thing she herself had advised her to do
                  only a day or two before, except, indeed, that she was taking Time a little by the
                  forelock, (which, however, she readily admitted, was, all things considered, a
                  much safer hold on the old fellow than the fetlock,) she gave in with a very good
                  grace, and, like the benevolent creature she was, declared, in the end, her entire
                  willingness for the withdrawal of the only spot of sunshine that had lit up her
                  cheerless old walls for many a day. Accordingly, the two took an affectionate
                  leave of each other, and, as was said, a few lines back, Filly reached the lake in
                  safety.
               Grim, who had received his mistress's mandate, to stay there until she came back,
                  did so with his wonted fidelity; and had she stayed away very much longer—nay, had
                  the sky fallen, I verily believe he would have remained as faithfully at his post,
                  as did his counterpart, the old Roman sentinel, at the gate of Pompeii, through
                  all the fearful time when the Sicilian sky came as near falling as perhaps a sky
                  ever did—when cinders, ashes, and fire were being rained on that devoted city. Our
                  four-footed Roman, however—now, no doubt, become a little nervous on the subject
                  of separation from his mistress—had shown what were, for him, unusual signs of
                  anxiety about her return. He had, for instance, kept constantly on that side of
                  the house from which she had started forth; and had there been any one
                  scrutinizing his movements—which, however, there was not—he might have been seen
                  to look often up the path she had taken, and even to wander forth occasionally a
                  few rods in that direction, as though hoping to catch sight of her returning
                  figure. And when she came at last, there was visible a sparkle in his usually
                  listless eye, while his tail, like certain military campaigns,—first proposed, I
                  believe, by one Horatio Whitetile, but, from some cause, not very successfully
                  executed at the time,—"short, sharp, and decisive," would actually have suggested
                  to any one who could have seen the point just then, something of a wag.
               From this time forth, it is almost needless to say, Filly and the Señorita were
                  fast friends. They were like two fond sisters who have met after a long
                  separation. Their life here was necessarily monotonous; but they kept constantly
                  together, and by the exercise of a little concerted ingenuity, managed almost
                  daily to vary the general routine to such degree as to make things quite
                  endurable. In the matter of reading, to which both were exceedingly partial, they
                  were unfortunately very limited. Could they have had plenty of choice books, Time
                  would have moulted at once his heavy wing, and, donning gossamer instead, would
                  have borne them lightly enough along. Isabella usually sent the old Mexican to
                  town every two or three days, to gather any news that might be stirring, or to
                  purchase groceries, or other articles essential to run the domestic machinery with
                  any kind of comfort. On these occasions he had a standing order to bring back with
                  him such newspapers or books as he might find purchasable. The consequence was, he
                  rarely returned without one or more of the former—but to get possession of a book
                  was indeed a rare event.
               
               Miguel, although by no means an Isaak Walton, usually managed to keep the
                  establishment well supplied with such fish as abounded in the lake. Nor was he
                  either a Nimrod, or a "crack" shot,—yet, where game was so abundant that a gun
                  discharged, at random, into a thicket, might be reasonably expected to bring
                  something down,—a deer, or a turkey, or something else, and possibly all
                  three,—must have been very derelict indeed, had he suffered the ladies to be
                  stinted in viands. On one occasion of his going forth, armed and equipped, to do
                  justifiable murder upon the denizens of the forest, the ladies, for the sake of
                  the excitement it promised, accompanied him to the deer-station and thence to the
                  turkey-roost. This once, however, sufficed for all time. To be sure, they were
                  variety-seekers, and here was no lack of variety,—but it could hardly be said to
                  be of agreeable quality. They had been accustomed, when they had before gone forth
                  with hunters—as, indeed, both of them had often done—to seeing the victim fall
                  dead in its tracks from a ball sent with unerring aim through brain or heart. But
                  Miguel—although he no doubt did the thing as neatly as he could, and began to
                  think himself a "star" hunter—made really such a bungle of it, that the mangled
                  animal was a long time in the death-throes, and at last was put out of its
                  protracted misery after most unscientific fashions,—a deer, by crushing the skull
                  with the rifle-butt; one of the feathered tribe, by a wrench of the neck,—both
                  methods producing sounds revolting to the ear of any but a veritable savage.
               Not wishing to witness, a second time, the agonies of the poor dumb creatures,—who
                  not only had done them no harm while living, but were likely, after due
                  preparation by Stefanita, to do them much good when dead,—they henceforth and
                  forever firmly but courteously declined the urgent gent solicitations of the old
                  Mexican to attend his bloody exhibitions,—when not fellow-creatures, to be sure,
                  as of old, but poor innocent brutes, were to be "butchered to make a holiday."
               They sometimes strolled out into the woods to gather flowers, Grim always acting
                  as escort. The Señorita was at first very loth to go, for fear of encountering
                  wild beasts; and when at length she did consent to make the venture, could not be
                  persuaded to trust herself out of sight of the house. On her companion's
                  assurance, however, confidently given and frequently iterated, that there was not
                  the least danger when Grim was about,—backed by many stories of his prowess in
                  throttling the largest and most ferocious beasts to death, single-handed,—Isabella
                  was induced to extend her walk a little every day, until, finally, she ventured as
                  far as she pleased without a fear, or even a thought, of molestation.
               The Señorita would sometimes vary these pedestrian excursions by sallying forth,
                  with Filly behind her, on the pony—Miguel's horse being a mule, (by an "Irish
                  bull,") and therefore scarcely ridable by a lady, consistently with comfort. Thus
                  mounted, they would thread the woods, along the bridle-paths, for miles; and
                  although more than once lost on these occasions, their four-footed factotum—their
                  walking forest-encyclopædia—the inevitable Grim, when appealed to show them the
                  way back, was never for a moment at a loss.
               But the lake was their favorite place of resort. When Filly first caught sight of
                  the little boat,—when strolling on the beach, alone, one day soon after her
                  arrival,—she resolved she would learn to row, so that she and the Señorita might
                  glide away over the bright water whenever and whithersoever they pleased. With
                  this determination, and without more ado, she leaped into the beautiful wee
                     craft, and taking up an oar, pushed
                  out boldly from the shelving beach. No sooner, however, did she feel the peculiar
                  sensation which such motion imparts to a person who has never experienced it, or,
                  having once experienced it, has long since forgotten what it is, than she felt a
                  chord in her memory, which had not been awakened for years, so rudely swept, that
                  its vibrations thrilled through her whole soul. How slight oft-times the
                  influences which thus rouse the emotions,—bringing up thoughts and
                  recollections—the bitter no less than the sweet—which, for years, had lain
                  dormant, or buried in oblivion. A sudden whiff of your dead sweetheart's favorite
                  flower, coming upon you, it may be, in the midst of gayety, may recall some happy
                  tryst when she wore that flower over her heart, and when the tide of your love
                  flowed along in unwonted smoothness, with no warning of the rocks so close ahead.
                  The cooing of a distant dove may bring back to your recollection that evening
                  when, a child, you went out, alone and forlorn, to muse for the first time over
                  your mother's grave—for then, as now, that mournful voice was plaining to you from
                  afar. And so it is with the other senses.
               So, too, it was with Filly. She had not even so much as seen a boat for years; but
                  when she felt this one gliding along under her, from the sudden impulse she had
                  given it, there trooped up, as from the very grave, memories of that wilder life
                  she had once led, when, in a frail canoe, guided by swarthy, often bloody, hands,
                  she had stemmed the rapids of dashing rivers, or shot over the surface of some
                  glassy lake that was set, like a gem, in the wilderness which was even then her
                  home.
               So vividly did the renewal of this long unfelt motion recall those hours of her
                  cheerless childhood, and so painfully did the thought of them affect her, that she
                  at once dropped the oar and sank down into the bottom of the boat. Resolved,
                  however, not to give way (so foolishly, as she thought it) to a mere recollection,
                  in a few minutes she rose and resumed the oar; and in her persistent efforts to
                  guide and propel the boat, her attention was so completely diverted from the dread
                  association which had upset her equanimity, that she forgot all about it.
               Day after day, henceforward, could she have been seen thus practising upon the
                  lake; and it was not many days before she had made herself—considering the time
                  and opportunities of her apprenticeship—a pretty fair oarswoman,—at least,
                  sufficiently so to induce Isabella, on an urgent invitation, to venture out with
                  her. And from that time, scarcely a day passed that they were not skimming about
                  over the water, circumnavigating the miniature islands, or lolling listlessly in
                  the boat, with the oars shipped, leaving it to the sport of the breeze and of the
                  little waves of the lake, which swung it lazily on its gently breathing bosom;
                  while the Señorita, who always took her guitar along on these occasions, would
                  sing some stirring patriotic ballad, which suited well her own taste; or, as was
                  much oftener the case, some melancholy love-song which accorded with the tastes of
                  both.
               But while the two girls were such fast friends, neither had more than the vaguest
                  suspicion of the main secret of the other's life—that which, more than all other
                  things combined, influenced the thoughts, motives, and feelings of her companion.
                  The one labored under the delusion that she really knew a good deal about the
                  other's heart-affairs; but it was, at most, only a delusion. The other had but
                  made a sort of wild conjecture that her guest had been smitten with that passion,
                  which to herself had proved at once the joy and misery of life. Filly may
                  sometimes have wondered why, if the Señorita really loved Gatewood, she had never
                  even so much as mentioned his name, when she had been far from reticent about other matters no
                  less personal to herself. But when she came to think of it fully, was not that
                  self-imposed silence a very strong proof, in itself, that she loved him—and that,
                  too, with so deep a love that she could not lightly utter his name?
                     "I would not speak of him to others," she thought, "either now, or
                  when I used to think he loved me so well."
               Moreover, when she recollected that, on the first evening of their meeting, the
                  Señorita, during their conversation, partly pronounced his name, then checked
                  herself, and looking confused, finally passed entirely around it, she was
                  led—judging from what her own feelings would have been in the same predicament—to
                  hold this, too, as a sure sign of love. She did not, for a moment, suspect that
                  her hostess's real motive for silence with regard to him was, that she wished to
                  dismiss him entirely from her mind, except in so far as he was a champion of her
                  country's freedom; and that, even as such, it would have pained her exceedingly to
                  allow his name to pass her lips—even those lips on which his passionate kisses
                  had, but a few days ago, been imprinted. She was offering herself up as a
                  sacrifice to a hallowed cause; the bare thought of an immolation so ruinous to her
                  individual happiness agonized her; the bare thought of the glorious end to be
                  attained for her bleeding country elated and sustained her. But whether thinking
                  of this theme or of the other, she felt that her use of his name was but so much
                  unnecessary self-torture.
               The two, then, keeping clear of love, talked of almost everything else. Filly, on
                  her part, gave the Señorita a detailed, and by no means uninteresting account of
                  how she had spent her life in camp, together with her views and feelings amid
                  surroundings of a character so very exceptional—taking care, of course, to keep
                  out of sight her relations with the Chief—indeed, without once throwing out the
                  remotest hint that she had even a casual acquaintance with him.
               On the other hand, the Señorita, with the exception of that passion which had
                  tinged the whole woof of her existence, gave her companion, at various times, such
                  glimpses of her past as could not but prove both entertaining and instructive to
                  one who had derived from novels alone nearly all the knowledge of society which
                  she possessed—a detail of real experience in matters of the fashionable world
                  being to her something wholly new. The truth is, Isabella became—though without
                  once thinking of it in that light—the instructress of this friendless and
                  untutored girl. Whether they were riding, or boating, or roaming on foot through
                  the woods, she was delivering a series of peripatetic lectures,—which, though
                  entirely improvised and without systematic arrangement, were, as regards the
                  edification they afforded and their refining influence on the audience, far above
                  the stolen thunder which is hurled forth in the vaunted lyceums of certain
                  sections by the conceited Jovelings of the present day.
               The most frequent topic, however, and one on which Isabella delighted particularly
                  to dwell, was the history and existing condition of her native country. That this
                  subject was constantly nearest her heart, it is to be hoped the reader has already
                  seen and believed; and that she should think it of no ordinary interest to her
                  guest seems surely reasonable when we take into account her belief that the
                  latter's father, and perhaps her lover, were on the march to do battle in behalf
                  of that country. And when she found that Filly listened to her favorite theme with
                  the most intense interest, this discovery only incited her to set forth still more
                  eloquently the sufferings and wrongs so long endured by her
                  fellow-citizens,—wholly ignorant, all
                  the time, of the fact, that, even had Filly a father, and had that father been
                  enlisted in the cause, her own betrothed—but alas, not her beloved!—who likewise
                  was in the patriot ranks, was far dearer to the girl than any father could be—that
                  around him circled alike all her thoughts by day and all her dreams by night.

                        I see some sparkles of a better hope.

                        As You Like It.
                     
                  
               
               
                  ONE evening, the Señorita and her companion were reclining, side by
                  side, in the hammock, discussing the prospects of the campaign which was then
                  being initiated.
               "Suppose," said Filly, after they had talked a good while, "our army, or a part of
                  it, should be captured: what do you think would be their fate?"
               She said their fate—but she thought, his fate.
               "Filly, don't let us think of that—rather let us think of a brighter ending. I
                  cannot bear even to imagine them in the hands of such cruel foes as those
                  Gachupins are; for, if not murdered outright,—as I have already told you was the
                  fate of my father and so many of our noblest leaders,—they would no doubt be
                  doomed to drag out, in dungeons, or the scarcely less dreadful mines, such
                  wretched lives as might well make them pray for death to relieve them."
               The speaker, as she said this, was thinking of Queretaro's horrors, which she had
                  witnessed; and as they came so vividly back upon her memory, she shuddered through
                  her whole frame.
               "Don't let us think of it," she repeated: "it is too horrible!"
               "You shudder, Señorita, at the mere thought of any one being thrown into a Mexican
                  prison. And I don't wonder, for I shuddered once myself, on hearing a poor
                  prisoner, who had escaped from one of them, tell his sad story. It was, indeed, so
                  dreadful, that I would n't let him go on with it, but begged him to—"
               "You heard a—When?—Where?—Who?" exclaimed the Señorita, starting suddenly to her
                  elbow, and manifesting such intense interest in her friend's words, that the
                  latter, wholly at a loss to account for it, became, for a little while, quite
                  disconcerted, and could make no reply.
               Perceiving this, Isabella, with great effort, suppressed her excitement somewhat,
                  and said, with an air of comparative calmness, though she was still perceptibly
                  affected:
               "Filly, when did you see such a prisoner?" then added, by way of explanation, "I
                  had a friend once, who escaped from a Mexican prison: I have never since been able
                  to hear anything of him. This very person may have been my friend."
               "Well," replied Filly, "I saw him about three years ago."
               "Where?" asked the other, eagerly.
               "He came into our camp. He was so broken down by his terrible journey in escaping,
                  that he lay ill there a long time."
               Filly here recited to the Señorita the bare outlines of what she had done for the
                  poor sufferer; and so far from according herself justice with regard to the
                  service, which, although a mere child,
                  she had rendered him in her voluntary capacity of nurse, in his helpless—well-nigh
                  hopeless—condition, she chose not to dwell on the affecting details of such kindly
                  attentions, as he lay, through many long weeks of fever and delirium, writhing and
                  groaning in the Chief's tent, which the latter had given up wholly for his
                  accommodation. In a word, it was to her untiring care and devotion that he owed
                  his life.
               If Isabella, for any reason, really wished to keep her secret from her companion,
                  it was well for her that the shades of twilight now veiled her face. To be sure,
                  she had succeeded in bringing under control her voice, which at first had
                  trembled, and indeed almost wholly failed her, and she had likewise in a great
                  measure repressed certain outward signs of eagerness, which, at the outset of this
                  impending development, she had betrayed,—but a ghostly pallor still pervaded her
                  countenance, and she was fain to keep her hand pressed upon her heart to moderate
                  its fearful throbbings—signs of her dreadful suspense, which Filly, owing to the
                  imperfect light, could know nothing of.
               "What—was his—name?" Isabella managed to falter forth,—afraid to ask, yet hoping
                  that the name, which was still, as it had been for years, dearer to her than any
                  on earth, might, in answer to her inquiry, come from the girl's lips. Had it been
                  so, it had been the sweetest sound that ever thrilled her soul. How great, then,
                  was her disappointment, when Filly said, after a little pause, to ransack her
                  memory:
               "Señorita, really, I have forgotten."
               "Forgotten!—surely, not forgotten? Would you know it if you were to hear it?"
               "I think so. I am almost sure of it. Yes, Señorita, I know I would."
               "Was it King?" demanded Isabella, hanging on the reply.
               "No—that was not it."
               "Not Carlos King? Think again," she said, heart-sick with this sudden extinction
                  of her hope, strangled, like a still-born babe, at the very moment of its
                  birth.
               "No, I'm certain that was not his name. His first name, I remember perfectly, is a
                  very common one among us Americans; it was John—Juan, I believe you call it in
                  your language. As I never called him anything else but Mr. John, and very seldom
                  heard his other name, I have forgotten it. I know it was a rather queer one,
                  though; and I'm confident, that, if I could only hear it pronounced, I should
                  remember it at once."
               It made no difference now to the Señorita what the name was, since she had found
                  it was not Carlos King,—and so suddenly did her intense interest in
                  the poor prisoner subside, that it was even doubtful whether she heard at all the
                  last portion of the girl's answer. She sank back to her original position in the
                  hammock, and resigned herself to a despair which was far worse than before. It was
                  as when the midnight lightning dazzles for an instant our eyes which we were
                  straining to discern our way along some chasm's verge, and leaves us in tenfold
                  gloom. But as, after the flash, we come again to see a little, until at length we
                  are enabled to grope darklingly above the abyss as before, so her heart gradually
                  regained its not quite rayless condition.
               The two remained in silence many minutes. At length the Señorita started up again,
                  as a new gleam (alas, she did not know it was a fleeting will-o'-the-wisp!) shot
                  athwart her cheerless path.
               "Did he escape from the Queretaro prison, Filly?" she asked.
               "No: from Monclova. I have a very distinct recollection of
                  that—because I had often heard of Monclova before."
               
               This reply quenched again all her hope. She had thought it possible that this last
                  name might have been assumed, with the view of aiding his disguise whilst
                  escaping, and, from policy, not laid aside, even after he reached Gatewood's camp.
                  But gathering from the girl's answer that this was not her prisoner
                  of Queretaro, she dismissed him from her thoughts.
               "Filly," said the Señorita, the next evening, as they strolled, in a more than
                  usually pensive mood, a short distance into the wood, "let's sit down here on this
                  log, which looks so tempting with its mossy cushion: I wish to have a little talk
                  with you on the same subject we were discussing yesterday evening."
               The two accordingly took their seats together on the log.
               "You said you had forgotten the name of the prisoner who escaped from Monclova and
                  was so long sick in your camp," the Señorita began. "But I think, too, you said,
                  that, if you were to hear his name, you would know it?"
               "Oh, yes, Señorita,—I should, without the least doubt."
               "And I suppose, if you were to see it written, you could n't fail to recognize
                  it?"
               "Of course not."
               "Then, Filly, glance over this list,—or, rather, read carefully every name on
                  it,"—said Isabella, drawing a paper from her bosom, unfolding it, and handing it
                  to the girl,—"and tell me whether that name is there or rot. These are the
                  Americans who are enlisted in our cause. My uncle, who gave me the list, said it
                  embraced all of them."
               Filly took the paper, and cheerfully addressed herself to the task put upon her.
                  It was, however, no easy one; for, not only had the names been carelessly copied,
                  and with evident hurry, but the copying had been done with very pale ink. She had,
                  therefore, to give each word a careful mental spelling before she could decide
                  whether or not it was the one so longed for.
               Isabella watched this slow procedure with much apparent solicitude, and with a
                  degree of impatience that could not have been mistaken by any one watching the
                  workings of her face. Long, therefore, before her companion had got half through
                  the list, she was on the point of taking it from her hand and reading it aloud to
                  her,—which she could have done with much more dispatch than the girl could
                  decipher them, from the fact that she had already gone over them all, from
                  beginning to end, perhaps a score of times, since the list had been in her
                  possession. Just as she was in the act, however, of seizing upon it with this
                  intention, Filly exclaimed, her face betraying the deep interest which she felt in
                  the matter:
               "There it is!—John Gatley—I remember it so well, now that I see it.
                     There, Señorita, John Gatley," she repeated, reaching the list out
                  toward Isabella and pointing with her finger to the name. "Mr. John I used to call
                  him. I don't believe I ever called him Mr. Gatley after the first day he told me
                  his name. And I hardly ever heard any one else call him that, for it was very
                  seldom that any one else saw him while he was sick; and almost as soon as he got
                  well enough to sit up, he left, on one of the camp-horses which was given him.
                  It's hardly any wonder, then, that I forgot his name," she added, apologetically.
                  "But that's it—I'm just as certain as I ever was of anything in my life. What was
                  your friend's name? I really forget."
               Seeing that the Señorita, from absent-mindedness, or some other cause, was not
                  likely to answer, Filly, after a brief rummaging of her memory, was able to recall
                  the other name.
               
               "Oh, yes—Carlos King. Well, the names are not much alike, I must confess."
               "No," said the other, roused from her abstraction at the sound of that name ever
                  dear to her. "But, Filly, it has struck me, that he may have gone under an assumed
                  name, at that time, for the greater safety it would afford."
               "But why should he not go back to his own name now?" asked Filly.
               "That quite puzzles me," replied Isabella, "though it is possible he may have some
                  good reason for it."
               "I don't see what it can be, then," returned the girl, discouragingly enough.
               "Well," replied the Señorita, "one reason that occurs to me, is, if captured in
                  this war, and recognized as the escaped prisoner, by means of his name—which I
                  suppose has long ago been made known to all the Spanish officials—it would
                  probably go much harder with him."
               "Yes—there may be something in that. But, then, Señorita, he did n't escape from
                  the same prison as your—friend."
               Now, Filly had by this time begun to think that this unfortunate man must be more
                  than a mere friend; hence, her hesitation about whether she might not use a
                  stronger word. Indeed, the Señorita, even so long ago as during the colloquy of
                  the previous evening, supposed that Filly had guessed her secret. She, however,
                  had not chosen to make confession of her heart-affairs in so many words, though
                  she had, from that time forward, no objection in the world to the girl knowing of
                  them if she could manage to find them out for herself from any language that might
                  escape her lips—from any sign she might give—or from any deed she might do—in her
                  endeavors to solve this mystery, possibly so vital to her happiness.
               "That is true," said the Señorita, dejectedly; "my friend escaped from
                  Queretaro."
               There was nothing more said for several minutes.
               "Well, Filly," resumed Isabella at length, "I have one more question to ask you:
                  your answer to that will determine whether I shall ever trouble you again on this
                  subject. If the prisoner's hair was black, or very dark, or if his eyes were
                  blue,—he was, beyond all doubt, not the friend I seek."
               "But," replied the girl, "his eyes were brown,—and his hair was neither black nor
                  very dark."
               "What then?"
               "Yellow."
               "Do you mean, golden?" demanded Isabella, earnestly.
               "Oh, yes—golden: that expresses the color exactly."
               "Are you sure?" exclaimed Isabella, starting from her seat to a position
                  confronting the girl, and leaning forward, with a hand on each of the latter's
                  shoulders,—as though resolved to catch every syllable she might utter.
               "I'm quite sure, Señorita; for, one day, when he had begun to recover, and I was
                  combing his hair, and trying to get the tangles out—for it was very long and
                  wavy—the sun came out from behind a cloud and shone through it. I had never seen
                  hair like it before, and I recollect so well, I said to him, 'Mr. John, your hair
                  looks just like gold.' 'Yes,' he said, I believe it does, when a sunbeam gets
                  tangled in it.'"
               "His very hair!" exclaimed Isabella, sinking back again to her seat on the log.
                  "Oh, it may be Carlos yet!"
               "But how can it be, Señorita, when he bears an altogether different name, and
                  escaped from a different prison?"
               "I do not know. Oh, Filly, for mercy's sake, don't crush to death what little hope
                  I have! No—no—let me still hope, if I can—though ever so little."
               But the girl's reason for not regarding the matter in a more encouraging light, was by no means because she
                  sought to destroy the Señorita's hopeful prospects: she would have done almost
                  anything to bless her. It was because this was such joyful news for herself as
                  well, that she could not believe it true. And it was joyful news, for the reason
                  that, should her rival's former lover—for lover she, by this time, firmly believed
                  him to be—come, and bear her off, Señor might yet restore her to her
                  olden place in his affections.
               "Now, Filly, to find out whether this is so or not: how can it be done?"
               "How can it be done?" echoed the girl, with an eagerness that might
                  well have surprised the other, had her thoughts not been so intensely preoccupied
                  "Oh, if I could only help you to do that, Señorita!" "I think you can
                  help me," said the Señorita!"
               "I think you can help me," said the Señorita, with a calmness that
                  was truly marvellous when compared with her recent exhibition of feeling; for now
                  she found, that, before there could be any hope of success, clear, unbiassed
                  judgment must be brought to bear upon this question of how to do the thing,—while
                  all bewildering emotion must be laid aside. "Miguel has just returned from
                  Natchitoches, and in questioning him for news—as you know I always do when he has
                  been to town—I learned that all the American volunteers leave Natchitoches
                  to-morrow morning, at a very early hour, on their march to Texas. As they are
                  infantry, noon, or a little after, will probably be the time they will pass near
                  here. Now, if you will only ride out to the main road, station yourself there, and
                  eye them closely as they file along, you will no doubt see Mr. Gatley. Should you
                  know him now, Filly, think you?"
               "Know him, indeed! To be sure: I shall never forget that face."
               "Call him aside; and when you shall get to where none may hear you, and after you
                  have told him who you are,—if he does not recognize you, which he may not do, as
                  you were a mere child when he saw you last,—whisper in his ear the name—not this
                  name here on the list, but the old name I told you of—you know what it is. It will
                  be a talisman that will probably make him betray himself to you on the spot, even
                  if he should be loth to put off his disguise. And, Filly, should it be he—you—you
                  will know what to do then. Will you do this much for me?"
               "Oh, yes—I will—to be sure I will: I'll do anything—anything!"
               Filly perhaps never made a promise more willingly than this one; and when the hour
                  of noon approached, she never started forth more cheerfully to do another's
                  bidding.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
                           I shall have share in this most happy work.
                        
                     
                     
                        Twelfth Night.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        The image of it gives me content already, and I trust it will grow to a
                           most prosperous perfection.
                     
                     —Measure for Measure.
                     
                  
               
               
                  MOUNTED on Isabella's pony, and accompanied, of course, by Grim,
                  Filly soon reached the road. Scarcely had she selected a point favorable for
                  viewing the men as they should pass, before she thought she could distinguish,
                  coming from towards the town, the roll of a still distant drum. Only a few minutes
                  more were required to confirm fully her opinion as to the nature of the sound. She
                  seated herself at the root of a tree, and awaited the crisis with what patience she could command. In
                  less than an hour, the sound had come so near, that she found herself straining
                  her eyes to catch the first glimpse of the column, as it should emerge, at the
                  nearest turn in the road, from behind the woods which, as yet, concealed it from
                  her view. Presently, the thin outskirts of a dust-cloud floated slowly around the
                  turn; and ere the maiden's throbbing heart had told ten more pulsations, the head
                  of the column appeared. Soon it came quite abreast of her station; and as they
                  marched past, many a glance was turned upon this fairy apparition and the canine
                  giant who attended her—many a comment was made complimentary of her beauty,—and
                  many words of wonder as to who she could be, were exchanged. They probably thought
                  her the daughter of some adventurous Daniel Boone who had settled hereabouts.
               Filly, however, did not observe their glances—did not heed, nor even hear, their
                  words. She was wholly intent on the one object which had brought her there—to
                  subject to the closest scrutiny every face that passed. When about half the column
                  had gone by, a halt was ordered, that all might rest awhile under the shade; for
                  it was the month of June, and the mid-day sun beat down on them with oppressive
                  heat. They accordingly broke ranks,—some seating themselves beneath the trees by
                  the road-side, to converse, or laugh and joke,—others penetrating into the woods,
                  and perching themselves on fallen trees, or stretching out their limbs at
                  ease,—some in groups, others solitary,—on the dead leaves that covered the earth,
                  to meditate, peradventure, on the momentous undertaking before them, which they
                  fondly imagined was to result in the founding of a new nation, or the re-modelling
                  of an old one, on the immortal principles that they had been so well taught by
                  their fathers how to maintain.
               It was one of these last, that Filly—catching but a partial sight of him at a
                  distance, through the growth of the forest—took to be the one whom she was in
                  search of; and on approaching him (leading her horse) as he lay leaning on his
                  elbow, apart from the rest and quite out of their sight, she recognized him as,
                  beyond all question, the man she had nursed three years before through a long and
                  dangerous illness.
               When he left the camp, the traces of disease were still visible on his person—his
                  form was somewhat bent—his step was still languid, and his face pale and haggard.
                  Even in that forlorn condition the girl—making due allowance for such
                  disadvantages—had been greatly impressed with his appearance. But now when she
                  came suddenly upon him in full possession of health and vigor, she found him a man
                  of no common mould as regards both symmetry of person and manly beauty of face. By
                  this time, however, she was too much interested and excited by the prospects
                  opening before her, to make any very particular note of his prepossessing
                  points.
               Discovering her approach, he rose to his feet, and by the act—gracefully done—a
                  tall, straight, well-knit figure was displayed to the greatest advantage. His
                  long, auburn hair swept his shoulders. He had before taken off his cap to admit to
                  his heated brow the ever cool air of those deep shades. His forehead was a noble
                  one, broad, and high, and beetling—as though a very fortress of thought. A silky,
                  brown beard decorated the lower part of his face and hung far down over his deep
                  muscular chest.
               As the girl drew very rear him, still leading her horse, his large eyes, of a dark
                  hazel hue, beamed on her mildly enough, but, also, with an expression made up of
                  wonder and surprise.
               "Mr. Gatley," she began, seeing she was not recognized, "I reckon you don't know
                  me."
               
               "I do not," he replied, in deep rich tones, as he stepped forward. "Is it some one
                  I ought to know?"
               "You certainly ought, sir, if I had not changed so: I was but a little thing when
                  you saw me last. But perhaps if I were to call you Mr. John, you would—"
               "Oh, it's Filly!" he exclaimed, seizing her in his arms, and before she could
                  prevent it—if she would have done so—imprinting a kiss on her cheek, doubtless
                  regarding her—as she lived in his recollection—a mere child.
               The girl flushed at this, and stepping back and looking just a little bit
                  dignified, said:
               "Mr. Gatley, you forget that I am a woman now."
               "Oh, I beg pardon, Filly," he said, somewhat confused under the gentle rebuke.
                  "Why, you do begin to look like a woman, sure enough. I really forgot that you
                  could ever get to be one—you were so small then. You were large enough, though, to
                  save my life, Filly; for I shall always think you did that, and shall never cease
                  to be grateful to you for it."
               He said this with an expression of gratitude on his face—which was evidently such
                  a face as glasses forth the soul of its possessor, whatever the feeling by which
                  he may be swayed, or however slight that feeling may be. Love could languish
                  there, and resentment could flush,—sensibility could shrink,—pity weep,—and,
                  doubtless, humor could twinkle, too, in happier days, for all these were in his
                  soul—and much more—and his face was its faithful mirror.
               "I am delighted to see you once more," he went on. "How have you been?
                     where have you been? Tell me all about yourself, little girl.
                  Don't look so grave—you used to be so gay, and that helped much to save me, when I
                  lay moaning and raving in that tent. Where is Captain—"
               "Mr. John—Mr. Gatley, rather—do you know Carlos King?" she interrupted, just at
                  the point when she knew he was going to inquire for Gatewood, at the same time
                  looking steadfastly at him, as though she would read the least change which the
                  question might produce in his countenance.
               For an instant he, seemed at a loss what to do or say. It was, however, only an
                  instant.
               "Yes," he replied: "he is—or perhaps I should say, was—a friend of
                  mine."
               "Why, 'was'?"
               "Because they say he is dead."
               "Do you know that he is dead?"
               "I do not; but I know he was one of Nolan's men, as I was myself, and was captured
                  with the rest of us, and thrown into some dungeon in Mexico. This I have always
                  thought equivalent to death, unless one gets away, and I am perhaps
                  the only one of Nolan's little band that escaped. So you can draw your own
                  inference as to whether he is still living or not. But, Filly, why are you so
                  desirous to know something about King, that you have perhaps sought me out for
                  this very purpose?"
               "I have sought you out expressly to learn his fate, Mr. John,"
                  replied the girl. "Glad as I am to meet you again, I should n't have thought of
                  coming here, in this way—among all these men, too—just for that."
               "Was he a friend of yours?"
               "Oh no—I never saw him in my life."
               "That's strange, indeed. Does what you have to say concern him much?"
               "It ought to, I think; and it certainly concerns some one else very deeply."
               "Some one else!" echoed Gatley, evidently getting much interested for his friend,
                  King. "Who is that?"
               "As you know nothing of the gentleman, Mr. John, and may never see him again—in fact, as you think him
                  dead, and cannot possibly see him any more to tell him, I don't know that I ought
                  to betray his secret to you, particularly as it is the secret of another person,
                  too—one you most likely never saw, or even heard of."
               "'His secret'—and 'the secret of another,'" said Gatley, in low tones; and looking
                  down, as though he said it to himself: "What can all that mean?
               "I did n't tell you I thought him dead, Filly," he said, breaking off his reverie
                  and raising his eyes from the ground. "I merely told you he was a prisoner in
                  Mexico, and I always regarded that as much the same as being dead."
               "It seems to me there's not much difference between saying that, and saying you
                  thought him dead," persisted the girl.
               "Well, the difference is, I may possibly see my friend some day—that's all."
               "In fact," he went on, after a brief pause, "I not only know that he is alive, but
                  have every reason to think I shall see him again—indeed, I am almost certain of
                  it."
               "Soon?"
               "Yes—soon."
               "Why, Mr. John, I don't see how you can be certain about seeing him again: you may
                  never return from this war—you may be killed."
               "Filly, my friend is with this little army now."
               "He is? Oh, Mr. John! why could n't you tell me that before, and
                  allow me the chance of speaking with him?" said the girl, somewhat irritated. "I'm
                  afraid it's too late now; there's the drum beating for a start. Show him to
                  me—will you? before they go—please!" she said, suddenly changing her tone to a
                  pleading key.
               "I didn't tell you before, that he was here, Filly, because cause I knew he had
                  particular reasons for not being recognized. He is in disguise, and is not known
                  as Carlos King, even to his comrades in arms. I am the only person here who knows
                  him as such. In truth, I have the best grounds for thinking that no one in the
                  world but myself knows him to be living; and you must see that it would hardly be
                  right to betray his trust without sufficient cause. If, however, you will say,
                  that what you have to tell him is, beyond all manner of doubt, of great importance
                  to him, I think I may venture to introduce him to you."
               "It is of such importance," replied the girl, "that he will rejoice over it the
                  rest of his life—be that short or long."
               Gatley looked down at the dead leaves which lay strewn at his feet, and seemed to
                  study for a moment.
               "But, Mr. John," replied the girl, with persistent incredulity, "I hardly know how
                  to believe that Mr. King is with this army: I saw a full list of the names
                  yesterday, and his was not among them."
               "His name," replied the soldier, "is just wherein he has disguised himself. In
                  everything else he is the same."
               "And, pray, what name did he take? I think you might tell me, Mr.
                  John, before they all go: they are starting now."
               "John Gatley."
               The girl looked at him in utter bewilderment.
               "Are you Carlos King, then?"
               "I'm the man, Filly. Now what is it you have to tell me?"
               "Oh, Mr. John!" she exclaimed, springing forward, and seizing his hand in both her
                  own, and at the same time looking fixedly in his face,—"are you,
                  really and truly?"
               
               "Yes. Now tell me: for, see! they have all started, and I have but little time to
                  listen. I am the pleader now."
               This sudden discovery—that she had so thoroughly succeeded in her
                  mission—embarrassed the girl to such an extent that she scarcely knew where to
                  begin, nor, indeed, the substance of what to say after she should have begun. She
                  tried hard, though vainly, to recall the programme laid down for her by the
                  Señorita—though heretofore she had not once thought of it, but had been conducting
                  the affair, all along, according to her own notions, and meeting emergencies, as
                  they arose, with her own resources.
               "The Señorita—" she at length managed to say, but could get no further.
               "Well?" said Gatley, calmly enough, though by no means uninterested.
               "The Señorita—Isabella—" she faltered forth, then stopped,—possibly with a vague
                  notion that he would, in some way, come to her relief.
               He did come. He forthwith took up her disjointed words, and put them together.
               "The Señorita Isabella?" he exclaimed, seizing the girl's arms, and looking
                  intensely into the face close before his own. "Isabella what? Tell me the name:
                  for heaven's sake! do you mean—"
               "Isabella Delgado."
               "What of her?—What of her? I say!"
               "She is here."
               "She here?" he cried, releasing the girl, and looking around in every
                  direction, as though he expected his beloved to start from behind some bush, and,
                     presto, rush into his arms.
               "I don't mean just here," explained Filly, observing his earnest search. "She's at
                  the lake."
               "The lake? What lake? Where is the lake, Filly? how far?"
               "Only a mile or two."
               "Oh, show me the way: guide me to her!"
               "I will," she said, as, with his assistance, she leaped on her horse.
               They forthwith started off—he walking by her side—Grim trudging along in the
                  rear.
               As may well be believed, the two were not long on their way. During the time thus
                  occupied, but little was said. Each was too busy thinking either to question, or
                  to volunteer information to the other. Filly was absorbed in reflecting on the
                  importance to her of the development just made, and in speculating, in detail, on
                  the prospects which it would secure her. To be sure, she did not altogether lose
                  sight of the happiness which must accrue to her friend, the Señorita; but where
                  she spent one thought on this result, she lavished a hundred on the other.
               King, for his part, thought, at first, only of the joy of meeting with his
                  long-lost sweetheart. The mere anticipation of this was sufficient to fill his
                  breast to the exclusion of everything else, until they had made, probably, half
                  the distance. By that time he began to rally a little from the ecstatic shock, and
                  to reduce to something like order, the emotional hurly-burly, of which his
                  palpitating heart was the centre.
               "What could have brought her to live in such a howling wilderness as this?" he
                  asked himself, and not getting any satisfactory answer from within, he addressed
                  to the girl a query of the same purport.
               In replying, she did not enter into particulars; for, in that case, much would
                  have had to be said about Gatewood's agency in the matter,—and that was a subject
                  on which she was always loth to speak.
                  In fact, she never mentioned his name to any one whatever, when it was possible to
                  avoid it.
               "She was driven from her home by the Spaniards," said the girl.
               "So I supposed. But why should she stop here? why did n't she make her way to the
                  United States—to Natchitoches, at least?"
               "I believe," replied Filly, "that the few vacant houses in town were filled by
                  refugees from Mexico and Texas, before she got there. A gentleman, who had just
                  built on the lake, heard of this and offered her his house: so she concluded to
                  live there."
               "Who was with her in her flight?"
               "Her uncle and her brother."
               "Not her parents?"
               "No—they are both dead. Her father was killed during the war, and her mother died
                  soon afterwards."
               The tender-hearted girl shrank from telling him the whole dreadful truth, as she
                  had heard it from the Señorita—that both of them had been murdered,—the one
                  directly,—the other indirectly.
               "Are her uncle and brother still with her?"
               "They are not. They started, two or three weeks ago, for Texas, with the advance
                  of the patriot army."
               "Filly, surely you don't mean to say she is living in these wilds alone?"
               "With only an old Mexican and his wife—as servants. Then, I have been staying with
                  her ever since the army left. Oh, Mr. John, there's no danger at all while Grim's
                  about," said she, looking behind at the dog. "Don't you remember Grim, sir."
               "Yes—I remember him now, Filly,—since you called my attention to him; but I had
                  not really noticed before that there was a dog along with us. Grim is a great dog,
                  and, no doubt, some little protection; but I don't like to see ladies expose
                  themselves in such lonely places as this, where so many terrible things may befall
                  them.

                  ISABELLA, about the time she thought Filly ought to be coming back,
                  took her station at the open window of her room, facing in the direction the
                  latter would return. She had in her hand, when she first sat down, a recently
                  opened letter and some newspapers, which she had probably been reading, or at
                  least making some effort to do so. These, however, soon dropped to the floor, from
                  her lap, where she had placed them soon after taking her seat.
               Although she had scarcely the shadow of a hope that the girl would bring her any
                  good tidings on the subject most engrossing her thoughts,—that little so affected
                  her, that she could not keep her eyes, for a single moment, from the fond task of
                  peering along the leafy vistas to catch the first glimpse of Pony's head. After a
                  while, however, she drew forth the army-list from her bosom, and for a few moments
                  it divided her attention with the anxious lookout. She ran over the list about the
                  twentieth time since it had been in her possession, to see if she could find on it
                  any name bearing resemblance to her
                  lover's. Although there was no such name as King to be found—as has already been
                  said—there were several Charleses; and, as Carlos is the Spanish of Charles, she
                  inspected these closely, one by one, to ascertain whether or not any of them had a
                  family name bearing even the remotest resemblance to his. But there was none.
               She next looked wistfully at the name of John Gatley, as though she hoped to find
                  in that something, which, if assumed as a disguise, her lover might have left as a
                  clue to his original name; to the end that she, at least, if no one else, might be
                  enabled to unravel it. But there was nothing of the kind to be seen.
               "Only one letter of Charles in the first name," she murmured in a very low
                  tone,—"and not even a trace of King in the last. It cannot, then, be Carlos: he
                  would n't have had the cruelty to blot out his name so completely, that I may thus
                  read it over and over, and yet never know it from that of a stranger."
               Despite these dreary words, however,—which showed how much she despaired of the
                  girl bringing her any good news,—her anxiety for the latter's arrival, so far from
                  diminishing, seemed to grow as the minutes went by,—until, at last, either because
                  she thought that the shifting of her situation and the consequent change in her
                  surroundings, might tend to relieve her suspense a trifle, or for the purpose of
                  getting where she could see, a little sooner, whatever of good or ill might be in
                  store for her, she left the house and strolled along the path she had been so
                  intently watching. After going some distance, she sat down at the root of a tree,
                  on the dead, dry leaves of the last year's growth, and with ears attent, listened
                  for the sound of the horse's feet, which she knew must herald Filly's
                  approach,—for there, where the woods were dense, and the path—as all by-paths
                  are—tortuous, the ear could distinguish much farther than the eye.
               In a few minutes, she heard the long wished-for sound,—and with it her heart set
                  to throbbing as though it would burst its bounds. In a little while more, Filly,
                  on the pony, emerged into view around a turn in the path; and with the same
                  glance, the anxious watcher saw at the girl's side, and recognized him on the
                  instant, her long-sought lover. As she was a little distance off the path along
                  which they were coming, they did not see her, until, rising suddenly from her
                  position and starting forward, she gave a faint scream, and sank down at once on
                  the earth, quite unconscious.
               This sudden joy, after long years of separation, intensified as it was by its
                  contrast with the intermediate suspense and suffering, and at length despair, had
                  proved too much for a highly impressible system, sensitive alike to all the
                  extremes of emotion. How strange, at times, is the womanly nature! We may readily
                  understand that, when woe, or terror, or utter despair comes on one of the gentler
                  sex, she should close her sight against them all in the transient death of a
                  swoon. But strange it is, that, when so near the goal of her one, life-long
                  hope,—out of which all other hopes are born, and around which, after their birth,
                  they all revolve like lesser stars, living by it, and through it, and for it
                  alone,—full strange it is, that she should then draw down the curtain
                  of her eyes and shut out the joyous sight: nay—that she should glide off into a
                  dark, dreary, unexplored realm, nor take with her so much as a thought, or a
                  memory, or a dream, of what is, or was, or is to be!
               King, hastening his steps, was soon with her. Throwing himself on the ground close
                  by her side in a half recumbent posture, he leaned over her, looking fondly in her
                  death-pale face—watching for the first opening of her eyes. Now and then, he
                  pressed his lips to hers, as though to confirm, by that exquisite prerogative of a
                  lover, the evidence of her presence,
                  afraid to believe what his sight alone so plainly told him—that this was indeed no
                  dream, which might, on waking, vanish into air, and leave him desolate again.
               Filly, at first, stood by, marking, with intense interest, all that occurred. She
                  had often read, in novels, of heroines fainting, and wondered how in the world
                  they managed it so opportunely; and had quite as often come to the conclusion,
                  that she herself would never make a heroine, in so far as it might depend in her
                  going off in the style therein depicted. But it became an altogether different
                  matter when she saw the genuine thing enacted here right before her face,—saw the
                  workings of the causes which led to it,—the evident intensity of the emotions
                  enlisted, together with the unmistakable suffering attendant upon the immediate
                  act itself. Putting herself in Isabella's place, and "Señor" in King's, she
                  thought it would be no very difficult feat to die off in pretty much the same way,
                  should anything have occurred to make her believe, for three or four long years,
                  that her lover was dead, and then should he come rushing, in this particular
                  manner, to her arms.
               "Oh, Carlos!" said the Señorita, in a low whisper,—which was, at that time, as
                  loud as her faint breath could afford,—slowly opening her eyes and gazing for a
                  moment full in his face, as though assuring herself that it was indeed her
                  lover,—then closing them again with very exhaustion. He said nothing—did nothing
                  beyond kissing her again—this time, with a more lingering pressure in the contact,
                  because he knew that his previous kisses had been but wasted on unconscious
                  lips,—and knew now that there was to be no more such wasting.
               Up to this time, Filly had been looking on with the most artless simplicity,
                  inspired solely by her sympathy with the parties more immediately concerned. No
                  sooner, however, did she see the Señorita open her eyes in evident consciousness
                  of what was going on, than it struck her that she herself was hardly doing just
                  the right thing in lingering here. Not having, as a guide in such matters, the
                  force of education and habit, which would have made her shrink at once from longer
                  witnessing so tender a scene, she had to resort again to her usual circuitous
                  test, of putting herself in the Señorita's place.
               "The bare idea," she thought at last, "of any one standing by and looking on when
                  Señor had me in his arms, any time after my childhood."
               Then, as if to make the impression stronger on her own mind, she recalled that
                  particular instance given in a previous chapter, where they had their last meeting
                  in the woods,—when, after making her weep with words unintentionally cruel, he
                  pacified her with fond caresses and sought to make, in some sort, amends for his
                  broken faith, by deceptive promises.
               As soon as she saw the impropriety of lingering here as a third party in a sort of
                  matter that is always so much better for having but two, she turned away to the
                  house—the pony, which, in the excitement, she had released, having already moved
                  leisurely on in that direction, so far as to be quite out of sight.
               Now, while Filly was undoubtedly right about this, and while it was very
                  considerate in her to get out of the way on so delicate an occasion, yet it must
                  be owned that her presence was not felt by the lovers to be, in the least,
                  embarrassing,—and this, for the very good reason that they did not once think of
                  her, nor indeed of anybody else in all the wide world, but their own two dear
                  selves. The girl had therefore little difficulty in getting away unnoticed, and
                  none the less that she glided stealthily off on tiptoe, as though apprehensive that her footfall in the
                  rustling, dry leaves might attract their attention. Ah! she did not know that each
                  was so filled with the other, that even a small earthquake might have "reeled
                  unheededly away."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               
                  
                     
                        I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratched.
                     
                     
                        All 's Well That Ends Well.
                     
                  
               
               
                  ISABELLA soon opened her eyes again. Her lover had already taken her
                  head on his lap, and was now smoothing out her dishevelled hair, and gently
                  stroking her blue-veined temple, and her rounded cheek, into which the blood was
                  flooding fast back. As yet, they said but little: and why should they? Surely,
                  words were worse than useless while their conscious eyes were exchanging such
                  eloquent looks. To see each other—touch each other—was enough: the tongue could
                  have added no joy to this—at least, until the appetite of sight and touch—so
                  sharply set by long separation—should be somewhat appeased.
               At length, quite rallying, the Señorita rose partly from the ground, and seating
                  herself by her lover's side on the mossy roots, leaned back against the tree,
                  while his arm encircled her tenderly about. Then, as a matter of course, came
                  divers fond words and caresses—of which it is by no means certain the reader has
                  any right to know the particulars, and which, at any rate, it were more discreet
                  to withhold,—for should he be one of the warm-blooded sort, the detailing of such
                  endearments might excite his envy—if one of the cold-blooded, his disgust. Suffice
                  it to say, in general terms, that, given the kind of lovers, all wooing— which is
                  really heart-felt, and not based on gold, or blood, or station—goes on in much the
                  same old familiar style, whether amid the rude environments of the wilderness, or
                  the luxurious refinements of cities—except that it may be, as regards outward
                  appearances, a trifle more under restraint in the latter situation than where
                  everything around encourages the more natural procedure.
               This brief foretaste over, of the heaven they had long ago limned forth for
                  themselves, they began gradually to talk about what had happened to them since
                  their parting at Queretaro. These preliminary allusions to that eventful period of
                  their lives, led soon to a request on the part of the Señorita that her lover
                  should give her a connected account of his escape, and of his subsequent
                  career.
               "It was a hard journey—that thousand miles," he said, sadly, heaving a deep sigh
                  at the thought of it,—"but what will a man not do for his liberty,—particularly
                  with the terrors of such a dungeon as mine constantly pursuing him? I could, of
                  course, move only by night; and many wretched nights did I pass, often hungry and
                  cold, and, before I reached my journey's end, well-nigh naked, and quite
                  defenceless against the pelting storm. But when made almost desperate by such
                  suffering, as I often was, I could at any time stimulate myself to renewed
                  exertion by reflecting that such nights of torture, bad as they were, sank into
                  nothing in comparison with the night of that prison to which I should be
                  remanded—or to one as hideous—if captured again.
               "In trying to keep to the most unfrequented ways, I became bewildered, and at
                  length hopelessly lost, on the barren plains of Coahuila. Up to this time, I had
                  subsisted myself with great difficulty by begging at the hovels of the lowest
                  classes of the country, who I knew were
                  themselves so cruelly oppressed by the Gachupins that they would not be likely to
                  betray me,—and glad enough was I to get a share even of their miserable food. But
                  it was infinitely worse for me on those fearful plains; for not only were there no
                  habitations there, of any kind, but both animal and vegetable life was so rare a
                  thing, that I was soon on the very verge of starvation.
               "At length, after many days of torture, I lay down to die by the bank of a little
                  river that made its way through barren sands. I had lain there but a short time,
                  however, when an unoccupied canoe came floating past me. With the exception of
                  your own appearance before my grate in Queretaro, this was the most
                  providential-looking object I ever beheld. It had most probably got loose from
                  some of the savage tribes who roamed the more favored upland, many miles away.
                  Putting forth all my strength, I plunged into the stream, and struck out to
                  overtake it; but in my enfeebled condition it gained so rapidly on me, that I grew
                  desperate, gave up the pursuit, and was led to consider whether I should make for
                  the shore again, to die there a lingering death, or seek a more speedy relief by
                  sinking beneath the wave. Just then the canoe ran on a little island, only a few
                  feet in extent, where it lodged—bow on—swayed to and fro by the current. I exerted
                  myself once more; but just as I was about to grasp the prize, the wave which my
                  own motion had pushed before me, struck the stern, and whirling it around, cleared
                  it of the island. Once more I abandoned the attempt,—for the stream from this
                  point was very rapid, and I knew I could not overtake the canoe when once fairly
                  in the current. But to my joy, the eddy which played below the island was strong
                  enough to draw it within its vortex, and it was while whirling around in this
                  little circuit that I rushed forward and boarded it.
               "I found nothing in the canoe but a paddle and a single ear of corn. On this
                  slender stock of provisions, grain by grain, I kept myself alive, while I used the
                  paddle with what strength I had remaining, to keep the canoe in the current. My
                  object was to move onward as rapidly as possible, trusting to chance to bring me
                  into a fertile region, or perhaps to the Gulf, where some friendly sail might
                  possibly be found to bear me away. I stopped neither night nor day. When overcome
                  by drowsiness, I would lay the paddle aside and sink down in sleep, allowing the
                  current still to carry me on.
               "On the second day, when my last grain of corn had been eaten, I succeeded in
                  catching a lizard, which I devoured raw. On the third day a turtle shared the same
                  fate and served the same purpose. Just before the fourth night closed in, I
                  fancied I could see some slight signs of a stinted vegetation in the distance.
                  Hoping, as I did, that the next dawn would find me in a more favored section, when
                  it came, in order to realize that hope, I strained my eyes with an anxiety to
                  which that felt by Columbus when he expected the break of day would show him a new
                  world must have been slight in comparison,—for should I be disappointed in this,
                  the close of that day would probably show me a new world indeed, and one for which
                  I felt but ill prepared.
               "During the glimmering twilight of that morning,—which in that latitude must have
                  lasted only a few minutes, but which seemed to me as many hours,—I saw, or
                  imagined I saw, clumps of trees looming up between me and the dim horizon; and it
                  was but a single step further to fancy homes embowered within them. And it was
                  even so. Soon I could distinguish the tinkling of bells, and in a few minutes more
                  could see flocks dotting the country over, as they went slowly forth to their
                     early browsing. Cocks began to crow.
                  Dogs to bark. Cattle to low. On sight of the first smoke curling upward from a
                  lowly cot, telling that the inmates were stirring, I leaped ashore, and made my
                  way thither by dragging myself along on the earth—for by this time I was too near
                  starvation to walk. They gave me food, and took care of me until I was strong
                  enough to start forth again. They had told me I was almost within sight of the
                  Gulf, but that there were no ports on this part of the coast, and of course there
                  could be no ships in which I might hope to escape. I therefore set out again by
                  land—as before, daring to move only by night.
               "I had almost reached the borders of Texas, when, darkling along a
                  mountain-path—for I was now in a wild and craggy country—by a few steps in the
                  wrong direction, I fell over a precipice into the road beneath. The fall broke one
                  of my legs, and of course I could not stir. Unfortunately for me, a detachment of
                  Spanish soldiers were the first who passed along. The commanding officer at once
                  recognized me as one of Nolan's men. He said he had seen us six years before as we
                  passed through one of the neighboring towns on our way to prison. Mangled as I
                  was, the officer had the heartlessness to order me to be placed on a horse behind
                  one of their number; and thus, with my shattered limb dangling by the animal's
                  side, while the ends of the broken bone grated together at every step, they
                  conveyed me to the nearest village. There I was kept under strict guard, and when
                  able to walk was marched to Monclova, where, for a year, I languished in a cell
                  only a degree less hideous than that of Queretaro.
               "With a knife-blade, which I found in a mound of filth that had accumulated during
                  the occupancy of some unfortunate before me, I tunnelled a way beneath the walls
                  after six months' labor. Through this hole I escaped— and then made my way
                  eastward. I soon reached the Rio Grande, and crossed into Texas. The next day, I
                  was captured by a band of Comanches. From them I had little right to expect mercy,
                  for I had often met their brethren in deadly conflict on the prairies. But these
                  heathen savages showed themselves far more merciful than their proud neighbors had
                  done, with all their vaunted Christianity. They not only fed me plentifully with
                  the best they had, but gave me a blanket to cover my nakedness, and moccasins for
                  my bleeding feet—then supplied me with food for the remainder of my journey, and
                  sent me on my way rejoicing.
               "At last I reached the eastern bank of the Sabine. Here I encountered two of the
                  men of the Neutral Ground, who, seeing my forlorn condition, conducted me to their
                  camp, where their Chief, Captain Gatewood—I shall always remember him with
                  gratitude—bade me—
               "My God! Isabella, why do you look so pale? You have not recovered from the
                  effects of your swoon. Lie down at once, or you will faint again."
               At the sound of his name with whom she had so lately entangled herself in a
                  loveless betrothal, her playing blushes checked at once, and left her cheek wan
                  indeed. The simple truth is, since she caught sight of the only man she had ever
                  loved in all the world, not a single thought of the other had crossed her mind.
                  She was so absorbed in gazing on this one—listening to his voice, and thrilling
                  and blushing beneath his ardent embraces, that she had as completely forgotten the
                  grim Chieftain of Neutralia as though she had never seen him, or he had never
                  existed.
               "Yes—I do feel a faintness coming over me again," she said, leaning
                  her head on his breast and hiding her face with her hands—ashamed that he should
                  see it. "I don't need to lie down though: let me but rest here awhile, and it will
                  soon pass off."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               
                  
                     
                        Who but a damned one could have done like me?
                     
                     TAILOR.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Blame not this haste of mine: if you mean well,
                           Now go, with me and with this holy man
                           Into the chantry by.
                        
                     
                     
                        Twelfth Night.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           A rusted nail plac'd near the faithful compass
                           May sway it from the truth and wreck the argosy.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Crusade.
                     
                  
               
               
                  DURING the brief time the Señorita remained in the position she had
                  assumed at the close of the last chapter, she gave a hurried glance into the
                  abyss, which— known full well, but forgotten for an hour—had been as suddenly
                  revealed to her by her lover's words, as is the fearful chasm to the benighted
                  mountaineer by a flash from heaven.
               For love's sake alone, she thought it would, beyond doubt, be better—infinitely
                  better—to make a clean breast of it, and tell him all about that other betrothal,
                  and how it came,—and then throw herself on his mercy to forgive the deed. But, for
                  her country's sake this would never do: she must delude both her lovers now
                  instead of one, as heretofore,—and bide a more auspicious time. If she should
                  embrace freedom now, she would lose love,— if she should embrace love, she would
                  lose freedom. She must wait until both could be hers at once.
               "There, now," she said, raising her head from his breast; "I feel better: go
                  on."
               "For many weeks I lay ill in camp, where I was known as John Gatley—having assumed
                  that name after I escaped from Monclova. And if it had not been for this sweet
                  girl— Why," he said, looking around, "where has she gone? I thought she was with
                  us—or rather, I should have thought so, if I had not forgotten all about her.
                  Well, she nursed me so faithfully that I have no doubt, she saved my life.
               "And what do you think I did next, Isabella?"
               "I suppose you sought your home, of course."
               "No—I sought yours."
               "You surely did n't venture to San Antonio?"
               "Yes—I did. Captain Gatewood very kindly gave me a horse,—thinking, quite
                  naturally, that I wished to go to the United States,—and I did not choose to
                  undeceive him. Disguising myself, I took my way westward, resolved to see you
                  again, if possible, and to atone for all our sufferings by wedding you at once,
                  and taking you to my own country—if you would go—where we might spend the rest of
                  our days in peace.
               "On my arrival in San Antonio, without making myself known, I entered into casual
                  conversation with different citizens of the place, and ascertained from them that
                  you had been sent to New Orleans to school. I started off again, and after a ride
                  of nearly a thousand miles, all alone, reached that city. There I set myself about
                  finding you. After a long search I had the good fortune to meet with one of your
                  countrymen—a priest from San Antonio—but the exceeding bad fortune to hear from
                  him that you had sailed, a few days before, for Vera Cruz, on your way to the city
                  of Mexico, to spend the winter with an aunt. He told me your friends had advised
                  this change, hoping it would restore your health, which he represented as failing
                  fast.
               "You may conceive how sad was this disappointment, after all my wanderings in search of you,—which
                  were now necessarily brought to an end,—for, of course, I had not the madness to
                  venture to the capital. I then returned to my native State, and rested for nearly
                  a year. About six months ago, I started out again to look for you. I came as far
                  as New Orleans, intending to make my way to San Antonio on horseback—in disguise,
                  of course. Hearing that Colonel Magee was then in the city in search of volunteers
                  for the patriot army of Mexico, I was not long in making up my mind to join his
                  standard,—since it would not only give me the opportunity of fighting for your
                  native province,—but it was the only way I could reasonably hope ever to see you
                  again. Thus it is that I am with you now."
               The Señorita then related her adventures. But as the reader is already acquainted
                  with them, there is no need of repeating them here. Suffice it to say, that she
                  dwelt particularly on the unceasing torture she had endured from the suspense of
                  not knowing anything whatever of his fate. With all her details, however, she told
                  him nothing about her relations with Gatewood—not even that he had rescued her and
                  her friends from the clutches of the Spaniards. In a word, she never once named
                  him in her narration.
               "Now, Isabella," said her lover, when she had finished, "since we have had such
                  bitter experience in the way of long separations, and as the future is to us so
                  very uncertain, that, if we part now, we may never meet again, I suggest that you
                  go on to Nacogdoches in the rear of our army,—with myself as your escort. I
                  understand the forces will be delayed there about two months, awaiting supplies.
                  As soon as we arrive, we will go to the Padre of the place, who will make us man
                  and wife. Are you willing to do so?"
               As she did not immediately answer this very direct proposal, he went on, in a few
                  moments, to give the whys and wherefores,—not only to relieve the very awkward
                  pause, but because he thought it nothing more than fair that she should have a
                  little time to consider,—and, moreover, that she had the right to know the grounds
                  on which he based his overtures for such a speedy union.
               "You will thus get out of this unpeopled wilderness and back to your native
                  province, under the very natural protection of your lover. We will spend two happy
                  months of married life in Nacogdoches, which, as you know, is the second town in
                  Texas, where there is much refined society, and where nearly every citizen is a
                  friend of liberty and hostile to the Gachupins. Then, when the army leaves, you
                  can await there the result of its operations westward. If it should succeed in
                  expelling the foe from Texas, we can go and live, if you prefer it, at your
                  beautiful home near San Antonio. On the other hand, should the campaign prove
                  disastrous, I will, if I survive it, return through Nacogdoches, and take you with
                  me to my own more peaceful home in my native State."
               To two fond lovers, eager to be made one, what could have appeared more reasonable
                  than such a proposition? And the truth is, if the Señorita had had no little
                  by-play to this life-drama, which she wished to be acted on the other side of the
                  curtain from him, this proposition would have seemed to her the most natural one
                  in the world, and she would not have had to think twice before adopting it. And
                  yet, instead of accepting it at once, as he thought she possibly would,—or
                  modestly hesitating a moment, and then assenting gracefully, with perhaps a
                  charming blush, as he thought most probable,—she did what he would have
                  considered—had such a result previously suggested itself to his mind at
                  all—neither probable nor possible: first, looked as one taken wholly by surprise—then, casting her eyes on the ground,
                  mused for a while dejectedly, and when she essayed to speak, stammered—broke
                  down—then tried again—and at last (he could scarcely believe his ears that heard
                  the stunning words) said she would prefer postponing their marriage until the war
                  should be quite ended—which they both knew might not be for years.
               King was as much hurt, as he was astonished by this answer. After all these mutual
                  avowals of love—after all that torturing suspense—that wringing of their hearts
                  for each other's sake—to be thus brought together once more by the merest freak of
                  fate, and then for his beloved to reject an honorable wedlock, and to
                  prefer parting again, perhaps forever! He thought it not only strange, but
                  hard—indeed, at the moment, almost heartless. And such thoughts could, in a
                  measure, be read in his face in lines of reproachful sadness, as he glanced at
                  her. He, however, never once suspected double-dealing. He only looked upon this
                  hesitation as proof of the melancholy fact that she did not love with half his own
                  fervor.
               She was not slow to read the distressed expression which swept his handsome
                  features; and—to do her justice—it cut her to the very heart. She felt, at that
                  moment of agony, that she could cast her country's present prospects to the winds
                  and await a more auspicious moment for its redemption, that she might remove by
                  marriage all doubt from that faithful breast—all trace of pain from the noble face
                  before her.
               After another brief but terrible struggle as to whether she should still tell him
                  all about her transactions with Gatewood and the cause of them, leaving him to
                  dictate what course would then be best; or whether, without making this
                  explanation, she should marry him and remain where she was until the war was over,
                  or go with him as he had suggested; or whether she should do neither of these
                  things, but let matters stand just as they were at present, she found it so
                  difficult to decide which course to pursue, that she resolved to hold her
                  decision, for a little while, in reserve, if she could manage so to arrange
                  things. With this view she asked him:
               "Carlos, you will surely stay here with us, for a few days—at least?"
               It is impossible," he answered. "I must hasten to rejoin my comrades: they have no
                  idea where I am. In my wild haste to meet you I left the ranks without saying a
                  word to any one, and they will think me a deserter, unless I return soon—for I am
                  an entire stranger to them, having caught up with them only yesterday. They are to
                  encamp about ten miles from here to-night, and if I start soon I can reach them
                  before the day closes."
               "But you can get a leave of absence, and return to me tomorrow? I will then be
                  prepared to tell you exactly what I will do. I should like to have ample time to
                  consider the subject: it is a very important one to me—more so perhaps than you
                  think. And when you come, I will tell you why it is so important to me."
               She had been, all this while, taxing her ingenuity to the utmost, to think of
                  something that might excuse, or at least extenuate, her indecision in this
                  matter,—but she could not, for her life, summon up anything plausible that she
                  could afford to tell: hence, this compromise proposal, to hold the subject under
                  advisement. By to-morrow she would be able, she thought, to make up her mind,
                  which was now so vacillating. If she should decide to marry him without further
                  delay, all would be right. Should she decide to put him off for a while, why, she
                  would assuredly be equal to the task of concocting some good reason by the time
                  they should meet on the morrow.
               
               "Well, I suppose it must be so," he said, sadly. "But, Isabella, I must tell you I
                  have a presentiment just now, that if we part thus, we shall never see each other
                  again. It may appear to you foolish—but I feel it nevertheless."
               "Oh," she replied, with affected carelessness, though a shudder shot through her
                  frame even as she uttered the words, "we must not allow our mere imagination to
                  have too much sway in matters of such moment."
               "Well, you may be right. I only hope you are. Good-bye, my love!"
               They parted tenderly—with the understanding that he was to return the next
                  evening, from the encampment where the little army was to rest until the second
                  morning.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               
                  
                     
                        Alas! how love can trifle with itself.

                        If you think well to carry this, as you may, the doubleness of the
                           benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What think you of it?

                  FILLY, meanwhile, strolled on to the house, reflecting on the day's
                  events, and nervously summing up the advantages which they would probably bring
                  her for the amendment of her affairs,—fallen, of late, into such a sad plight; and
                  it is scarcely necessary to say that she derived much hope from her reflections.
                  She sought the room occupied by herself and the Señorita, and almost the first
                  object which drew her attention on entering, was a letter lying open on the floor.
                  Not only was the seal broken, but the sheet was quite unfolded. She picked it up,
                  along with a book and some newspapers that lay near it, with the view of putting
                  them aside, for order's sake,—a very common thing with her,—she having gradually
                  taken upon herself, since coming to live there, the business of arranging the
                  room, whenever the Señorita in her abstracted moods—which, of late, were
                  frequent—would leave things strewn about.
               A letter being by no means an every-day affair in that wild region, Filly could
                  not help glancing at the handwriting. That single glance sufficed to bring about
                  events that colored the rest of her days. It was a letter from Gatewood, and the
                  girl instantly recognized it as such. Nor was she long in finding that it was
                  addressed to the Señorita.
               Considering how long Filly had been kept on the rack by her ignorance of the exact
                  condition of affairs between "Señor" and Isabella, as well as the few moral
                  advantages she had enjoyed,—living, as she had done, ever since the first dawn of
                  her reason, where honor, if not daily murdered outright, was at least constantly
                  besmirched by some questionable act on the part of those around her,—it is
                  probably not much to be wondered, that she dived into the contents of this letter
                  with an eagerness which she had seldom, or perhaps never, before felt. So
                  absorbed, indeed, was she in the act, that she did not move a jot from her
                  position until she had read every word of it.
               The letter was as follows: 
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 SALITRE PRAIRIE, West Bank of the Sabine.
                              
                              MY DEAREST ISABELLA: As I have a chance to send a letter to
                                 Natchitoches, I will write you and enclose to a friend, who always
                                 sees Miguel when he goes to town for the news, and will of course
                                 hand it to him for you.
                              We came within sight of this point yesterday, and immediately
                                 attacked the Spanish force stationed here. After a running fight of about an hour, we
                                 drove them entirely off, with a loss on our part of two killed and
                                 three wounded. We leave early to-morrow for Nacogdoches—so I have
                                 not much time to write. We are all in fine spirits and confident of
                                 worsting the Gachupins as soon as we can come up with them. I feel
                                 my sympathies enlisted more and more every day in the cause which
                                 you have so well taught me to espouse. But how could it be
                                 otherwise? Am I not all your own? What is nearest your heart is
                                 also nearest mine,—and it must be so henceforth and for all time. I
                                 often recall the many delightful hours we have spent together on
                                 the lake and in the wood. I often recall so vividly too that I
                                 realize in the fond vision half the bliss they gave me at the
                                 time—those burning kisses and tender embraces. Oh, how they thrill
                                 me, and inspire me anew with devotion to the cause which is
                                    yours! I must live in the mere memory of them—such
                                 is the soldier's fate—until our promised marriage shall make sweet
                                 realities of them all. Then liberty and love shall go hand in hand,
                                 with nothing to intrude on our paradise—for, as I pledged you, I
                                 will then quit forever the wild life I have been leading, and we
                                 will dwell together in happiness the remainder of our days.
                              My duties claim my attention now, dearest, and I have no time to
                                 write more—or I could fill pages with my love for you, and in
                                 anticipating the happier days that await us when the war is over. I
                                 will send a letter whenever I can, though the opportunities will be
                                 so very rare that you must not be disappointed, nor think me remiss
                                 if you get none at all. In a year or two, however, or perhaps
                                 sooner, I have no doubt I shall be able to return to the lake in
                                 person and bring you away as my bride, to look again on your
                                 beautiful Texas—more beautiful than ever then, that she too will be
                                 tricked out in her new bridal robes, as the spouse of liberty.
                              It will be useless to ask you to write—much as I should like to
                                 hear—for after we leave here we place a wilderness between
                                 ourselves and you—so that there will be few facilities, if any, for
                                 sending a letter either way. But I will ask you to
                                 think of me often—and not forget me even in your dreams!
                              
                                 Your devoted lover,
                                 GATEWOOD.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               While it is needless to say that the perusal of this letter caused Filly much
                  pain, she found comfort in the belief that all the love therein expressed for
                  another would now be transferred back to herself, where she thought it rightfully
                  belonged. Therefore, although the well-nigh unmixed joy, which she had felt but a
                  few moments before, was alloyed no little by this actual sight of Gatewood's
                  ardent words of love written to her rival, her relief, on the whole, was so great
                  from the agony of the last few weeks,—when she thought herself altogether deserted
                  by him, and left without a single hope of regaining him,—that she felt much reason
                  for self-gratulation on the day's results.
               Being a good deal worn-out by the excitement of the afternoon, which had kept her
                  feelings so long on the stretch, after laying the letter carefully away, she threw
                  herself on the bed and was soon asleep.
               For some time after Isabella's lover bade her adieu, she kept her position at the
                  foot of the tree where they had been conversing. She watched his retiring form
                  until completely hidden from her view by the foliage, through which he made his
                  way with rapid strides,—for, that he might the sooner rejoin his comrades, instead
                  of taking the path by which he had come, he struck off through the trackless woods
                  in a more direct course. No sooner had his figure vanished, the sound of his steps
                  died away, and the agitated boughs, just at the point where he had dashed them
                  aside and disappeared behind them, ceased waving, and left no sign of him
                  whatever, than she felt such a sense of loneness come over her as she had hoped
                  never to feel again.
               "He is gone!" she exclaimed, throwing herself prostrate among the leaves.
               
               These were all the words she spoke,—but her thoughts, so far from stopping,
                  continued to sweep through her brain like a flood of fire.
               "Oh, how fearfully am I swayed between those two darling objects of my life—my
                  poor country's freedom and my poor heart's love. But there shall be a speedy end
                  of this painful trifling: I can endure it no longer. When he comes, to-morrow, I
                  will tell him that I will marry him at once,—and so settle this matter forever.
                  Ah! why did I hesitate?—it seems so strange now that I did. I little
                  dreamed how desolate I should feel when he was gone, or I had not done it. His
                  noble heart was wounded at my vacillation; and no wonder, surely, after such
                  suffering in the past,—and such prospect of suffering to come, in the dangers and
                  hardships of battle. Would I could call him back now—this very moment open my
                  breast to him—tell him how I have deceived him—and why—and then ask his
                  forgiveness—make him mine for life! Oh, that I could! One day seems so long now to
                  wait for his return. Yes, one brief day seems long—though I have
                  waited through the agony of years. And have I only waited for this,
                  at last—to hurt his kindly heart? To-morrow shall atone for all."
               This, one might think, looks enough like decision: but it was not. It was only one
                  of those impulsive outbursts which had often overcome, for a time, the passionate
                  nature of Isabella Delgado, in some degree throughout her life,—but more
                  especially during her sojourn in the Neutral Ground: in other words, since the
                  trying alternative of a choice between love and patriotism had swerved her from
                  the spotless sincerity of her early youth. By the time she had risen from the
                  ground and was slowly making her way towards the house, her mind was already
                  beginning to undergo a change.
               "But were I to do this, and Captain Gatewood to hear of it, as he most probably
                  would, it would cause him to withdraw at once from the field, and so, dash the
                  only hope we have for Texas, now so near her freedom, if he but remains her
                  champion. He might even do worse: on the discovery of such a gross deception
                  practised upon him—treachery it may well be called, unless I undeceive him before
                  taking this step, and tell him candidly how it is, that I have met with my own
                  true lover, long thought dead—his fierce temper might even impel him to espouse
                  the opposite side. And, surely, I could not blame him, knowing as I
                  do full well that his feelings are only conditionally enlisted in our cause. He
                  has been entrapped solely by these silken bands of my weaving. If I sever them by
                  marrying another, there will be nothing left him but to turn on us in pitiless
                  revenge. No: I will let things remain as they are, and when the war is over, make
                  my choice between them—a choice that is already made in my heart, and can never be
                  changed. The Chief may fall in battle, and in that case there will be no choice to
                  make. But what if he survive, Carlos be slain, and the tyrants win? Ah! far better
                  for me both should fall—for then the convent becomes my haven of rest."
               As was perhaps not altogether unnatural, these conflicting thoughts ended, at
                  length, in a resolution to adopt a medium course—that King, when he should come
                  the next day, should be told, without concealment or reserve, about the matter,
                  from beginning to end,—the question of their marriage to be left entirely to his
                  decision. It was a terrible struggle, in which her olden candor triumphed.
               The Señorita's entrance into the room woke Filly, and she started up.
               "Where's Mr. John?" she asked.
               "He's gone, Filly."
               
               "Not for good?"
               "No—he left his command without getting permission, and so had to return as soon
                  as he could. He promised to come again to-morrow evening."
               The Señorita took a seat by the open window, while her companion lay down again on
                  the bed. They both seemed to glide off into reverie.
               "Filly," Isabella at length said, "I'm going to tell you my secret—at least a part
                  of it. I believe I can trust you to keep it; and, then, it seems so hard to stay
                  here in the wilderness and not share such precious thoughts with some one;
                  besides, if it had not been for you, I should not have found my lover. In truth,
                  if it had not been for you, he says he should have been dead long ago. So, there
                  will be a peculiar fitness as well as a pleasure in telling you about it. 'My
                  lover,' did I say, just now? Why, then, you already know my secret."
               "Oh, you must not think me so dull, Señorita, that I did n't guess that much as
                  long ago as yesterday."
               "So you well might. But, at best, it was only a guess then,
                  Filly—now, you know it.
               "But, Filly," she added, after a pause, "you must have tarried but a very short
                  time where we were. We looked around for you, after talking a little while, and
                  you could n't be found."
               "After talking a little while, indeed! Why, as soon as you opened your eyes,
                  and—well, as soon as I saw how things were likely to go, I left you,—of course I
                  did."
               "That was very considerate in you," replied the Señorita, with a faint smile and a
                  very evident blush.
               She now told the girl a good deal about her love-affairs, with which the reader is
                  supposed to be already familiar.
               "I reckon you will be married now—as you have been separated so long?" said Filly,
                  with her usual direct simplicity, as soon as the other had finished her story.
               This was an important question to her who propounded it—an
                  all-important one. In fact, she would rather, by far, have had it
                  answered than to have heard all the long story, that had just been told her, as
                  much as this interested her.
               The Señorita, so far from taking umbrage at this rather plain inquiry into the
                  state of her affairs, seemed pleased at the interest manifested in them, and
                  answered without the least hesitation:
               "Well, that's a question we did not fully decide. I shall leave it entirely to
                  Carlos when he comes."
               Here the colloquy closed, for the present, and they both lapsed again into the
                  meditative mood. For this, the time was peculiarly favorable—the shadows of
                  twilight were closing fast around them. That hour, 
                     
                        "When Meditation bids us feel We once have lov'd, though love
                           is at an end"
                     
                   is also singularly fitted for dwelling on such a love as theirs, which has
                  not yet ended, nor is likely to end but with life.
               The longer Isabella revolved in her mind the last resolution she had formed, the
                  more did it impress her as being the right course to pursue,—in truth, the only
                  course she could pursue; and no great while elapsed before she began
                  to marvel that she had ever thought of doing anything else. So that, in the end,
                  her summing up was, "He shall know all about it to-morrow, and then I will do
                  whatever he says."
               "To-morrow!" Ah! that treacherous word!—who can foreknow what it has in store?
               As to Filly, many allowances are to be made for her musings on this occasion—her
                  reasonings—the conclusions she arrived at—her determination as to her course of action in this critical matter: for
                  she had long since resolved on action, energetic action too, if an opportunity
                  should ever present to reclaim her faithless lover. Her comparative ignorance of
                  the world's ways—its sentimentalities—its thousand little refinements of thought
                  and feeling—must be constantly borne in mind. Indeed, these considerations must by
                  no means be lost sight of during the perusal of many other of these pages: else,
                  her conduct at times may well strike the reader as improbable.
               "If they would only marry," she thought, "that would end my agony. For no one but
                  this beautiful charmer could ever have taken him from me in the first place; and,
                  once married, of course, she will lose all her charms for him,—and then he would
                  come back to me. But if they decide not to marry now, many things may happen to
                  prevent it, and dash my hopes again. Mr. John may be killed: and then Señor will
                  be hers, with no kind of doubt. Or, both may come back from the war: in that case
                  there will be a duel, and if there is, Señor will be certain to kill him,—for
                  there's no better shot and fencer in the world,—and then he'll marry her. All she
                  says about her devotion to Mr. John may be true, but it's not the
                     whole truth, for he's not very much handsomer than Señor, and then
                  he's not near so agreeable,—and I know she must love Señor just as much—probably a
                  great deal more. Why, don't that letter show it? Would she allow him to kiss and
                  hug her, as he says there he did, unless she loved him devotedly? And even now,
                  when Mr. John has been found, I can't think she is willing to give Señor up
                  altogether. I only wish I could think so. No—no—she wants to keep two
                  strings to her bow, as they say. She will wait till the war's over, so that, if
                  one should be killed, she can marry the other. I could n't do so, but
                  it's sometimes done in the novels, and I suppose in the world too. Oh, if they
                  would only marry!
               "Suppose I were to go to Mr. John and tell him plainly that Señor and myself were
                  just on the eve of being married when the Señorita came and stole him from me.
                  Would there be any harm in that? Suppose I were to tell him how wretched I am, and
                  how much more wretched I shall be if Señor never loves me again. It might touch
                  his heart,—for he has a kind heart,—and he says I saved his life once; and if I
                  did, I'm sure he might pity me enough to do what would give me back my happiness.
                  The Señorita says she is going to leave to him the question of their marriage.
                  Now, if I can only—Ah, that letter!—it is the very thing: that will
                  tell him all. I'll just hand it to him, and when he reads it—if he loves her as I
                  think he does—he will certainly insist on their being married at once,—for he will
                  then see that, if he puts it off, he may lose her altogether.
               "Would it be wrong to do this? Would I be doing injustice to anybody? I can't see
                  that I would. As to Mr. John, it would surely be doing him a favor, rather than a
                  wrong. As to the Señorita, she has been very kind to me, and I'm very grateful to
                  her for it. But is it reasonable that just because one lover might be killed in
                  the war, she should be allowed to keep two engaged to her, when one of them is
                     mine, and when all the happiness I ever expect to have, depends on
                  his being restored to me? My gratitude will go very far, I believe; but justice to
                  myself forbids any such stretch as that. Then, there is Señor: would it be
                  treating him badly? I can't think so. He had no business to make me
                  love him so—and then to leave me. To be sure, he saved my life—at least saved me
                  from a life that was a thousand times worse than death. But does that give him a
                  right to break my heart?
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIV.

                           I have tremor cordis on me:—my heart dances,
                           But not for joy,—not joy.

                  NEXT morning, soon after breakfast—the Señorita having gone to
                  stroll on the beach, that she might ruminate, alone, on the new prospects opening
                  to her mental view, so wholly unexpected but one short day before—Filly,, with the
                  design of reviewing and perfecting her plan of the previous night, drew forth the
                  Captain's love-letter from the nook where she had concealed it, and read it over a
                  second time.
               Besides playing this missive in King's possession, she now resolved that, instead
                  of trusting her tongue to explain to him the further particulars of this delicate
                  matter, she would write what she had to say—this being, she thought, a much less
                  embarrassing and painful mode of imparting tidings which were unpleasant, but at
                  the same time essential to be known. She accordingly procured writing-materials
                  and indited the following letter: 
                     
                        
                           
                              DEAR MR. JOHN: I enclose you a letter which I found lying wide open
                                 in our room (the Señorita's and mine) yesterday after you left. It
                                 speaks for itself, as far as it goes—but it don't go quite far
                                 enough to speak for me—so I shall have to say a few words.
                              Captain Gatewood and myself were engaged to be married—but the very
                                 day before our marriage was to take place, he rescued the Señorita,
                                 and her uncle and brother, from the Spaniards who had captured them
                                 and were taking them back to Texas as prisoners. From that
                                 moment—now nearly a year ago—I've never once seen him or heard a
                                 word from him—the enclosed will tell you plainly enough
                                    why.
                              It went very hard with me from the first, Mr. John,—and as the days
                                 go by, it seems still harder to bear. I told you, as you may
                                 remember, that a gentleman who had built by the lake had offered
                                 her his house to live in—but I did n't choose to tell you
                                    then who the gentleman was. Well, it was Captain
                                 Gatewood. He had that very house (the one I am in now) built and
                                 furnished for me to live there with him as his wife. He took me to
                                 the lake before he commenced building it, that I might choose the
                                 spot, and after it was finished he bought everything I wanted to
                                 furnish it with. We were to go to the priest next day in
                                 Natchitoches, and after being married, were to live here at the
                                 lake—but that was the day he met with her. I was sent
                                 from the camp to Natchitoches and never saw him afterward.
                              I can't recover from the blow. I've been crushed ever since. But I
                                 don't blame the Señorita for it. She didn't know we were engaged,
                                 and don't know it now, nor even suspect a word of such a thing. For
                                 my sake as well as your own I hope you'll not go off to the war
                                 without making her your wife— for if you do, and you and Captain G.
                                 both come back alive, believe me, sir, he will not give her up to
                                 you without a duel. If he kills you, you will go to your grave,
                                 while he will marry her—and I'm not sure that will not
                                 send me to mine. If you kill him, you may as well have fired the
                                 same bullet through my heart too—for it would n't kill me any
                                 sooner in that way than by being fired through his.
                              Oh! Mr. John, she loves you dearly—I know she does. Why then can't
                                 you marry her at once, and put an end to all this suffering?
                              
                                 Your true friend,
                                 FILLY.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Scarcely had the girl finished her letter, when, on looking out the window
                  fronting the lake, she saw the Señorita leisurely making her way back to the
                  house. It was but the work of a moment to fold her epistle, place the other within
                  it, and direct the package to Mr. John Gatley. Scarcely had she thrust it in her bosom, when
                  Isabella entered the room.
               "Señorita," the girl at once began,—partly, it may be, from impatience to execute
                  her project, but mainly to hide her embarrassment on so narrowly escaping
                  detection,—"I've taken a fancy for a ride this beautiful morning: do you feel in
                  the same humor?"
               "No, Filly," she replied, as the girl well knew she would, or the invitation had
                  not been extended. Indeed, had she suspected any desire of the kind on the
                  Señorita's part, she would have stolen off without letting her know she was going
                  away at all—much less, whither. "No—Filly; I feel like passing the morning alone.
                  I feel that this day is so closely interwoven with my destiny I can do nothing
                  better than try to unravel the web."
               "Unravel it—indeed! Don't you think, then, that Mr. John will come this evening,
                  and unravel it for you?"
               "I don't see what's to prevent his coming, and yet I cannot help thinking he may
                  not. He told me, on parting, he had a presentiment that we should never see each
                  other again."
               "Oh, Señorita!—don't indulge in such horrid thoughts: cast them out, do. On the
                  eve of your marriage, too, perhaps."
               On hearing herself utter these last words, the smile which she had summoned to
                  cheer her companion vanished instantly, her countenance fell, and she herself
                  looked very like an object to be cheered; for those words had reminded her that
                  she was once "on the eve of marriage"—but the marriage never came.
               This sudden change, however, was not observed by the Señorita, who now threw
                  herself on the bed, and said, with a deep sigh:
               "Well—I'll make the effort, Filly. Go, take your ride."
               This conversation stimulated the girl to hurry forward the execution of her plan.
                  For, unsophisticated as she was, she thought all painful presentiments, and every
                  other obstacle, imaginary or real, to the union of those two devoted hearts—to say
                  nothing of the obstacles in her own way—must evanish like a morning mist before
                  the presentation of those letters now in her bosom. With this new incentive to
                  prompt action, she glided hurriedly from the room, and, summoning Miguel to
                  caparison the pony, was soon on her way to the patriot camp.
               The girl had intended inquiring for King, (under the name of Gatley, of course,)
                  and after handing him the letters in person, to remain in his presence while he
                  was reading them, that she might learn from his own lips their effect upon
                  him,—or, if he should prefer silence on the subject, then to ascertain the result
                  as best she might from his manner, or any other outward sign. While yet at a
                  distance she had anticipated little or no embarrassment to herself from so doing;
                  but on drawing near, quite an altered view of the matter was presented to
                  her—particularly when she came to imagine herself facing him while he should be
                  reading her own letter, exposing the sad state of her affairs. She even began to
                  have misgivings as to whether she was acting altogether fairly or not. But as
                  these misgivings were of a very vague sort, and as she was unable to assign any
                  good reason for them, she was disposed to attribute them—coming upon her, as they
                  did, only at the eleventh hour—to diffidence. And, in a measure, her judgment was
                  correct.
               The perhaps not very unnatural consequence of all this was, that, by the time she
                  came within sight of the camp, she had resolved to give the package into the hands
                  of some responsible person—in so far as she could judge him to be such—ask him to deliver it to Gatley, and
                  then make off, out of sight, and home with what speed she could. Before she fairly
                  reached the camp—being as yet on the outskirts—she descried a tent pitched apart,
                  larger and more showy than the rest—which indeed might well be, where none were
                  either large or showy.
               "That's some officer's tent," thought she. "I'll leave the letters with
                     him."
               With this, she rode up to the rear of the tent, where she thought she would be
                  less likely to be seen by any of the men—for, by this time, she had become quite
                  ashamed of the boldness which had brought her here, and wished herself well clear
                  of the place and of her embarrassments.
               A gentlemanly person, who had no doubt heard the sound of the horse's feet, lifted
                  the rear tent-flap a little way and peeped out. On discovering that there was a
                  lady in the case, he touched his cap, and, emerging, approached her
                  side—evidently, from the expression of his face, very much astonished at
                     something: and what was it, if not at seeing one of the gentle sex
                  at such a place?
               "Is Mr. Ki— I mean Mr. John—Gatley in camp?" she stammered forth, by this time
                  blushing deeply.
               "John Gatley? Yes—you'll find him in a tent nearly fronting this one," said the
                  officer, (for such he was,) pointing in the direction he wished to indicate. "Or,
                  if you prefer it, I will send for him. Just wait a moment."
               So saying, he turned about, with the view of carrying out his suggestion.
               "Oh, no, sir," said Filly, at once drawing forth the package. "I don't wish
                  particularly to see Mr. Gatley—but here is a letter for him: if you will only be
                  kind enough to see that he gets it without delay, it is all I wish—and much
                  obliged to you, sir."
               "By no means, I assure you," said the officer, as he took the package from her
                  hand: "it will give me pleasure to hand it to him myself, at once."
               Filly, bidding good morning, touched Pony with the whip and rode off.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I lov'd her dearly,
                           And when I do but think of her unkindness,
                           My thoughts are all in hell.
                        
                     
                     HEYWOOD.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        I have drank, and seen the spider.
                     
                     —Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  SCARCELY had the girl disappeared, when the officer started forth to
                  make good his word. He found Isabella's lover alone in his tent. He was lying on
                  his blanket with several newspapers scattered beside him. At that very moment,
                  when the crushing blow was about descending upon him, he was musing of his
                  betrothed, and fondly anticipating the joy which their appointed meeting, now so
                  near at hand, would give him.
               The officer left him alone again as soon as he had handed him the package. He
                  unfolded it, and as Filly's letter was the outside one, and therefore first noted,
                  he read it before he even glanced at the handwriting of the other. On perusing it,
                  a feeling came over him that was by no means agreeable, though perhaps not more
                  formidable than worry and dissatisfaction that Isabella had been so uncandid as to
                  keep him in total ignorance of so much of what was here exposed as concerned
                  herself. That Gatewood, or for the matter of that, any other man, should be
                  smitten, even to desperation, with her charms, did not surprise him in the least.
                  Nor did the fact that she continued to live in the house—which had no doubt been
                  duly negotiated for by her uncle and brother, as a temporary residence—seem to him at all
                  strange, except in so far as the situation might be a dangerous one to any lady
                  not sufficiently protected. That Gatewood, being deeply in love, should even
                  venture to write to her, appeared but natural. In the girl's letter there was not
                  a word to show that Isabella had ever given the Captain the least encouragement—so
                  that, what little indignation—if it may be so called—King felt at his sweetheart's
                  apparent want of candor in withholding from him the exact state of the affair, was
                  entirely borne down and lost sight of by his sympathy with the poor, forsaken
                  girl, who so simply depicted her own sufferings, and to whom, moreover, he owed
                  his life. Glad enough, therefore, was he to find that his betrothed knew nothing
                  whatever of Filly's engagement, since this ignorance released her from all
                  blame—even supposing she was to blame, in the least particular, for merely
                  treating with common politeness (which he, as yet, supposed was the entire extent
                  of the case) a man to whom she had had the misfortune to be placed under
                  obligation, first by mere accident, and then by her natural friends and
                  protectors, and through no agency of her own.
               As regarded any duel that he might hereafter find on his hands should he and
                  Gatewood both survive the war, Filly, he thought, might not be far wrong about
                  that. It would be by no means the first time that a man of Gatewood's fierce
                  temper had, by reason of baffled passion, insisted on such miserable satisfaction
                  as the duello affords. The prospect of such a fight, however, ruffled him but
                  little, except that, to use the poor girl's words, "to kill the Captain would be
                  like sending a bullet through her own heart."
               King read the letter but once, and read it rapidly,—yet so quick are the
                  operations of an acute mind when intensely engrossed, that he made (mentally, of
                  course) all the above comments on it during the brief time he was reading. So
                  that, when he came to her earnest, question at the end, "Why, then, can you not
                  marry her at once, and put an end to all this suffering?" he answered it, in his
                  heart, if not with his lips, "I don't know, Filly—but if I can, I most assuredly
                  will."
               It was with no apprehensions or misgivings as to its contents, that King took up
                  the other letter; and whatever scruples he may at first have felt as to the
                  propriety of reading it, were soon removed by the fact that it had been placed in
                  his hands by one in whose honor he had good reason to confide, and who, in her own
                  letter, had plainly told him that the welfare of more than one very dear to him
                  depended on his perusing it. Inasmuch as the writer of it had been exceedingly
                  kind to him during his sojourn at Camp Wildwood,—at a time when even a little
                  kindness, as contrasting with the fearful treatment he had experienced for years
                  at the hands of his fellow-men, could be so well appreciated, and stood him in so
                  good stead,—he could not help saying, "Poor fellow!" as he cast his eye on the
                  address, and thought how hopeless was the love of the brave man who penned it.
                  This first compassionate impulse over, however, he felt, as he unfolded the
                  letter, a touch of that contempt which we are apt to feel for one—be he ever so
                  worthy—who hangs on long and hard to a beloved object, suing abjectly after every
                  ray of hope is fled, and even after the fair one's scorn has withered him again
                  and again—for he never doubted, for a single moment, that such was the case here.
                  The greeting on the inside of the missive, however, somewhat startled him at first
                  sight.
               "'My dearest Isabella,' indeed!" he exclaimed. "The impudence of the fellow!"
               By the time he had read a few lines, embracing mere matters of fact, of general interest, he came to
                  the conclusion that this was but a friendly letter.
               "Oh, I see how it is," he thought. "She tolerates his writing friendly letters to
                  her—perhaps even encourages him in it—that she may get the news in which she is so
                  deeply interested; otherwise, she might not hear at all from the army. 'The cause
                  which you have taught me so well to espouse.' That's quite natural: she is very
                  enthusiastic, and wins over to the cause all who come in contact with her. That
                  was no trifle, my Bella! Gatewood has nearly two hundred brave men under him. 'Am
                  I not yours?' That is, her slave—ready to do her bidding. Verily, you are,
                  wretched sir! 'What is nearest your heart is nearest mine, and it must be so
                  henceforth and for all time.' Poor man! how deeply he must be in love! 'I often
                  recall the many delightful hours we have spent together on the lake and in the
                  woods.' The sweet siren! during those rambles she was only using her charms for
                  her country's good. I hope she gave him no reason even to think she
                  loved him: that would, indeed, have been cruel—unpardonable! Perhaps the next
                  sentence will explain. 'I often recall—so vividly, too, that I realize, in the
                  fond vision, half the bliss they gave me at the time—those burning kisses and
                  tender embraces.'"
               Carlos King was a strong man: his physique was a splendid one, or his skeleton had
                  long since mouldered piecemeal in the dungeon of Queretaro, or had lain bleaching
                  in the desert this side. His nerves were of the firmest—his thews almost as iron
                  for strength and endurance. Though of gentle nature, he was a stranger to fear,
                  and if need were to put forth his physical powers, there was not to be found of
                  human mould a doughtier foe. Yet this man of almost god-like make succumbed, both
                  in body and spirit, before that "paper bullet of the brain," like a stout warrior
                  shot through and through in battle. At that moment, and all in a moment, his
                  fervent love and his darling hopes were alike crushed forever. For long years, he
                  had fondly nursed them, like rare exotics, far away there in the innermost
                  recesses of his desolate heart—its only garden-spot: fondly nursed them there,
                  through years of storm, and blight, and canker,—allowing none to intrude upon
                  them, nor to look in, nor even so much as know of their existence. To him they had
                  all the fair outward seeming and tempting deliciousness of Dead Sea fruit,—and,
                  like that, they crumbled now, just as he was reaching forth to cull them for the
                  garnishing of his marriage-altar.
               Turning on his face, just there where he lay, he uttered a half suppressed
                  moan—his agony tenfold keener for that his immortal part, and not his body, had
                  sustained the scath. After a few minutes, he leaped up and paced the tent with
                  hurried, but such uncertain strides, that he soon staggered to a camp-chest.
                  Sinking down upon it to a sitting posture, he bowed low his head and pressed
                  between his hands his throbbing temples.
               The first thing that came between him and the tortures of his sudden hell, was the
                  sound of voices and laughter without, as from a passing group of rollicking men.
                  These beat so jarringly on his ear and told him, in such plain terms, that this
                  was no place for him, that he snatched up the letters—since they were
                  not for mortal eye—and rushed away to the depths of the dim woods unseen.
               When he had gone far enough to feel secure from intrusion he flung himself on the
                  ground, where he lay writhing, as though the snake that had stung him, along with
                  its venom had imparted its own serpentine movements. Hours elapsed before he had
                  any connected and definite thoughts as to his condition. To be sure, there was
                  ever present to his mind a realization of some terrible calamity personal to himself,—a constant, keen sense of
                  havoc and ruin within,—but this chaos of his mental deep was as yet without form
                  and void, and darkness was upon its face. For a while he was in much such a whirl
                  as characterizes the acme of madness. And, as the exhaustion which succeeds the
                  intense excitement of frenzy often induces slumber, long and profound, so was it
                  in this case of transient madness.
               As far as lying there alone on the cold, bare earth, the livelong night, was
                  concerned, that was, comparatively, but a luxury to him who had so often lain
                  pelted by the pitiless elements and howled at by hungry beasts. He did not wake
                  until a late morning hour,—and a most sovereign balm this respite of
                  unconsciousness had proved to his fevered brain.
               It was, like the preceding one, a bright and beautiful day. The sunbeams came
                  glinting aslant through the leafy openings: in unison with the breeze, they danced
                  on his lids in their golden-slippered feet. His eyes opened to the touch of this
                  gentle revelry, and let in the light even to the point of dazzling them and
                  causing them to blink in their sudden pain. But with it all there came not a ray
                  to the darkened soul that shuddered and crouched within. Nay—that
                  outward sheen, by contrast, but deepened the inner gloom.
               Yet for all this, the physical man was no longer unnerved. He now drew forth the
                  fatal letter, confident of his strength to endure its contents and to read it
                  through from beginning to end. As may be readily supposed, he dwelt not on the
                  words, as before, but hurried through their torturing lines, as the luckless
                  Indian captive runs the gauntlet. Every syllable buffeted his poor heart about,
                  and more than once it was quite transfixed during the cruel race.
               He found there an engagement of marriage, to be solemnized nized when the war
                  should close; a promise of reformation; fond anticipations of future happiness;
                  the recalling of past sweets; the hoped realization of present musings; the
                  frequent recurrence of "dearest;" the asking of the tender boon to be remembered
                  and dreamed of—and all this from another, which should have been only from
                     him. Yes—all this was there, and the strong man endured it without
                  a tear, without a groan or sigh,—but yet not without such an inward struggle as
                  none but his God could ever know.
               King, with this new incentive to do so, had no difficulty whatever—as, indeed, few
                  lovers have, with no incentive but true love itself to edge their memory—in
                  recalling, even to the minutest details, his late interview with Isabella.
               "No wonder now," he thought, "that she came so near swooning when I
                  told her of my intimacy with Gatewood. She feared that when he and I should meet
                  again during this campaign, there might come about a mutual exposition not the
                  most favorable to her faithless scheme. No wonder now that she looked surprised
                  when I proposed our speedy nuptials. No wonder she cast her eyes to the ground,
                  instead of looking tenderly in my face, as she was wont in the olden time when the
                  lightest word bearing upon love escaped my lips. No wonder she took a little
                  holiday of thought before speaking, and when she did speak at last, faltered at
                  her own lukewarm words. Yet never once did I doubt her love,—but only its
                  intensity compared with my own; and even this I freely forgave, for it was then
                  only a slight suspicion. Alas! it has become a dread reality. It is too plain now
                  that all this was double-dealing. She wanted not less than two lovers at least;
                  (and, indeed, for aught I know to the contrary, she may have a half-dozen more;)
                  one, as a reserve, to bill and coo with in Venus' service, in case Mars should
                  kill the other off."
               
               His mind was fated, however, to undergo many fluctuations before coming to a final
                  determination on a matter which had struck its tincture through and through his
                  life. From the sarcastic tone of thought in which he had just indulged, a reaction
                  of softer feeling came over him, and he fondly strove to believe she could not
                  have been so deliberately heartless.
               "She had, at one tine," he went on speculating, "given me up as dead,—and surely
                  not without good reason. What then if she, whiles, met with another who came
                     next to me in her heart: could I blame her much for accepting
                  him—thinking me forever lost to her? Ah! no—if she had but told me all, I could
                  have forgiven her, with only a trace of all this pain: ay, in time, could have
                  quite forgotten it. But to be engaged to one—not stranger to me, but a man who,
                  she knew, had once befriended me and placed me under lasting obligations—and not
                  to breathe me a word of it all,—that could not have come from a mere misfortune:
                  it was tenfold worse than a misfortune; it was perfidy—perfidy, too, of the
                  blackest dye. 'Burning kisses'—'tender embraces,' indeed? I too have enjoyed these
                  of her; but, alas! I have had my day, it seems, and such are no more for me. No—I
                  will never be an alternate in love to this man, or to any one else; nor will I
                  allow him or any one else to be an alternate to me. I once thought Isabella
                  Delgado mine—all mine—but now that she is, at least partly, another's, and is
                  neither anxious nor willing to forego him for me, I know she is false and has no
                  further claim on my love. Gatewood, Delgado, King & Co., Retail Dealers in
                  Fancy Goods—or Haberdashery, perhaps—of the Heart. A new-fangled firm this, and a
                  pretty one truly to trade with that ancient, venerable, wholesale concern, Cupid
                  & Hymen! Then, Know all men by these Presents, that the disgusting partnership
                  is hereby forever dissolved."
               And so great did the ruined man's indignation grow, at this point, that he
                  actually indulged in a sort of unearthly chuckle at his triumph—or, what he chose
                  to think his triumph—over himself.
               So might Marius have triumphed amid the ruins of Carthage—albeit they were ruins
                  over-strewn by the far sadder wreck of the stern old Roman's heart.
               The first impulse which came over him, after these reflections, was, to go at once
                  to the lake, and, under cover of night, put the letters into the hands of the old
                  Mexican, who, Filly had told him, lived there in the Señorita's service,—that he
                  might give them to his mistress.
               "She shall at least know," thought he, "that I am fully aware of her
                  treachery."
               So firmly resolved was he on this course, that he took a pencil from his pocket on
                  the spot, and prepared the Chief's letter for the contemplated delivery, by
                  writing immediately after the closing words—"Your devoted lover, Gatewood"—as
                  follows:
               "Carlos King begs the honor of congratulating the Señorita Isabella on her
                  approaching nuptials with her 'devoted lover'—as so delicately foreshadowed in the
                  above billet doux."
               He knew she would recognize his handwriting, and therefore signed no name.
               Besides the motive just stated for delivering these letters into her hands—to
                  inform her, namely, that he knew of her treachery—he felt himself actuated, in no
                  slight degree, by an additional one. Filly's letter would supply her with
                  information which might, in the end, redound to the former's advantage. For, if
                  the Señorita could be made to understand that Gatewood and the girl were to have
                  been married on the very day before the fickle Chief met with her ladyship, and
                  that the very house which the latter,
                  with so much complacency, occupied for her own personal comfort and convenience,
                  had been specially prepared for the reception of the other bride,
                  might she not be so staggered by the announcement as to withdraw, without more
                  ado, her affections from the man, and her person from the house, and leave Filly
                  once more in undisputed possession of both? But he soon saw—or thought he saw,
                  which had the same effect—the utter folly of such a course.
               "What a fool am I," he muttered, "to imagine that such a trifle as
                     that could rouse either the shame or the pity of such a person.
                  Moreover, let my sweet little friend speak for herself, if she wishes that
                  faithless lady to know about the state of her affairs. She is constantly on the
                  spot, and has the other's ear,—and it is certainly no business of mine to act as
                  her negotiator—and least of all, now. So, none of that: no, let all
                  thought of the false one be banished this moment and forever."
               Only a few minutes more elapsed before he was on his way to rejoin his
                  companions.

                  THAT lovely June evening for which the Señorita and her lover had
                  arranged their parting tryst, dragged along full wearily to both the fair dwellers
                  at the lake. They lay, side by side, in the hammock, swinging listlessly—
                  awaiting, with about equal anxiety, King's arrival. Nature seemed to have decked
                  herself out in a style of brightness and beauty peculiarly fitted for an occasion
                  which promised so well to disperse the overhanging heart-shadows, and make all
                  happy alike. But, then, Nature is not always what she seems to poor human
                  eyes.
               They did not know precisely at what hour to expect their guest. They watched the
                  sun's last rays as they tipped for a few moments the tree-tops on the eastern bank
                  of the lake, then faded entirely away—but he came not then. Nor yet did he, while
                  the twilight dampness was extracting fragrance from the spicy woods around, and
                  zephyrs were floating the instilled balm onward to where they sat, and dispensing
                  luxurious coolness about them. Nor yet while the crescent moon rode high,
                  checkering with "dim religious light" those leafy aisles, where an altar might
                  well have been set up to the God who was even then so lavishly showing forth His
                  glories around them,—His blessings, they thought,—fond lovers! vain dreamers! poor
                  deluded mortals!—so soon to follow.
               "Filly," said the Señorita, about midnight, "he surely cannot be coming
                  to-night."
               Each had thought this for several hours past, but neither had before ventured to
                  shape it into words. The "witching hour," however, had at last broken the
                  spell,—and no sooner had Isabella thus expressed herself, than her companion
                  readily agreed with her.
               "But, Señorita, what could have prevented his coming?"
               "Oh, many things may have prevented," replied the other, bracing herself with at
                  least the appearance of hope—the more, perhaps, that precious little of the
                  cheering substance itself was there. "He may not have been able to get a leave of
                  absence to-day. Or such news may have reached camp as to require all to push on to
                  the front. Other things, too, may have
                  happened. I have no doubt he will come to-morrow."
               Now what these "other things" were which Isabella did not see fit to specify, may
                  of course be gathered from the thoughts which her heart conceived, but which
                  aborted on her tongue.
               "Could he have suspected," she asked herself, "from my hesitation—my
                  confusion—and, at last, when he proposed our immediate marriage—my downright
                  refusal,—could he have suspected, from these, that I was not as true as I should
                  be, and that there was something covert and insincere in my conduct? It may well
                  be so; for I marked how his beaming countenance fell at that very moment. But then
                  he looked cheerful again after I gave my reasons for acting as I did. Yes—and he
                  parted full of tenderness. Alas! he may have brightened up, to all outward
                  appearance,—may have looked loving, to the very last,—may have done all this on
                  purpose to mislead me,—intending, even whilst he did so, never to see me again,
                  thinking me—false!"
               The other thing that Isabella imagined might have happened to prevent the return
                  of her lover, was his having possibly met with his former benefactor, Gatewood, or
                  with some of the men from the latter's command, who might by chance, during some
                  of their camp-fire discussions, have so expressed themselves within his hearing as
                  to give him an inkling of what had been so long going on at the lake. For although
                  she had no positive knowledge that her engagement with the Chief had been bruited
                  about, or even that it was suspected, she thought such gossip not at all
                  improbable, and now regretted, more than ever, her suicidal oversight in not
                  freely enlightening King—when she had so good an opportunity—with her own
                  statement of the case, instead of running the risk of his getting hold of some
                  perverted and ruinous version of the unfortunate affair.
               Filly, who, in placing the letters in King's hands, had acted from an impulse
                  caught from looking hastily at the matter, and then only on its bright side,—now
                  that the dark side began to obtrude itself, came, by degrees, to discover how
                  easily her conduct might produce an effect just the opposite of her
                  intentions.
               It was not very long after midnight that they retired to their bed, since sitting
                  up longer for their expected guest would evidently have been hoping against
                  hope.
               All the next day, they were expecting him—the next—and still the next. They then
                  gave him up,—but yet hoped, that, since he could not come in person, he would at
                  least send tidings of himself by letter or otherwise,—and why he had not kept his
                  engagement. At last, even this faint hope failed to delude them longer.
               "Oh, that I could let him know of my duplicity!" thought Isabella. "But he is far
                  on his way across the wilderness, and, so, my wish is vain. My only alternative is
                  to await, with what patience I may, the end of the war. If I can see him then, all
                  may yet be well. Faint hope, indeed! but I can do nothing better than nurse
                  it."
               Filly, for her part, from thinking that her hasty action might have had an effect
                  the direct reverse of what she desired, came soon to have no doubt whatever that
                  such a result—so disastrous to her own prospects, as well as to her friend's—had
                  already been consummated.
               But we must now leave these melancholy mourners to their sorrows, and their
                  penitential tears, for many a long day, and turn our attention to the busy and
                  bloody scenes about being initiated on the plains of Texas.

                  THE advance of the patriot army, after driving the royal troops from
                  the west bank of the Sabine, as stated in Gatewood's letter to his betrothed, had
                  pushed on to Nacogdoches with all dispatch, lest the enemy should have time to
                  fortify that place to such an extent as to render its capture a bloody affair. As
                  it was, they found, on their arrival, that the force which they had driven from
                  the Sabine having retreated to Nacogdoches and joined the garrison there, the two
                  combined had hastily constructed, on the hill overlooking the town on the east, a
                  breastwork, mainly of bales of wool designed for the Louisiana market.
               The enemy fled before the charge of the Americans, with scarcely a shot from
                  either side, and could be seen rapidly making their way through the town at the
                  very time the assaulting forces were taking possession of the abandoned works. The
                  Americans, resolved, from the very necessity of the case, to utilize everything
                  during this campaign, and finding that the wool-works, as such, could nowise serve
                  the cause, sent them off without delay to Natchitoches, to be exchanged for
                  additional arms and equipments, as well as enough supplies to serve them until
                  they should get further into the interior; for in all these the little army was
                  still sadly deficient, the United States authorities having so seriously menaced
                  its dispersion—to prevent an entanglement with Spain at this particular time, when
                  the long-threatened threatened war with England had become a reality—that it had
                  been forced to cross the border before they could be procured in sufficient
                  quantities.
               Up to this point, the advance, though nominally under the direction of General
                  Bernardo, was really commanded by the Chief of the Neutral Ground, whose men,
                  indeed, composed, thus far, nearly the whole force. Here they were joined by the
                  volunteers from the United States, numbering about a hundred and fifty.
               Having now penetrated some fifty miles into the Spanish territory, they considered
                  themselves secure from disturbance by the United States government. That
                  government, however, might yet materially cripple the expedition by capturing the
                  expected arms and supplies, which, even in case of the most fortunate conjunction
                  of circumstances, could not reasonably be looked for sooner than six or eight
                  weeks to come. At length, much to the little army's relief, both mentally and
                  physically, those war essentials reached Nacogdoches in safety.
               It was a bold undertaking which they had now before them,—and it was well for them
                  that no braver hearts could anywhere be found. Three hundred men were about to
                  march through a wilderness where subsistence, drawn, as it necessarily would be,
                  from the wild game of the country and from the few sparsely provisioned posts
                  which they might hope to capture, must needs be precarious. After taking, on their
                  way, such places as should offer resistance, and beating back such force as should
                  be sent against them, they must expect to meet, when they should reach the western
                  confines of Texas, at least, if not before, the main army of the enemy. If worsted
                  then, they must either fight to the last, or retreat five hundred miles through a
                  hostile country, pursued by a merciless foe. If captured, a fate worse than death
                  itself would await them in dungeons
                  geons, or mines well-nigh as hideous, where they must drag out for years, unless
                  suffering should sooner extinguish the vital spark, a wretched existence. Nor
                  could they hope for any material accession to their small force,—for the United
                  States, whence alone they could hope for recruits, had, as before stated, become
                  involved in a struggle with the most powerful nation on the globe, and, of course,
                  no more Americans could be expected, at a period so critical to their own country,
                  to leave it, that they might lend a hand in freeing another.
               In fact, taking into consideration the great disparity of the opposing forces, as
                  well as all the other circumstances of the case, no bolder military project than
                  the one we are about to chronicle, with such meagre facts as we can gather, had
                  taken place on this continent since Cortez, with a handful of men, marched on the
                  capital of the Montezumas; for not only had the Aztecs no knowledge of gunpowder,
                  but they had only rude arms, at best, to cope with the artillery and musketry of
                  their invaders. The brief period beginning in August, 1812, and ending just one
                  year from that time, was one of the most eventful in the whole history of Texas;
                  and it was only the fact that a bloody conflict at home engrossed, at the time,
                  the entire attention of our people that prevented the Gachupin War in that
                  province from occupying in history a much larger space than it does. As it is,
                  this brief, but bloody war—which, as far as the American arms were concerned,
                  began and progressed so gloriously, even to the very verge of final triumph, and
                  at length closed in an overthrow almost unprecedented in its completeness and
                  suddenness—fills, on the historic page, but an insignificant space. And, truth to
                  say, but few persons in the United States have even so much as heard of such a
                  war.
               During this time, Magee had remained behind, at Natchitoches, to collect and
                  forward what recruits he could. He, however, soon arrived at Nacogdoches, and took
                  command; though it was understood that Bernardo—as Magee himself had originally
                  proposed—should be the nominal commander-in-chief throughout the campaign.
               Some time in September, the little army left Nacogdoches and moved against Spanish
                  Bluff, on the Trinity. This post, then occupied by about four hundred Spaniards,
                  was evacuated on the approach of the Americans. The latter, after remaining here
                  for several weeks, vainly awaiting reinforcements, set out for La Bahia, an old
                  Spanish town on the Guadaloupe, now called Goliad.
               When within a few miles of La Bahia, Magee's advance captured certain spies, who
                  gave information that Governor Salcedo commanded at La Bahia, and that, having
                  been told that the Americans would attack the place, he had marched out with
                  fourteen hundred men, and with these was, at that moment, awaiting the invaders in
                  ambush, at the Guadaloupe crossing. Magee, on further investigation, finding this
                  statement made good, changed his route,—crossing the river below the ambushed
                  road,—then, making a forced march, reached the fort before daybreak, and captured
                  the small garrison with but little resistance.
               Three days afterwards, Salcedo, enraged at having been so completely circumvented,
                  made a furious assault on the place,—but, being driven off, fell to work preparing
                  for a regular siege. The Americans, meanwhile, were by no means idle. They mounted
                  on the bastions of the fort the three six-pounders which they had brought with
                  them, together with the only cannon they found there,—the same being an old
                  nine-pounder,—and proceeded to fortify the place as well as they could, and
                  otherwise to prepare for its defence.
               
               Salcedo had fourteen pieces of artillery of various calibre. Dividing his
                  force—which, by this time, amounted to two thousand men—into four divisions, he
                  stationed one on each bank of the river, above the town, and made a similar
                  disposition below. After cannonading sufficiently to satisfy himself that he could
                  effect nothing without heavier ordnance, he suspended his operations for a
                  fortnight, until he received nine splendid brass cannon, with which he could throw
                  a shot a distance of three miles. Finding, on trial, that even with this accession
                  of artillery little could be done against the strong walls confronting him, he
                  began to approach nearer, finally venturing into the town itself.
               Toward the close of November one of the severest fights of the siege took place
                  within the town and under the walls of the fort. It lasted from nine o'clock in
                  the morning until two P. M., when the royal troops hastily retreated, after a
                  heavy loss in killed and wounded, the Americans losing comparatively few. Finding
                  they could not take the town by assault, the enemy now determined to invest it
                  closely and starve the Americans out.
               The investment continued for nearly three months, and during this time skirmishes
                  took place almost every day, though there were only two other general engagements.
                  The first of these was brought on, during the latter part of January, without
                  premeditation by either of the combatants. The enemy's main force, on the opposite
                  side of the river, attempted to kill a beef for their own use. The beef escaping
                  ran towards the river in the direction of the fort. Now, although the Americans,
                  when they had captured the place, had found an abundance of corn and salt, they
                  had found little else in the way of provisions. One of Gatewood's hungry
                  companies—the one to which Wynne belonged—chanced to be looking on, and seeing
                  this delicious viand travelling toward them, their mouths straightway began to
                  water,—observing which, the cool old high-private just named, who always kept an
                  eye to the main chance, addressed those around him in his peculiar style of
                  oratory.
               Boys," said he, "beef's a rare thing with us lately, and as we don't like it quite
                  so rare, s'pose we furnish our own this one time. And to make right shore, boys,
                  that it's well done for once, s'pose our whole squad crosses the river, and puts
                  in for this here contract."
               No sooner said than done: for it was seldom that Wynne proposed anything in vain.
                  In fact, Patrick Henry's famous and oft-quoted outburst, reaching its climax of
                  pathos in "Beef! beef!" compared with this other "forest-born
                  Demosthenes'" effort, was the merest twaddle, so far as its effect on the audience
                  was concerned. As it was not long, however, before the execution of their project
                  brought them in contact with the enemy, it may well be supposed they forgot all
                  about the beef. From this insignificant beginning, the engagement became a general
                  one, and lasted about two hours—or until night, when the Americans retired,
                  fording the river back again to the fort, with the loss of only seven men. The
                  enemy's loss was nearly two hundred.
               Indeed, throughout the siege, the greatest difficulty, on the part of the
                  Americans, consisted in defending themselves—not against the Spaniards—though this
                  was no child's play—but against hunger. They could obtain beeves only by sending
                  out foraging parties at night, sometimes as far as the Nueces—a distance of about
                  fifty miles—where cattle of the finest quality abounded, and, on returning, they
                  had to take advantage of the darkness to drive them in between the investing
                  divisions—having sometimes to kill the sentinels, or even to fight a small
                  battle.
               Before the last general engagement,—which took place about the middle of February,—for some unknown
                  reason, a three days' cessation of hostilities had been agreed upon,—the officers
                  of the respective armies exchanging civilities and such courtesies as are usual
                  between gentlemen. It was during this lull that a mysterious event occurred which
                  took every American by surprise and came near proving instantly and fatally
                  disastrous to the expedition. Magee having accepted an invitation to dine in the
                  quarters of the Spanish commander, this festal interview resulted in an agreement
                  between them, that the fort should be surrendered, and the Americans should go
                  home without arms,—Salcedo to supply them with provisions on the way.
               Magee returned to the fort, paraded the men, told what he had done, and took their
                  vote by directing those approving his course to shoulder arms. His brave followers
                  unanimously struck the butts of their rifles to the ground with indignation. Magee
                  retired, with no little confusion, to his quarters, leaving the men on parade.
                  Difficulties and disorder threatened. Lieutenant-Colonel Kemper, repairing to
                  Bernardo,—who usually kept in the background, and did little, in fact, throughout
                  the campaign, beyond signing such papers as were necessary,—brought him forth to
                  aid in meeting this sudden and unfortunate emergency. The General sided with the
                  troops.
               Meanwhile, a flag from the Spanish commander brought a note to Magee. This was
                  delivered to Bernardo, who found that it reminded Magee of his honor, and of the
                  fact that the hour agreed upon for the surrender had expired. The flag was sent
                  back with no answer.
               Salcedo now made a furious assault, took the town, and advancing to the walls of
                  the fort, threatened, for a while, to capture everything and end the war on the
                  spot. The Americans, confounded by the wholly unexpected events which had shortly
                  before occurred, and having no commander mander, seemed to lose their wonted
                  efficiency as an organized body, though, individually, they were very far from
                  being demoralized. Soon rallying under Kemper, they drove the enemy from the
                  walls, then out of the town, and finally across the river—the fight continuing
                  until night ended it. The Spanish loss was very heavy. Their opponents being on
                  the defensive, suffered of course comparatively little.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Sir, spare your threats:
                           The bug which you would fright me with, I seek.
                        
                     
                     
                        Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        We've caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled.
                     
                     
                        All's Well That Ends Well.
                     
                  
               
               
                  MAGEE'S bravery being universally conceded, and his honor
                  undoubted,—at least, until this unfortunate event in his life,—all were at a loss
                  to account for his proposed surrender—most unmanly, to say the least of it, when
                  the prospect for repelling the enemy was certainly fair, and when not a man out of
                  his whole command was disposed to yield.
               The probability is, that he was no longer the fiery, brave, energetic officer he
                  was when he organized and led forth this expedition from the borders. The seeds of
                  that wasting disease, consumption, had, for a long time, been rankling in his
                  system, and the hardships and exposure to which this campaign had subjected him
                  had given them an impetus of development which fearfully exhausted his physical
                  powers. In proportion as these failed him, and the lamp of life burned low in the socket, his
                  courage and energy doubtless sank with them, until, by the time Salcedo sought the
                  fatal conference, he had become so wasted and unnerved by the ravages of the
                  disease as hardly to be responsible for his conduct in a situation so trying.
                  Instances are by no means wanting of a similar effect produced by physical
                  suffering on commanders of unquestioned bravery. Of these, Texas has since
                  furnished her proportion. Nay—near this very place, thirty-five years later, the
                  ill-starred but dauntless Fannin, unnerved by the sufferings produced by a severe
                  wound, surrendered his command, when it was said the hope of triumph still cheered
                  his men, and under circumstances which the unscathed Fannin would
                  have thought far from desperate. The gallant Texan, too, who led the famous "Mier
                  Expedition," is defended by his friends from the charge of untimely surrender,—at
                  a moment when victory hovered around his banner,—by the plea, that the severity of
                  his wound had unfitted him for his position. Most brave men, however, retain all
                  their nerve under such circumstances; though ever so horribly mangled in body,
                  their spirit remains unshaken to the last. Magee may not have been one of these.
                  His wily, cold-blooded, wholly unscrupulous antagonist may, deliberately and
                  purposely, have taken advantage of this shattered condition of his health, to
                  frighten him into surrender by gross misrepresentations or downright falsehoods
                  regarding his own resources, present, or expected in the shape of reinforcements;
                  and then may have backed these lies so effectually with threatening to end the
                  matter, if successful, with one of those horrible scenes of butchery, for which
                  the Gachupins were noted, that this poor, suffering wreck and shadow of manhood
                  may have been intimidated into a disgraceful surrender. Our sole choice lying
                  between this extenuating view and barefaced perfidy, we are strongly inclined to
                  choose the former.
               Magee did not leave his quarters during the fierce struggle going on around him.
                  The emphatic and indignant rejection, by his men, of the terms he had negotiated,
                  had chagrined him no little. Being too feeble, from his malady, and too exhausted
                  by recent excitement, to stand up, or even to sit up, throughout the fight, he
                  lay, most of the time, on his bed. Occasionally he would rise and stagger to a
                  window, whence he watched—with what concern can never be known—the combatants as
                  they exchanged hardiments in the deadly strife.
               Night closed upon them at last,—and he could see no more. But when he, soon
                  afterwards, caught the triumphant shout of the Americans, which told him of a
                  glorious victory, a sense of utter shame and disgrace came instantly over him.
                  What little life he had left was nearly extinguished by the shock, and he
                  straightway sank back on his bed in the agony of remorseful despair.
               It was at this moment that some one stole softly into his room without any warning
                  knock. He could see a stalwart form gliding stealthily along the wall between him
                  and the window, until it stopped close beside him.
               "Who are you?" demanded Magee, in feeble tones, at the same time
                  rising to his elbow, and feeling his flesh "creep" with terror, as the apparition
                  stood directly before him, towering and motionless.
               The only answer was a clear cold laugh,—not loud, but having the genuine fiendish
                  ring, so far as we mortals may judge at all of fiendish mirth.
               At the unearthly sound, Magee quickly shifted his position to the farther side of
                  the bed, and, as he did so, said, scarcely above his breath:
               "I never heard that laugh before—nor any like it!"
               "No—you never heard me laugh: but you've heard me groan. Magee! I come to you
                  besmirched with powder, and red with
                  blood, that, while my hand's in, I may play my little game with you all the
                  better."
               "Did I ever do you a wrong, that you threaten me so savagely?"
               "The scars on my back would freshen your memory, if you could see them. Perhaps
                  naming them will do it."
               "You are one of Gatewood's men, then?"
               "Ay—ay—and this is our day of settlement—and I'm glad I can pay you in full.
                  Here's for the blood your stripes drew from me," said he, taking from his belt a
                  long knife which gleamed in the light of the window. "But, for the fire-scars
                  which you branded into my flesh, you shall get enough of them, this
                  night, in hell!"
               The intruder, as he said this, stalked around to the other side of the bed, that
                  he might be nearer his intended victim, still holding the avenging blade in his
                  hand.
               "It's but a poor revenge," said Magee: "by killing me, you only anticipate, by a
                  few days at most, the work of disease."
               "That may be. But, then, the pleasure of it! To guide this blade across your d——d
                  throat at last! To feel it, as it cuts in!"
               "It was cowardly in you—what is your name?"
               "I am the devil."
               "I can almost believe you. It was cowardly in you, I say, Mr. Devil, to wait till
                  I was so near dead to do this."
               "Would you have fought me, if I had challenged you?"
               "In health, I would have fought the devil, upon occasion; and you say you're the
                  devil."
               "Yes—and you might have killed him, too. Magee, I would have been afraid of you in
                  open fight: but I've often watched my chance to kill you. Nothing else could have
                  made me serve under you. I would have shot you when your back was turned—stabbed
                  you in the dark— poisoned you—or killed you, any other way—but I knew, if they
                  found it out, they 'd make short work of me; for you were all the rage then. But
                  you've disgraced yourself to-day, and I might cut your throat before the whole
                  d——d army, and not a man raise a finger."
               "So you would n't be ashamed to kill a dying man—not even publicly?"
               "Yes: shame might prevent me—but nothing else would, if you were the
                  man. There's no public here, though."
               So saying, he strode a step forward, which placed him in contact with the bed;
                  then reaching forth his armed hand, he was about to execute forthwith his bloody
                  purpose, and that, too, as was evident, in the most summary manner, when Magee,
                  without attempting any resistance, or even stirring from the spot where he lay,
                  said:
               "So you will kill me?"
               "I will, by God!"
               "And nothing can stop you?"
               "Nothing this side o' hell—and hell'll have to be smart to do it."
               "Then I 'll tell you, man—or devil—or whatever you may be—a secret: that, in
                  killing me, you but do me a favor. I long for death. I was wishing for it when you
                  entered. The few days' respite that my disease would give me, seemed entirely too
                  long to look forward to, and I could not bear the thought of waking, even once
                  more, to the morning light, to face my shame. You thought me frightened when you
                  entered. So I was,—but it was only a supernatural dread: you came in so much like
                  a ghost. As soon as I found you were real flesh and blood, and learned your deadly
                  purpose, I looked upon you as a friend."
               Whether or not Magee spoke thus with entire sincerity, may be doubted. He probably strained the point a
                  little, in order to dash the sweets of vengeance which his grim assassin was about
                  to sip.
               "I your friend?" shrieked the man, almost beside himself with
                  rage.
               With these words, he clutched Magee by the throat, either because his fury came
                  upon him so suddenly that he did not once think of using the knife, although it
                  was drawn ready in his other hand, or because he wished to torture him a while
                  before killing him.
               If the latter, he widely miscalculated either the force, or the length of his
                  gripe,—for his victim never moved after that powerful hand was taken from his
                  throat.
               Finding that he was indeed dead, Crabtree—for it was he—the same who had uttered
                  such a terrible threat against Magee during Wynne's interview with the men at Camp
                  Wildwood—stole out as softly as he had entered but a few moments before,—leaving
                  only the remains of the commander of the patriot army, but yesterday
                  the idol of all, whose sad fate was, to be disgraced—deposed—and thus
                  murdered—within a few brief hours.
               The enemy made no further demonstrations, but continued in their quarters about a
                  week, when they raised the siege and commenced their retreat to San Antonio. A few
                  days later, Kemper set out in pursuit with his whole force,—to which, just before
                  starting, he had received an accession sufficient to supply all losses up to this
                  date. About one-half of this small reinforcement were Americans, the other being
                  Coshatta Indians, (known, then, as Quachattas,) the remnant of a brave tribe
                  living on the upper Sabine, who had always been friendly with the Americans, and
                  bitterly hostile to Spaniards.
               Salcedo soon hearing of the invaders' approach, sent out, to meet them, General
                  Herrera, and another General who had just brought reinforcements dispatched from
                  the interior provinces by the viceroy. Their whole force amounted to about
                  twenty-five hundred men. The first information the Americans had of the enemy was
                  given when within nine or ten miles of San Antonio, by a picket firing into their
                  right flank, the left being protected by the San Antonio River—here twenty or
                  thirty yards wide—along which they were marching.
               The Mexican force was ambushed on a slightly elevated ridge, which was covered
                  with chaparral. This ridge, running along between the San Antonio and the
                  Salado,—a small creek, which empties into that river, at an acute angle near this
                  point,—was crowned, about the centre of the royal line of battle, by several
                  pieces of artillery. An order was given by the American commander, that, at the
                  tap of the drum, a general charge should be made. The men were to advance to
                  within thirty yards of the enemy, fire three rounds, load again, and charge along
                  the whole line. The Coshattas, on the extreme right, misapprehending the order,
                  charged sooner than they should have done, and consequently suffered greatly,
                  losing some of their principal braves in a hand-to-hand struggle. The survivors,
                  however, stood their ground, and fought with undaunted bravery, killing a great
                  many of the enemy.
               Meanwhile, the Americans came up from the centre and left, and so coolly and
                  deliberately carried out the order of loading and firing repeatedly at short
                  range, that the enemy became demoralized, overshot their opponents, who were a
                  little below them on the hill-side, and when the general charge was made, at once
                  turned and fled along the entire line, despite the many gallant efforts of their
                  officers to rally them. Their loss in killed and wounded was nearly one thousand,
                  a very large proportion being officers.
                  But few prisoners were taken. The Americans lost between thirty and forty.
               The victors now pushed on to San Antonio, and proceeded at once to invest it.
                  Seeing this in contemplation, Salcedo sent out a flag of truce, and after a good
                  deal of parleying, perceiving that he could not help himself, agreed to surrender
                  unconditionally,—by which the Alamo—a very strong fortress—the town, and the
                  entire garrison fell into the hands of the Americans.
               For the purpose of formally complying with these terms, Salcedo rode forth and
                  offered his sword, first to Captain Taylor, who referred him to Kemper. Kemper, in
                  his turn, referred him to General Bernardo Gutierrez, as commander-in-chief. The
                  proud Gachupin's hatred getting the better of his discretion on seeing his old foe
                  triumphant before him, and on finding himself in a fair way to be personally
                  humiliated before so many witnesses, was unable, or unwilling, to endure so much.
                  Accordingly, in an evil moment, flown as he was with insolence, he advanced in
                  front of that commander, and disdaining to hand him his sword, as he had politely
                  enough done in the case of Kemper and his subordinate, ran the thing into the
                  ground right under Bernardo's nose, and turning scornfully on his heel, left it
                  there. Bernardo, after a while, took it up; but the insulting act of Salcedo, and
                  still more, the manner in which it was done, rankled in the vindictive and already
                  deeply wronged Mexican's breast,—destined to break forth, full soon, in such
                  vengeful guise as will never be forgotten in the bloody annals of butcheries.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Now by my faith and honor of my kin,
                           To strike him dead, I hold it no great sin.
                        
                     
                     
                        Romeo and Juliet.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        Nay—soft I pray you: I know a trick worth two of that.
                     
                     
                        King Henry VI.
                     
                  
               
               
                  SCARCELY was Bernardo established in his quarters in the town,
                  before he was visited by Juan Delgado. This young man's sole object in the war, as
                  avowed by himself in his conversation, previously given, with the Señorita
                  Isabella, was to avenge the cold-blooded murder of his father. As before stated,
                  he was at one time, while in the Neutral Ground, on the point of returning to San
                  Antonio to assassinate Salcedo, who had caused the murder to be perpetrated. But
                  on learning that the latter had left that place for the city of Mexico, he was
                  constrained to forego his vengeance for a while. When the campaign opened, he was
                  nominally taken on Bernardo's so-called staff—a position which was not only a
                  sinecure, but one which had neither honor nor emolument appertaining to it. From
                  what now speedily followed, it is quite probable that the young man, who was by no
                  means wanting in spirit, sought so inglorious a position merely because it would
                  enable him to leave the army at any time, for the accomplishment of certain
                  side-purposes, without prejudicing the service,—if, indeed, he had not the
                  General's assurance that such privilege should be accorded him whenever he might
                  see fit to ask it. Be this as it may, on hearing, soon after the expedition set
                  out from Nacogdoches, that Salcedo had returned to San Antonio, he readily
                  obtained his General's consent to go forth on the hunt of him.
               
               When he reached the latter town (in disguise), he ascertained that Salcedo had,
                  several days before, started out at the head of the royal forces, to meet the
                  Americans at La Bahia. There being of course no hope of reaching that tyrant while
                  surrounded by his army, the young man promptly set himself about doing what he
                  thought was the next best thing in his power to do under the
                  circumstances—secretly organizing in his native town a company of Mexicans, who
                  might be ready to join the patriots as soon as they should arrive.
               "We've caught the monster at last, General," said he, gloatingly, as soon as he
                  had greeted Bernardo.
               "Yes," replied the other, with an oath. "And now the difficulty is how to deal
                  with him."
               "What!" exclaimed Delgado, elevating his voice to a high key, while the fire
                  gleamed in his great dark eyes. "You not know what to do with
                     Salcedo? Is this possible, General Bernardo?"
               "Young man, don't let your excitement proclaim our designs to the whole city:
                  speak a little lower, if you please."
               "General, I care not if the whole city, and the whole world into the bargain, know
                  that I'm resolved to have the blood of that infernal villain."
               "But what, if such a broad announcement of it should foil its execution?"
               "Is he not in our power? and are not you commander-in-chief? What
                  more can be needed? Do you but give me the order—"
               "The obstacle in the way is not what you conceive it to be. Nor does it lie
                     here," said Bernardo, striking his breast.
               "Then," replied Juan, "I am wholly at a loss to—"
               "The difficulty," interrupted the General, "lies with the Americans. I know them
                  too well to believe they would ever consent to such an act."
               "I say we must have Salcedo's blood, let come what may. D——n the Americans! Have
                  they come into our country to dictate our treatment of the murderers of our
                  families? If so, let them go to hell! And the sooner, the better."
               Delgado was quite sincere in all he said. In fact, he was so near that point of
                  temporary insanity which is at present the rifest plea for homicide, that he had
                  become perfectly regardless of consequences, provided only vengeance could be
                  visited upon the incarnate fiend, who, after causing him so many disappointments
                  in the matter of reaching him, had at last come within his swoop.
               Bernardo, however, though sufficiently vindictive by nature, contemplated the
                  thing in a somewhat different light. Vengeance was much with him—as, indeed, with
                  what Mexican is it not?—but still it was only a secondary object. He was by no
                  means unambitious; and having already been chosen, by the Military Council,
                  Provisional President of the young Republic, he had good reason to think that, by
                  the exercise of only a moderate degree of prudence, he would be chosen permanently
                  to that exalted station. But he well knew that, if, by any rash act of his, the
                  Americans should be driven from the service, all these personal aspirations must
                  inevitably be dashed—to say nothing of the national welfare.
               "That may be your view, Juan," he replied, with great coolness,—"but it's not
                  mine. We owe our successes, thus far, to the Americans. Our countrymen, I am sorry
                  to say, have as yet done little or nothing. To be sure, they may do something, now
                  that our allies have so auspiciously opened the war in this quarter; and I
                  sincerely hope they will. But let them do their best, they cannot, unaided, expel these Gachupins from our native
                  province—at least they cannot at present; nor is it at all likely they will be
                  able to effect their expulsion for years to come."
               Delgado, of course, was not convinced. I say "of course," because it is my firm
                  belief that, since the creation of the world, no one in his particular frame of
                  mind ever was convinced that he was not already in the right. If an angel had come
                  down at that moment—or, indeed, at any moment within the previous
                  twelvemonth—bearing credentials of his angelic nature, and his divine mission as
                  unimpeachable as those required by a Radical Congressional Committee of a
                  Democratic member elect, and had said to him, "Young man, God bade me tell thee,
                  thou shalt not kill," the chances are ten to one that he would not only have
                  disregarded the mandate, but would have bidden the celestial messenger go to the
                  same place to which he had just before consigned the Americans for
                     their interference in the internal affairs of Mexico.
               "In the name of God," he exclaimed, "is that fiend to go unpunished? If we do
                  nothing with him now, when can it be hoped justice will be visited on him? Why,
                  sir, he may not go to hell for twenty years yet, unless we send him there now. Do
                  you know, sir, that he is treated, at this very moment, more like a gentleman than
                  like the pure devil that he is?"
               "Surely no one should know it better than I do,—since he is so treated by my
                  express order."
               "By your order?" cried Delgado, with a scowl that ill became his youthful and
                  really handsome face. "Then, General Bernardo, I am done with you forever! Though
                     not with him."
               So saying, he turned on his heel, and was about withdrawing without so much as a
                  parting salutation.
               "Come back, young man," said Bernardo, with a peculiar laugh.
               The other faced about, to hear what the General had further to say, for there was
                  something reassuring not only in Bernardo's laugh, but in his manner of speaking,
                  and even in the tones of his voice.
               "I see," Bernardo went on, "that you are quite as keen for this thing as I am,
                  which is keen enough, God knows. The only difference is in the extent of our
                  projects. Your sole aim is Salcedo, I believe?"
               "Yes. I have thought of no other. And yours—?"
               "Mine takes a much wider sweep. I would include not only Salcedo, but Herrera and
                  Cordero, with their respective staffs—fourteen in all. Here is the list," he
                  added, taking a paper from a drawer near at hand, and reading the names aloud:
                  "'Manuel de Salcedo, Governor of Texas; Simon de Herrera, Governor of New Leon;
                  Ex-Governor Cordero; Lieutenant-Colonel Geronimo.' Then come five or six captains,
                  three or four lieutenants, an ensign, and a citizen."
               "That would make a pretty good cleaning out, for Texas," remarked Delgado,
                  evidently startled, if not shocked.
               "And you shall do the work," said Bernardo, "if you will but promise to do it
                  faithfully."
               "But, General, not one of these, except Salcedo, ever harmed me or mine,—save in
                  so far as they have fought against our cause. Why then should I—"
               "Ask not my reasons. Let it suffice that I think the general good demands it. The
                  only question is, Will you do it?"
               "General, I always regarded Cordero and Herrera as the best Spaniards we have ever
                  had in this province: every one so regards them."
               "That only makes them the more effectual obstacles to our independence."
               "Must such men stand on the same level, then, with a monster,—and be butchered for their very virtues,
                  as he for his villanies?"
               "Well, as you choose, Juan Delgado. I see you are not equal to this thing. So, I
                  will get some one who is. Go your way—I have such a one in my
                  eye."
               "General, I must be Salcedo's executioner."
               "One might think you ought to be, young man, considering whose son
                  you are."
               "Are those, indeed, your only terms?"
               "It is but breath thrown away to ask for other."
               "Then, it must be done. Yes—rather than miss, I will do even that."
               "I'm glad to hear you talk so reasonably. Now let's about it. It admits of no
                  delay. It is a deed whose long contemplation may endanger its performance. The
                  much safer plan is to make it a memory at once. However much memory
                  may sting the living, it can hardly quicken the dead. It would be useless to ask
                  our American friends to sanction such work as this: it must be done by stratagem;
                  and if you can only manage to pick up a squad of desperate Mexicans, who will obey
                  implicitly, asking no questions, I think I have a plan by which the whole thing
                  can be accomplished within twenty-four hours."
               "There can be no difficulty," said the young man, "about getting the services of
                  such a squad, so long as my company is within reach."
               "Do you, indeed, command a company here?"
               "Ay, sir—and you may believe they are men who will not be over-scrupulous about
                  such a trifle as slitting a few Gachupin windpipes. But, General, what plea can we
                  use to induce these Americans to deliver the prisoners over to us? Are you
                  willing, as generalissimo, to issue a peremptory order to that effect,—without the
                  awkwardness of an explanation?"
               "Oh, you may be sure I have already laid my train to that end; and for doing so,
                  you were, only a moment since, on the eve of leaving me in disgust."
               "Do you allude to your kind treatment of the prisoners? for it was that which
                  disgusted me."
               "That is what I allude to."
               "I confess, I can't see what you could expect to accomplish by that."
               "No, Juan—you're too impetuous to plot yourself, or even to see the merits of a
                  plot after it is hatched out by another. But I am older and cooler, and, so, can
                  look ahead a little way. Not satisfied with the proposals of the Americans as to
                  the kind treatment of the captives, I went much further, and, in my turn, proposed
                  to put them on their parole of honor, and even to allow them the liberty of the
                  town—besides other privileges."
               "Ay, now I see," said Delgado. "Your object was to blind everybody to the
                  vengeance that you would not forego, but were willing to postpone for a little
                  season, that success might be assured. But suppose the Americans had consented to
                  all this: Salcedo might have effected his escape!"
               "I knew they would not consent."
               "By my father's soul! had I seen him ranging the streets, I would have buried this
                  up to the hilt in his black heart, even at risk of being so served myself the very
                  next moment."
               As the young man spoke, he drew a small, keen dagger from beneath his vest far
                  enough to flash it in Bernardo's eyes, then, slipping it back to its sheath, went
                  on:
               "In fact, when I was about to leave you so abruptly, a few minutes since, outraged
                  by your seeming generosity to that monster, I had resolved to make my way hence,
                  straight to his quarters, and stab him to death on the spot, despite all the American bayonets that could have
                  been levelled at me. But I much prefer to play with him a while—as he did with my
                  poor father and mother—on the awful verge of eternity."
               Here a shade of sadness swept the handsome face of the speaker, greatly
                  heightening, for a moment, his natural beauty, and well calculated to excite a
                  touch of pity in the beholder's heart; (had there been any beholder there with a
                  heart susceptible of pity, which was by no means the case;) but it was only for a
                  moment. Vengeance again mounted up from within and drove the soft usurper
                  away.
               "You shall have a chance to 'play with him' to your heart's content," said
                  Bernardo, "if you will but hearken and obey. But first, of the stratagem I have
                  concocted to get hold of these Gachupins. We will imagine a ship at Matagorda Bay,
                  which, by information lately arrived, will sail in a few days for New Orleans.
                  That is the whole basis of my project. Whether any ship is lying there or not, or
                  whether any such information has reached here to that effect, matters little to
                  you. In the next place, I will call the American officers together, for a
                  consultation touching the disposition to be made of the prisoners; and after
                  giving my views as to the unavoidable insecurity of guarding them here, where many
                  of the citizens still adhere, in heart, to the royal cause, I will tell them of
                  the opportunity which presents at the Gulf, to send the prisoners to the United
                  States, on their parole of honor not to return to this country during the war. I
                  shall do this on the avowed pretence of holding their word more secure than
                  guards—for you know, when a prisoner is not on parole he has a perfect right to
                  escape whenever he can. My real opinion of a Gachupin's word you well
                  know to be very different.
               "Should the Americans accede to this proposition—which I doubt not they will
                  do—you, Juan, shall escort them to— Well, whether they ever reach the Gulf or not
                  must depend entirely on you. And I—"
               "Don't doubt, General, but they shall reach the Gulf—the Great Gulf—that Gulf of
                  Gulfs—the bottomless Pit, I mean."
               "And I freely confess my confidence," the General went on, without much heeding
                  the interruption, "that you will faithfully discharge the important duty devolved
                  on you. I am glad to trust the matter into such safe hands. There is one thing,
                  however, which you must remember as certainly as though your life were to be the
                  forfeit of forgetting it: not only that the whole responsibility and odium of the
                  result of this thing—let the result be what it may—is to rest on you,
                  henceforth and forever, but that you will exculpate me from all complicity in
                  laying this plan. You must swear until you are black—should the necessity
                  arise—that I knew nothing whatever of your intentions."
               "You need have no fear, General," replied Delgado, with a gloating laugh, "of
                  incurring the least particle of either the shame or the merit that may attach to
                  the affair. I can assure you, I shall be but too proud of the catastrophe for the
                  remainder of my days—be they long or short—to allow the world to shift it to other
                  shoulders."
               With this understanding, they parted.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XL.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Oh, you are well-tun'd now,
                           But I'll set down the pegs that make this music.
                        
                     
                     
                        Othello.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           A young man
                           More fit to do another such offence
                           Than die for this.
                        
                     
                     
                        Measure for Measure.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Duke.
                           —Had you a special warrant for the deed?
                        
                        
                           Provost.
                           —No, my good lord, it was by private message.
                        
                        
                           Duke.
                           —For which I do discharge you of your office.
                        
                     
                     
                        Measure for Measure.
                     
                  
               
               
                  NEXT morning, Delgado's company, commanded for the time by the first
                  lieutenant, left town, escorting Salcedo, Herrera, Cordero, and others,—all of
                  whom, from having had constantly before them the gloomy prospect of a dungeon, or
                  even worse, were now cheered at the idea of being placed so soon in a state of
                  comparative freedom; and as they talked and joked with the men who escorted them,
                  they seemed far more like comrades than prisoners. The American officers who had
                  gathered on the plaza to see the captives start, on observing in them such a flow
                  of spirits, waved them a friendly adieu, and bade them God speed. They no more
                  doubted that Bernardo intended to keep good faith in this matter, than they
                  doubted the justice of heaven itself. He had, to serve his own bloody purpose,
                  played so deftly the part of a generous enemy, that they were completely blinded
                  to his treacherous designs.
               Delgado himself chose, as yet, to linger behind. This was an all-important part of
                  the blinding process. His appearance at the head of the escort would instantly
                  have transformed that gay cortege into the semblance of a funeral procession.
                  This, of course, was, of all things, to be avoided, until beyond the sight of the
                  Americans; for it would inevitably have led to a protest on the part of Salcedo
                  and his companions,—their more humane enemies would have interfered, and the
                  scheme of dreadful retribution must have aborted.
               A few minutes after they had taken their departure, Delgado rode, alone, from the
                  opposite side of the town, and after making a circuit, forded the river; then
                  taking the road that wound along its eastern bank, soon overtook the procession.
                  Salcedo had not seen him since that fearful day in the records of the Delgado
                  family, when he had forced him and his mother to be present at the execution of
                  the father and husband. We can therefore but faintly imagine the horror which
                  struck through the tyrant's flinty heart, when he saw the scowling youth come
                  thundering up in the rear,—like a black cloud fraught with vengeance,—and take his
                  place at the head of the escort.
               All that is known of the precise mode in which this horrible deed was executed,
                  was elicited from the lips of the young man himself during his informal trial.
               It would have required at least a week to escort the prisoners to the Gulf, and
                  return. Inasmuch, therefore, as Delgado and his entire company were in town, next
                  morning, in their quarters, the American officers, who had pledged their honor for
                  the safe conduct of the captives, suspecting treachery, and learning that he had
                  sallied forth from the town soon after the escort started, and had taken command
                  of it, caused him to be arrested and brought before them.
               "Gentlemen!" he began, as soon as he had come into their presence, and before any
                  one had time to propound a query, "I know exactly what I am brought here for,
                  although I have neither inquired of any one, nor been informed; and I wish you to understand, once for
                  all, that you need fear no concealment on my part. I alone am responsible for the
                  deed which shocks you."
               "Were you present at the butchery?" asked Colonel Kemper, "or did you only—"
               "Present? My God! yes, sir. I would n't have missed my share in that
                  for the whole world. Present, indeed! Why, gentlemen! I killed Salcedo myself. I
                  stripped him: I tied his hands behind him: I whetted my knife on the sole of his
                  boot, right before his face, that he might see it, and hear it, before he
                     felt it. I then asked him if he remembered the day when he had me
                  dragged from my cell, and my mother from our home, that we might see my father
                  beheaded—to hear of it merely would not satisfy him. And you may be sure,
                  gentlemen, I did not fail to ask him, further, if he remembered how he ordered the
                  blood from the streaming neck to be sprinkled over our persons—as coolly as you
                  may have seen a priest order his congregation to be sprinkled with holy water from
                  the censer.*
                   I asked him if he knew my mother had died from the shock. And after I had
                  thus jogged his memory—yes, then, in that proudest moment of my life,
                  with this very blade—this blade—here it is, gentlemen!" he said,
                  plucking from his belt a knife uncleansed of yesterday's blood, and shaking it
                  aloft with all the terrible grace and beauty of a thoroughly roused tiger—"with
                  this knife, and with this hand, I cut the villain's throat from ear to ear. If you
                  want my life, take it. I care but little: my chief mission is done—and I thank my
                  God that he has spared me to do it."
               
                  *Lest my readers may think I have invented
                     this horrible portion of young Delgado's story, I will give an extract from
                     a letter which can be found in Niles' Register, vol. iv. p. 280. It is
                     written to the Editor: 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    "PINKNEYVILLE, M. T., May 28th, 1813.
                                 
                                 ". . . Col. Samuel Kemper, who commanded in the action fought
                                    near St. Antonio, has arrived and is now here. From, his
                                    information it appears that the killing of the fourteen
                                    prisoners was without the approbation of the Americans, and
                                    by the express order of the generalissimo, Bernardo . . . The
                                    young Creole who was charged with the execution of this order
                                    was one who had, on a former occasion, witnessed many
                                    cruelties of Salcedo, and among them the beheading of his
                                    father, at which his mother was also compelled
                                    to be present; and by order of Salcedo the blood from the
                                    bleeding head of his father was sprinkled over his
                                    unfortunate mother."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "How were the other prisoners killed?" asked one of the officers, after the awful
                  pause which ensued at the end of this outburst had continued for a full
                  minute.
               "Much in the same way, I suppose. I was too busy myself to observe what my men
                  were doing, or even to think of them at all. I gave them no order—in fact, I said
                  not a word to them: from the moment I caught sight of Salcedo, everything else and
                  everybody else passed from my mind. But I did set them the example I
                  have told you of,—and I suppose they were not slow to follow it, for when I had
                  finished my part of the work, I saw the other prisoners lying around me, as dead
                  and as naked as Salcedo."
               The officers now put their heads together, and there was a low hum of conversation
                  going on between them for several minutes,—though nothing of what they said could
                  be heard where the prisoner stood, quite alone.
               "I believe he is a madman," said one.
               "If not," said another, "it would indeed be a wonder; for he certainly has had
                  enough to drive him mad. We all have heard of that fiendish deed of Salcedo's
                  before, but I suppose we had forgotten all about it. I certainly had—or I should
                  never have favored treating him so kindly."
               "Well," said a third, "whether insane or not, we may as well discharge him at
                  once. Considering the provocation, there is no one here, I 'm sure, who would wish
                  to punish him for killing Salcedo just so soon as he got a chance— though one might well wish the deed had been done
                  after a less inhuman fashion."
               "Gentlemen," said Colonel Kemper, who, thus far, had been a mere listener, "I
                  cheerfully agree with you, that we ought to release this unfortunate young man.
                  Whether the butchery he has perpetrated be justifiable or not, I do not propose to
                  discuss. But, convinced as I am, that any one of us would have done the same
                  thing—though, I hope, in a more civilized way—I cannot see how we could
                  consistently—or conscientiously, if you please—impose a punishment on him, even to
                  the extent of 'breaking' him. But, at the same time, we must not lose sight of the
                  very important fact that our honor was solemnly pledged for the safety of these
                  prisoners, and therefore it behooves us to do something more than we have just
                  done to clear our skirts in this matter. I consider myself involved to a greater
                  extent, personally, than the rest of you, from the fact that, under certain
                  representations from Bernardo, I signed a peremptory order directing the officers
                  of the guard to deliver the prisoners into the hands of such of his subordinates
                  as he might designate to receive them."
               "What, then, do you propose to do, Colonel?" asked Major Ross.
               "I propose," replied Kemper, "that Bernardo be examined informally. I have my
                  suspicions that he is the guilty one. If he cannot give a consistent and
                  satisfactory account of his part in this miserable affair, he ought then to be
                  tried by a regular court-martial, without the least fear or favor as to the
                  exalted position with which we have entrusted him,—and if proved to be responsible
                  for so gross an act of perfidy, he should be at once deposed."
               "Colonel," suggested Major Ross, "before we discharge Delgado, suppose you ask him
                  a few questions about Bernardo's part in this matter."
               This being agreed on, Kemper began:
               "Captain Delgado, will you be so good as to inform us, so far as you may know,
                  what agency, direct or indirect, General Bernardo had in this killing?"
               "Yesterday, I made the General a friendly visit at his quarters," answered
                  Delgado, whose fury had, by this time, reacted into a comparative calm. "In the
                  course of our conversation, after remarking on the insecurity of the prisoners, so
                  long as they should remain here, he said he had information that a vessel was
                  lying at Matagorda Bay, which would soon sail for New Orleans; and that, if he had
                  at his service a company of Mexicans, he would like to send the prisoners off to
                  that point."
               "Why did he wish them to be Mexicans?"
               "I suppose he thought the Americans could not well be spared."
               "Did he assign that as his reason?"
               "No—but he had just before said their presence here on the frontier was
                  indispensable."
               "Well—that's much the same thing. What next, Captain?"
               "Then I offered the services of my command."
               "Was he aware, before, that you had a company here? In plainer terms, do you think
                  he intended to hint to you that he would like to have the services of your company
                  in particular?"
               "He knew nothing at all, until that moment, about my company—not even of its
                  existence."
               "He accepted your offer without hesitation?"
               "He did."
               "Did he know of Salcedo's inhuman treatment of your family?"
               "Oh, yes—he must have known of that: it is known, I believe, to everybody in
                  Texas."
               "Did he give you any intimation as to what your treatment ment of the prisoners should be? whether you were
                  to treat them kindly, or the reverse?"
               "He impressed on me the importance of escorting them safely through to the Gulf.
                  Said he had entire confidence that I would discharge the duty faithfully, and that
                  he was glad he was able to commit the matter to such safe hands."
               "And you promised to perform your duty faithfully?"
               "I did. And, by God! I have kept my promise."
               "Do you think the General suspected for a moment that you would keep it in
                     that sense?"
               "His language, which I have just given you, gentlemen, does n't sound much like
                  it. I have nothing else to judge from."
               Colonel Kemper's proposition to examine Bernardo being now unanimously agreed to,
                  he was summoned—Delgado having first been discharged from custody. Although the
                  General might well have fallen back on the dignity of his supreme office and have
                  refused compliance with this irregular summons from his inferiors in rank, he knew
                  too well the tone of character of the American officers and their followers, as
                  well as their importance to himself, to assume towards them any such preposterous
                  attitude. He, therefore, soon made his appearance. While waiting for him, however,
                  one of the captains, who had stepped out to take a stroll of recreation on the
                  Plaza, returned and said he had just heard the hint thrown out by a citizen that
                  the pretended information on which Bernardo had based his plan of sending the
                  prisoners off, must have been manufactured out of whole-cloth,—since there was no
                  vessel at the Gulf, and had not been for weeks; and that, in the present
                  distracted state of the country, it was not at all likely there would be one there
                  for a long time to come—all trade having been destroyed. On this hint mainly they
                  determined to rest in support of their charges.
               "General," said Colonel Kemper, soon after Bernardo had entered and gracefully
                  saluted those who awaited him, "we are forced by late occurrences to assume toward
                  you an anomalous and very unpleasant attitude,—which, however, we sincerely hope
                  may be only temporary."
               Bernardo bowed politely, and smiled, as he did so, a pleasant smile.
               "We are not altogether satisfied, General," Kemper went on, "that you had not some
                  agency, direct or other, in the horrible murders that were perpetrated yesterday a
                  mile or two below this town."
               The General started a little from his position, with a surprised look, affected or
                  real,—though, if the former, it was certainly well acted.
               "Would you be willing," continued Kemper, "to answer a few interrogatories bearing
                  on that point?"
               "Most assuredly, Colonel," Bernardo said; "nothing could give me greater pleasure
                  than to have so good an opportunity of clearing myself of so grave a charge.
                  Proceed with your inquiries, gentlemen, if you please. Or, rather, I
                     beg you to do so, for the sake of my own reputation and that of
                  the patriot army. And I sincerely hope you will not stop short of anything which
                  may aid in sifting the matter so thoroughly that there may be no ugly suspicions
                  about it hereafter."
               Bernardo, in deporting himself thus confidently, had, of course, taken it for
                  granted that Delgado—who he was aware had already been before this body—had
                  faithfully kept his pledge, by not saying anything to implicate him. And in this
                  assumption, as we have seen, he was quite right.
               "General, we suppose you have long ago heard of Salcedo's cruel treatment of the
                  Delgados?" was the next query propounded.
               "Oh, yes—it is known throughout the land."
               
               "Then we do not clearly see why, after pledging solemnly your honor, along with
                  ours, that the prisoners should be kindly treated, you should place them, at once,
                  and without any consultation with us, in the power of one of that deeply wronged
                  family."
               "There was no other organized company, or squad, to be found," replied Bernardo,
                  "except among the American forces; and I did not hold it safe to send any of them
                  so far away."
               "What instructions, if any, did you give Captain Delgado?"
               "I told him I wished him to escort the prisoners to Matagorda Bay, where there was
                  a vessel lying, which would take them to New Orleans."
               "Did you try at all to impress on him the importance of performing the duty
                  faithfully?"
               "Yes—I told him I had every confidence that he would execute my order faithfully,
                  and escort them safely through."
               "Had you any personal spite or particular cause of malice against one or more of
                  the massacred officers?"
               "None whatever."
               This answer, although utterly false as regarded Salcedo, Bernardo delivered
                  without a show of hesitation, and even with an air of the utmost candor. The
                  simple truth is, he had expected the query and was ready for it.
               The most unscrupulous liar, before delivering his lie, will cast about him for
                  some sort of salve, however sorry a one, for his poor, miserable wreck of a
                  conscience. So, Bernardo, in meeting this query, argued inwardly, that his spite
                  was entertained against the officers only while they were yet
                  unmassacred, and that as soon as the massacre took place all his
                  spite ceased; ergo, he had no spite against any
                  of the massacred officers. So much for a Mexican's conscience,—or, rather, the
                  remnant of that noble, sensitive conscience with which his Maker has endowed him
                  in common with the rest of mankind, but which has been frittered away in political
                  and social intrigue, until a mere shell is left,—and that often of the hardest
                  kind.
               "We would like to know, General, the source of your information to the effect that
                  a sail, destined for New Orleans, is now lying in Matagorda Bay?" was the next
                  interrogatory, and the one on which the Americans—to judge from the intentness
                  with which they awaited the answer—evidently expected the whole matter to
                  turn.
               Bernardo showed just enough confusion to be perceptible, and did not at once
                  reply.
               "We ask this," resumed Kemper, on perceiving his hesitation, "because we have
                  since heard that no vessel is there at present, or is likely to be there within
                  any reasonable time."
               These additional words by no means relieved the embarrassment of the accused. Nor
                  is it at all likely his interrogator designed that they should do so. The blood
                  mounted from his guilty heart to his cheek, as Abel's rose out of the ground and
                  told who was the murderer then. He winced unmistakably, and his
                  effort to answer was delayed for some time. During this painful pause, all eyes
                  remained fixed upon him; and though sadly at a loss what to say—yet knowing full
                  well that something must be said, and that speedily, or his ruin was at hand—he
                  managed at last to get off a miserable abortion.
               "Well really—gentlemen, I—I have forgotten."
               There was perhaps not a man present who did not think Bernardo's complicity pretty
                  well established by the latter part of this examination. At any rate, a
                  court-martial was the consequence,—which resulted in implicating him in the
                  murder. He was accordingly—on the ground of treachery and barbarity—deprived at once of all
                  military command, nominal and real, as well as deposed from the Provisional
                  Presidency, to which he had just been chosen.
               So here Bernardo Gutierrez disappears from our story, to reappear briefly but once
                  or twice again. He was doubtless a man of talent, and was possessed of fascinating
                  manners. He had done as much, perhaps, as any one else to initiate this
                  invasion,—though, since it crossed the Sabine, he had—most probably from lack of
                  personal courage—done little or nothing to advance it,—and now he came near
                  working its ruin; for Kemper, Ross, and many other officers, as well as some of
                  the men disgusted by such perfidious atrocities, which they feared—and certainly
                  not without reason, now that full five hundred Mexicans of San Antonio and
                  vicinity had joined the little army—might, at almost any time, be repeated,
                  abandoned the patriot cause, and returned to the United States.

                           . . . . So horrible, so bloody, must
                           Lead on to some foul issue.

                  AT the same time that Bernardo had been placed at the head of the
                  local administration, a council of thirteen—only two of whom were Americans—had
                  been appointed to advise with and assist him in the discharge of his duties. As
                  soon as he was deposed, however,—there being no one who was capable of filling his
                  place, and who would at the same time have been acceptable to the Mexicans
                  cans,—the entire civil machinery went to pieces. It is not at all improbable that
                  the Americans—well knowing that one of their own number would not, without much
                  murmuring, be tolerated at the head of affairs by the ignorant and jealous Mexican
                  population, and fearing to risk in that exalted position another of Bernardo's
                  race—concluded they would try for a while, in preference, the experiment of having
                  no civil government at all. Be the reason what it may, there certainly was, for a
                  time, no civil government in San Antonio.
               The consequence of this want of wholesome restraint was, that, on a small scale,
                  the invaders came near finding their Capua in San Antonio. For the two or three
                  succeeding months,—during which there was not even a rumor, false or other, of an
                  enemy's approach,—the Americans revelled in all the excesses which a plentiful
                  supply of wine and comely women well-nigh invariably develops in the inflammable
                  soldier, during those heyday periods when he is fain to forget the hardships and
                  dangers through which he has already passed, no less than to blind himself against
                  such as are yet to come.
               Whilst they were still rioting in almost every kind of dissipation, Elisondo—the
                  same who had so basely betrayed Hidalgo into the hands of the royalists—suddenly
                  made his appearance before the badly picketed town with three thousand of the
                  viceroy's regular force. He could easily have entered the place at once; but not
                  knowing how thoroughly surprised the garrison were, nor how ill-prepared for
                  defence at that particular juncture, instead of seizing this opportune moment, he
                  quietly encamped not quite a mile from town.
               There being, on the side of the patriots, no one at the head of affairs to direct
                  their movements, great confusion for a time prevailed. The local influence proved
                  too strong to justify the Americans in
                  setting up one of their own number in place of the discarded Bernardo; for,
                  despite his broken faith—or, possibly, by reason of it—he was still a favorite
                  with the Mexicans. Had there been in the beleaguered town any one else of that
                  mongrel race, who could have commanded the confidence of his countrymen, it is
                  quite safe to believe that Bernardo would have been ignored—and that, without
                  scruple—by their allies. There was, however, no other Mexican to be for a moment
                  thought of, except Manchaca, who, although possessing, with all his rudeness, a
                  vast deal of vigor, both mental and bodily, and having no little influence with
                  his people, was nevertheless unfit for leadership.
               Thus did Bernardo come to be reinstated—though only nominally, and for this
                  special emergency. Perry, an able and energetic officer, was the real
                  commander—both Kemper and Ross, who out-ranked him, having, as already stated,
                  quit the service in disgust of Bernardo's conduct.
               Meanwhile Elisondo had the effrontery to propose to the Americans, through a
                  messenger, that, if they would surrender into his hands Bernardo and the other
                  Mexicans implicated in the murder of the Spanish officers, they would be allowed
                  to retire unmolested from Texas. To this they replied to the effect, that not only
                  did they not desire his Excellency's gracious permission "to retire unmolested
                  from Texas," but that they, in their turn, had no intention of allowing
                     him any such privilege.
               A word to the wise is said to be sufficient; and, if the saying be true, Elisondo
                  must, indeed, have been a fool, that these plain words did not suffice to put him
                  more on his guard than he was presently found to be. His impudent proposition, and
                  the contemptuous answer thereto, were proclaimed in the town, and had, at once, a
                  most happy effect in rallying the people. A general muster was called, and all
                  Americans and Mexicans capable of bearing arms prepared for battle.
               The Americans, with the hope of effecting a complete surprise,—a matter of vast
                  moment to them, when the disparity of numbers, as well as the almost entire want
                  of discipline and experience on the part of their Mexican allies, is
                  considered,—put double sentries on duty,—no one was allowed to pass and repass,
                  and all their cannon were spiked except four pieces.
               The Spaniards had thrown up two bastions, with a curtain of about four hundred
                  yards between. This work covered a gentle ridge running hard by the bank of the
                  Alazan, a small branch of the San Antonio river, and behind which they were
                  encamped.
               About ten o'clock at night, the Americans marched out by file, in deep silence,
                  until they had reached a point where they could hear the enemy's guard. Here they
                  sat down, with their arms beside them, through the remainder of the night. Orders
                  were given that a charge should be made, on a certain signal. This signal was to
                  be communicated noiselessly by a check from the right of each company: not a word
                  was to be spoken. About daybreak, when the Spaniards were heard at their matins,
                  the concerted signal was set in motion on the extreme left of the little army, and
                  ran through its ranks like an electric shock.
               The patriots, numbering about seven hundred and fifty, only one third of whom were
                  Americans, moved forward like veterans. The enemy, as hoped, were completely
                  surprised. The assailants, after capturing their pickets, mounted the works,
                  hauled down the Spanish flag, hoisted their own tri-color—all, before those in
                  camp even so much as suspected what was going on.
               The Spaniards, however, notwithstanding the disadvantage which the surprise caused
                  them, as soon as they could bring
                  themselves to comprehend fully the state of things, rushed to the menaced point
                  and fought bravely. After a hard struggle they succeeded in driving the assailants
                  from the works. But the Americans, by a resolute charge, recaptured them—using
                  only the bayonet—and carrying everything before them, penetrated into the camp.
                  The slaughter was terrible. The battle had lasted several hours, when the
                  Spaniards fled, leaving a thousand killed and wounded,—very few being captured.
                  There fell into the hands of the patriots all the enemy's artillery, a large
                  quantity of ammunition and military stores, two standards, and some silver. The
                  patriots themselves lost nearly fifty killed outright, and about one hundred and
                  fifty wounded, one third of them mortally. This was, as yet, the hardest-fought
                  battle of the campaign.
               The battle, however, which was to decide, for many years, the fate of Texas, was
                  yet to come. And it came much sooner than the achievers of the recent glorious
                  victory had any reason to expect.
               Bernardo was now a second time dismissed from the service. It is difficult to
                  pronounce, at this late day, with the meagre evidence before us, whether this man
                  was an ardent and self-sacrificing patriot,—lacking, however, the very essential
                  endowments of courage and humanity,—or whether he was only a truckling
                  time-server. It is certain he endured—though with what patience, we cannot now
                  learn—a vast deal of such treatment from the Americans as could have been borne
                  only by the possession of one or the other of the two antipodal qualities above
                  named. Nor were the Americans to be blamed for so treating him. From the moment he
                  violated his solemn pledge in the matter of the murdered Spanish officers, they
                  felt an utter want of confidence in him,—and that they did, is surely not to be
                  wondered at. However sincere they may have thought his hatred of the royal cause,
                  and of the Gachupins, who so fiercely upheld it; however faithful they may have
                  supposed him to be to the principles of republicanism,—in so far, at least, as
                  consisted with his own peculiar notions of fidelity to those principles,—whatever
                  they may have thought of this man, on these and other points, they never, after
                  that cold-blooded butchery, felt safe in trusting him,—and nothing but the
                  relentless necessity, which actually arose, could have induced them to do so.
               To review his course briefly,—now that we have given all the facts, and are about
                  to dismiss him from our notice as an officer,—in the first place, he may be
                  considered the nucleus around which the invading forces gathered on the Sabine.
                  During the nine succeeding months of an active campaign, he did literally nothing
                  for its advancement. Although accompanying the army throughout, he took no part in
                  the operations, except in the passive way of allowing himself to be used as a mere
                  lay-figure, not to be produced save in certain emergencies. Only one emergency
                  requiring his aid arose,—on the occasion, namely, of Magee's proposed surrender at
                  La Bahia, when, as we have seen, he was brought forth,—not, indeed, for the
                  purpose of deciding the question at issue, for the army had already done that with
                  unanimity, but with the view of securing, for the sake of its effect on the
                  Mexican element in Texas, his formal sanction to their already announced decision.
                  With this single exception, nothing whatever is known of him, although half a
                  dozen battles were fought during that time. Nor is his name so much as mentioned
                  elsewhere than as stated above, in any one of the many Texan histories,
                  narratives, reminiscences, or what not, that we have been able to get access to.
                  To be sure, after the brilliant victory on the Salado, which secured the surrender
                  of San Antonio and its garrison, he took up the sword which Salcedo had stuck in the ground before him: but
                  what of him during the battle? during any battle, in fact? Not a
                  single word.
               When he at last arrived among his own people, in the above-named town, his
                  cold-bloodedness seems to have been warmed up a little by the contact,—as though
                  he was fain to prove—now that the winter of Texan discontent had been made
                  glorious summer by these sons of Columbia—that he was not quite so torpid as he
                  had been during his hibernation. And like the genuine anaconda that he was, on the
                  first favorable opportunity presenting for a meal after his protracted abstinence,
                  he gorged himself, as we have seen, on fourteen Gachupins at one fell gulp—two of
                  them, Cordero and Herrera, being perhaps the very best native Spaniards in the
                  land; for they are universally represented to have been accomplished gentlemen,
                  fine scholars, brave soldiers, and withal, as possessing a humanity of disposition
                  rare, indeed, in a Spaniard of those days.
               Preparatory to the battle of the Alazan, just described, Bernardo was again
                  brought forth from the mist of shame in which he had shrouded himself, and was put
                  prominently forward, as a puppet, to tickle the inordinate vanity, and allay the
                  inordinate jealousy, of his countrymen.
               As late as July the 4th, we find him, by the records, issuing, at San Antonio, a
                  high-flown address, in which he says, after recapitulating the unbroken series of
                  triumphs achieved by the little army:
               
                  "For all this, I am indebted to the immortal sons of Columbia."
               It is probable that this was his last official act. Soon afterwards, accompanied
                  by his family, he found his way to the Neutral Ground. Fifteen years later, he was
                  living somewhere in Mexico, in unmolested obscurity, the independence of that
                  country having then been achieved. Some time during this long interval, he
                  published an elaborate pamphlet, having for its object the exculpation of himself
                  in the matter of the Salcedo tragedy. From this single fact, we may venture to
                  hope that remorse for that egregious piece of diabolism goaded him throughout the
                  remainder of his life.

                           We must, with all our main of power, stand fast.

                        It is a day turn'd strangely.
                     
                     —Cymbeline.
                     
                  
               
               
                  SCARCELY had the Americans discharged Bernardo, when, resolved to do
                  away with the disagreeable necessity for his further use, they dispatched an agent
                  to solicit the services of a man on whom they had already secretly fixed as his
                  successor.
               This man, Don Jose Alvarez Toledo, belonged to a distinguished Spanish family, and
                  was born in Cuba. At one time he resided in Mexico, where he had been a member of
                  the Spanish Cortes, then in existence there. Banished thence for his republican
                  sympathies, he had, for some time past, been living in Louisiana, where he was
                  engaged in forwarding to the patriot army what few recruits he could gather.
                  During the period last referred to he had been kept advised, from time to time, of
                  what was going on in Texas. On receiving the news of his appointment, he forthwith
                  set out for San Antonio, and reached that point soon after Bernardo's departure
                  for the Neutral Ground.
               The citizens, as well as the troops, in consideration of his distinction as an eminent republican Spaniard,
                  sallied forth to meet him and escort him in. He was received with an unusual
                  amount of display, and was at once chosen Commander-in-Chief of the "Republican
                  Army of the North."
               Toledo forthwith organized a junta for civil government, and set himself
                  assiduously about the re-establishment of law and order. Alcaldes and their
                  subordinate officials were appointed, and, for a brief season, law, other than
                  military, was supreme in San Antonio.
               Unfortunately, however, for the patriot cause, the new commander, despite his fair
                  fame and his soldierly qualities, was regarded with dislike and jealousy by the
                  Mexicans, who openly murmured that a Gachupin—that is, a native of Spain—was to
                  govern them, although he proposed to govern them in accordance with those very
                  principles of liberty which they themselves were so zealously maintaining. It
                  would seem that, either from gross stupidity or blind prejudice, they habitually
                  failed to recognize any difference between a Spaniard who was a true friend and a
                  Spaniard who was a mortal enemy. Accordingly, Manchaca—now that Bernardo had left
                  the country—found the majority of his fellow-citizens disposed to place themselves
                  under his auspices. The alienation of so large a portion of the
                  native population boded no good to the cause of independence.
               It was not long after Toledo had inaugurated his government, and set the political
                  machinery fairly to work, that the American scouts rode into town with the
                  startling announcement that a large Spanish army was approaching.
               The republicans promptly marched forth to meet the minions of despotism. It was
                  now nearly two months since the battle of the Alazan. The scattered remnants of
                  Elisondo's army had made their way, as fast as utter consternation could impel
                  them, to the interior of Mexico, where they of course lost no time in circulating
                  tidings of the disaster that had befallen the royal arms.
               General Arredondo commanded the north-eastern provinces of Mexico at this time. He
                  was a soldier of unquestioned ability, as well as unquestionable ferocity—one of
                  the generals who had borne a conspicuous part in the defeat of Hidalgo, and a no
                  less conspicuous part in the subsequent atrocious massacres. He was even charged
                  with having, at Altimea and Saltillo, put to death women and children; and, from
                  subsequent events, the truth of which does not rest on hearsay, it is probable the
                  charges were well founded.
               Joining his forces with such of Elisondo's as he could get in hand, he set out for
                  Texas, in company with that badly-beaten and much-chagrined leader, at the head of
                  four thousand men. Halting at a lake, about a mile west of the Medina river and
                  fifteen miles from San Antonio, he set about fortifying his position. He threw up
                  a breastwork in the road, in the form of the letter V, with the open end towards
                  San Antonio. This work he masked from view by setting up bushes like a natural
                  growth of chaparral.
               On receiving information of the approach of the republicans, one-half of his
                  command, with four pieces of artillery, was thrown forward as a decoy. The
                  Americans were commanded by Kemper, who—perhaps under the inspiration of Toledo's
                  leadership—had recently returned from the United States, whither, as before
                  stated, Bernardo's perfidious conduct had driven him, disgusted and indignant. The
                  Mexicans were commanded by Manchaca—the whole force being directed by Toledo, who
                  differed from his predecessor in that he was no mere puppet.
               Manchaca's insubordination, and his evident envy of the commander-in-chief, probably induced the latter to
                  commit the fatal blunder of placing the Mexicans in one body in the centre, thus
                  separating the Americans, who formed the wings. The principal officers of the
                  Texan army differed about the propriety of crossing the Medina. Toledo proposed to
                  feign a retreat, and thus lure the enemy over to the east bank. Kemper, with his
                  characteristic, fiery valor, opposed it, and at last carried his point. This noble
                  American had chafed sorely during his separation, for principle's sake, from his
                  struggling comrades; and now that he had joined them once more, he was
                  eager—perhaps too eager—to atone for his absence by closing at once with the foe.
                  Accordingly, the Texans, crossing the river, pressed forward, the enemy yielding
                  ground, though slowly and in good order. After retreating about a mile, a vigorous
                  onset broke them, and they fled, leaving their cannon behind.
               Toledo, fearing an ambuscade, besides thinking the ardor of the men was carrying
                  them too far from water, ordered them to fall back upon the river. From this order
                  arose at once discord, and consequently confusion. Kemper and Manchaca galloped
                  furiously along the lines, countermanding the orders of the commander-in-chief,
                  and swearing there should be no retreat.
               The Americans, of course, preferred obeying Kemper; and as Toledo was disliked by
                  the Mexicans, while, on the other hand, Manchaca was very popular with them, they
                  pushed on in total disregard of the former's order to fall back. During this
                  period of disorder in the Texan ranks, the Spaniards had rallied. The fighting now
                  recommenced, and the enemy, closely pressed, retired a second time, though still
                  fighting and without confusion, to their intrenchments. There the patriots were
                  suddenly exposed to a most destructive fire of cannon and musketry from
                  Arredondo's whole force, whose great superiority in numbers now became evident.
                  The Mexicans being terror-stricken by the first terrible volley, almost the whole
                  of them turned and fled,—appearing no more on the field.
               It was at this precise juncture that Toledo's blunder in arranging his order of
                  battle was made fearfully obvious; for this untimely flight of the entire Mexican
                  force would, most probably, not have been fatal had the Americans been kept in one
                  body. But forming, as they did, the right and left wings, they were subjected to
                  the incalculable disadvantage of being widely separated at that very crisis when
                  concentrated action alone could be depended on to retrieve the day. They, however,
                  did not flinch from the perils before them, but, rushing upon the breastworks,
                  fought with a desperation proportioned to their fearful environments.
               At this point in the struggle, the Spanish cavalry was broken, and Arredondo made
                  preparations to retire. When about commencing his retreat, however, Colonel
                  Musquiez, a traitor from the Mexican ranks, rode over to the royalists, with the
                  news—which was not quite true, though, of course, sufficiently so for such a
                  villain, when his infamous purposes were to be subserved thereby—that the
                  Americans were beaten: moreover, that they were fainting, from want of water, and
                  that it would be impossible for them to resist one more determined onset.
                  Thereupon Arredondo rallied his cavalry, and with these and some of his freshest
                  companies of infantry, rushed furiously on the Americans. Being by this time
                  terribly thinned, their allies having long since fled, their ammunition being
                  nearly spent, worn down by almost superhuman efforts, and still further enfeebled
                  by a scorching sun and a lack of water, they—being nothing more than mortals,
                  after all their display of heroism—began to give way. A merciless butchery now commenced, and most of the
                  few brave fellows who escaped from the field were slain in their long flight back
                  to the Neutral Ground.
               The Mexicans, who fled early, suffered comparatively little. The handful of
                  Coshatta Indians, however, stood by the Americans to the last, and shared their
                  heroic fate.
               The Spanish cavalry started immediately in pursuit, and scrupled not a moment to
                  butcher all who were so unfortunate as to be overtaken. At Spanish Bluff, on the
                  Trinity, they captured seventy or eighty of the fugitives, whom they marched to an
                  island of timber in the vicinity, where, with a touch of diabolism from which hell
                  itself—if indeed even hell would not recoil from it—might take an instructive
                  lesson in torture, they caused the victims to stand hard by and witness the
                  horrible preparations which for several hours were going forward for their
                  execution. They first dug a long, deep trench, which they bridged with a log. They
                  then tied the limbs of the doomed, set them, ten at a time, on the log, and shot
                  them,—making the little woods ring with their fiendish merriment as each batch of
                  dead and dying dropped, with a heavy thud, into the great yawning grave, below,
                  where they writhed, and groaned, and struggled a-top of the writhing, groaning,
                  struggling mass which had just preceded them.
               Among the few Americans who reached Natchitoches were Kemper, Perry, and
                  Taylor,—the last-named badly wounded.
               The victorious party pursued with vengeance every friend of republicanism in
                  Texas. The town of Trinidad, at Spanish Bluff, was utterly wasted. Such of its
                  inhabitants as did not escape were driven to a hill in the vicinity, called Loma
                  del Toro, or Bull's Hill, and massacred in cold blood.
               Two days after the battle of the Medina, General Arredondo dondo with his wagons
                  full of his own wounded and dying, made his triumphal march into San Antonio. Here
                  he forthwith seized and imprisoned seven hundred of the peaceable citizens. Three
                  hundred of these he confined in one house, and on the following morning nineteen
                  of them were found to have died during the night from suffocation. From day to
                  day, the remainder were led forth and shot without even the pretence of a trial.
                  This inhuman tyrant had also a prison for women. Here he kept in close confinement
                  five hundred of the wives, daughters, and other female relatives of the patriots.
                  On these the daily task was imposed of grinding between stones, with the hand,
                  twenty-four bushels of Indian corn, and converting the same into Mexican cakes,
                  called tortillas, for Arredondo's army.
               By the time this monster had thus, and otherwise, glutted his fiendish appetite
                  for blood and torture, his precious lieutenant, Elisondo, who had pursued the
                  fugitives to the Trinity, returned to San Antonio, driving before him, on foot,
                  the widows and orphans of those he had there slain.
               Of the few Americans who survived, such as had not already seen enough bloodshed,
                  finding their own country now deeply involved in a fierce struggle with Great
                  Britain, volunteered their services to aid in repelling the invader from their own
                  homes. This final withdrawal of their brave allies, by whom so many brilliant
                  successes had been achieved, and with the lesson of the late terrible retribution
                  before them, it may well be believed that the sparsely scattered citizens of Texas
                  were slow to stir up again the fires of revolutionary strife. For five consecutive
                  years an awful hush, like that we feel in the presence of the dead, or of the
                  ghosts of the dead, rested on that fair province—so blessed by heaven—so cursed by
                  tyrants.

                  WE will now turn to our fair friends at the lake. A whole year has
                  gone by since they were last named in this story—a year of wearing grief and
                  remorse to both. During the first portion of that period, they had roamed
                  nervously about by day, alone, much preferring solitude to each other's society,
                  each feeding on her own sad thoughts, as though these were the sole sustenance of
                  her mental life. At night, they slept but brokenly, and in the morning awoke at an
                  early hour, unrefreshed and haggard. They both, however, were blessed with most
                  excellent constitutions; and, as is the usual result under such physical
                  advantages, the present state of depression, instead of wearing these lone
                  mourners out, began itself to die away. This grew at length into a state of
                  patient endurance, during which, although they could tolerate for hours, without
                  any annoyance, each other's company, they sat in silent meditation, rarely
                  conversing, for they had as yet few thoughts in common—none indeed that would have
                  admitted of agreeable discussion. Understanding each other as they did, they could
                  not but know that any attempt at free communion would have been but mockery.
               This stage of their sorrow began, in its turn, to wear away, and they gradually
                  lapsed into their previous boon relations with each other. They began to converse,
                  not from necessity, as they had all along done at times, but purely for the
                  pleasure which conversation afforded them. They began to renew their rambles
                  together through the woods. They began to resort again to their favorite diversion
                  of rowing upon the lake. In short, they began to fall into all their olden habits.
                  With such healthful exercise and cheerful intercourse came, as a natural
                  consequence, better appetite, refreshing sleep, quiet nerves. In this improved
                  condition, they were enabled to endure, with comparative comfort, a year's
                  dreadful suspense, which, but for the boon of unusual physical vigor, might have
                  forced them to succumb long before.
               When the storm of a terrible grief first breaks upon us, we shrink, quail, tremble
                  before it; but if it does not deprive us of life outright, we come, by degrees, to
                  accommodate ourselves to the new atmosphere in which we believe we are destined to
                  live for the remainder of our days. We still see each flash and hear each bolt,
                  and if these seem not so keen nor so loud as once, it is only because we do not
                  look and listen for them so eagerly as we did. In fact, since we mark, only
                  through the reflex aid of memory, this storm which has long ago passed, but has
                  left its melancholy traces behind, we do not see and hear any more the thing
                  itself. We once looked aloft and saw the black cloud in substance lowering above
                  us: we now look down and see only the black shadow about our path. The vivid
                  lightnings once burned into our eyeballs,—now we see but a reflected glare; while,
                  instead of the startling crash, it is only the distant echo of the reverberating
                  thunder that we hear.
               Thus we become, in some sort, used to the tempest that overhangs our life. To be
                  sure, we are never without a consciousness that it is there—above us—around
                  us—and, indeed, within us—but it is only a vague consciousness—just as, at other
                  times, we feel, rather than see, that some revolting object from which we would but
                  cannot escape, is lurking near.
               From the first, Isabella had thought of writing fully and freely to her lover in
                  explanation of her conduct, should an opportunity present to send a letter. But
                  she was perfectly aware that Miguel, the only person whose services she could hope
                  to command, was too timid to venture while there was the least shadow of danger to
                  himself. This old man had not only a holy horror of the ferocity of the Gachupins,
                  but a most exalted opinion of their collected strength. Although a republican at
                  heart, he had no confidence whatever that the cause which he passively favored
                  would prevail. From the moment the little army crossed the Sabine, he began his
                  lugubrious predictions—sometimes to the Señorita when she would endure them, but
                  chiefly to his wife, in whom, holding, as she did, opinions in common with his own
                  on this point, he found a patient, nay, an eager listener—that they would soon
                  come back, such of them at least as survived, a beaten and bleeding fragment.
               Entertaining these morbid views, he turned a deaf ear to all Isabella's entreaties
                  to be the bearer of her letter to the Texan camp. Not only did she lavish on him
                  all her persuasive powers, but she threatened to discharge him unless he would do
                  her bidding in this matter. This, of course, did not move him, since he well knew
                  that, for the present at least, he was indispensable to her, and in no danger of
                  being so summarily disposed of. She then offered to reward him, when the war was
                  over, with a certain amount of gold, with no other effect, avaricious though he
                  was by nature, than to make him stretch his eyes in utter astonishment at the
                  liberality of the offer, which was far beyond anything he had before heard of in
                  the matter of letter-carrying, and set him to vainly wondering what could be the
                  theme of an epistle so momentous as to justify such a lavish expenditure.
               The truth is, after the army left the Trinity, it would have been no easy task for
                  a much bolder courier than Miguel would have proved, to reach them. For, thence
                  they marched directly, and at no laggard pace, for La Bahia, where they were
                  immediately shut in by Salcedo's army, and henceforth to the end of the siege, a
                  period of about four months, maintained by valor alone such intercourse with the
                  surrounding country as was dictated by dire necessity—their only alternative
                  being, as herein before explained, starvation. Even for weeks after San Antonio
                  had fallen into the hands of the patriots, no reliable news to that effect reached
                  Natchitoches. What one person would report on coming in, another would contradict
                  before the week had passed. In fact, the royalists had, in the very beginning, so
                  arranged matters that rumors adverse to the invading force should find their way
                  to Louisiana at brief intervals,—thus discouraging such American recruits as had
                  already gone thus far, from pushing on any further westward to assist their
                  countrymen. At one time the patriots had been utterly routed, and were flying in
                  every direction. At another, they had been captured and sent to Mexico, to be
                  thrown into dungeons, or to drudge in the dreadful mines. At another, they had
                  surrendered and had been sent to the United States. At still another, they had
                  been put to the sword—not one being left to tell the tale.
               The consequence was, no one could possibly know the exact state of things. The
                  most hopeful sometimes doubted whether the republicans had held their own, and
                  even if they had, thus far, whether discomfiture and disaster might not soon come
                  upon them. It is little to be wondered, therefore, that Isabella could not, by any
                  means she could use, prevail on a
                  chicken-hearted old Mexican to undertake her mission.
               Indeed, Miguel—as well from his natural bent, as from the apprehension that the
                  Señorita, on a favorable turn in the affairs of the republicans, would again urge
                  him to the mission he had so often declined—took precious good care to glean all
                  these ugly rumors whenever he was dispatched to town for news,—which, since the
                  campaign fairly opened, was nearly every day. Moreover, he colored, and enlarged,
                  and embellished them to suit himself, and that so artfully, that, with all the
                  acumen she displayed in examining, re-examining, and cross-examining him on his
                  return, she could seldom get out of him what he had really heard, much less could
                  she get the naked and undistorted facts themselves as they had been brought forth
                  during the throes of a revolution five hundred miles away.
               Soon after the Americans reached San Antonio, however, the prospects for learning
                  the true state of things began to brighten, until, at length, when Elisondo was so
                  disastrously driven out of Texas, there were no longer any Gachupin newsfactors
                  left to range betwixt San Antonio and Louisiana. Henceforth, for several weeks,
                  there was only one side to all the rumors, wild and exaggerated though they often
                  were. According to these, everything was going on smoothly for the patriots. It
                  was now that Isabella resolved to make one more effort to persuade, beg, inveigle,
                  or bribe, Miguel into the secret service which she had in view.
               "Miguel, what news?" she said to him, one day, when he returned from Natchitoches.
                  She spoke in Spanish, as, indeed, she always did in addressing him,—for he could
                  speak but little else, and not much of that, really, but a lingo, which, by a sort
                  of "loyal" courtesy, passes for it in Mexico, just as with us, in certain cases,
                  greenbacks pass for gold, though it is exceedingly difficult for anybody but a
                  bondholder to see the justice of the arrangement.
               "There isn't much, Señorita," he replied slowly, and looking a trifle downcast.
                  The shade of dejection arose not at all from his having no news, but
                  from his having, for once, nothing but good news. This was something which, in all
                  his running to town, had never happened to him before: he had always been able to
                  gather adverse tidings enough to serve as a foundation for a discouraging story.
                  But to-day, although he had lingered in the place much longer than usual, for the
                  express purpose,—ransacked every corner which promised anything of the kind he
                  sought, and pumped, without scruple, every citizen who understood Spanish, he
                  found not a single inauspicious item.
               But, to give the devil his due, this old fellow, although he hesitated not, when
                  it best suited his purpose, to distort most egregiously what he heard, would never
                  tell a downright lie, or invent a rumor out and out. Hence his dogged aversion to
                  opening his budget on the present occasion: he would not lie, and he had
                  absolutely nothing to build on.
               "What, no news at all?" exclaimed the Señorita. "Why, that, in itself, is news—and
                     good news. When you can come home from town and bring
                  nothing bad, but a bad countenance, it's a pretty sure sign there's a good time
                  coming. Miguel, do put off that miserable expression, and tell me what you
                  heard."
               "I did n't hear anything worth telling," he replied, this time mingling a dash of
                  sulkiness with his previous rueful look—a mongrel expression on a mongrel
                  countenance, not very gratifying to one's æsthetic sense.
               "Well, tell me what you did hear," she persisted, "and let me judge
                  for myself of its value. Is our native town still in the hands of the
                  patriots?"
               
               "Yes—but I'm sure I've been telling you that every day for a month."
               "And, Miguel, it's worth telling every day for a month longer,—more especially as,
                  every time you have told me of it heretofore, you have predicted that they would
                  not be suffered to hold it until the morrow."
               "Oh, yes—to be sure they still hold San Antonio; but—"
               "But what, now?"
               "Well, they just have n't got any further: that's all."
               "Did you ever hear that they expected or wished to get any further?"
               "No—Señorita; but I thought—"
               "You thought what?
               "Come now—let's have it: what do you think?" she went on, seeing that he was not
                  disposed to reply. "Tell me what you thought, Miguel."
               The Mexican still said nothing—so she once more went on:
               "You thought, I suppose, that three hundred Americans, and probably about twice as
                  many Mexicans, would have the madness to undertake to march to the city of
                  Mexico."
               "No—no—I did n't think that, Señorita," returned Miguel, looking a
                  little abashed.
               "Well, did you ever hear that they hoped or expected to do more than drive the
                  Gachupins out of Texas, and keep them out?"
               "No, Señorita."
               "Well, have n't they driven them out? and do they dare return?"
               "No, Señorita, they don't yet—but—"
               "Oh, Miguel, no more of your buts! that is, if this
                  'but' belongs to the same family with the last one, and I dare say it's a direct
                  descendant,—most likely a degenerate one, too."
               "Miguel," she said, after a pause, "you know as well as I do that the Gachupins
                  will never come back to Texas; and as the way is clear now, I want you to—"
               "I'm sorry I can't agree with you, Señorita," interrupted Miguel, well knowing
                  what was coming next, and resolved, if possible, to stave it off, as he had so
                  often done before: "I think they will come back."
               "Miguel," said she, stepping close to his side and whispering in his ear, as
                  though afraid the murmuring leaves above might repeat what she had to say, if
                  spoken aloud. "If you will take a letter to San Antonio, and bring me a written
                  answer, your reward for the service shall not be put off until the war is over, as
                  I before proposed,—nor shall it be the same paltry sum."
               "Pay me at once, Señorita, did you say? and—how much, Señorita?" he asked, in a
                  low tone, evidently surprised no little; for he had considered her previous offer
                  exceedingly liberal,—and if that was, in comparison but a "paltry" one, sure
                  enough, how much, in the holy virgin's name, he asked himself, could this other
                  one be?
               The inquiries which he had just made of the Señorita were, in themselves, a sign
                  that there was some hope at least of the old man's fears being overcome,—for never
                  before this moment could Isabella interest him enough to lead him even to inquire
                  how soon, or how much, he was to be paid in case of success, though she had more
                  than once thrust that information on him, nolens
                     volens, the proffered amount being increased each time. The danger of
                  the undertaking had at last, then, even in his distorted judgment, so diminished,
                  that avarice, of which he had no small share, was beginning to struggle in his
                  breast for the mastery over fear, and cool calculation had already returned to his
                     head and gone to casting up figures.
                  It was surely a cheering sign. And the lady resolved, now that this old iron was
                  hot at last, to strike down upon it instanter her one great blow which she had
                  reserved as the final resort;—that failing to shape the stubborn metal to her
                  will, all further effort in that direction to cease henceforth and forever as
                  utterly futile. The prize sought was worth the venture: to succeed, would probably
                  restore the happiness she had so strangely thrown away; to fail, would certainly
                  perpetuate her present misery.
               "Yes, Miguel," she replied; "I will pay you at once, and it shall be a thousand
                  dollars in gold.
               "Well may you look surprised, old man," she went on, as he stared at her with a
                  startled gaze, which arose, as she well knew, partly from the sudden idea, that he
                  could scarcely grasp, of his possessing so much treasure, and partly from
                  wondering how she expected to get such a sum in a place like this. "You did n't
                  dream of my having so much? Well, I brought it from San Antonio, belted around me.
                  Oh, you need not doubt it—it is here. It is hidden away—where, no one knows but
                  myself; but if you will do me this service, it shall be brought forth, and all be
                  yours—every dollar of it; and with it, you and Stefanita can be comfortable for
                  the rest of your lives."
               Isabella, in saying this, not only knew that, before setting out, he would have to
                  run the gauntlet of Stefanita's objections and fears,—as in fact he had to do in
                  well-nigh everything he undertook,—but that the old woman herself had a kindred
                  touch of avarice which might be thus wrought upon to advantage.
               It makes me stretch my eyes, Señorita, to think of having so much gold," said the
                  old man; "but, then, when I think of how much you will have when you get back to
                  San Antonio, it don't seem such a great deal after all."
               "Why Miguel, you surely don't mean to hint that I'm not offering you enough?"
               "Oh, no—no—Señorita: it's not for such as me to hint that, anyhow. It
                     is enough, and more than enough, if I can only do what you want
                  done; and, God knows, I'll try my best, if my old woman will only let me."
               Despite this positive disavowal, however, it is quite probable that Miguel did—and
                  it is perhaps an irresistible impulse with avarice to do so—just for the moment
                  hope he might be able to extort a little more from the lady, and that what he said
                  was really intended as a hint to effect such a purpose. But scarcely had the base
                  idea crossed his mind, when the thought of thus treating one who had always been
                  so kind to him, made his cheek tingle with shame. Hence his prompt disclaimer.
               Stefanita's decision proving favorable to the enterprise, Isabella wrote her
                  letter, and in a few hours after sundry very fussy movements in packing and
                  preparing, on the part of the old couple—Miguel set out with it for San
                  Antonio.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLIV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           There is no lady living
                           So meet for this errand.
                        
                     
                     
                        Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I beseech you,
                           If you know aught which does behoove my knowledge
                           Whereof to be inform'd, imprison it not
                           In ignorant concealment.
                        
                     
                     
                        Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           He tells her something
                           That makes her blood look out.
                        
                     
                     
                        Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  AFTER Miguel left the lake, Isabella and her companion did not, of
                  course, hear the news so often as they had heretofore done with his assistance. A
                  day or two after his departure, however, they began to feel the want even of such
                  wild and unsatisfactory rumors as they had every reason to suppose still made
                  their way daily into town; and before a week had passed thus, their longing to
                  hear something had increased to that degree, that Filly declared she would endure
                  such a state of suspense no longer, but would ride into Natchitoches herself, and
                  gather whatever tidings she could.
               "Things may be going on very important to us," she said, "and we, here, not
                  knowing a word about it."
               "Yes," replied Isabella, "a good many of our little army have been killed: that
                  much we know, but as yet few of the names of the unfortunate ones have reached us.
                  Some of our dearest friends may be among them—my dearest friends at
                  least: it's only the singular number with you, if you have no very dear friend
                  there except your father."
               The Señorita may have expected to learn, by this remark, whether or not Filly
                  really had a lover with the army, as she had long suspected. If so, she failed of
                  her object, for the girl chose to take no notice of the semi-query.
               "Go, Filly, by all means," she added, after a moment's pause, "and try to hear
                  something definite."
               The girl was not long about starting. On reaching the town, she went first to the
                  house of her old friend, Mrs. Davies, not only to make inquiries as to how and
                  where she might best possess herself of such rumors as were afloat, but also
                  because she really wished to see the old lady, whom she had not seen for nearly a
                  year, and whose former kindness she still remembered with gratitude.
               She met with a very warm reception; and after she had answered all the anxious
                  questions propounded with regard to herself, she began to unfold the object of her
                  visit to the town.
               "Mrs. Davies," said she, "the Señorita has a good many friends living in San
                  Antonio, and some in the Texan army, and I've come in to-day to try and find out
                  something about them. Where ought I to go, that I may hear?"
               "Why, honey, to General Bernardo, of course."
               "You don't say General Bernardo is in town?" said the girl, in great
                  astonishment.
               "Yes—he got in last night, with his family, direct from San Antonio."
               "How did he come to leave the army, Mrs. Davies?"
               "I don't exactly know, but I suppose, as the fighting's pretty much over—for a
                  while, anyhow—he wants to get some more help by the time the Gachuphins come
                  again—that's, if they ever do come. But whatever brought him, I'll
                  warrant you, he's got all the news, child. Everybody here that's got friends in
                  our army has been around to his quarters, to hear about them—or is going. I went
                  last night, to ask after Will,—that's my son. I saw a good many there, and a great
                  many have been going to-day."
               
               "I hope you heard good news of your son?"
               "Oh, yes—he's well enough, Will is. And what's more, the General says he's a
                  splendid fighter. He never got but one wound, though: and that was only a scratch
                  on his cheek from a musket-ball, at the Alazan. That's close enough, dear knows;
                  and I'm thankful it wan't worse. Just to think, an inch or so to one side would
                  ha' killed him!"
               Under ordinary circumstances, Filly would have taken a lively interest in hearing
                  about the man who had always been kind and courteous to her. But as it was, she
                  really heard little of what the old lady said—so little, indeed, that, had any
                  one, a moment afterwards, asked her for information about Mr. Davies, I doubt
                  whether she could have given a single accurate item concerning him,—except,
                  perhaps, that he was alive,—and even of this she had only a vague sort of
                  conception, gathered not from the words spoken, but from a general impression left
                  on her mind, that the old mother's manner was of quite a cheerful cast, and for
                  that reason wholly inconsistent with such grief as she must have felt had she lost
                  her only son.
               She had not heard what was said, because she had been wholly absorbed in thinking,
                  that, if she could only summon up courage to venture into the presence of General
                  Bernardo—whom she fancied, for no better reason than that he was a general, a
                  being of awful presence—how soon she might hear something reliable about the man
                  whom she loved a thousand times more than all the world besides, despite the cruel
                  treatment she had received at his hands.
               "But be it ever so hard to do," thought she, "I'm determined to go through with
                  it."
               "Where's the General to be found, Mrs. Davies?" she inquired, starting suddenly up
                  from her seat.
               Fortunately, she chanced—for it was by the merest accident—to do this just as the
                  old lady had got through with her flight of what the General had said in praise of
                  her dear Will, and had made a decided pause, though no doubt intending to begin
                  anew just so soon as she could think of something else which the
                  commander-in-chief had said about him. Filly's breaking her off did not,
                  therefore, seem rude; and, so, by sheer good luck, her tender-hearted old friend's
                  feelings were not hurt, nor was her previous good will in the least forfeited.
               Having received such directions as would enable her to find the General, she took
                  a fond leave of Mrs. Davies and started forth. She found him alone; and so
                  courteous and affable was he,—instead of grand and august, as she had
                  expected,—that she soon forgot the painful embarrassment caused by the mere
                  anticipation of the interview; and, with a little adroit assistance from him, she
                  had no difficulty in entering at once into conversation about the business which
                  had brought her there, and which she was all the more anxious to dispatch
                  speedily, for fear of interruption by visitors, who, Mrs. Davies had said, were
                  numerous.
               "You have friends in the army?" he said, in an interrogatory tone, as soon as he
                  saw that she was an entire stranger, at the same time rising from his chair and
                  coming forward to meet her. These words were spoken almost immediately on her
                  entrance, and evidently with the express intention of relieving the signs of
                  confusion which she had brought into the room on her face.
               "Yes, sir."
               "I am always happy," he went on, "when I can give news of the brave Americans who
                  have done so much for our freedom. Please be seated, and tell me who your friends
                  are."
               
               By this time, Filly felt quite at ease; and, after declining the seat proffered
                  her, said:
               "General, do you know anything of Mr. Gatley?"
               "Ah, my dear child, if he is a friend of yours, he is indeed one to
                  be proud of. To be sure, he is only a private, but that only makes his conduct the
                  nobler. A private, as you may know, has little chance of prominent distinction;
                  but there is no officer in that whole army of better fame than Private John
                  Gatley. And why he is not an officer, is a mystery to us all. He has been offered
                  a commission after every battle we have had, and still he prefers to be in the
                  ranks. But now that the war is over, so far as Texas is concerned, I hope he may
                  be induced to accept some high civil office, for which his extraordinary talents
                  so well fit him."
               King's (alias Gatley's) reasons for so persistently refusing a captaincy several
                  times offered him, arose from a desire to remain, of all things, unknown to
                  Gatewood. While, as a comparatively obscure private, he might manage to conceal
                  from him his identity, his acceptance of a commission would necessarily lead, at
                  times, to official and even personal intercourse with the man whom he once highly
                  esteemed, but with whom he now felt he could never endure the agony of meeting—and
                  not this only, but being recognized and claimed as an old friend, and made much
                  of.
               As well as the gentleman now under discussion stood in her esteem, Filly had
                  already had a surfeit of the subject. Could she have been assured that no one
                  would intrude, she could have endured a good deal more of Mr. Gatley for the
                  Señorita's sake,—but having no assurance of this, she soon became sorely troubled
                  lest she should at last lose her chance to speak of one incalculably nearer and
                  dearer to her throbbing heart. In fact, although she had laid away in her memory
                  every word which the General had said thus far, it was only by dint of great
                  effort and in accordance with a pre-determined process of mechanical absorption
                  and retention, to be carried out at all hazards, and a consciousness that to do
                  otherwise would be treating the Señorita shabbily.
               "That's enough of him!" she thought. "I wish he would say something
                  about Señor, without my asking him; but I don't suppose he will."
               At this point, the girl heard—or rather imagined she heard—some one coming, and
                  resolved to delay the important matter no longer. So she spoke at once.
               "Is Captain—Captain Gatewood—well, General?" she asked.
               "Yes—the Captain is well now. Is he a friend of yours?" said
                  Bernardo, regarding her with a sudden change of expression, which, although she
                  did not fully understand it, made her shrink back from him into herself.
               "He's a mean old thing, after all his oily ways!" thought the girl,—"for he don't
                  like Señor."
               For policy's sake, however, she tried to overcome the feeling, and returned to the
                  charge.
               "You say he's well now, General: has he been sick?"
               "No—not sick—but he was very badly wounded at the Alazan."
               The girl grew deadly pale in an instant, to think how dreadful it would have been
                  had he been killed: dead, and buried in the cold earth, two months ago! Bernardo
                  observed her agitation, but with great tact, appeared not to do so, and went
                  on.
               "But it's no wonder Gatewood was wounded: the only wonder is that he has not been
                  killed long ago; for I don't think I ever saw a more reckless man in battle. His
                  men are brave enough for all purposes—even including the forlorn hope—should that be required—but he
                     rushes ahead even of them."
               Now, although Bernardo recounted these exploits of Gatewood and Gatley as
                  something which he himself had seen, the fact is, as long since explained, he was
                  never near enough to a battle-field to see even in a general way, what was going
                  on,—much less could he observe individual acts of bravery. Nevertheless, what he
                  said, he knew to be true, for it was the common talk among those who
                     had seen.
               "Oh, Captain Gatewood," he continued, as if to re-assure the girl, "is a splendid
                  soldier. I don't see how we could have got along at all without the Captain."
               This laudation of course set up Bernardo again in the impulsive and infatuated
                  girl's estimation; for if there is any one virtue which a romantic woman delights
                  to hear, above all others, harped upon in the man she adores, it is bravery,—and
                  there is none which chills her so effectually toward him as poltroonery.
               "He's a dear man," thought she; and was wondering what he could have meant by that
                  strange expression on his face, which had so repelled her for a time, when some
                  one knocked at the door. On hearing this, as a closing interrogatory, she inquired
                  after Isabella's brother and uncle; and being told all was going well with them,
                  after thanking the General, she took leave and withdrew.
               The expression which had so puzzled her in Bernardo's face on her asking after
                  Gatewood, was, at first, one of searching inquiry. Conviction took the place of
                  this, which, in its turn, was succeeded by commiseration. One less unsophisticated
                  than Filly in the ways of the world, and more skilled in reading the human face,
                  would have had little difficulty in rendering this plain physiognomical tablet
                  into thought.
               "Can this be a sister of Gatewood's?" he had asked himself; and the almost
                  immediate answer was, "No—they are in nothing alike; and as for a wife, or an
                  intended wife, such a man could surely have no use for one. Alas! she must be his
                  victim."
               And so she was—though not exactly in the sense in which he meant it.
               "All may be well, yet, for both the Señorita and me," thought Filly, as she rode
                  back to the lake. "The war's over, the General says,—and he surely ought to know.
                  Señor is alive, and so is Mr. John, and if the Señorita's letter only reaches him,
                  it will bring him straight back to her. Then he'll marry her, and take her away to
                  his home in the United States. And, so, when Señor comes, he'll find nobody to
                  fight with—and nobody to marry but poor me."
               And as these happy thoughts took the place of the sad ones which had so long
                  possessed her, tears of joy rolled down those cheeks, over which, for a long,
                  wretched year, only tears of sorrow had found their way.
               When she had nearly reached home, she started from a deep reverie over her
                  anticipated happiness, and exclaimed:
               "There now! I forgot to inquire after Mr. Whishton. That is too bad!
                  The Señorita will ask me, the first thing, how my father is—whether he's living or
                  not. I 'm so sorry I ever told her that lie, when I first saw her. But, then, I
                  could n't well help it. Well, let it go, now: all 's well that ends
                  well, they say, and everything will soon be right with both of us. It's lucky for
                  me, though, that I happened to find this out; for, if she had asked me what the
                  General said about my father, I should hardly have known, at first, what she
                  meant, or who she meant; and I know I
                  should have blundered so in answering her, that she would have suspected me of
                  deceiving her before, and perhaps would even have found out all about the matter,
                  and what a big lie I told her. But if she asks me now, I can be ready with an
                  answer."
               The Señorita was very well satisfied with what news Filly had to tell her; for
                  meagre though it was, it proved to be quite as much and of as good quality as she
                  had any right to expect. All that the girl chose to unfold of her budget, revealed
                  simply the facts, that the war was over, that her so-called father, and the
                  Señorita's brother and uncle were well, and that Mr. King was still unscathed,
                  stood high, and persistently refused all honors, which, otherwise, would have been
                  heaped upon him.
               There was one thing too evidently shown during this conversation to escape Filly's
                  notice, ever alert as she was on this one theme: Isabella had not so much as
                  hinted that she would like to know how Gatewood was, or even whether he was alive
                  or not. This, she thought, proved, beyond all doubt, what had, all along, been a
                  mooted point with her—that King was her first choice, and that the other was held
                  as a mere reserve, in case of accident. This she considered to be exceedingly bad
                  taste on the Señorita's part, but exceedingly good fortune for herself.
               As Filly was much fatigued by her long ride, the two went to bed early that night.
                  Their sleep was the most pleasant they had had for many a long month, in that it
                  was deep enough to refresh, and yet richly interspersed with visions of happy
                  meetings, smooth reconciliations, atoning words of sweetness, endearing caresses,
                  blessed altars.
               The first sorrow that came to mar this heaven of their long-tortured breasts, was
                  caused by Stefanita's hoarse voice at the door, announcing breakfast. It pained
                  both no little to emerge from that fancy-land of elysian delights, into real life,
                  although the day seemed to dawn upon them with hopes of a joyous future.
               Alas! it only "seemed" so to dawn—that bright, beautiful,
                  cloudless—treacherous day!
               And that dream, (for their two dreams were so much alike they were as one,) so
                  passing lovely, one might almost hope to enter directly the pearly gate on its
                  wing, the guarding seraphim thinking the plumage celestial and letting one pass in
                  unchallenged: what of that? Treacherous, too!

                  JUST before midnight, the two sleepers were roused by a thunderous
                  knock at the window of their room, accompanied by a loud calling of their names,
                  and other vociferations in Spanish. The voice, as they started up, they recognized
                  as Miguel's,—and immediately knew that, coming in the very unnatural guise that it
                  did, it could bode them no good.
               Isabella leaped from the bed, and hastily throwing over her night-dress her
                  mantilla, ran to the window and hoisted it.
               "What, in heaven's name, brought you back with all this clamor, Miguel?" she demanded, with what
                  calmness of voice and manner she could summon.
               "Oh, Señorita!"
               This was all the man could say, partly from terror, as of something that might be
                  coming up behind—for he looked nervously back as he uttered the exclamation—and
                  partly from the sheer exhaustion of bawling so loud.
               "Do tell me what is the matter, as soon as you can get your heart out of your
                  throat," cried Isabella, indignant at so much craven-heartedness in a man,—for she
                  could see, by aid of the moon, that the eyes confronting her were stretched to
                  double their ordinary size, from fright, and the rest of the countenance
                  proportionately disfigured from the same cause.
               "Oh, Señorita!" was, a second time, his only reply—if reply it could be
                  called.
               At this juncture, a real man, who had been standing close to the house and far
                  enough aside from the window to be heretofore hidden from Isabella's view, stepped
                  forward. It was plain he had lately been in some terrible conflict; for his
                  clothes were in tatters, his hat was gone, and a very bloody bandage was bound
                  about his head.
               "I suppose, Señorita," he said, in clear, calm tones, "he wishes to tell you the
                  patriot army has been terribly beaten and all is lost; for such is the fact."
               "Si, Señor, y Señorita! si! si!" hissed out the old Mexican, in his native
                  tongue.
               Here, Stefanita, who had heard the clamor from her bed, made her appearance on the
                  scene; whereupon Miguel fell into her arms, and they at once rushed off together,
                  screaming, weeping, and well-nigh frightened to death. This deafening and
                  disgusting nuisance quite out of the way, Isabella was on the point of availing
                  herself of the opportunity to gather some particulars from the self-possessed man
                  before her.
               "Why, it's Mr. Davies!" exclaimed Filly, who had, all along, been standing inside,
                  some distance from the window; but on hearing the voice, and thinking it Davies's,
                  had come up to the Señorita's side, and was now peering out of the window, at his
                  face, to make quite sure there was no mistake.
               "Yes, Filly, it's Davies," the man replied; and his voice, as he said these few
                  words, fell so low, and became so sadly compassionate in its tone, that the girl
                  was convinced, from this alone, that there was awful news for her. For Davies must
                  long ago have guessed what relation she and Gatewood once occupied towards one
                  another,—and she supposed he sought to break the news to her now as softly as
                  possible, because it was bad news.
               On such occasions, it is not often that we can summon up courage at first to put
                  directly the question that is nearest our hearts,—any more than can the messenger
                  himself of the awful tidings bear to pour it all abruptly into our ears in one
                  black and crushing sentence. Hence the circumlocution now adopted by all
                  concerned. Filly, for her part, shrank from asking anything at all.
               "When you tell us all is lost, Mr. Davies," said Isabella, "do you mean there was
                  great slaughter in our army?"
               "Yes, Señorita. We had a battle on the Medina, and although a great many of the
                  Mexicans who were of our army escaped, it was by running away early in the fight.
                  On this account, the Americans had to bear the brunt of the struggle, and were
                  nearly all killed, or so badly wounded that they could not get away."
               "I suppose the wounded who could not get away were made prisoners."
               Isabella said this—but she "supposed" no such thing; for, knowing the Gachupins as
                  thoroughly as she did, it was
                  impossible to do more than hope so, and scarcely so much as even
                  that. Therefore, although terribly shocked at the reply, it can scarcely be said
                  she was surprised.
               "No, Señorita—they were butchered where they fell—every one of them, I
                  believe."
               "God help us, Filly!" she exclaimed, as she fell, weeping on the girl's
                  neck,—thinking, as she did so, not only of her lover, but likewise of her
                  companion's father—having yet to learn that that father was but a myth, while a
                  far dearer than any father, though far less kind, was most probably gone from the
                  poor girl forever.
               The brave man outside, despite the hardening life he had led, was by no means
                  callous to suffering, particularly when endured by the gentler sex; and as the
                  mingled wailing of these two heart-broken women pierced his ear, it thrilled him
                  to the minutest fibre. Each wild sob smote against his manly heart like a
                  ponderous blow; and the glitter of tears might have been seen at that moment in
                  the moonlight, as they coursed down his weather-beaten cheek.
               Such an outburst could not endure long: it must needs, from very exhaustion, give
                  place to a calmer mood. Soon the women unlocked their embrace and gradually
                  released their hold on each other, when the younger sank down at once upon the
                  floor and lay there prostrate. Isabella threw herself on her knees by the window,
                  and folding her arms on the sill, bowed her face down upon them. In this position
                  she remained for several minutes, in silence, probably offering up a
                  prayer,—though God only can know what she prayed in her secret heart at that hour
                  of utter inward desolation. Let us hope that her petition was granted.
               At length she raised her bowed head and looked out, as if to ascertain whether the
                  soldier was still before her. He was there; having lingered on the spot because he
                  knew that when the first flood of grief had spent itself, the details of the
                  melancholy tidings would be sought by those so deeply concerned. So there she
                  found him, his arms folded across his broad breast, his eyes cast sadly on the
                  ground,—evidently unwilling to obtrude the stubborn, remorseless facts just as
                  they were, yet ready to tell all that should be asked of him.
               Seeing that he was still there, she said, with a choking voice:
               "Will you tell me, sir, whether you know Mr. Gatley of our army?"
               Instantly, on asking this question, and before he could reply, she bowed her head
                  down again on the sill. She felt that the words of the man would be as much as she
                  could bear, without watching the expression of his face as he gave his answer. She
                  could not endure that both eye and ear should be so cruelly mangled at once,—well
                  knowing that through one of these avenues the dreadful tidings, if
                  come they must, would reach soon enough, and keenly enough, the sore, shrinking,
                  sensitive heart below.
               Davies, for his part, was very much surprised that she should inquire for Gatley,
                  rather than for her brother, or Gatewood, to whom it had been pretty well
                  understood in Camp Wildwood that she was betrothed. He, however, hurriedly
                  conjectured, since there was no other conjecture left him, that Gatley was her
                  real lover.
               "Yes, Señorita—I knew him very well, indeed," he replied, in a soft, low tone,
                  which sounded to her like the moaning of a gentle wind around a grave.
               "You knew him—but you do not know him. That is
                  enough—that tells the tale—tells me all!"
               There was silence for some moments, during which the lady still did not raise her
                  head.
               "He is dead then?" she said, at length. "Why not say so? Dead! You are afraid of
                  the dreadful word. Speak, sir: is he dead?"
               
               "Yes—he is dead, Señorita."
               She did not scream at the "dreadful word," nor sob, nor even stir; and yet she had
                  not swooned. She only remained still and silent for at little while, thinking and
                  inwardly praying by turns.
               "And my brother?"
               He was killed in the battle."
               There was a brief pause.
               "And my uncle?"
               "The Padre is in the enemy's hands."
               "God save him! with such monsters,—that is worse than death."
               Filly had of course heard this conversation, but she had heard it in silence. She
                  cared not to ask any questions. In fact, she could scarcely have brought herself
                  to do so. She felt that if there had been any good news for her,— anything about
                  Gatewood exceptional to all this widespread hopeless gloom,—Davies would long ago
                  have been eager to tell her of it: but he had not even so much as hinted of such a
                  thing. Feeling quite sure therefore that "Señor" was at last beyond her love
                  forever, she cared but little what had betided others, or what might yet betide
                  herself during the remainder of her blasted life.
               Isabella, however, seemed a trifle more hopeful than this. On further thought, she
                  began to catch desperately at any little straw that floated past her on this tide
                  of blood. As we are fain to do at all times, but particularly when our life-long
                  prospects of happiness are menaced, she began to feel that she would rather know
                  the exact state of the case in all its details, agonizing though they might be,
                  and then judge for herself whether or not there was the shadow of a hope left.
               "Mr. Davies," she said, with this view, in faint, tremulous tones, still keeping
                  her head bowed down, "were the friends we have inquired after killed in the
                  battle, or during the pursuit? I should be glad if you would tell me more fully
                  about it."
               Davies, assured by this open appeal for facts, and feeling that it at least
                  cleared him of the responsibility of torturing his hearers by telling them the
                  horrible naked truth, did not hesitate to comply.
               "After nearly all our band," he began, ("I mean Captain Gatewood's band,) were
                  down, either dead or mortally wounded, the Captain and Wynne and me found
                  ourselves surrounded by about twenty of the enemy."
               At this point, Filly leaped up from the floor, and coming forward to the window,
                  kneeled beside Isabella; and the soldier—though not the lady—easily guessed which
                  of the words he had spoken was the talisman that drew her thither.
               "The battle had already been lost; and the very few that were not down with wounds
                  were in full flight, pursued by the enemy. We three were hemmed in on every side,
                  and could n't have got away if we had tried; so, we stood, back to back, and
                  fought our best. We killed a great many of the Gachupins,—but it was soon all over
                  with us, for Wynne fell, shot through the head; then they rushed up closer on the
                  Captain and me. He fell next— and then I was struck to the ground by a blow on the
                  back of the head. I don't know how long I laid there senseless,—but it was night
                  when I came to. The enemy's camp was so near, I could hear the call of the guard;
                  and as it was moonlight, I had to be cautious in my attempts to get away. I crept
                  off as quietly as I could. The dead of both sides were scattered around in every
                  direction. There were no wounded now: the enemy had carried theirs off—and
                  butchered ours, and packs of wolves were howling and prowling about, feeding on
                  them. As I crept along among the
                  bodies, I saw many of my old comrades in arms. Some were lying on their faces: I
                  did n't recognize these, for I was thinking too much then about getting away, to
                  stop and turn them over: I had only time to give a glance as I slipped along. I
                  shall never forget how John Gatley looked. He was lying on his back, with the moon
                  shining down directly in his face. He was thought the finest-looking man in our
                  army; but I never saw him look handsomer than he did then, and I could not help
                  stopping to look at him; it was the only time I stopped. He looked so natural that
                  I stooped down to feel if he was not still warm—but he was cold enough. I raised
                  his head a moment from the ground, to take a last look at the finest sample of a
                  man I had ever seen—or ever expect to see. There was a little round bullet-hole
                  right in the centre of his forehead. A red streak ran down from it to his long
                  hair and soaked it through and through with clotted blood.
               "I did n't see Captain Delgado after the fight begun; but one of our men that got
                  away told me he saw his dead body near the enemy's intrenchments. I heard the
                  Padre was arrested in San Antonio: a citizen that joined us in our flight said he
                  saw them taking him to the prison."
               Surely all this was bad enough. But Isabella's cup was not yet full.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           O pardon me!
                           I'll pardon thee: I will shed tears for thee:
                           I'll wish to die with thee.
                        
                     
                     HEYWOOD.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           About the wood, go swifter than the wind,
                           And Helena of Athens look thou find.
                        
                     
                     
                        Midsummer Night's Dream.
                     
                  
               
               
                  AND this poor girl's father—what of him?"
               The Señorita receiving no answer to this inquiry, raised her head again to
                  ascertain why there was no reply. She saw the soldier lying on the ground, just
                  where he had been standing but a few moments before. He was so nearly worn out by
                  the terrible hardships incident to such a protracted and sleepless flight, that as
                  soon as he thought his mission was over, he sank down there in his tracks, and
                  almost immediately fell into a profound sleep.
               "Oh, Filly!" said the Señorita, turning to the girl, "how could you let him stand
                  here so long, and not ask a word about your dear father?"
               Filly had often thought lately of making a clean breast of that matter by telling
                  her friend, whom she had so long deceived, all about it: so she resolved that now
                  was the time to do so. And this was the beginning of the end.
               "Indeed, Señorita, Whishton was not my father, nor any relation of mine. I barely
                  knew him well enough to speak if I happened to meet him."
               "Why, what do you mean?"
               "I deceived you, Señorita, long ago; and I've often been so ashamed of it, that,
                  more than once, I've been on the point of telling you just how it was, and why it
                  was."
               When Filly first said this, the other shrank a little from her side; but thinking instantly how very deceitful
                  she herself had been, and with what disastrous result, this led her on to think
                  how paltry an exercise of charity it would be to forgive the same in this poor,
                  friendless, untutored girl. So, curbing at once the rising indignation, she
                  replied, mildly enough:
               "Well, my dear, tell me now."
               "Yes," said Filly, "it will ease my conscience somewhat, late as it is; and so I
                  will tell you. I had no father in the Texan army, or anywhere else that I know of.
                  For anything I can tell, my father may have died before I was born."
               "Then why did you tell me he was still living?"
               "Why, you remember, Señorita, the very first time I saw you, I told you I had been
                  living in the camp."
               "Well, was not that true?" asked the lady.
               "Yes—that much was true. But I had reasons for not letting you know exactly how I
                  lived there; and so I told you I was Whishton's daughter, for fear you might think
                  me something worse—that I had been kept by some of the men, like too many of the
                  women in Camp Wildwood,—and that I was no fit company for you."
               "And have you still those reasons for not telling me how you lived in the
                  camp?"
               Filly, when she began, did not intend going any further than this; and even now,
                  after her friend had propounded her question, she was on the point of ending the
                  subject by replying simply:
               "Yes, I still have those reasons; but I will say, my life there was honest and
                  honorable."
               But she now, rather suddenly, came to the conclusion that she could be better
                  contented for the rest of her days—that it would relieve a little of the remorse
                  which helped so materially to swell her misery—if she should confess to the
                  Señorita the fatal blunder she had made in placing Gatewood's letter in his
                  rival's hands: and in order to extenuate the act she must of course tell her of
                  her own relations with that Chief. All which she now resolved to do.
               As may well be imagined, Isabella, up to this point, had taken little heart-felt
                  interest in the conversation. She had in fact kept it up, so far as she was
                  concerned, only by considerable effort, and merely because she thought the girl
                  seemed, for some reason unknown to her, very much interested herself. During the
                  whole time of its progress her own thoughts were flying off to other things, and
                  were brought back to the subject only by force. But henceforth to the end it was
                  not so.
               The girl having made up her mind to a full confession, instead of the affirmative
                  reply which she had at first intended making, began with a negative:
               "No," she said—"those reasons no longer exist, especially as my life there was a
                  virtuous one; and I think I shall feel better if I tell you all about it—and other
                  things besides. I lived with Captain Gatewood in the camp; but when—"
               Isabella looked around at her with surprise.
               You mean that you—why, Filly, you just now told me your life while in camp was a
                  virtuous one."
               "And so it was, Señorita: only hear me. Captain Gatewood rescued me from the
                  Indians when I was a little thing. I have always thanked him more for it than if
                  he had saved my life; for no one can imagine the misery that he saved me
                  from."
               "Oh, yes—I understand it now: he adopted you, as his child—being childless
                  himself—and you have ever since regarded him as you would your father, had you
                  ever known your father."
               "No—not exactly that either, Señorita: I'll tell you about that and all the rest presently. When he
                  rescued me, I could speak no language but such a jargon as the savages spoke.
                  Señor—as I always called him—not only taught me his native language, but how to
                  read and write; and, now I look back at it, it must have given him a great deal of
                  trouble, considering his habits and the kind of life he was leading all the time.
                  But when he found I was anxious to learn and tried my best to do so, he always
                  seemed glad to teach me, and never once got out of patience with me. But, then,
                  Señorita, he was always kind and gentle with me—and never spoke a
                  harsh word all the time."
               Here the girl, as she thought of those bright, fresh, happy, hopeful days, and
                  then thought of the mangled, lifeless form that lay unburied and rotting, or torn
                  by wolves, on the far-off banks of the Medina, broke down in her story, and had to
                  stop for a while. But after wiping away the tears that fell fast over her burning
                  cheeks, and bracing herself for the task, she was able to resume.
               "He had a separate tent pitched for me near his own, and another, alongside of
                  mine, for Mrs. Davies—the wife of that poor soldier there—who waited on me and
                  always attended to me faithfully and kindly. Then, when I grew to be a woman, he
                  had this house built and furnished for me to live in."
               "For you to live in, here by yourself?" interrupted Isabella. "Or were you to
                  marry one of his men?" she added, as she recollected the blush that once came to
                  the girl's cheek when speaking of "one of the men."
               "Oh, no—Señorita: I was to marry him."
               "It is n't possible that you were to be married to Captain Gatewood?"
               "Yes, Señorita: we were to be married, and come to live here, the very day after
                  he rescued you from those Spaniards."
               "And you loved him?"
               "I had loved him for a long time—young as I was. And how much I loved
                  him, Señorita, no one can tell!"
               "Oh, you poor dear child! why did you not tell me this long ago?"
               "Why should I tell you, Señorita?"
               "Because— But I forgot that you did not know—"
               "I know a great deal more about it than you think, Señorita," said the girl, on
                  perceiving her friend's hesitation. "But still I may not know all."
               "What do you know, Filly?"
               "I know that you and Señor were engaged to be married."
               "And, pray, how did you find that out?"
               "I heard the rumor, and I came here on purpose to learn the truth of it."
               "And how did you find out the truth at last?"
               "I saw a letter he wrote to you."
               "You saw a letter that Captain—? You mean, you saw the address on the
                  outside?"
               "No, Señorita. Oh! if you but knew the misery of my suspense—not knowing whether
                  all hope was gone—you would pardon me, I know, for what I did then."
               "Oh, yes—Filly; I have been too wicked myself not to forgive everything you may
                  have done."
               "I found the letter lying open on the floor," said the girl, "the very day you met
                  with Mr. John. I saw that it was in Señor's writing; and I almost knew, if I read
                  it, I'd find out at once what I had been trying to learn for so long."
               "And, so, you read it. Well, that was not altogether right, to be sure; but I
                  don't blame you half as much for it, as I do for not telling me, when you first
                  came here, of your relations with Captain Gatewood. Oh, Filly! if you had only told me then that
                  he was your betrothed, and that this was your house, all this wretchedness might
                  have been spared us both."
               "But," said the girl, "Señor was gone then, and it could have done no good—it
                  would have been too late."
               "Yes, it would have done good: it would not have been too late. For had I known
                     that, I should have married the only man I ever loved, instead of
                  putting him off, so that he never came back—and now, alas! never can
                  come back."
               Ah, how fondly prone are we to talk of what might have been!
               "And, why did you hesitate about marrying him, Señorita, even as it was?"
               "Filly, it is much too long and sad a story for me to tell you all of it. But I
                  will say this much: that I engaged myself to Captain Gatewood, not because I loved
                  him—for I never loved him—but because I thought him indispensable to our cause,
                  and this was the only way I could win him to espouse it. I promised to marry him,
                  should we prove successful, but not otherwise. I then thought my lover had long
                  been dead; but I met him at last, and you must see in what a dilemma that placed
                  me. Had I married Carlos and gone with him to Nacogdoches, as he wished me to do,
                  Captain Gatewood must have heard of it, and would have withdrawn from the army
                  with his whole command."
               "Suppose I had told you, Señorita, what would you have done
                  then?"
               "Why, Filly, I should immediately have dispatched Captain Gatewood a note—for he
                  was not then beyond my reach—telling him, that by his treatment of you he had
                  forfeited every right to my hand,—and, but that he had placed my family and myself
                  under such deep obligations tions to him by our rescue, he would likewise have
                  forfeited my acquaintance, and—but for that, too—I should have hoped never to see
                  him again."
               "Would you, indeed, have done so, Señorita?"
               "I should, despite the risk of its estranging from the cause himself and every man
                  of his command: nay, had I been certain it would have provoked him even to take up
                  arms on the other side. Of course I should. Why, justice to you, Filly, no less
                  than respect for myself, would have demanded that I should do so,—and nothing on
                  earth could have prevented me."
               Nothing more was said for several minutes, and each went off into a painful
                  reverie: (alas! must not all their reveries be painful henceforth?) The burden of
                  Filly's was, "Then, all would have been right. How I wish I had told her!" The
                  burden of the Señorita's was, "Oh, if Carlos had only returned to hear my
                  explanation, this could never have been!"
               But the girl had not yet told the worst. And had she foreseen the effect of the
                  telling, this last mortal arrow had never been sped. Now, however, that she had
                  commenced unbosoming herself to her friend, she resolved to go on to the end and
                  leave nothing hid. After deceiving her so long and so grossly, it was but right,
                  she thought, that she should wholly undeceive her ere the subject should be
                  dismissed, perchance forever.
               She began by asking a question.
               "Señorita, if Mr. John had come back to see you that evening, would you have
                  agreed to marry him?"
               "Yes—I had fully made up my mind to do so, if he still thought it best, as he did
                  at our meeting. Oh, yes—there is no doubt our marriage would have taken
                     place—here, if we could have secured a priest's services—if not,
                  then, at Nacogdoches."
               
               "But Señor would have heard of it; and that, you say, would have broken up the
                  expedition."
               "So it would. But, my dear child, think how much better it would have been for all
                  in the end. Though I should have lost my home and my country, I should have had my
                  lover, his home, and his country. But, alas! I have now no country, no home, no
                  lover! Yours, too, would probably have returned to make you happy. So you see,
                  whatever it was which prevented Carlos from filling his tryst, it has made a round
                  of ruin for us all. Oh, if he had but returned for a single moment, even to fling
                  scorn in my face, on my knees I would have pleaded for his forgiveness,—and I
                  doubt not he would have granted it. But as this cannot be—can never be—it seems
                  now, that if I could only know what that mysterious something was which kept him
                  away, after parting so tenderly, and vowing that he would return to me, even that
                  would give me some relief."
               "Do you really think," asked Filly, calmly, "it would give you the least bit of
                  comfort in the world to know that?"
               "Yes—and for the simple reason, that, whatever it may have been, it could not
                  possibly be worse than some of my misgivings and conjectures on the subject."
               "I can tell you what it was, Señorita."
               "Then tell me, for the love of God! Was it anything dreadful?"
               "Oh, no, I reckon not. Yes, it was, too,—for it was dreadful in me to do what I
                  did."
               "You surely did n't cause that?"
               "I fear I did, Señorita. But I hope you'll forgive me for that, too, as you have
                  already forgiven me for reading that letter. And I almost know you will, for that
                  was a selfish act on my part, while this one was done in a friendly spirit, though
                  it ended so badly. I thought it would not only bring him back to you, but that it
                  would be certain to lead to your marriage; and then Señor would marry me. Oh, I
                  little dreamed it would drive him away from you forever, and ruin both him and
                  us!"
               "Don't talk in that strain any longer, Filly: it puzzles me, and worries me so! Do
                  tell me at once what it was, and relieve my suspense."
               "Well, I will tell you, though I hate to do it. You may recollect that, on the
                  morning of the day he had promised to return, I told you I was going to take a
                  ride."
               "Yes—I remember it perfectly."
               "Well, I went to the camp, and—"
               "What did you do at the camp, Filly?"
               "Gave Mr. John that letter which you have just pardoned me for reading
                  myself."
               The shock from this piece of news was much more sudden to Isabella than it might
                  otherwise have been, from the fact that, when the girl had told her a few minutes
                  before, that she had read the letter, she had—though with some effort
                  then—recalled its contents, and had imagined, as indeed she invariably did,
                  whenever she thought of the horrid letter at all, "How dreadful it would be if
                  Carlos should ever come to know what it contained!"
               Now, however, from having just been conned over, every word came up again in an
                  instant, freshly and vividly to her mind,—insomuch, indeed, that the mere naming
                  of the letter in connection with his dear name would have made her
                  shudder. How sudden then—how terrible—how crushing—came the knowledge that, for
                  the last long year, through hardships and dangers, incurred, too, not for his own,
                  but for her country's freedom, her lover must have been cursing her
                  in that heart of hearts, where she had been, before, so long and so faithfully
                  enshrined as something altogether too pure for this lower world.
                  That, it was which had driven him away from her forever!
               
               Yet she uttered not a single word—did nothing whatever that could hint of the
                  fearful commotion within, which was even then stirring, lacerating, and breaking
                  up the fountains of her spiritual no less than of her physical life. She simply
                  leaned her head again on the sill,—as one might do, at almost any time, to relieve
                  a slight weariness,—and there allowed it to remain like a passive weight that was
                  no part of her most impassioned self—calm, motionless, wordless.
               The girl was greatly surprised at this apparent composure. She had expected an
                  outbreak either of grief, or of indignation, and was only wondering of what
                  intensity it would be when it should come—whether she herself would have to
                  dissolve in sympathy with the one, or be driven from her presence by the
                  other.
               Filly having told her whole story, had no more to say; and as her friend did not
                  speak, a deep silence prevailed in the moon-lighted room. Presently this grew to
                  be painful, and the girl, beginning to think it, in some way, boded ill, resolved
                  to break it and meet the risk.
               "Oh, Señorita! speak, for God's sake! say either that you hate me, or forgive
                  me!"
               She said this in a very low tone, and as she did so, placed her arm gently about
                  Isabella's waist and bowed her head close to hers on the sill, until her breath
                  came warm against the other's cheek.
               If that embrace had been an adder's coil—that breath an adder's hiss—the kneeling
                  woman could not have sprung more quickly away from their pollution, and rushed
                  from the room.
               Filly,—utterly overcome by these manifestations of loathing towards her, from one
                  whom she sincerely loved, and had, at the very worst, but unwittingly
                  injured,—instead of following her, rose from the window and took refuge in her
                  bed; where, for a long while, she gave herself self up to alternate thinking and
                  weeping. Poor girl, how could she, forest-reared as she was, be expected to
                  comprehend the awful extent of her offending? As the hours dragged by and the
                  Señorita did not return, she began to wonder what could have become of her,—and
                  from wondering, she at length grew anxious lest something untoward might have
                  befallen her.
               Under this disquieting impression, she resolved to make such search as the
                  unfavorable hour would permit; and after hurriedly dressing herself, went forth
                  for this purpose. As she passed the door of the only other room of the small
                  house, she opened it and glanced in. As it was lighted up by the moon, she could
                  see, without entering, that there was no one within. So she passed on and
                  continued the search about the premises—where she was joined by Grim—and along
                  under the nearest trees. She then hastened down to the lake-shore and walked some
                  distance along the beach, hoping to find her sitting there, where she had often
                  loved to sit and muse, the while looking out over the water. But she was nowhere
                  to be seen.
               She next made her way to the tent of the old Mexican couple, who, on hearing her
                  call, were of course frightened well-nigh out of any wits they may be supposed to
                  have had left, thinking, no doubt, that the whole Gachupin host was upon them. She
                  had not been there.
               By this time Filly was seriously alarmed for her friend—or hostess, rather, since
                  it seemed she no longer wished to be considered her friend. Her next step was to
                  appeal to Grim. But, although he evidently saw that something was wrong and seemed
                  to have a vague conception of what was required of him, yet, for once, he was too
                  much befogged to be of any real service, and merely followed at his mistress's
                  heels,—his usually unexpressive face, however ever, full of anxiety all the while about a matter
                  for which he knew himself not qualified.
               In this emergency, her only resource seemed to be in Davies; and although she was
                  very loth to disturb him, worn out and wounded as he was, she soon decided that
                  the urgency of the case demanded it, and resolved to enlist, without further
                  delay, his valuable services in the search; for she well knew him to be one of the
                  cleverest in woodcraft that could anywhere be found.
               It was no such easy matter to wake him as it had been in the case of his nervous
                  neighbors of the tent. Having fallen asleep entertaining a view of "the situation"
                  entirely different from Mr. and Mrs. Miguel, he was by no means alarmed, or even
                  startled at the sound of his own name. On the contrary, he seemed rather lulled
                  than otherwise by the soft tones of the girl's voice in his ear; at any rate, she
                  appeared to fancy that he did, for she soon abandoned calling, and substituted a
                  vigorous shake. This had at once the effect of thoroughly arousing him; for, in
                  the case of a soldier, a gripe may prove too serious a matter not to be instantly
                  looked to. On seeing whose touch it was, he sprang up from the ground and
                  addressed himself to listening intently to her words.
               "Mr. Davies," she said, excitedly, "the Señorita has left the house—and I can't
                  find her anywhere."
               "What could she have left the house for, Filly, at this time of night?"
               "I don't know—unless her grief was more than she could bear, and she hardly knew
                  what she was doing."
               "That might well be," said the soldier, sadly. "How long has she been gone,
                  Filly?"
               "About half an hour."
               "Where have you looked for her?"
               Filly told him where.
               Davies at once turned towards the woods, calling on Grim to follow. The dog
                  hesitated—probably about the propriety of leaving his mistress alone, at night,
                  while she was not inside a house or tent. At any rate he cast an inquiring glance
                  at her.
               "Go along with Mr. Davies, Grim," she said, in a tone half of persuasion and half
                  of command—a tone 
                     Phich
                     which
                   never failed, coming from her, to prove quite irresistible to Grim. So
                  he lost no time in transferring himself to the immediate rear of the soldier's
                  heels,—where he closely stuck until both were out of sight.
               "Mr. Davies," said Filly, when he had gone a few strides, "might n't Miguel be of
                  some use in searching?"
               The soldier halted to make reply.
               "You could n't get him ten feet into the woods, to-night, to save all the
                  Señoritas in Mexico. But if you could get him there, and he was to
                  hear an owl, or see a lightning-bug, he'd run back to you with all his might, and
                  swear—if he had any breath left to do it with—that ten thousand Spaniards were
                  charging on the house."
               Filly did n't insist. And the soldier having vented his indignation against
                  cowardice, (personified,) and no doubt feeling the better for it, sped away with
                  his four-footed ally, and disappeared among the shadows of the trees.
               Filly had no rest during the remainder of the night,—nor, to say truth, did she
                  desire any. She was too anxious for the lone wanderer, whom her unintentionally
                  cruel words had driven forth to fare and to habit with howling beasts. She roamed
                  about in the vicinity of the house, peering as far as she could into the gloomy
                  openings of the surrounding forest, with a faint hope that the Señorita might be
                  descried there, returning, of her own accord, to the shelter of that roof which,
                  the other began now to fear, she had left because it was not her own—and worse— because she had
                     reminded her of the fact that it was not her own.
               "She perhaps thinks," cried the girl, in remorseful anguish, "that I told her this
                  was my house, for the very purpose of driving her out of it!"
               It was high noon before Davies returned; and then he brought neither the Señorita
                  nor any tidings of her. No print of her footsteps had he found, nor any clue even
                  of the direction she had taken. He was an adept in wood-craft—versed in all the
                  signs of the passage of animals through these tangled mazes, even to the turning
                  of a dead leaf, or the ruffling of a flower—but of her, there was to be found no
                  more trace than if her disembodied spirit had gone forth, leaving the flesh
                  behind.
               Tarrying only long enough to get something to eat, he set out again, assisted,
                  this time,—besides Grim,—by Miguel, to whom he assigned a certain area for his
                  special search. The Mexican seemed quite like himself again, now that the weird
                  shadows of night had given place to day.
               Toward nightfall they returned with no better success than Davies had had in the
                  morning. Every day the search was renewed, but always in vain. All hope of finding
                  her gradually died away; so that, at the end of a week, they gave her up; and
                  Davies, very naturally. thinking it high time he should report himself to his
                  wife, in Natchitoches, that she might at least know he was still in the land of
                  the living, took his departure from the lake.
               Before leaving, however, Filly made him promise that he would bring his wife—and
                  his mother, too, if he could prevail on her to leave her present home—to live here
                  with her. The girl hated the town, merely because it was a town; while, on the
                  other hand' she loved the lake, despite all the unpleasant associations connected
                  with it, better than any other spot in the world; and was resolved to make her
                  future home in this house, which had been built and fitted up for her by one whom
                  she still fondly and devotedly loved—cruel though he had been to her—dead though
                  he now was,—and had died, too, for another.

                        Why dost thou thus appear to me?
                     
                     
                        The Witch of Edmonton.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Are you sure
                           That we are awake? It seems to me
                           That yet we sleep, we dream.

                           In thy sullied eyes
                           I read a tragic story.
                        
                     
                     —ROWLEY.
                     
                  
               
               
                  THAT night, about the same hour at which the Señorita had
                  disappeared a week before, Filly was awakened, or dreamed she was awakened—she
                  could not for her life tell which—from a sound sleep, by hearing her name called.
                  On opening her eyes, she found a figure leaning over her, presenting, as well as
                  she could judge by aid of such imperfect light as the moon shed on the
                  chamber-floor, every appearance of being the Señorita herself.
               The girl was of course startled. At first, she thought it all a dream; and so
                  thinking, vainly tried to shake it off. She then put forth her hand and laid it on
                  the one which was resting on the bed beside her.
               "It's genuine flesh," thought she,"warmed by genuine blood—such as never come to
                  us in dreams."
               "It's your friend, Filly: there's no need to doubt it."
               The girl instantly recognized the voice—failing, by reason son of her excitement, to observe the very marked
                  change that had come into it.
               "God bless you, Señorita!" she exclaimed, springing up, throwing her arms around
                  her friend's neck, and kissing her several times. "You've come at last! I was so
                  afraid you had left me altogether. Where in the world have you been?"
               "Oh, never mind about that."
               "But you'll never leave me again, Señorita, will you?" asked Filly,
                  pleadingly.
               "Only once more."
               "And you'll forgive me—won't you? I did n't mean to do you, or him
                  either, any harm,—indeed I did n't."
               "Never mind about that either, Filly. Never let us talk again about anything
                  that's past, or anything to come."
               "What, then, shall we talk about, Señorita?" asked the girl, yielding
                  instantly—(penitence makes us so very pliant!)
               "The present," was the only answer.
               "Well, Señorita,—what of the present?"
               "Why, I 've taken a sudden fancy to go to the lake—and you know I can't row. I
                  want you to row me out to where those little islands are."
               "To be sure I will do so, Señorita," replied Filly, starting up at once and
                  commencing to put on her clothes,—though, at the same time, thinking this about
                  the strangest midnight freak she had ever heard of. Her extreme anxiety, however,
                  to gratify any wish of the Señorita, with the hope of thus thoroughly conciliating
                  her, after having been so rude as to drive her away, was quite sufficient to
                  account for the alacrity with which she complied with the strange proposition,
                  demanding not the why and wherefore.
               The night was a lovely one, and as they walked along beneath the trees, in
                  silence, to the shore, noiselessly trampling ing the checkered light and shadow
                  under their feet, that impression of dreaminess, which such a scene invariably
                  imparts to us, came over the girl in such force, that, for the second time
                  to-night, she could scarcely think herself awake.
               When they had descended to the smooth beach, by a flight of steps cut in the
                  earth, Isabella, stooping down just where the bluff joined the sands, thrust her
                  hand under the bank, to the full length of her arm, and drew forth something
                  which, from the repeated failures she made in trying to raise it after it was
                  dragged from its hiding-place, seemed to be unusually heavy for its bulk, which
                  was but small.
               "Here is something for you, Filly," she said, as she held it out towards the girl
                  in both hands.
               "What in the world is this, Señorita?" asked the other, soon as she took hold of
                  it, and felt its weight.
               "Only just a little present from me. It may be of use you, some day."
               "Why," said Filly, "it's heavy enough for gold."
               "That's just what it is."
               "Gold?" exclaimed Filly. "Why do you give me all this gold? I don't want it: keep
                  it, Señorita, for yourself."
               "Oh, I have plenty besides: more than I know what to do with."
               Filly, wishing, of all things, to avoid giving any further offence, however
                  trivial, determined that she would, for the time at least, accept this singular
                  present, so capriciously bestowed.
               "But why," she asked, "did n't you wait till we came back?"
               "Well, I just happened to think of it as we were passing the spot."
               "But what shall I do with it now—I mean, until we return?"
               
               "You can leave it here, if you choose,—or you can take it along. It is a belt, and
                  you can fasten it about your waist, if you prefer it."
               "So it is. Why, yes—that will be much the handiest way."
               And she adjusted it accordingly.
               They got into the boat; and while Isabella sat down near the bow, her companion
                  took up an oar, and stepping to the stern, so as to have the assistance of her own
                  weight in getting it off, gave a vigorous push against the hard bottom of the
                  lake, and they were at once afloat.
               Grim had followed them to the boat; and when they got in, he attempted to enter
                  also, unbidden—something very unusual with him, for never had dog less
                  presumption. On an adverse motion from his mistress, however, he desisted, and
                  laid himself down at the water's edge, head erect, to watch their proceedings,
                  showing no signs of disappointment; though a little uneasiness manifested itself
                  in a whispered whining which he set up, equivalent, in the matter of feeling, to
                  the downright howl of any other dog.
               Filly now seated herself about midway in the boat, and taking up the other oar,
                  pulled slowly and evenly, and they glided out smoothly enough toward the middle of
                  the lake.
               The feeling that all this was a dream, still clung to the girl. Nay, the more she
                  thought of it, the less was she impressed with its reality. The being awakened in
                  the middle of the night by an apparition, and summoned to follow forth amid weird
                  and fantastic scenery, that looked like the work of some magician's spell. The old
                  trick of finding a large sum of gold, so common in dream-land and fairy-tales, so
                  rare anywhere else. The skimming along so noiselessly on the smooth water,
                  surrounded on all sides by such scenes as enchantment loves so well to call
                  up:—all this seemed so unreal, that Filly was ready to exclaim, at almost any
                  moment after she left the beach, up to the very last, "It is a
                  dream—I know it is!" But her lips were sealed as by a spell. She
                  thought of trying some plan to wake herself, which, however, ended in her
                  thinking, "Oh, no—let it go on so: I'll wake soon enough to something worse than
                  this!" Thus it was that to the very end she could not realize what she both saw
                  and felt: for so far from contradicting the view she had taken—or rather, the view
                  that had forced itself upon her—everything conspired to confirm it, more and more,
                  from this time forth. Indeed, I hold it by no means impossible that we may even
                  die, thinking death itself all a dream. And surely this was as fitting a time, and
                  these were as fitting surroundings for such a death-dream as could well be brought
                  about.
               It was such a night, for loveliness, as is rarely seen. There was nowhere any sign
                  of a breeze. The leaves hung absolutely motionless on their boughs. A few fleecy
                  clouds, motionless too, flecked the sky above, pleasantly relieving the otherwise
                  unbroken blue. The surface of the lake was of glassy smoothness, save where a
                  flock of wild ducks, roused from their sleep, drew out their heads from under
                  their wings, and seeing the approaching boat, paddled themselves out of its
                  course; or save where the dripping oar, or the gliding prow, turned off a
                  miniature wave, that flashed an instant in the moonlight and then went careering
                  gracefully away, in still widening but gradually dying ripples.
               Beyond the narrow area of this slight commotion the moon, and starry clusters, and
                  the little clouds were imaged as clear and distinct as their substance appeared
                  above; while two conspicuous twin-stars of almost equal size and glory, and very
                  near each other, were just disappearing behind the western trees.
               
               How sadly would these palpable beauties have contrasted the invisible freight of
                  misery that was now obtruding itself into their midst, could this have been seen,
                  as such, by the physical eye. It would have seemed not unlike a hell-smirch on an
                  angel's cheek. The very mocking-birds appeared to feel its marring influence. They
                  had all along been singing merrily enough, as they are wont to do in that balmy
                  clime, so long as the moon is abroad. But when the woe-laden boat swept across
                  that elysian scene, those gay songsters were awed into instant silence; and
                  although a solitary one out of all the tuneful host ventured presently to break
                  forth again into song, his song was no longer as it had been. For he now left his
                  perch in the cheerful brake, and burying himself in the gloomy boughs of a
                  cypress, chanted a song of such tristful sort as no bird before or since ever
                  poured forth. One might think it would have broken the heart that gave it birth—
                  even though a bird's.
               Reaching the vicinity of the islands, the Señorita made a sign to Filly to stop.
                  The girl had not yet had a good view of her friend's face. While the two were yet
                  in the house, and during their walking forth beneath the trees to the shore, there
                  was but little light; and before they had gone far enough on the water to be
                  fairly beyond the skirting shadows, Filly, in order to row to advantage, had
                  necessarily seated herself with her face to the stern, and her back to Isabella,
                  who sat near the bow. Now, however, when they stopped, the girl, after shipping
                  the oars, shifted her position, so as to sit facing the Señorita, and very near
                  her. The moon was shining full on her face.
               Filly was so shocked at the change in both feature and expression, that she almost
                  screamed out at the sight of that wasted, worn, ghostly-white face—that hair
                  wildly tangled—those sunken cheeks—those hollow eyes. And it was well, perhaps,
                  there was not light enough to show her, to the full, the strange expression of
                  those eyes. Her mantilla, still wrapped about her and fastened over her bosom, was
                  much torn,—as was also such of her embroidered night-dress as showed below it,
                  about her feet.
               After the first shock was over, Filly, as she continued to look on this pitiable
                  sight, was so moved that she burst into tears, the Señorita, all the while,
                  sitting calm and apparently unmoved. She may have been listening to that
                  melancholy bird,—for he was still singing. Neither spoke a word, had not spoken
                  since they left the shore. Why the lady chose to remain so silent may well be left
                  to the reader's imagination. The girl for her part could think of nothing to say.
                  What, indeed, could she have said—could any one have said—that had not been far
                  better withheld? Could any words of hers have availed to lift a feather's weight
                  from the utterly crushed woman before her? A voice less than divine would have
                  been worse than mockery.
               At length the Señorita, unpinning her mantilla, pushed it back from her
                  snow-white, emaciated shoulders, and it fell into the bottom of the boat.
               "Do you hear that bird?" she said. "He must be singing somebody's
                  death-dirge."
               Poor Filly's heart was too full to answer this simple remark, even had it required
                  to be answered.
               As Isabella said this, she rose, and looked down for a moment into the water. As
                  she did so, a slight shudder struck through her frame. And now, for the first
                  time, the dreadful truth with regard to her friend flashed upon Filly,—and
                  immediately after, a dreadful thought with regard to herself, as she too rose from
                  her seat.
               "There! the bird has ceased. How suddenly! Don't you suppose he's dead? that song
                  was enough to kill him."
               
               As Isabella said this, she took her eyes from the wave, and instead of directing
                  them upon her companion to whom she was speaking, as one might suppose she would,
                  threw a glance aloft on the spangled sky, and for a few moments looked as intently
                  at its twinkling orbs and into its blue depths, as though she knew it would be her
                  last look.
               "See those two stars just setting!" she said. "But why should there be more than
                  one?"
               The girl, as before, made no reply: though she might well have done so, for she
                  saw clearly enough, so far as reading the future in those stars was concerned, why
                  "more than one" should be just then trembling on the horizon.
               "Farewell, Filly," said the Señorita, opening her arms. Then followed a long and
                  lingering embrace. "Long and lingering," indeed, it was!
               "There! let me go now, Filly!"
               "Never!"
               "Then, you will have to go with me."
               "Yes—yes!"
               They gradually leaned further and further over the side of the boat, until it
                  glided away from under them, when they fell, together, into their wide, wild
                  grave, with a heavy plunge. The water once closed over them, there was no coming
                  to the surface, now, nor ever again: the weight of the gold bore them at once to
                  the bottom, where they remained.
               At the sound of that sullen plunge, many a bird started from its perch and
                  fluttered about the brake in wild alarm. Many a wild duck rose from the water, and
                  on whistling wings, sought refuge at the remotest end of the lake. One after
                  another, a few clusters of bubbles came to the surface, were rudely tossed about
                  for a while on the still agitated water, then, one by one, burst into
                  nothingness,—typifying well the brief, stormy, fruitless life, and the sudden
                  death, of those below.
               All this was but fairly over, when there rose from the shore, just where the boat
                  had started forth, the long-drawn howl of a dog,—so piteous that Death himself,
                  could he have fore-heard it, might have withheld the dart, just sped, which called
                  it forth. Then there was a plunge from the beach out into the water—and all was
                  still as before.
            
            
               CHAPTER THE LAST.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           This is that face, thou cruel Angelo!
                           Which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on;
                           This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
                           Was fast belock'd in thine.
                        
                     
                     
                        Measure for Measure.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           If you can bring
                           Tincture, or lustre, in her lip, her eye,
                           Heat outwardly, or breath within, I 'll serve you
                           As I would do the gods.
                        
                     
                     
                        Winter's Tale.
                     
                  
               
               
                  AN hour later, a man of stalwart form, his clothes torn into rags,
                  his face haggard, one of his arms carried in a sling, and much disabled in one of
                  his legs, limped forth from the deep shadow of the woods by the lake and made his
                  way towards the house. He paused before the door, and seemed to hesitate a moment
                  whether he should enter. The mournful howl, which still went up at intervals from
                  about that watery grave, may have caught his ear,—for, instead of going into the
                  house, as he had probably intended, he walked around it and sought the shore of
                  the lake, glancing at the empty hammock as he passed along.
               
               He found the boat drifting near the beach; and wading out to it, he took up the
                  mantilla which lay in the bottom.
               "It's hers!" he said, in a hoarse whisper.
               That howl rent again the still air. It came from among the group of islands.
                  Stepping into the boat, the man took up an oar and sculled off in that
                  direction—for, with but one arm, he could not row.
               "Grim! is it you?" he said, as he reached one of the islands. "You have found your
                  voice too late, I fear, old dog! Get in here, and show me where it is: I know it's
                  somewhere near."
               The dog got into the boat; and looked, and continued to look, intently over the
                  side, down into the clear, shallow water, while the man sculled around so slowly
                  and smoothly as scarcely to stir the surface in the slightest degree. Presently
                  the dog began to howl most piteously, with his eyes steadily fixed on one
                  particular point at the bottom of the lake. The man laid by his oar, and creeping
                  up to the dog's side, looked down, too, at the mysterious object.
               He looked not long! Up from that liquid crystal, illumined by the moon almost to
                  the brightness of day, had come to his eye a spectacle he well might shrink
                  from—the beautiful, sad face of a heart-broken girl. The wide-open eyes were
                  looking directly up into his, and he could not endure the sight, although he knew
                  she was dead: nay, because he knew she was dead—for he also knew he
                  was her murderer.
               He saw, too, another figure clasped in her arms, but the face was turned towards
                  the bottom, and he had to guess whose it was. But he could not guess amiss.
               With a cold shudder, he rushed away; and regaining the oar which he had dropped,
                  was, the next moment, gliding shoreward with all the speed he could make.
               Ah, cruel man! so far as love alone was concerned, you might have lightly
                  forgotten that sweet, sad face. But by that one glance, remorse will
                  hold it up to your memory for ever and ever!
               Yet severe as was this shock, still another awaited him. In repassing the house—on
                  his way, he scarcely knew whither—he recoiled from entering where he could hope
                  for nothing better than tormenting associations and eloquent reminders of more
                  hopeful days. But on catching sight of a small white object lying on the ground
                  close beside the window of the Señorita's room, an irresistible impulse to see
                  what it was, and whether it gave any clue to this tragic mystery, yet only half
                  solved, drew him a step or two out of his way to secure it.
               He found that it was a letter; but as to who had penned it, to whom it was
                  addressed, or of what it treated, the present darkness kept him in blissful
                  ignorance. When, however, the morning shall break upon him, stretched—somewhere,
                  he knows not yet whereabouts in the forest it may be—on his wild bivouac of
                  leaves, tortured in mind, and wrecked in hope, he can then read it at his leisure,
                  and with what comfort he may.
               He will find it to be the Señorita's letter, intended for the man she really
                  loved, whom it never reached. It had been handed back, by Miguel, mechanically, to
                  the writer, on the night when the disastrous news reached the lake, and probably
                  laid by her on the sill; whence the wind had blown it to the ground. While it will
                  tell him all, and add humiliation to his other pangs, it will by no means soothe
                  his rankling remorse; for, as he already knows that she whom he deserted was all
                  his own, he will learn from this missive, that she for whom he deserted her was
                  all another's.
            
            THE END.
