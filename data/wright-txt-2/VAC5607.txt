            PREFACE.
            IN the "Golden Age," angels were the companions of men, holding their spirits in
               immediate relationship with heaven. But, as the gold of celestial innocence became
               dimmed by the breath of self-love—the parent of all evil—angels receded; and farther
               and farther they removed themselves, as men darkened their spirits with sin, until
               even a perception of their existence faded from the mind.
            As it was in the "Golden Age" of the world, so is it in the first, or "Golden Age" of
               each individual life, when the innocence of infancy finds angel-companionship.
               Whoever holds a babe to her bosom, and holds it there lovingly, comes within the
               sphere of angelic influences; for, with infants and little children, angels are
               intimately near. This is seen in the tender love that fills the heart of even a
               wicked mother, when she clasps her helpless offspring in her arms—a love flowing
               forth from heaven, and breathed into her spirit by the angels who are with her
               babe.
            Into every household angels may enter. They come in through the gate of infancy, and
               bring with them celestial influences. Are there angels in your household? If so,
               cherish the heavenly visitants.

               CHAPTER I.
               "BEDLAM let loose!" exclaimed Mr. Harding, passionately, as he started up from the
                  corner, near the fire, where he had been sitting moodily since supper-time.
                  "Silence! or I'll break some of your bones!"
               The children, who had been wrangling, suddenly ceased their noisy strife, and
                  shrunk back from their angry father, who, advancing toward them, seemed half
                  inclined to put his rough threat into execution.
               "There, now! don't talk and act like a savage!" sharply ejaculated the wife and
                  mother, throwing from her coal-black eyes a scornful glance upon her husband. "If
                  I couldn't speak to children in a better way than that, I'd not speak at all."
               We will not put on record the brutal retort of Jacob Harding, as he almost flung
                  himself from the room; throwing over, in his mad haste, little Lotty, the youngest
                  member of his unpromising flock, who happened to be in his way. The loud slamming
                  of the door, and the wild screaming of the child, mingled for the excited mother's
                  ears their sounds discordant.
               
               "He'd better break my bones!" said the oldest boy, Andrew, in looks and attitude
                  the picture of defiance. "I'd just like to see him try it."
               "Hush this instant, you little vagabond! How dare you speak so of your
                  father?"
               "I don't care! He's not going to break my bones." And the young rebel, not over
                  eight years of age, drew himself up, while his eyes, black as his mother's,
                  flashed with boyish indignation.
               "If you say that again, I'll box your ears off!" And Mrs. Harding took two long
                  strides toward the lad, who, knowing something about the weight of her hand,
                  shrunk, muttering, away, and contented himself with thinking all manner of
                  rebellious things, and purposing all kinds of disobedience.
               For a few minutes, after Lotty ceased crying, there was silence in the room; not a
                  pleasant, but a gloomy, forced silence. Then Lucy, six years old, and Philip,
                  between four and five, who had been frightened from their play by the scene just
                  described, drew together once more, and commenced rebuilding a block house, which
                  Andrew had wantonly thrown down. Their work, as it again progressed, this bad boy
                  watched with an evil eye, and, just as it was near completion, wantonly swept
                  again the fabric into ruins. Unable to control their indignation at this second
                  unprovoked violation of their rights, the outraged brother and sister, as if moved
                  by a single impulse, threw themselves upon Andrew, and with fists, nails, and
                  teeth, sought to do him all the injury in their power. Fierce was the struggle,
                  and long would it have continued, but for the mother's interference. She did not
                  stop to separate them, but, with her open hand, dealt each such rapid and vigorous
                  blows about the head and ears, that they were soon glad to retreat, crying with
                  pain, into opposite parts of the room.
               "Now, off to bed with you this instant!" exclaimed the angry mother, "and if I
                  hear a word between you, I'll come up with a switch and cut you half to
                  pieces."
               Andrew, Lucy, and Philip glided from the room, keeping silent through fear, for
                  they understood their mother's present mood well enough to know that it would be
                  dangerous to provoke her further.
               "Come! let me undress you," said Mrs. Harding to Lotty. There was nothing gentle,
                  nothing of motherly love in the tones of her voice. The waters of her spirit were
                  agitated by a storm, and the sky above them was dark.
               "I don't want to go to bed," answered the child, fretfully.
               "Come here this instant, I say!" cried the mother, with threatening look and
                  tone.
               "I don't want to go to bed," repeated Lotty.
               "D'ye hear? Come this minute!"
               But the child, instead of obeying her mother, shrunk away into the farthest corner
                  of the room.
               "If I have to come to you, miss, you'll be sorry; now, mind!"
               Most children would have been frightened at the dark, threatening eyes that almost
                  flashed with cruelty; but Lotty was self-willed, and strong to endure, though but
                  a child. She inherited a large portion of her mother's peculiar spirit. Instead of
                  yielding to this threat, she crouched down in the corner, and cast back at her
                  mother a look of defiance. Mrs. Harding was in no mood for a long parley. There
                  were times when the mother in her was strong; and then, for the sake of her
                  wayward, self-willed child, she would patiently strive with her, and use all
                  gentler efforts to bend her to obedience. But now the mother had given place to
                  the passionate woman. It was one of her hours of darkness, when all the evil of
                  her perverse nature had sway. A few moments she fixed her eyes upon those of
                  Lotty, throwing into them, as she did so,
                  a fiercer light; but this failing to intimidate the stubborn child, all patience
                  gave way, and she darted toward her with something like a tiger's spring. Seizing
                  the still resisting little one, Mrs. Harding jerked her from the corner into which
                  she had retreated, and as she lifted her up into the air, struck her three or four
                  hard blows in quick succession.
               Did Lotty lie still now in her arms, or stand passively by her side? Not so. The
                  spirit of rebellion was like a young giant in her heart, and blows only quickened
                  this spirit into more vigorous life. The child screamed and struggled, and even
                  struck her mother in the face. Such resistance to her will only made Mrs. Harding
                  blindly resolute. More smarting and longer continued blows were returned, and to
                  these was added such a mad shaking of the child, as she held her out with both
                  hands in the air, that Lotty, losing her breath, became frightened, and ceased her
                  struggles.
               "I'll break that stubborn spirit of yours, if I kill you!" said the mother, with
                  cruel triumph in her tones, as she set Lotty down upon the floor heavily. With
                  impatient hands the garments were almost torn from the little one's body, and
                  replaced by her night-gown. Then, without an evening prayer, a kiss, or a kind
                  good-night, she was placed in bed; her only benediction an almost savage threat of
                  consequences, should a single word pass her lips.
               All was silent now in the house. The older children had fallen quickly to sleep,
                  and Lotty, subdued by the power of fear, restrained the rebel cries that were
                  almost bursting her heart for utterance. She, too, soon passed into the world of
                  dreams. Was it a beautiful world to her, poor child? or did haunting images,
                  terrible in shape, follow her there from the real world in which she daily
                  struggled and suffered?
               Alone, with not a sound on the air but an occasional sob from Lotty, the tumult of
                  whose feelings even sleep had not entirely subdued, Mrs. Harding's state of mind
                  underwent a gradual transition. There are few in whose spirit subsiding anger does
                  not leave its debris of sad emotions, or painful self-condemnation. It had ever
                  been so in the case of Mrs. Harding, yet had she not seemed to grow wiser by
                  suffering. With every new cause of excitement, her quick temper fired up and
                  burned its little hour fiercely; and, ever as the fire died out, her spirit felt
                  colder than before, and groped sadly in a deeper darkness. And it was so again.
                  How rebukingly upon this state came, now in a single deep sigh, and now in
                  fluttering sobs, the grief of her self-willed child, prolonged even into slumber.
                  So painful was this sound at length, that Mrs. Harding went softly and closed the
                  door that opened into the room where Lotty was sleeping. But, through the shut
                  door, came, ever and anon, the sigh or sob, each time smiting her ear sadly, and
                  adding to the gloomy depression from which she was now suffering. Nor was this the
                  only cause of self-upbraiding. She was alone, and why? Sharp, insulting words,
                  striking on the ears of her impatient husband, had driven him, as the same cause
                  had before, times without number, from home, to spend his evenings at the tavern,
                  among scenes and associates of a degrading character. Ah! how often and often had
                  the unhappy wife, as she sat through the lonely evening hours, wept far the
                  absence of him whom her blind passion had driven forth—even from the hearth her
                  presence might have made warm and attractive.
               Alas! that suffering taught not this ill-governed woman its lessons of wisdom.
                  That remembered anguish did not act as a stimulus to self-control. Ever as a leaf
                  in the wind was she, when the gust of passion arose. As it had been with her many,
                  many times, so was it now. She was too unhappy for any thing but tears; and so, letting the work she had taken up fall
                  into her lap, she drew her hands over her face, and sat idle, weeping, and
                  miserable. A knock on the door disturbed her wretched mood. It was night, and
                  their house stood at some distance from the nearest neighbour. Mrs. Harding was no
                  timid woman; yet this summons startled her, not because it was bold and
                  imperative; on the contrary, it was low and hesitating.
               "Who's there?"
               She had risen up quickly, and now stood in a hearkening attitude.
               No voice replied, but the same singular knock was repeated.
               "Who's there, I say?"
               Sharp though her tones were, a slight tremor betrayed a secret fear.
               No answer.
               "Come in."
               A hand was on the door knob. It seemed like the hand of a child, and failed in the
                  apparent effort to gain admittance. Mrs. Harding distinctly heard the rustle of a
                  woman's garments. She tried to repeat the words "Come in;" but a strange fear
                  prevented utterance. Almost as fixed as a statue, she stood gazing at the door,
                  which, after a little while, swung quietly open. Her eyes caught a momentary
                  glimpse of a white garment, and then she looked vainly into the deep darkness.
                  There was no form visible.
               "Who's there?" she cried, after a brief pause; but silence was the only
                  answer.
               As she still gazed through the open door, her eyes, penetrating farther into the
                  gloomy vail of night, saw dimly an object on the ground. Advancing across the room
                  a few steps, she was able to perceive distinctly that this object was a large
                  basket, covered with a cloth.
               "Who's there? What's wanted?"
               Again she sought an answer; but no response came. Boldly now she stepped to the
                  door, and bending her body out, peered farther into the darkness; but there was no
                  movement nor sound that indicated the presence of friend or stranger. Close by the
                  door-step stood the basket. She stretched forth a hand, and made an effort to
                  raise it from the ground; but to do this required the exercise of considerable
                  strength.
               "This is strange! What can it mean?" said she to herself, again searching with her
                  eyes into the surrounding darkness.
               "Jacob! Jacob!"
               A thought that her husband might have brought the basket, flitting across her
                  mind, prompted her to call his name.
               But no answer came back upon the quiet air, that bore her voice afar off, until it
                  died in the distance. Why does she start so? A low smothered cry, like that of an
                  infant, has come suddenly upon her ear; from whence, she is in no doubt, for
                  already she has lifted the basket, and is bearing it into the house.
               How wildly excited was the countenance of Mrs. Harding, as she stooped down, and
                  with unsteady hand removed the white napkin that covered the basket. The sight
                  revealed would have touched a harder heart than hers. A babe, only a few weeks
                  old, lifted to hers a pair of the softest blue eyes that ever reflected the light;
                  and as it did so, fluttered its little hands, and showed all the instinctive
                  eagerness of an infant to be clasped to a mother's bosom.
               Now, with all the hardness and passionate self-will of the woman, up into whose
                  face this helpless, innocent stranger looked, there was a warm chamber in her
                  heart, over the door of which was written "mother;" and the hand of an angel
                  opened this door to admit the babe so cruelly abandoned. Her first impulse was
                     obeyed—that prompted her to lift the
                  child quickly from the basket, and fold it in her arms. A sweet, confiding smile
                  played softly around its lips; and its large, beautiful eyes rested in hers with
                  an expression so full of loving confidence, that she felt her whole bosom warming
                  with love, and yearning toward it with inexpressible tenderness. The kiss that
                  could not be withheld from the rosy lips that parted to receive the salutation,
                  was the kiss of a mother.
               Ere there was time for reflection or observation, the babe had won its way into
                  the heart of Mrs. Harding. The door still remained open as she had left it in the
                  excitement incident to bearing in the basket. Mrs. Harding, now aware of this,
                  arose, still holding the child in her arms, and crossed the room to shut the door.
                  Was it really so; or did her imagination create the picture? Be this as it may,
                  just in the dusky extreme of the circle of light made by the rays pouring out from
                  her lamp, she saw the form of a woman. The face was distinct, and its expression
                  never to be forgotten. It was a young face, very sad, very full, and very
                  beautiful. The hands were clasped tightly together, and the figure seemed bending
                  forward eagerly. For a moment or two the vision was distinct; then it faded
                  slowly, and the eyes of Mrs. Harding saw nothing but darkness.
               Closing the door, with a strange feeling about her heart, she went back to where
                  the basket stood upon the floor, and, seating herself beside it, the babe on her
                  lap, commenced an examination into its contents, with the hope of gaining some
                  light on the mysterious circumstance. But nothing here gave her the least clue to
                  the parentage of the child, or made clear the reasons for committing it to her
                  tender mercies. In the basket were four or five full changes of clothes, most of
                  them made of good, but not very fine material, except the white flannel skirts,
                  which were soft as down, and of the choicest quality. These were not so new as the
                  other articles. No letter was to be found in the basket; nor did it contain any
                  money.
               While Mrs. Harding was thus seeking for all possible light in regard to the babe,
                  it had fallen asleep in her arms, unconscious that any great change had taken
                  place in its fortunes or friends, and as happy in its slumbers as when it nestled
                  on its mother's bosom—if, indeed, it had ever known that blessed privilege.
                  Perceiving this, and affected with a new tenderness as she gazed down upon its
                  face—one of uncommon sweetness, even for a babe—she sat for many minutes with her
                  eyes upon its countenance. Her gaze seemed held there as if by a kind of
                  fascination. What a yearning love grew up in her heart, gaining strength every
                  moment! She wondered at her own feelings.
               Rising now, and holding the child with exceeding care, she passed into the next
                  room—her own chamber, where Lotty was sleeping—and gently laid the sweet young
                  stranger in her bed. Here she lingered for some time, leaning over and looking
                  upon the child. Once or twice she left the bed, and went as far as the door,
                  purposing to leave the chamber. But a strange attraction drew her to the babe
                  again and again, and each time it seemed that its face had acquired a newer
                  beauty.
               At last, Mrs. Harding compelled herself to leave the apartment; and as she did so,
                  she closed the door softly. Sitting down by the basket, she commenced a new
                  examination of its contents. This was as fruitless of intelligence as the first.
                  Not a mark nor sign was there, to tell from whence the infant came.
               Half an hour elapsed, and still Mrs. Harding sat musing over the basket, her mind
                  incapable of finding, for the present, interest in any thing but what appertained
                  to the babe.
               Thus she was sitting, when the heavy tread of her husband startled her into
                  painful consciousness of coming trouble.
                  Jacob had never been very fond of children—not even of his own, toward whom he had
                  shown but little tenderness. That he would manifest only ill-nature, perhaps give
                  way to violent passions as soon as he learned that a strange infant had been left
                  at his door, she had too good reason to fear.
               He came in roughly, as was his wont—shutting the door heavily behind him.
               "Hush!"
               Mrs. Harding raised her hand involuntarily, to enjoin silence. But her rude
                  husband strode noisily across the floor, heedless of her warning.
               "What's that?" he said, as his eyes rested on the strange-looking basket.
               "You would hardly guess," answered Mrs. Harding, speaking with a forced
                  pleasantness of tone, very unusual with her when addressing her husband.
               "I shall hardly try," said he, gruffly.
               "A strange thing has happened to-night."
               The voice of Mrs. Harding was not as steady as she wished it to be.
               "How, strange? What has happened? Who's been here?"
               "That basket was left at our door to-night."
               "By whom?"
               "I cannot tell."
               "With somebody's cast-off brat in it, I suppose," said Harding, with a flush of
                  anger in his face, for now he saw the baby clothing which his wife had taken from
                  the basket and laid on the table. "Is it so?"
               The flush had deepened to a fiery glow, and his eyes burned with indignation.
               "The basket contained a young babe," said Mrs. Harding calmly, and with a mother's
                  tenderness in her voice; "the sweetest, loveliest babe your eyes ever rested
                  upon."
               "Pshaw!" And Harding averted his face, on which was a look of supreme contempt.
                  "I'd like to know," he added, menacingly, "who has dared do this thing!"
               "That we are not likely soon to know," said Mrs. Harding. "The basket contained
                  only infant clothing."
               An almost savage imprecation leaped from the tongue of Jacob Harding. For a little
                  while he stormed about the room like a madman. Under almost any other
                  circumstances, his conduct would have kindled up in the mind of his wife as fierce
                  a flame as that which burned in his own. But a woman's true instincts subdued her
                  passionate nature, usually so quick to gather all its forces for combat. Silently
                  she waited for the fire to burn out in her husband's mind for want of fresh fuel,
                  that she well knew how to supply.
               "It is such a sweet baby," said Mrs. Harding, in as calm a voice as she could
                  assume, after her husband's fierce indignation had in a measure consumed
                  itself.
               "Humph! sweet!" How the selfish, cruel animal growled! What a look of disgust was
                  on his countenance—scarcely human in its expression!
               Harding had come home from the tavern, ripe for a quarrel; and he was doing all in
                  his power—impotent of effect so far—to raise a storm. He had not been drinking
                  much: only enough to deaden all of true manhood that he possessed, and to quicken
                  into active force the evil of his nature. He now perceived the change in his wife,
                  and at once divined the cause. The foundling had won its way into her heart, and
                  she was already purposing to adopt it as her own. The thought enraged him
                  anew.
               "Where is the brat?" he exclaimed, starting up with a fresh burst of anger. "I'll
                  throw it out of doors!"
               "Better replace it in the basket, poor thing!" answered Mrs. Harding. "It has done
                  us no harm."
               "Very well. Put the duds back into the basket, and the child with them. They shan't stay in my house
                  to-night!"
               Conscious that, if she gained over her husband at all, it must be through apparent
                  yielding, rather than resistance to his will, Mrs. Harding commenced slowly
                  replacing the baby clothes, as if about to do his bidding. A little wondering at
                  this passive acquiescence on the part of his wife, Harding stood looking on while
                  she laid in garment after garment.
               "It is dark out, Jacob, and will be cold before morning. And then the dogs, or
                  some other animal, might hurt the poor helpless thing."
               "I don't care. It shan't stay in my house to-night. I'll teach people better than
                  to leave their brats at my door—I will!"
               The man's stubborn spirit was roused by the remonstrance of his wife.
               A deep sigh heaved the breast of Mrs. Harding, as she bent once more over the
                  basket, and, to gain time, made some new arrangement of the baby clothes.
               "Don't be all night about it!" growled the savage.
               Mrs. Harding, without a word in reply—a circumstance that excited the especial
                  wonder of her husband—took up the basket, and passed into their chamber, as if to
                  do his bidding. Acquiescence like this he had been far from anticipating. Yet was
                  he, in the blindness of evil passion, bent on thrusting the babe from his house.
                  The very thought of it was an offence to him.
               "Jacob!" It was the voice of his wife, calling to him from the adjoining room,
                  where she had been for several minutes.
               "What do you want?" he answered, gruffly.
               "Come here a moment," Mrs. Harding spoke, in a mild, subdued voice.
               "You come here. You're as able to walk as I am," he retorted.
               "Just a minute. I want to show you something."
               Harding arose and went into the room from which his wife had called to him. In the
                  middle of the floor stood the basket, and lying in the basket, with its beautiful
                  face uncovered, was the sleeping infant.
               "There it is, Jacob," said Mrs. Harding, in a low, steady voice. "Cast it forth,
                  if you have the heart to do so—I have not."
               How suddenly were the man's steps arrested! The moment his eyes fell upon the
                  placid face of the infant, so innocent, so peaceful, so heavenly in expression, he
                  felt himself within the circle of some strange power that stilled the waves of
                  passion in his heart.
               "Cast it forth, Jacob, if you can," repeated his wife. "My hands would be
                  powerless were I to make the effort."
               A little while Harding struggled with himself and the new influences that so
                  suddenly pervaded the atmosphere around him; then, with an effort, he turned
                  himself away, and went back into the room from whence his wife had called him.
               Tenderly, very tenderly, did Mrs. Harding lift the sweet babe, still sleeping,
                  from the basket, and replace it in the bed, the moment her husband retired,
                  vanquished by weapons his fierce manhood despised, yet against which he had no
                  shield of defence. For some time she bent over the baby, gazing upon its face; and
                  it was only with an effort that she could tear herself away.
               "You'd better keep it all night," said Harding, as his wife entered the room where
                  he was sitting. His voice, though untouched by gentler feelings, was not so harsh
                  and cruel as before. "Some harm might come to it, and then we'd be blamed.
                  To-morrow I'll have it sent to the poor-house, if no owner can be found."
               Mrs. Harding sighed, but said nothing in reply. She was afraid to express what was in her mind, for, by
                  years of sad experience, she knew that for her to express a wish, or to approve a
                  measure, was to insure her husband's opposition; and, in truth, it must be told,
                  that she had proved no inapt scholar in the same bad school where he had learned
                  his lessons of ill-nature and boot-less contention.
               "I only wish I could find out who has dared to do this miserable deed," resumed
                  Harding, his anger growing warm again. "A wild beast never deserts her young. The
                  wretch should be gibbeted alive."
               As he said this, a cry arose from the chamber.
               "There it is! A nice time you'll have with it tonight."
               Mrs. Harding went quickly in to the babe, that was now awake. She lifted it gently
                  in her arms, and, as she drew it to her breast, it commenced nestling there,
                  seeking for the fountain of its life—alas! so suddenly and so cruelly cut off. How
                  deeply was the heart of its new friend stirred by this movement! What a yearning
                  pity pervaded her bosom!
               "Dear, dear child!" she murmured, as she bent down her face, and placed that of
                  the infant's closely against it. Holding it thus, she went out into the room where
                  her husband still remained.
               "Won't you get me a little milk in a cup, and some sugar and warm water, Jacob?
                  The poor child is hungry."
               Harding, with considerable reluctance, went off, grumbling, to do as his wife
                  desired. The milk and warm water were brought, and, as he set them on the table,
                  he could not restrain the utterance of an ill-natured remark. To this no answer
                  was returned.
               Much to the relief and pleasure of Mrs. Harding, the babe drank freely from the
                  spoon which was placed to its lips. Evidently, it had been prepared for this great
                  change in its life by those who contemplated abandoning it to strangers. Somehow,
                  Harding's eyes remained riveted on the face of the child, as it took the food
                  prepared by his wife; and, strangely enough, the longer he gazed upon it, the
                  gentler became his feelings. The human in him began to rise above the bestial.
               "No punishment is bad enough for the wretch who could desert a child like that,"
                  said he, his ready indignation taking a new direction. "It was fiend-like."
               "You may well say that, Jacob," returned his wife, as she drew the babe's head
                  back upon her bosom, and looked down tenderly upon its face. "Isn't it
                  beautiful?"
               "I never saw any thing very beautiful in babies," said the man, a little
                  impatiently. He was worried with himself because of the involuntary interest in
                  the little stranger that was awakening in his mind.
               "Oh! how can you say so?"
               Something of the sweetness of bygone years was in the voice of Mrs. Harding, and
                  something of the maiden beauty in her face that had won the heart of her husband
                  in the long-ago time; at least so it seemed to Jacob Harding.
               "It is true, Mary," he answered, even smiling briefly, as he spoke.
               "There is beauty here—beauty that even your eyes can see. Dear little angel! It
                  has come to us like a ray of sunshine, Jacob. You don't know what strange feelings
                  I have had ever since I looked into this sweet countenance. More like a
                  heaven-born than an earthly child the babe seems to me; and now, as it lies so
                  close against my bosom, I feel such a pleasant thrill going deep, deep, even to
                  the centre of my heart, that I wonder as to the cause."
               "You are foolish, Mary," said Harding, kindly.
               "Maybe I am," she replied, "but I can't help it. Now it is fast asleep again! Did you ever see such
                  perfect lashes for a babe? They lie in a dark line upon its cheeks like the long
                  lashes of a woman. Let me place it in bed again."
               Mrs. Harding arose and turned to go into the bedroom. As she did so, her foot
                  caught in the carpet, and she would have fallen forward had not her husband, whose
                  eyes were on her, or, rather, on the babe, sprung instantly forward and caught
                  her.
               "Don't let it fall," he cried, eagerly, stretching his arms around and beyond her,
                  so as to save the child. The act was involuntary; but it betrayed, both to his
                  wife and himself, the strong hold that weak, helpless, unconscious infant had
                  already gained upon his rugged heart. How this betrayal caused the warm blood to
                  leap joyfully through the veins of Mrs. Harding! When she returned from the
                  bed-room, and addressed her husband, he answered in milder tones than he had
                  spoken to her in many days—weeks and months we might almost have ventured to
                  affirm.
               "There's something uncommon about the child, that's certain," he said, as they
                  talked together; "and I shall not feel just right about sending it off to the
                  poor-house. But it can't stay here, for we've enough of our own, and it's as much
                  as I can do to fill their mouths."
               To this Mrs. Harding answered nothing. So far, the babe had been its own
                  all-sufficient advocate, and she felt that words from her might prejudice rather
                  than advance its cause.
               As husband and wife laid their heads upon their pillows that night, each felt a
                  calmness of spirit hitherto unknown. Selfish passions were at rest, and higher and
                  purer emotions—so long held down by evil—stirred with a new life, and opened the
                  windows of their hearts for the influx of celestial influences.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               AS Mrs. Harding lay watchful and musing on her pillow that night, she wondered at
                  her state of feeling. Could the mere presence of a babe effect so great a change?
                  Four times had she been a mother, and four time she had felt, as a helpless babe,
                  just born into the world, was laid against her heart, an indescribable joy. Too
                  soon had this passed away—too soon had her briefly slumbering passions awakened to
                  fresh activity—too soon had the trials and temptations of her position changed the
                  heavenly tenderness that pervaded her spirit into harshness or indifference. She
                  remembered all this, and wondered how she could ever have indulged in anger toward
                  the little ones for whose gift her heart had felt such deep thankfulness.
               How distinctly present to the eyes of her mind were Andrew, and Lucy, and Philip,
                  and Lotty! Not with faces marred, as was, alas! too often the case, by selfish and
                  cruel passions, but with each young countenance beautified with loving affections.
                  With what a new impulse did her heart go out toward them! All the mother in her
                  was stirred to its profoundest depths. While she thought and felt thus toward her
                  own children, involuntarily she raised her head, and bending over, lay, partly
                  reclining, with her eyes fixed upon the calm face of the sweet, young
                  stranger.
               "Baby—dear baby!" She could not keep back the low utterance; and, as she spoke,
                  she lifted the sleeper in her arms, and, hugging it to her bosom, commenced
                  rocking her body, and murmuring a tender lullaby.
               "Don't be foolish, Mary!" Jacob Harding spoke more roughly than he felt, but in tones less
                  reproving than he had meant to use. "You'll waken the child, and then we shall
                  have a time of it."
               "She is so sweet," said Mrs. Harding, as she kissed the babe, and then replaced it
                  in the warm nest from which it had just been withdrawn. She did not know that her
                  husband was awake: he had been lying so very still, that she believed him
                  sleeping. But busy thought, excited by a new current of feeling, had driven
                  slumber also from his eyelids.
               "One would think you'd never seen a baby before!"
               There was no ill-nature in the voice of Jacob Harding, notwithstanding he tried to
                  speak unkindly. The fact was, he had been so long in the habit of speaking harshly
                  to his wife, that, to address her with any thing like tenderness, seemed an
                  unmanly weakness. And so he put on a rough exterior to hide the softness within.
                  He could not entirely hide it, however. Mrs. Harding perceived all the change he,
                  too, was experiencing, and it but increased her wonder and delight. She did not
                  venture a reply, lest something in her words should quicken the perverse temper of
                  her husband.
               Never in her life before did Mrs. Harding fall asleep in such a state of mind, or
                  with thoughts so full of all tenderness and loving-kindness; and never before came
                  to her a dream so strange and beautiful. Last in her thoughts, as all waking
                  perceptions died, were the singular incidents of the evening; and, as fancy began
                  to mingle her airy forms with the things of actual life, the strange vision—real
                  or ideal—that fixed the eyes of Mrs. Harding, as she gazed through the open door
                  into the surrounding darkness, was most prominent. Across this warp, fancy threw
                  her shuttle, and strange figures were soon made visible in the dreamy fabric she
                  wove.
               Again Mrs. Harding was alone in the family sitting-room. No babe was in her lap;
                  but, in the open door stood a beautiful woman, and she knew her to be the same
                  whose white, sad, yearning face had been revealed to her a moment on the
                  background of shadows. Tender and serious, but not sad, was her face now, as she
                  beckoned with her hand. Mrs. Harding arose and followed the lovely apparition. As
                  she stepped beyond the threshold, she became aware that the earth lay in sunlight,
                  and that the scenery around was new and more beautiful than any thing she had
                  seen. Here were soft, green meadows, dotted with snow-white lambs; there, leafy
                  avenues, along which the eye ranged to an almost interminable distance, and yonder
                  towered up, even to the spotless heavens, mountains as blue as the sky itself.
               "The land of innocence and essential love," said the stranger, as they gained an
                  eminence and looked down upon the scene spread out in beauty before them. "The
                  angels of childhood dwell here. Whenever a babe is born upon the earth, two angels
                  from this world are appointed to its guardianship, and they remain near the child
                  through all the days of its tender infancy; and near the mother, also, filling her
                  heart with love for her helpless offspring. It is their presence that so often
                  changes the selfish and cruel woman into the tenderest of mothers. They flow into
                  her mind through love for her babe, and fill it so full of what is gentle and
                  good, that evil passion has no room for activity. But, gradually, as the minds of
                  infants are opened, through the senses, to a knowledge of the world into which
                  they have been born, and as the will, gaining strength, is moved by inherent evil,
                  the angels gradually recede from both the child and the mother; not because they
                  wish to abandon their charge, but because their gentle influence is no longer
                  perceived. With some they remain longer than with others; for some children are
                  born with fewer perverse inclinings, and some mothers love their babes with a
                  divine rather than an earthly love."
               
               As the fair stranger ceased speaking, Mrs. Harding perceived that they were
                  standing in one of the porticos of a building, the architecture of which, in its
                  grandeur, exceeded any thing ever reached by the boldest imagination. The walls
                  were of translucent gems, and everywhere the ornaments, that seemed living forms,
                  gleamed with gold and sparkled with precious stones of wonderful brilliancy. Into
                  this magnificent palace they entered, and the stranger led the way to a large east
                  room, where a small company of beautiful virgins stood near a window, from which
                  they were gazing earnestly.
               "Let us approach them," said the stranger; and they moved over to where the
                  virgins were assembled by the window.
               "Pride and human fear have hardened her heart." Thus spoke one of the virgins.
                  "And she is about to desert the babe. See!"
               All bent near and gazed from the window. To the eyes of Mrs. Harding every thing
                  looked dark and sad. It was some time before she was able to distinguish objects;
                  but, when her vision was clear, she recognised all the prominent features of the
                  scene. Dimly revealed from out of the murky shadows, was the neighbourhood where
                  she dwelt, and she seemed to be looking down upon it, as from an eminence. It was
                  night, for all was it half obscurity, and the stars were shining from the sky.
                  Here and there stood a house—she knew them all—and there was her humble abode, the
                  only one from the window of which light streamed forth upon the gloomy darkness.
                  As she continued to look, an object moving along one of the roads became visible.
                  Gazing more intently, she saw a woman, and in her hand she carried a basket. A
                  thrill passed along every nerve, as she recognised the face that had looked so
                  wildly upon her from the fading circle of light, and she turned quickly toward the
                  stranger who had led her thither—but she was now alone with the virgins.
               "Not there," said one of the company.
               The woman had paused before a house, the inmates of which Mrs. Harding knew to be
                  best esteemed in all the neighbourhood for goodness of heart and kindness of
                  action. In this home there was ease and comfort; and the babe, if left there,
                  would find love and tenderness.
               "Why not there?" she asked aloud.
               "Even a babe has its mission of good to the world," answered one. "A household
                  angel will this babe be, wherever it is received; for to the best of Heaven's
                  angels has been committed its guardianship. If the mother, hearkening to evil
                  counsel, casts it from her, the blessing of its presence must be for those who
                  need the blessing. No, not there."
               And the woman, who had paused before the dwelling of peace, took up the bundle,
                  and passed on slowly, wearily, and in tears.
               "Not there," said one of the virgins, as she stopped before another dwelling.
               The woman seemed to hear the words, for she raised the basket again, and kept on
                  her way. As she did so, her eyes received the light, streaming forth from the
                  Hardings' window, and she turned her step thitherward.
               "The angels of childhood are about to leave that dwelling," said one of the
                  virgins; "for innocence has almost died in the hearts of the children. A dark
                  shadow is resting over them, for the powers of evil have prevailed over the good.
                  Let the babe go there."
               "There? Not there!" answered one of the virgins. "The innocent, helpless lamb must
                  not be left in a den of wild beasts."
               "It will not go alone," was replied. "Angels have gathered their protecting arms
                  around it; and its own sphere of innocence will be a wall of defence."
               
               A low cry reached the ears of Mrs. Harding—the cry of a babe. Instantly the vision
                  faded, and she became aware that a small, soft hand was nestling in her bosom.
                  There was love, more than human, in her heart, as she gathered the half-walking
                  infant in her arms, and felt that she had been, she still was, in the company of
                  angels.
               How vivid remained the impression of her dream—not to her a mere phantasm, but a
                  real vision!
               "For this great blessing, Father, I am thankful," said she, as she lifted upward
                  her heart to heaven.
               Strange fact! Not, perhaps, since the days of innocent childhood until now, had
                  she felt that God was near to her, and near as the Giver of good; and that she
                  should address God in a thankful spirit! She wondered, even while she gave
                  involuntary thanks.
               When Mrs. Harding slept again, it was to dream of the babe, and to have a
                  consciousness of deep peace, such as she had never experienced in her waking
                  moments. New purposes and better states of mind had been formed during both the
                  waking and sleeping hours that passed since the little stranger first greeted her
                  with its winning smiles. The morning found her calm, thoughtful, yet sad. What a
                  trial was before her! Ah! how clearly she saw her difficult position! How sunk her
                  heart, as one hard, harsh fact after another, of that position, looked her sternly
                  in the face! She had as much to fear from within as from without—from her
                  ungovernable passions as from the tempers of her husband and children.
               Dimly the morning broke, the cold light creeping slowly into the chamber where she
                  lay. Her husband and Lotty still slept; but the babe was awake, and its large blue
                  eyes were looking up into hers. How sweetly it smiled! How trustful and loving the
                  whole expression of its young face!
               "Blessed baby!" she said tenderly.
               And it responded to her greeting with a curving lip, and the low, cooing sound of
                  a dove, as she talked to it, forgetful of every thing in the pleasure of the
                  moment. Harding awoke suddenly, and starting up in bed, muttered some incoherent
                  words, and threw his eyes hastily around the room. His voice chilled the heart of
                  his wife, for she dreaded his waking mood. Scarcely thinking of what she did, Mrs.
                  Harding drew the bed-clothes over the child, and so placed her body as to shield
                  it from his observation.
               "I've been dreaming, I believe," said Harding, as he laid himself back on the
                  pillow.
               "Dreaming of what?"
               Mrs. Harding spoke very gently. In half wonder, her husband turned his head to
                  look into her face—the tone was so unusual.
               "I never saw any thing so real."
               "Was it a pleasant dream?"
               Harding looked over at his wife again. It was the old voice that, in times gone
                  by, had sounded to him so musically.
               "Yes, Mary," he answered, mildly, "it was a pleasant, though a singular dream. I
                  thought some one left a baby at our door"—
               He paused abruptly, looked serious for a moment or two, and then said—
               "But that was no dream, Mary."
               He now raised himself up, and, as he did so, Mrs. Harding drew down the
                  bed-clothes, and showed him the smiling infant.
               "It was no dream, Jacob," she said, kindly.
               For some time, Harding gazed upon the little face, and the longer he gazed, the
                  softer grew his heart. He said no more of the dream; yet, as well to him as to his
                  wife, had come a vision—though not in all things alike. He had seen the little abandoned one in sleep, and
                  under circumstances that impressed his mind powerfully.
               It was now broad daylight, and Lotty, as was usual with her, awoke in a bad
                  humour. She commenced crying even before her eyes were fairly open.
               "What do you want, Lotty?" asked Mrs. Harding.
               But Lotty cried on, not seeming to have heard her mother's voice.
               "Lotty! Lotty!"
               The crying did not cease for an instant.
               "See what I've got here, Lotty!"
               "You ain't got any thing!"
               By such words the child had been so often deceived, that no confidence remained
                  even in her mother. And so she kept crying on.
               "Will you hush, now?"
               The father's patience was gone, and he spoke in a quick, angry voice. How the
                  little stranger babe started! What a frightened look was in its face! Harding saw
                  the effect of his harsh tones; and, for the sake of the babe, regretted the sudden
                  passion to which he had given way.
               "But I have got something here, Lotty," said Mrs. Harding. "It is the
                  dearest little baby you ever saw in your life."
               Instantly the voice was silent, and, springing from the bed in which she lay,
                  Lotty stood beside her mother. Harding watched her face, and saw how suddenly it
                  changed.
               "It is wonderful!" he said to himself, as he arose and commenced
                  dressing—"wonderful. It seems even now as if I must be dreaming. 'A heaven-sent
                  child.' These were the very words that sounded in my ears as I awoke; and I verily
                  believe the babe is from heaven."
               "Baby! baby! dear, sweet baby! O mother! where did it come from?"
               There was such a gush of delight in the voice of Lotty, who was usually cross in
                  the morning, as she stood on a chair, and bent over the infant, that Mr. Harding's
                  wonder increased. A spell about the babe subdued all who came near. To him it was
                  a new life-phenomenon, the mystery of which filled him with surprise, not
                  unmingled with a heart-pervading sense of pleasure.
               Mrs. Harding now arose, leaving Lotty and the infant equally delighted with each
                  other, and commenced hurriedly dressing herself. It was her business to prepare
                  the morning meal; for the earnings of her husband were not sufficient to allow her
                  help in the family. With many earnest injunctions to Lotty not to hurt the babe,
                  she left the chamber for the kitchen, in order to make up the fire and get
                  breakfast. Somehow or other, the fire kindled with unwonted quickness; and every
                  touch and movement of her hand seemed to accomplish her purpose more readily than
                  usual. By the time the milkman was at the door, she had the table set, and the
                  kettle was almost ready to boil. The babe's breakfast was her next thought. It was
                  scarcely the work of a moment to dilute some new milk with warm water, to add a
                  little sugar, and a few crumbs of bread, and to bear it into the chamber where she
                  had left the little stranger.
               As she came in noiselessly, she saw her husband stooping over the infant, whose
                  two white, chubby hands were fluttering about his rough face, and heard the
                  cooing, dove-like voice that had sounded once before to her so sweetly.
               As soon as Harding perceived that his wife was present, he left the bedside, half
                  ashamed of his weakness in thus toying with a mere babe.
               "The child must be hungry," he said, with as much indifference as he could
                  affect.
               
               "I've brought her something to eat," answered Mrs. Harding. "And won't you, Jacob,
                  while I feed her, call the children, and bring me in an armful or two of wood?
                  Breakfast will be all ready in a little while."
               There was no resisting the manner of Mrs. Harding. If she had always spoken to her
                  husband as now, he would always have been to her a kind husband. Her power over
                  him for good might have been complete, had she been wise, gentle, and forbearing.
                  But she had exercised no self-control, and almost from the beginning of their
                  married life, had excited the evil in him, rather than the good. How much she had
                  lost, and how much she had suffered in consequence, can hardly be imagined. Her
                  life, for the last six or seven years, might almost be called a living
                  martyrdom.
               Harding did not answer, but went out from the chamber promptly to do as his wife
                  had requested. Ordinarily, in calling the children, he spoke, to use the strong
                  words of his wife, "as if he would take their heads off." He corrected this bad
                  habit in the present instance; for, instead of ordering them roughly and angrily
                  to get right up, or he would be after them "with a stick," he ascended to the room
                  where they lay, and spoke kindly, yet firmly, to each one, subduing their waking
                  impatience, by the quiet pressure of his own voice and manner.
               "Andrew," he said in a tone that, exciting no opposition in the boy's mind, left
                  the consciousness that he must obey—"dress yourself before you come down, and do
                  it quickly."
               "Yes, sir," was answered cheerfully, and Andrew sprang from his bed.
               "Philip! Lucy!" The two younger children rose up. "Go down to your mother. She
                  wants to dress you."
               The voice and manner of their father were so unusual, that the little ones felt
                  both surprise and pleasure. They obeyed instantly, and Mr. Harding had the strange
                  satisfaction of witnessing an act of ready and cheerful obedience in his
                  children.
               A great surprise awaited Lucy and Philip, and they were just in the state of mind
                  for its full enjoyment.
               A stranger, who had looked in upon Harding's family at the early meal on the
                  previous day, and who looked in again upon them as they assembled around the
                  breakfast-table on this morning, could hardly have believed that his eyes rested
                  on the same individuals. In her usual place was Mrs. Harding, the stranger babe on
                  her arm, and looking so beautiful and happy, that all eyes and hearts were drawn
                  toward it. Little Lotty, from the moment its bright eyes looked into hers, had not
                  once left its side, and now, as she sat close to her mother, she could not eat for
                  pleasure.
               "Has it any name, mother?" asked Andrew, from whom had not proceeded a single
                  ill-natured word or act, since he came down and saw the baby.
               Mrs. Harding did not reply, but looked at her husband. A name bad been floating in
                  her thoughts, but she hesitated about giving it utterance.
               "Dora," said Mr. Harding. "Let us call her Dora."
               Now, that was not the name about which Mrs. Harding had been thinking; nor was it
                  a name that pleased her ear. It was on her tongue to say, "Oh, no;" but she kept
                  silent. Her eyes were bent down upon the little one's face, and there she read her
                  duty. For its sake, she refrained from objecting, because she feared that any want
                  of accord with her husband would produce a state of opposition; and so she said
                  nothing.
               "Shall it be Dora?" Harding spoke in a pleasant voice.
               "Yes, if you like the name." And Mrs. Harding looked up and smiled as she
                  answered.
               
               "Have you thought of one, Mary?"
               "A name has been in my mind ever since I awoke this morning. But if Dora sounds
                  pleasant to your ears, let her be called Dora."
               "What name did you think of? Perhaps I will like it best," said Harding.
               "Grace." Mrs. Harding spoke the word softly and tenderly.
               "The very name!" said her husband. "It is much better than Dora. Let her be called
                  Grace."
               "Grace! Grace!" All the children echoed the name; and the baby, as if conscious of
                  a new importance, tossed its little hands, and smiled.
               So touched was Mrs. Harding by this unexpected acquiescence of her husband, that
                  tears came into her eyes. For the first time in months, it might be years, Harding
                  has deferred to her wishes—but not in consequence of resolute persistence on her
                  part. Had she contended for the name that pleased her best, he would never have
                  seen in it a beauty and fitness above the one he preferred himself; and she would,
                  in the end, have been compelled to yield, or have the babe thrust out from the
                  home into which its presence had already brought so many rays of sunshine.
               And so the babe was named Grace.
               "What will you do, Mary?" said Harding to his wife, as, after sitting longer than
                  usual at the table, he arose to leave the house. As he spoke, he looked toward the
                  child that still lay in her arms. Mrs. Harding understood, and answered
                  quickly—
               "Oh, I shall get on very well. Breakfast wasn't late a minute this morning, and
                  I'm sure every thing has gone on pleasantly. No hurry nor confusion. The children
                  never behaved better in their lives."
               And the mother glanced at them approvingly.
               "But you can't attend to an infant, and do all your work into the bargain?"
               "You see if every thing isn't in order, and dinner smoking on the table when you
                  come home," answered Mrs. Harding, cheerfully, and with smiles.
               Harding lingered. There was a fascination about little Grace, from the circle of
                  which it seemed as if he could not break.
               "What are we to do with this child, Mary?" said he, his manner becoming serious.
                  "We have more children now than we can well take care of."
               "Has it brought us trouble or pleasure, so far?" asked Mrs. Harding, looking up
                  earnestly into her husband's face. He did not answer.
               "Would you like to see it taken to the poor-house?"
               "No, no. It shall not go there!" Harding spoke quickly and strongly.
               "It is a heaven-sent child, Jacob," said Mrs. Harding, in a low but impressive
                  voice. "I know it from the dream that came to me last night. Let us accept the
                  boon thankfully. He who sent it to us will see that it shall prove not a burden,
                  but a blessing."
               Harding answered not a word, but drew nearer to his wife, and, bending down, laid
                  his finger upon the babe's soft cheek. He would have stooped lower and kissed the
                  cheek, but felt ashamed to betray what seemed to him a weakness.
               When that hard, harsh, passionate man went forth into the world of strife and
                  labour, he carried in his thoughts the beautiful image of a babe. Men with whom he
                  had been used to come in rough contact, saw a change, but divined not the cause.
                  He was less coarse in speech, and rude in action—less contentious—less
                  overbearing. The consequence was, that men who had always treated him roughly,
                  because he was himself rough, instantly changed their manner, so that fewer things than usual occurred to chafe his
                  spirit. Not during all that morning was the image of the babe once wholly
                  obliterated, though many times obscured.
               "What does it all mean?" said Harding to himself, as he reflected on the change.
                  "Am I the same man that I was yesterday? What is there in a little helpless babe
                  to cast a spell like this?"
               But he questioned in vain. He could not understand the mystery. With lighter steps
                  and a lighter heart than usual, he took his way home at dinner-time, looking for
                  sunshine there. And he did not look in vain, for it lay broader and brighter over
                  his threshold than it had lain for many years.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               THERE was quite a stir in the neighbourhood when the news got abroad that an
                  infant had been found at the door of the Hardings. The gossips had a "world to
                  say" on the subject; and all agreed, that a more unfortunate selection of a home
                  for the little one could not have been made.
               "It don't matter much as far as that goes," said Mrs. Margaret Willits, the
                  storekeeper's wife, as she chattered over the tea-table with Mrs. Jarvis and Miss
                  Gimp; "for the truth is—all among ourselves, remember—Harding can't support his
                  own children, let alone other people's. Somebody will have to take the child off
                  their hands, or they'll send it to the poor-house."
               "But he does support his own children," replied Miss Gimp.
               This was ingeniously remarked, in order to draw Mrs. Willits out.
               "I'm not so sure of that," said the storekeeper's wife, mysteriously.
               "Who does support them?"
               Mrs. Jarvis put the question direct.
               "I guess we do our part—this among ourselves."
               "Oh, I understand," said Miss Gimp, a light breaking over her countenance. "He
                  doesn't pay up at your store?"
               "You've hit it right—but it's all among ourselves, remember."
               "Oh, of course, returned Miss Gimp. And——"
               "Of course," said Mrs. Jarvis. "We wouldn't speak of it on any consideration."
               
               "Don't, if you please; for they're bad kind of people, and I wouldn't get their
                  ill-will on any account. Mrs. Harding has an awful tongue in her head; and what is
                  worse, I verily believe she would seek to do me some harm, if she knew I'd said a
                  word against her."
               "Don't be afraid," said both of the ladies at once.
               "And so Harding owes your husband?" Miss Gimp spoke insinuatingly.
               "Oh, yes. He's been getting things off and on now, for a year. Every little while
                  he comes and pays something on account; but manages to let his bill keep getting
                  larger and larger. Mr. Willits says it must stop soon. He was going to refuse them
                  trust last week; but thought he would wait a while longer. He knows that the
                  moment he stops them off, Harding will be terribly angry, and that he will not
                  only lose the custom of the family, but all the money that is owed to him into the
                  bargain."
               "Rather a hard case," remarked Miss Gimp.
               "Isn't it? And so, as I was saying, it doesn't matter much for the child, that it
                  was left at their door. They'll never dream of keeping it."
               "When was the infant abandoned?" asked Mrs. Jarvis.
               "Three nights ago," replied the storekeeper's wife.
               "Indeed! I never heard a syllable of it until today. And the child is still with
                  them?"
               "For all I know to the contrary," said Mrs. Willits.
               "They've been very quiet about the matter, that's certain," remarked Miss Gimp,
                  who was dressmaker and assistant gossip for the neighbourhood. "Three nights
                  ago—and not a breath of it to reach my ears until last evening! It looks
                  mysterious. Why should they be so very still about it?—they, of all people in the
                  world! I shouldn't wonder, now that I think of it, if they knew more about the
                  matter than they care to tell. There's something wrong, depend on't. I'm as sure
                  of it as that I am sitting here."
               "Wrong in what way?" asked Mrs. Jarvis, manifesting a new interest in the
                  subject.
               Miss Gimp affected a mysterious manner, as if she knew more of what was going on
                  in the neighbourhood than she felt at liberty to tell.
               "Have you any suspicion as to where the child came from?" inquired Mrs.
                  Willits.
               "I have my own thoughts," said Miss Gimp, with a gravity that so well became her.
                  "But thoughts cannot always be spoken."
               "We are all friends, you know, Miss Gimp." Mrs. Jarvis put on her most insinuating
                  manner. "Old friends, who can trust one another."
               "I'd trust you with any thing I knew certain," replied Miss Gimp. "But it's all
                  guess-work here. Wait a few days. I'm bound to sift this matter to the bottom. At
                  present, I'll just give it as my opinion, that the Hardings know a great deal more
                  about the child than they care to tell."
               "You may be right there, Miss Gimp," said Mrs. Willits—"else, why have they kept
                  so still about it?"
               "Exactly! Why have they kept so still about it?"
               "Did you hear," inquired Mrs. Jarvis, "whether there was a letter in the basket
                  with the child?"
               Mrs. Willits shook her head.
               "Of course, there must have been," said Miss Gimp. "There always is, in affairs of
                  this kind. Take my word for it, the parentage of that child is no secret to the
                  Hardings. And"—her imagination was taking a freer range—"I shouldn't at all wonder
                  if the basket contained something more than a baby."
               "What?"
               The two ladies bent closer toward Miss Gimp.
               "Money!"
               
               "Money?"
               "Yes: a handsome sum of money; and a letter besides, promising a regular payment
                  of more every month or quarter, as long as they keep the child. Depend upon it,
                  this is the case; I'm as sure of it as if I had seen into the basket myself."
               "You've guessed it as certain as fate," said Mrs. Willits, with animation. "No one
                  would have trusted a little helpless infant in their hands, without some strong
                  hold, like this, upon their selfishness. Well, all I can say is, that, in the
                  first place, they didn't deserve any such good fortune; and in the second place,
                  whoever selected them as guardians of the child, have made a cruel
                  experiment."
               In this the other ladies fully agreed, Miss Gimp remarking, "It is an ill wind
                  that blows nobody good. Your husband, Mrs. Willits, may now stand some chance of
                  getting his money."
               "Sure enough! I didn't think of that. It takes you, Miss Gimp, to see all the
                  bearings of a subject."
               Miss Gimp was flattered by this compliment, and drew her head up in a way peculiar
                  to herself when pleased.
               "Has any one seen the child?" inquired Mrs. Jarvis.
               "I have not," answered Mrs. Willits; "nor have I met with any one who has called
                  on Mrs. Harding since it was left at her house. There's neither pleasure nor
                  comfort in visiting her; and so people stay away. I haven't been in her house for
                  three months. The fact is, the last time I called on her, she was in an awful
                  humour about something or other, and as snappish as a turtle. I'm sure she boxed
                  the ears of every child she has, three times over, while I was there, and, if the
                  truth must be told, they richly deserved all they got; for a more ill-mannered,
                  quarrelsome brood I never saw. Andrew, their oldest boy, is a perfect little
                  desperado. The way he knocked the other children about was dreadful. I was in fear
                  every moment of seeing some of their limbs broken or eyes put out."
               "Just as it was when I called there last," said Miss Gimp. "I went to fit a dress
                  for Mrs. Harding. The house seemed like a perfect bedlam. The children quarrelled
                  all the while, and their mother stormed at them incessantly. I was too glad to get
                  away."
               "Do you expect to go there again very soon?" asked Mrs. Jarvis.
               "I ought to have gone there a week ago, to take home the cape of her last new
                  dress. She wants it, I know. There isn't more than half an hour's work on it, and
                  I'll do that this very evening."
               "Then you'll see her in the morning," said the storekeeper's wife.
               "Yes."
               "Just drop in on your way back, Miss Gimp; that's a good soul. It's such a strange
                  affair, I really feel curious about it. Take a good look at the baby, and see if
                  you can trace a likeness to anybody. And then, be sure to find out if any money
                  came with it, or is promised. I want to know about that, of all things."
               "Never fear for me," said Miss Gimp, looking unusually bright. "I'll gather up
                  every crumb of information."
               "And you'll call in as you go by?"
               "Oh, certainly."
               "Do, if you please," said Mrs. Jarvis; "for, as I have an errand out in the
                  morning, I'll manage to be here—at what time?"
               "Say ten o'clock," replied Miss Gimp.
               Little else was talked of by the ladies during the hour they remained together
                  after tea.
               Oh the next morning, at ten o'clock, Mrs. Willits and Mrs. Jarvis sat together,
                  awaiting the arrival of Miss Gimp, who
                  had looked in upon the storekeeper's wife, as she passed on her way to the
                  Hardings, to say that she would call on her return and make a report. Sooner than
                  they expected the dressmaker, she came in. Her face did not look very
                  animated.
               "Good morning, Miss Gimp!—good morning!" said the ladies.
               "Good morning."
               Miss Gimp tried to look important and well satisfied with herself, but the effort
                  was wholly unsuccessful.
               "Well, Miss Gimp, did you see the baby?"
               "I did."
               There was an ominous gravity in the gossip's tones.
               "Is it a nice-looking baby?" inquired Mrs. Willits.
               "A very nice-looking baby, indeed. In fact, it's the dearest, sweetest little
                  thing I ever saw."
               "Why, Miss Gimp! You don't say so?"
               "It's the truth, every word I tell you."
               "Well, really! It's a nice baby, then?"
               "You may believe it. And then, it's so good! Mrs. Harding says it hasn't cried an
                  hour since it came into the house."
               "You don't tell me!"
               "I can well believe her; for, while I was there, it did nothing but smile and coo,
                  and try its best to talk to every one who came near the cradle where it lay."
               This information was not half so satisfactory to the two ladies, as the report of
                  its being cross and disagreeable would have been.
               "Well, so much for the baby," said Mrs. Jarvis. "And now, Miss Gimp, tell us all
                  you learned about it. Where do you think it came from?"
               "Haven't the least idea in the world," replied Miss Gimp.
               "Really!"
               "Really!"
               "Could you trace a likeness?"
               Miss Gimp shook hear head.
               "Doesn't it look like somebody you have seen?"
               "No one that I can remember; and yet the face is strangely familiar. It seems as
                  if I had met it only yesterday; but, for my life, I cannot tell where."
               "What does Mrs. Harding say?"
               "Nothing."
               "Nothing?"
               "Or next to nothing. She's very quiet and very reserved. Something has come over
                  her and the whole family."
               "Indeed!" Both the ladies spoke at once.
               "In what respect?" asked Mrs. Willits.
               "I didn't hear a cross word while I was in the house, either from mother or
                  children. The last time I was there, Lotty, the youngest, did nothing but fret,
                  and snarl, and cry. But this morning she sat on the floor, beside the cradle,
                  looking fondly on the baby, or playing with it in the gentlest manner. The fact
                  is, that baby seems to have brought a charm into the house. I could hardly believe
                  I was with the same people."
               "You don't tell us so?"
               "It's the truth, just what I say."
               "Was there any letter or money in the basket?" inquired Mrs. Willits, whose
                  interest in that aspect of the case was particularly strong.
               "Not that I could find out," answered Miss Gimp. "I felt my way, and hinted, and
                  did every thing except put the question direct; but Mary Harding either could not
                  or would not understand me. She was always a little close-mouthed, you knew."
               "Why didn't you ask her right up and down? I would have done so," said Mrs.
                  Willits.
               "It was on my tongue's end more than once; but every time I was about to speak,
                  she seemed to know what was in my mind,
                  and made some remark that threw me off."
               "How provoking!"
               "It was provoking," said Miss Gimp, looking particularly annoyed.
               "What does she intend doing with the little stranger?" asked Mrs. Jarvis.
               "Keep it," replied Miss Gimp.
               "She's got a house full of her own now—more than her husband is able to support,"
                  said Mrs. Willits. "I don't understand the woman."
               "I think I do," returned Miss Gimp, assuming a knowing look. She was good at
                  surmising. "As to there being any disinterested feeling toward the babe, that is
                  not admitted for an instant."
               "Of course not."
               Miss Gimp resumed—"You may rely upon it, then, as I suggested in the beginning,
                  that she knows all about where the child came from, and is well paid for taking
                  care of it."
               "But how do you account for the singular change in her temper, and, above all, for
                  the change in the temper of her children?"
               "I've thought of all that," answered the dressmaker, "and own that I am puzzled.
                  It has occurred to me, that her young savages may have been tamed, as they tame
                  wild beasts, by hunger and stripes. If she has a motive strong enough to make her
                  resolute, Mrs. Harding is not the woman to hesitate about the adoption of any
                  means for the accomplishment of her purposes. It has, no doubt, been made her
                  interest to keep this child, and to keep it right. If this is really so, she will
                  make all bend to her will in the matter."
               And so, after all, the dressmaker had failed to learn any thing about the babe,
                  that was satisfactory either to herself or her friends, Mrs. Willits and Mrs.
                  Jarvis. As might be supposed, the report of Miss Gimp excited still more the
                  curiosity of the two ladies, who had urged the visit to Mrs. Harding. They were
                  really troubled, because of their inability to penetrate the mystery that
                  surrounded the affair. Over one bit of information, reserved to the last by Miss
                  Gimp, they became excited; but it left them still in the dark.
               "Harry Wilkins saw the person who left the basket at Harding's door," said the
                  dressmaker.
               "What!"
               "I was talking with Harry Wilkins last evening, and he says, that on the night the
                  child was left at Harding's, he went to Beechwood. On the way, he met a woman
                  carrying a basket. She was young, and had something strange-looking about her. It
                  struck him that she was in trouble, for she seemed very irresolute—walking on for
                  a time hurriedly; then stopping as if in doubt; and once or twice turning back
                  toward Beechwood. His curiosity was excited, and he watched her for some time. On
                  his return, he met her again, but without the basket. He passed very close to
                  her—close enough to get a glimpse of her face, which he says looked like the face
                  of one in deep distress."
               "And she came from Beechwood?" said Mrs. Jarvis, breathing deeply.
               "She came from that direction, Harry says."
               "The child's mother, no doubt. What a wretch she must be! From Beechwood? That's
                  something to know. I've got a cousin living in Beechwood, and I'll go over and see
                  her this very blessed week. I shouldn't wonder if she could trace the whole
                  affair."
               Saying this, Mrs. Jarvis arose, and made a movement to go, at which Miss Gimp
                  remarked that she must run home also, as she had promised a dress on that very
                  day, and the scissors were not into it yet. Nearly five minutes elapsed before all
                  their parting words were said; then they
                  separated, with mutual promises to sift the matter more closely, and to
                  communicate, one to another, any thing new that might happen to be learned.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               A WEEK passed, and, notwithstanding Mrs. Willits, in league with Miss Gimp and
                  Mrs. Jarvis, had been all eye and all ear, so to speak, yet they had not been able
                  to learn any thing satisfactory to themselves about the stranger babe. Each of the
                  ladies had, during the time, made a call upon Mrs. Harding, and each came away,
                  more strongly confirmed in her first conclusion, that she knew a great deal more
                  about the child than she had cared to tell. As for the babe itself, there could be
                  but one opinion. Miss Gimp said it was "lovely;" and when she spoke of an infant
                  so decidedly, you might be sure there was something about it more than common.
               Meantime, singular changes were progressing in the home where the little offcast
                  had found an asylum—changes that as much surprised the inmates as those who looked
                  on from a distance. Grace had won all hearts from the beginning; even selfish,
                  rude, ill-natured Andrew, who had been the pest of the family, stood subdued and
                  gentle in her presence. Before she came, his greatest delight was in annoying and
                  oppressing the other children; now his chief pleasure consisted in holding the
                  babe, carrying her about, or playing with her as she lay in the cradle. So
                  attentive was he, that Mrs. Harding scarcely perceived any new demand upon her
                  time, in consequence of so important an addition to her family. Left more to
                  themselves, by the diversion of Andrew's attention, the other children—whose
                  almost incessant strife owed its origin mainly to their older brother's
                  interference—rarely gave way to a wrangling spirit. When it did occur, a word from
                  their mother subdued their angry feelings.
               Often and often did the hands of Mrs. Harding pause in her work, as she thought
                  intently on this new order of things, and wondered how it was, that a single word
                  could calm the stormy passions of her children, when only a little while before,
                  nothing but a more violent storm on her part could allay the tempest on theirs.
                  How greatly she was herself changed, did not come with clearness into her
                  apprehension—changed, we mean, in her external aspects; for, internally, no real
                  change had yet taken place: there was only the beginning of a change. Nor was she
                  aware how different were her words and manner of speaking, when addressing her
                  children, to what they were a little while before.
               One thing the children did not fail to notice. It was this: the marked difference
                  in their mother when Grace was awake and in the sitting-room, and when she was
                  asleep in the adjoining chamber. She was always gentler and more forbearing toward
                  them when the babe was present than when absent. Nor did Mrs. Harding fail to
                  remark, that the children were more gentle and obedient when Grace was in the room
                  with them than when she was sleeping.
               Quite as remarkable was the change in Mr. Harding. He never came in, now, with a
                  heavy, horse-like tread, nor banged the door behind him, as had been his custom.
                  Nor did he reprove the children, when in fault, with his former angry violence.
                  Always he went first to look at the babe, as if that were uppermost in his
                  thoughts. And what seemed to please him particularly, was the fact, that little Grace began to flutter
                  her tiny hands the moment he appeared, and never seemed better satisfied than when
                  in his arms. Not once, since she came to them, like a gift from heaven, as she
                  was, had he left home in the evening, to spend his time at the tavern. In his
                  favour it may be said, that his associations at the tavern had never presented a
                  very strong attraction; and he had only gone there, because every thing in the
                  home-sphere, owing to the incongruities of temper between him and his wife, was
                  disagreeable and repulsive.
               We have omitted thus far to mention that Jacob Harding was a carpenter by trade.
                  His shop stood at no great distance from the store of Willits the grocer, and not
                  far from the tavern kept by a worthless fellow named Stark, who was doing more
                  harm in the neighbourhood in a single month than he had ever done good in his
                  life. The absence of Harding from the bar-room of Stark, for so many consecutive
                  evenings, did not fail to excite the tavern-keeper's attention, who, not liking to
                  lose so good a customer, made it his business to call in at the shop of Harding,
                  and in a familiar, hale-fellow, well-met sort of a way, inquire if he had been
                  sick. This was about a week after the appearance of little Grace in the
                  carpenter's family. Harding answered in the negative, and with a slight coldness
                  of manner.
               "What's the matter, then?" said Stark. "Any thing wrong at home?"
               "Nothing."
               "We wanted you, particularly, last night. Tom Ellis, from Beechwood, and Jack
                  Fleming, from Avondale, were both here. They had a jolly time of it, I can tell
                  you; and if they asked for you once, they did a dozen times. You don't know what
                  you lost. They're coming over again this evening. You must be sure and meet them,
                  for I promised that you would be on hand."
               "You were a little too fast in that," said Harding, as he tightened the blade in
                  his jack-plane, and then sighted the edge to see if it was at the true cutting
                  distance.
               "Why so?" asked Stark.
               "Because I shall not be there."
               "And why not, pray?"
               "Because I'm better off, and better contented, at home," was replied.
               "Tied to your wife's apron-string."
               This was said pleasantly, yet with just enough of sarcasm to touch the quick
                  feelings of Harding, without giving offence.
               "I never was tied to a woman's apron-string in my life, and never except to be.
                  Mary Harding knows me far too well to attempt any thing of that kind."
               The tavern-keeper shrugged his shoulders, and arched his coarse eyebrows in a way
                  that said, "I can believe as much of that as I please."
               The quick temper of Harding took fire, and he was about making a sharp retort;
                  but, singularly enough, the image of little Grace came suddenly before the eyes of
                  his mind, and something in her innocent face subdued and tranquillized him.
               "Look here, Harding." Stark spoke in a coarse, rough way. "What's this I hear
                  about somebody's brat being left at your door? Is it so?—or only Gimp-gossip?"
               "A young babe was left at my door," Harding answered, coldly, and, at the same
                  time, commenced driving his plane over a rough board that lay on his
                  work-bench.
               "You don't tell me so! Well, what have you done with it?"
               "Kept it."
               "Kept it! You're joking! I thought you had a house full of your own—more than you could get
                  bread for without making a slave of yourself,"
               Harding felt annoyed, as well at the tavern-keeper's words as his manner, and an
                  angry retort was on his tongue. But he controlled himself, and merely answered,
                  with assumed indifference—
               "We haven't found it in the way, so far."
               "Whose is it?" inquired Stark, still in his rude manner.
               "Don't know'" replied Harding.
               "Why don't you send it to the poor-house? I'd do it in less than no time."
               "When we are tired of keeping it, perhaps we will do so."
               Stark began now to see that his way of speaking to the carpenter was not
                  altogether relished; and, as it was by no means his interest to offend one of his
                  customers, he changed, somewhat, his manner of addressing him. But he failed
                  altogether in his effort to restore the old state of feeling that had existed
                  between them.
               From the shop of Harding, Stark went to the store of Mr. Willits, where he bought
                  a barrel of sugar and a bag of coffee. He was about the only man in the
                  neighbourhood whose pocket-book was sufficiently well filled to warrant the
                  purchase of groceries in such liberal quantities.
               "Make out the bill and receipt it," said he, in a self-satisfied voice.
               "I like that," was the pleasant response of the storekeeper. "I wish all my
                  customers were as ready to put the cash down.'
               "Pay as you go—that is my motto." returned Stark. "You'll not find my name on
                  anybody's books."
               "It's the safest kind of a motto, and one that I shall have to suggest to two or
                  three people about here, even should I offend them." said Willits. "Harding, for
                  instance, between you and me."
               "Jacob Harding! Why, is he running behindhand?"
               The storekeeper, before answering, threw open his ledger, and, after glancing
                  rapidly along a column of figures on one of the pages, said—
               "Yes; to the tune of a hundred dollars in six months."
               "Whew! And he's the man that takes in stray babies? He can afford to be
                  generous—at your expense."
               "Not any longer. Thank you for that hint. I'll act upon it at once."
               And so he did; for, at that moment, Andrew Harding entered the store, with a
                  wooden pail in his hand, and said that his mother had sent him for six pounds of
                  flour and two pounds of sugar.
               "Have you brought the money?" asked Willits.
               "No, sir. Mother says, charge it."
               "Tell your mother that I can't charge any thing more."
               The boy looked bewildered. He did not clearly understand the storekeeper.
               "Tell your mother that she must send the money. I can't trust any more."
               Andrew retired slowly, his mind in considerable perplexity, and bore the message
                  to his mother.
               "That's right," said Stark, approvingly. "It's the only safe way to do business. I
                  rather think Harding will be as mad as a March hare. You may look out for a squall
                  before night."
               "Let it come; I'm not at all concerned," replied Willits.
               "I hope," said Stark, growing serious, "that nothing I have said has caused you to
                  take this stand with Harding. "We've
                  always been on good terms; and I wouldn't say any thing to injure him for the
                  world."
               "Oh, no. My mind was pretty well made up before you came in. That baby business
                  decided me. Mrs. Willits and I were talking it over last night, and we both came
                  to the conclusion that, if he couldn't make both ends meet before, there was no
                  hope for him now. We did think, at first, that a money inducement caused him to
                  keep the child; but Mrs. Harding assured my wife, yesterday, that not a farthing
                  came with it, nor was promised at any future time. If they are fools enough to
                  take up a burden like this, they mustn't expect me to bear it for them."
               "This refusal on your part may do them good," said Stark. "It will, at least, open
                  their eyes to their true position. I rather think the child will find its way into
                  the poor-house before it is a week older."
               "I don't care where it goes, or what becomes of it," answered the storekeeper, "so
                  I get my money."
               Soon after Stark left the shop of Jacob Harding, the latter put on his coat and
                  hat, and went over to the house of a farmer, named Lee, about a quarter of a mile
                  distant. This Lee, a rather thriftless sort of a man, who spent far too large a
                  portion of his time and money at Stark's tavern, owed the carpenter a hundred and
                  fifty dollars for new roofing his house, and doing sundry repairs to his
                  dilapidated old barn. The account had been standing for some months. On the
                  payment of this money, Harding had intended settling his bill at the grocer's. The
                  manner of Willits, on the day before, when he had called to get half a pound of
                  tea and some corn meal, annoyed him considerably. He saw that the storekeeper was
                  getting uneasy at the size of his account, which, but for the failure to procure a
                  settlement with Lee, would have been long since paid off. He had brooded over this
                  until a sort of desperate feeling took possession of him; and, in this state of
                  mind, he went over to see the farmer.
               "Can't do any thing for you," said Lee, in the coolest way imaginable, on
                  Harding's asking for a settlement. "Haven't ten dollars in cash to bless myself
                  with, let alone a hundred and fifty."
               Harding felt exceedingly fretted at this way of treating him, and said, quite
                  sharply—
               "Pray, Mr. Lee, when do you intend settling my account?"
               "Some of these days," replied the farmer, indifferently.
               "That way of doing business don't suit me. I want something definite. I paid the
                  cash down for the shingles that cover your roof; and now I want my money."
               "Don't get excited, Harding: it won't do any good," said Lee. "The man doesn't
                  live about here that can drive this horse; so you needn't try."
               This was more than the carpenter could bear. Bitterly did he retort upon the
                  farmer, and left him, finally, with threats of an immediate resort to law for the
                  recovery of his bill.
               When Harding and his wife met at dinner-time, each perceived in the other's
                  countenance a troubled aspect. Harding's heavy brows were drawn down; and about
                  his wife's mouth was the old look of fretfulness that had so often repelled him.
                  For the first time, he passed the cradle without even looking at Grace, whose
                  round, white arms had commenced flying the moment she heard the sound of his
                  footsteps across the threshold; and, going into the yard, he took up the axe, and
                  commenced splitting up a stick of cord wood. This done, he came back into the
                  house, again passing the cradle, and sitting down, in moody silence, at the
                  dinner-table, on which their meal had already been served. While cutting up the meat, and helping it around, the
                  low, sweet, coaxing murmur of the baby's voice sounded in his ears. The cradle was
                  only a little way from him, and so turned that Grace could-see-him. And there she
                  lay, fluttering her arms, and cooing, and trying all means in her power to arrest
                  his attention. Yet, resolutely, he kept his eyes turned away from the imploring
                  little one. But weaker, each moment, became his resolution; for her voice came to
                  his ears like the music of David's harp to Saul, driving out the evil spirit. At
                  last he could resist the babe's pleadings no longer. Almost stealthily, he turned
                  his eyes upon her. One look was enough. The tenderness of a mother filled his
                  heart. So sudden was the revulsion of his feelings, that, for a few moments, he
                  was bewildered. But of one thing he was soon clearly conscious, and that was of
                  having Grace in his arms, and hugging her almost passionately to his heart.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE suddenness with which Harding arose from the table and caught up the child,
                  which he had not seemed to notice since he came in, and the eager way in which he
                  held it to his heart, naturally excited the surprise of his wife, who looked at
                  him wonderingly. His indifference toward Grace had not been unobserved by Mrs.
                  Harding. She saw that he was in one of his unhappy moods—that a dark cloud was on
                  his spirit—and that only a word was needed to awaken a fierce storm. And, more
                  than all this, the message brought from the storekeeper by Andrew had so deeply
                  angered her, that her mind was still panting under the excitement, and still
                  fretting itself with indignant thoughts; so that she, too, was ready for strife.
                  It had been as much as she could do to keep back from her lips words of sharp
                  reproof, for the cruel indifference manifested by her husband toward the pleading
                  babe: most probably, a few minutes longer of forced neglect on his part, would
                  have brought down upon him a storm of words that would have marred every thing for
                  little Grace, and made her presence, in the household, ever after, a cause of
                  angry contention. Happily, the quick-tempered wife controlled her struggling
                  impulses long enough for better influences to prevail. As she looked at the
                  singular exhibition of feeling in her husband, she was touched by softer emotions.
                  The incident gave her a deeper insight into his character, while it quickened her
                  own thoughts into self-reproaches for the misjudgment which had wellnigh fanned a
                  few embers into fiercely burning flames of discord.
               
               As for Harding, now that the repressed tenderness of his heart had free course, he
                  found himself carried away as by a flood. The babe in his arms felt more precious
                  to him than life itself; and it seemed as if he could never be done hugging it to
                  his heart. When, at length, he reseated himself at the dinner-table, with Grace on
                  his knee, and looked over to his wife, the cloud had passed from her
                  countenance.
               "What possessed you," she said, smiling, and in a pleasant voice, "to neglect the
                  sweet child so? She was almost dying to have you notice her."
               Harding did not answer, but merely drew Grace close against him, and, bending
                  over, talked to her in fond, childish language.
               A calm followed this little exciting episode, in which both Mr. and Mrs. Harding
                  looked and felt sober, but not ill-natured. After dinner, as Harding was preparing
                  to leave the house, he took some silver change from his pocket, and handing it to
                  his wife, said—
               "Our bill at the store is getting rather large. Don't send for any thing without
                  the money. Here are two dollars and a half for any little thing you may want."
               The change in his wife's countenance as he said this arrested Harding's
                  attention.
               "What's the matter?" he asked, abruptly.
               "Nothing much," she replied, her face flushing as she spoke. "Only I'm glad you've
                  left me some money, for we're out of flour, and—and"——
               "And what?" She paused, stammering, and Harding saw that something was wrong.
               "Nothing, only Willits sent word this morning, that he wouldn't let us have any
                  thing more, unless we paid the money down!"
               "He did!" A fierce light burned instantly in the eye of Jacob Harding, and his
                  lips were drawn back against his teeth.
               "Yes," said his wife, forcing herself to speak in a mild and soothing way; "but no
                  matter, Jacob. Let us try to get on without asking for credit anywhere. I'll do my
                  best to economize in every thing. It chafes me to be under obligations to anybody,
                  and especially to the Willits. I don't like any of the family."
               "That's talking outright, Mary!" said Harding, the threatening scowl on his heavy
                  brow suddenly breaking away; and, as he spoke, he thrust his hand a second time
                  into his trousers pocket, and drew out a handful of small change, which he counted
                  over.
               "Here are three dollars more," he added. "It's all the money I have Just now, and
                  may be all I shall receive this week. Make it go as far as you can."
               "You may be sure I will do that, Jacob," replied his wife, kindly and
                  earnestly.
               "Wouldn't trust us any more!" Harding's mind returned to this hard, unpleasant,
                  mortifying fact. "Very well—so let it be. He's had a good deal of my money in his
                  time—I hardly think he will get as much in the future. Don't you buy any thing
                  there that you can do without. The next time I go over to Beechwood, I will lay in
                  a good stock of things, if I happen to have the money. I saw Lee to-day, and tried
                  to get him to settle that bill of his; but he put me off again, and is more
                  indifferent about it than ever. I got out of all patience, and threatened to put
                  the sheriff on him. It will have to come to this sooner or later; and the quicker
                  it is done, the quicker I shall get my money."
               "Couldn't you trade off the account to Willits, and thus save a world of trouble?"
                  suggested the wife.
               Mr. Harding caught at this suggestion, and, after turning it over in his mind for
                  a few moments, said—
               "I don't know, Mary, but that might be done. Now that I come to think of it, I
                  remember hearing somebody say that Willits was about buying that house and acre lot where Jones lives. You know it
                  belongs to Mr. Lee. There's no doubt in the world but that he could settle my
                  account in the transaction. I'll see him about it this very afternoon."
               "Do, Jacob," answered his wife, encouragingly. "It will be such a relief to have
                  this all off our minds."
               In spite of his indignation against Willits, Harding went direct to his store. The
                  latter, on seeing him enter, made up his mind for a sharp passage of words with
                  the fiery tempered carpenter. Still, he managed to receive him with a forced
                  smile.
               "How much have you against me on your books?" inquired Harding, speaking firmly,
                  and with a sober countenance, yet repressing, as far as possible, all appearance
                  of anger.
               The storekeeper, affecting a pleasant manner, turned over his ledger, and,
                  glancing at the account, which was already footed up, replied—
               "One hundred and fourteen dollars."
               "So much as that?" Harding showed surprise.
               "I will make you out a bill of items, day and date, and you can examine the
                  account. I presume you will find every charge correct."
               "I expected to have paid this long ago," said the carpenter, "but have been
                  disappointed in getting a large bill. To-day I tried my best to collect, but I'm
                  afraid there's no chance for me, unless I go to law and I don't want to do
                  that."
               "Whose account is it?" inquired Willits.
               'The one I have against Lee for roofing his house, and repairing his barn."
               "Is it possible he hasn't paid that yet?"
               "Not a cent of it."
               The storekeeper looked serious for a few moments, then, shaking his head, he
                  remarked—
               "That's not right in Lee."
               "No, it is not right," said Harding, warmly. "If he had paid me, I would not now
                  be in debt a single dollar."
               "Have you any objection to transferring your account to me?" Willits hesitated a
                  little, as if fearful the proposition would not be received with favour. "I have
                  some business transactions with Lee, in which, most probably, I could manage to
                  include your bill."
               "The very thing I thought of proposing to you," said Harding. "I understand you
                  are about buying the property now occupied by Jones; and it has occurred to me
                  that you might save my account in the purchase, thus obliging me and getting a
                  settlement of your own bill at the same time."
               "It can all be done, no doubt," replied the storekeeper. "Lee has offered the
                  house and grounds at a fair price, and is anxious for me to buy—so anxious, that a
                  proposition to take your claim against him in part payment will be no impediment
                  to the bargain. The best way for you to proceed will be to get his note in
                  settlement. He'll give that readily enough, in order to gain time, and get rid of
                  the annoyance of being dunned. This note you can endorse to me, and I will pay it
                  over to him."
               Perfectly satisfactory to both parties was the proposed arrangement, and the two
                  men separated in much better humour with themselves and each other than when they
                  met. During the afternoon, Harding called again on Mr. Lee, who readily acceded to
                  his request, and gave him his note, at six months, in settlement of the
                  account.
               "Pleasant news, Mary," said the carpenter, as he came home at sundown. "My name is
                  off of Willits' books."
               "Off of his books! How, Jacob?" Mrs. Harding did not see his meaning clearly.
               
               "I've settled his account."
               "Have you? Oh! I'm so glad."
               "And better still, Mary: he owes me thirty-six dollars, which I have agreed to
                  take out of his store, as we want things in his line."
               "It is pleasant news, indeed; Jacob. But how did all this come to
                  pass?"
               "Just in the way you suggested. Willits has taken my bill against Lee, and
                  credited me with the difference between that and the account on his books."
               "Oh! I am so glad: it has taken such a load off of me," said Mrs. Harding. "I
                  don't believe Mr. Lee would ever have paid the bill without your suing him; and I
                  dread lawsuits above every thing: they always bring trouble to both sides."
               Already, Grace was in the great, strong arms of the carpenter; and Lotty, between
                  whom and her father a new and gentler relation had existed ever since the
                  stranger-babe came to them, was leaning on his knee and playing with the happy
                  little one.
               At this moment, a form darkened the door. It was the form of a woman, just past
                  life's middle age. Her countenance was strongly marked—the lines as indicative of
                  patient endurance as great suffering. She was tall in person, with the carriage of
                  one who had moved in polished circles.
               "Can you tell me," said she, as she advanced one foot inside of the door, "how far
                  it is to Beechwood?"
               "Nearly two miles, ma'am," replied Mrs. Harding, who had turned, on perceiving the
                  presence of a stranger.
               "So far away?" said the woman, in apparent concern. "I can't possibly reach there
                  before dark."
               You certainly cannot," replied Mrs. Harding. She then added, "Won't you come in
                  and rest yourself?"
               "Thank you," returned the stranger, stepping across the threshold, and advancing a
                  few paces into the room.
               "What a dear, sweet babe!" she said, as, on taking a chair, she fixed her eyes,
                  with a tender, admiring gaze, upon the babe that still remained in Harding's arms.
                  She could not have offered a remark better calculated to make a favourable
                  impression on the minds of the carpenter and his wife.
               "what is her name?" she asked, after a moment's pause.
               "We call her Grace," replied Mrs. Harding, all her countenance lit up with
                  pleasure.
               "Grace—Grace." said the woman, half speaking to herself, in an abstracted way. "A
                  beautiful name," she added; "none more beautiful." And then she bent forward, and
                  gazed at the child with such an earnest, tender expression, that Mrs. Harding, who
                  was observing her intently, felt a troubled consciousness that she knew something
                  of the child, and did not now look upon it for the first time in her life.
               There was about the stranger a bearing that inspired involuntary respect. Her
                  calm, intelligent eyes looked into those of the carpenter and his wife in a way
                  that caused them to feel a singular deference; and when she referred again to the
                  long distance she had still to go, and spoke, in a troubled voice, of the
                  gathering darkness, Harding said, looking at his wife—
               "If the lady will accept what poor accommodations our house will afford, she need
                  not go to Beechwood to-night. What say you, Mary?"
               "She is welcome to the best we have to give," was the answer of Mrs. Harding.
               "I did not expect this," said the woman, evidently touched by the proffered
                  hospitality; "nor do I know whether it will be altogether right for me to trespass
                     on your kindness. If there is a
                  respectable tavern in the neighbourhood"——
               Harding shook his head, as he answered—
               "There is no tavern about here but Stark's, and I couldn't advise you to go there.
                  If you will remain in our poor home, believe yourself entirely welcome."
               "Let me take your bonnet and shawl," said Mrs. Harding, encouragingly; and she
                  reached out her hands to receive them.
               The woman hesitated only a moment, and then removing her bonnet and shawl, gave
                  them to her hostess, who took them into the adjoining chamber. As Mrs. Harding
                  returned to the apartment she had just left, she was struck with the singular
                  beauty of the woman's countenance—bearing though it did the marks of time—as well
                  as by the depth and brilliancy of her eyes, that were fixed, almost as if by
                  fascination, on the infant which still lay against the bosom of her husband.
               All parties were now, for a time, in a state of embarrassment. Harding felt a
                  little uncomfortable in the presence of the woman, whose eyes, whenever they
                  rested upon him, seemed as if trying to read his very thoughts; and the stranger,
                  conscious of the effect her entrance had produced, did not feel altogether at
                  ease.
               "Let me have that dear babe," said the woman, reaching out her hands toward
                  Grace.
               The little one shrunk closer against the breast of Harding, while a shade, almost
                  of fear, darkened her face.
               "Won't you come?"
               The woman spoke in soft and winning tones, and still extended her hands; but the
                  babe could not be lured from its place.
               At this moment, Andrew came in, rudely, dashing his hat upon the floor, and
                  pushing his sister Lucy aside so roughly as almost to throw her down. Lucy gave an
                  angry scream at this violence, and called her brother some vile name. The woman
                  turned, half startled, at this sudden outbreak, and fixed her dark, penetrating
                  eyes on Andrew, who, now first conscious of the presence of a stranger, became
                  quiet, and shrunk away into the farther part of the room, the eyes of the woman
                  still following him.
               "Is that the place for your hat, sir?"
               Anger, as well as mortification, caused Harding to speak roughly to the boy. The
                  woman seemed quite as much startled by the voice of the father as she had been by
                  the rudeness of the son. The look she threw upon him was timid—almost fearful; and
                  her eyes passed rapidly from his dark, threatening face, to the calm, sweet,
                  confiding countenance of the infant, who seemed not in the least disturbed by the
                  sudden gust of passion which had come sweeping over the little household.
               Andrew looked sulky and stubborn for a few moments only; then he returned to the
                  place where his hat lay upon the floor, and taking it up, hung it upon a nail. In
                  the next minute he stood beside the baby, who, the instant she saw him, arose from
                  her reclining position, reached out her little hands to him, and almost springing
                  into his arms, gave voice to her pleasure and affection in sounds as well
                  understood as if the utterance had been in words. Andrew bore her in a sort of
                  triumph about the room; while the stern features of his father gradually relaxed,
                  as his eyes followed the happy babe, until no trace remained therein of the anger
                  which disfigured it a little while before. Lucy, too, forgot her indignation
                  against Andrew, and, moving close beside her brother, clapped her hand at Grace,
                  and talked to her with a voice so full of tenderness, that the stranger looked at
                  her in wonder, hardly crediting the fact that she was the same little girl who,
                  scarcely a moment before, had startled her with a shrill cry of anger.
               
               Silent, yet attentively observant of all that passed, did the visiter now remain,
                  until supper was ready, and she was invited to join the family in their evening
                  meal.
               "Do you reside in Beechwood?" inquired Harding, addressing the stranger, soon
                  after they had gathered around the table.
               "No, sir," was her simple answer, somewhat coolly made, as though she wished to
                  repel inquiry.
               "You have friends there?" said Harding, who, as he observed the stranger more
                  narrowly, felt his curiosity in regard to her increasing. Particularly did her
                  manner of looking at the child excite his attention: to him it seemed as if she
                  made an effort to conceal the interest really felt by her in the little one.
               "Yes, I have friends there," she replied; and then said, almost in the same
                  breath, "How old is your little Grace?"
               Harding looked at his wife, and she looked at him. Both seemed taken by surprise
                  at the question; and both were slightly confused.
               "How old is it, Mary?" asked Harding.
               "About nine weeks," replied Mrs. Harding, her face receiving a shade of colour as
                  she spoke.
               The stranger looked at her intently. Mrs. Harding's eyes fell under the steady
                  gaze.
               "A bright child for nine weeks old." remarked the woman.
               Then she seemed to lose herself in thought, and once or twice sighed deeply. After
                  the supper-table was cleared away, and the children were all in bed, her manner
                  underwent a change. She was now entirely at her ease, and conversed in so
                  attractive a way with the carpenter and his wife, that both found themselves
                  strangely drawn toward her, and ready to answer freely in regard to their personal
                  affairs, about which she inquired with an interest they felt to be genuine. About
                  people in the neighbourhood she also asked questions; and when reference was made
                  to Stark the tavern-keeper, she spoke strongly of the danger of visiting such
                  houses as he kept.
               "It gratified me more than I can express," she said, looking at Harding, "to find
                  you at home, during the evening, with your family. There is every thing to hope,
                  for a sober, industrious man. Your struggle with the world may be hard for a time,
                  but keep a brave heart. With temperance, industry, and frugality at home, you are
                  sure to rise above your present position. It is our first meeting, and it may be
                  our last; but if we ever do meet again, I shall expect to find that Andrew Harding
                  has taken a long stride in the way of prosperity."
               There was more in her manner than in her words that impressed the mind of the
                  carpenter. But no matter in which lay the influence, Harding felt new purposes
                  growing up in his heart; and he even said to himself, "If ever we do meet again,
                  it shall be as you predict."
               At an early hour, Mr. and Mrs. Harding retired, after having shown their guest to
                  the little spare room kept for visitors.
               "I must have one look at that dear babe of yours," she said, as she was about
                  leaving them for the night.
               Mrs. Harding led her into her own chamber, where Grace was sleeping, and drew down
                  the bed-clothes from the face of the infant. The woman bent low over it, and, for
                  a time that seemed long to Mrs. Harding, stood gazing upon the calm face before
                  her, so full of heavenly innocence. There were tears on her lashes, when, with a
                  deep, quivering sigh, she lifted herself from the babe. Placing a hand on the
                  shoulder of Mrs. Harding, and raising a
                  finger slowly upward, she said, in a tone so solemn, that it thrilled to the heart
                  of her auditor—
               "God has committed to your care one of the precious ones whose angels are ever
                  before his face. Oh! never forget your high responsibility. Love, cherish, keep
                  the dear one."
               The woman's voice faltered. She made an attempt to say more; but, as if conscious
                  that she was betraying too much feeling, turned away quickly, and retired to the
                  little chamber that had been assigned to her.
               On the next morning, breakfast was all ready, ere the stranger joined the
                  family.
               "Had you not better call her?" said Harding to his wife.
               Mrs. Harding stepped to the door of the guest-chamber, and tapped-lightly. She
                  tapped a second time, for there was neither movement nor reply; yet all remained
                  silent. A louder summons was answered only by its own echo.
               Wondering at this, Mrs. Harding lifted the latch, and pushed open the door.
               "There is no one here, Andrew," she said, in a startled voice.
               "No one, Mary!"
               "Even the bed is not tumbled! What can it mean?"
               The carpenter now stood beside his wife, and both entered the room together. There
                  was no evidence whatever that any one had passed the night there. On the little
                  dressing-table was a narrow slip of white paper, which Mrs. Harding caught up. On
                  it was written simply these words—
               "Grace Harding. Ten weeks old to-day. June 4th, 18—."
               "It is very strange!" said the carpenter, with a look of doubt and wonder on his
                  countenance.
               "Very strange!" echoed his wife, in a troubled voice.
               "Who can she be?"
               "One," answered Mrs. Harding, "who knows all about our little Grace. I felt that
                  it was so last night."
               And weak, pale, and trembling, she sunk into a chair.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE sudden appearance of the woman, her singular conduct, and mysterious
                  departure, were new facts in the strange series of events, that were almost
                  bewildering the minds of Mr. and Mrs. Harding. Something in this woman's manner
                  had strongly impressed them both, and now, when they thought of her, it was with a
                  certain sense of constraint, as if she were present, and closely observing their
                  actions. That she bore some kind of relationship to the babe was no longer a
                  question in their thoughts; and it was equally clear, that her visit was by no
                  means accidental or purposeless.
               A pressure upon the feelings was a natural consequence; not so much a troubled
                  pressure, as a certain thoughtful sobriety, favourable to self-control, and
                  productive of wiser counsels in the minds of both the carpenter and his
                  quick-tempered wife. Each had need of a preparation like this, for the day was to
                  prove one of more than ordinary trial.
               From some cause, Andrew, their oldest boy, naturally of an exceedingly perverse
                  temper, was ill-natured and quarrelsome
                  beyond his wont, on this particular morning. Since rising, he had not ceased to
                  interfere with Lucy and Philip, and this created a strife among the three, which
                  the mother vainly sought to subdue. Not until the father, with a stern threat and
                  a smart blow, commanded the overbearing lad to cease from his annoyance of his
                  brother and sister, was the discord abated. And then the evil in the boy's heart
                  remained strong as ever. Only the fear of instant punishment kept down the spirit
                  of rebellion.
               Soon after his father left for the shop, his mother said to him—
               "Andrew, go over to the store, and get me two pounds of sugar and two pounds of
                  rice; and go quickly, for it's nearly school-time now."
               "Where's the money?" Andrew spoke very rudely.
               "Never mind the money," said Mrs. Harding. "Go and do as I tell you."
               "'Taint no use. Mr. Willits said yesterday that you needn't send for trust any
                  more."
               "Go, this minute, you little"——
               The angry mother caught the profane epithet just leaping from her tongue, and kept
                  it back from utterance.
               "'Taint no use, I tell you," persisted Andrew. "He said"——
               "Off with you, this instant!"
               And Mrs. Harding, unable to restrain her indignation, made two or three rapid
                  strides toward the boy, who, seeing from her face that he was in danger, darted
                  from the house, and went away toward the store. After being gone long enough to
                  have done the errand twice, he came loitering back, without the articles for which
                  he had been sent.
               "Where's the sugar and rice?" asked his mother, looking at him sternly, as he came
                  in.
               "I told you so," was his irritating reply.
               "Told me what?" said Mrs. Harding.
               "Why, that you needn't send there for trust any more."
               "Have you been to Mr. Willits'?" asked his mother, growing suddenly calm, and
                  speaking very firmly.
               "Yes, ma'am, I have," was the unhesitating answer.
               "And you saw Mr. Willits?"
               "Yes, ma'am."
               "And asked him for the sugar and rice?"
               "Yes, ma'am."
               "What did he say?"
               "He wanted to know where my money was; and when I said I had none, he told me to
                  go home and tell you that he didn't charge things any more."
               All this was spoken by Andrew with a steady voice and eye, and in a manner that
                  but ill concealed a spirit of triumph.
               For a little while, a tempest of indignant anger raged in the breast of Mrs.
                  Harding.
               "He'll be sorry for that, or I am not a living woman!" she muttered to herself, as
                  soon as a little self-possession was obtained, and thought ran partially clear
                  once more. "Here's the money," she added, aloud, speaking to Andrew, as she drew
                  from her pocket some change; "go back, as swift as your legs will carry you, and
                  get two pounds of rice and two pounds of sugar."
               The boy took the money, and went loitering indifferently away; but, ere he had
                  gone ten paces, a switch was laid smartly over his shoulders by his mother, who
                  could no longer control her anger against him. The effect was all she wished to
                  produce. He sprung from her like a frightened young deer, and ran the whole
                  distance to the store. In returning, he resumed the old pace, and managed to get back at least half an hour
                  after school-time.
               "It's so late, mother, can't I stay at home to-day?" This was his response to a
                  hurried order to start off immediately for school. "Mr. Long will keep me in."
               "I don't care if he does. It will serve you right. No; you can't stay home."
               The lad threw himself down on the door-step, and began to cry.
               Poor Mrs. Harding! Notwithstanding the influence of recent events, the causes of
                  irritation were too many and too strong for her. Almost since daylight had this
                  perverse boy been making assaults upon her patience. Several times she had lost
                  the self-control she was struggling to maintain, and given way to bursts of
                  passion, and as often had she striven to force back into quietude the disturbed
                  impulses that darkened her spirit. Now, her pent-up anger blazed forth like a
                  fierce flame. Seizing a stout switch, she sprung toward Andrew, and commenced
                  lashing him with all her strength. Her countenance was that of a fury. For a short
                  time, Andrew, who had great powers of endurance, bore the smarting strokes,
                  thinking to tire his mother out; but in this he was mistaken. She was possessed of
                  cruel spirits; and, in the blind passion with which they inspired her, would have
                  struck on, even to the endangering of his life. At last, with a yell of pain, that
                  sounded more like the cry of some animal than a human being, Andrew started up
                  from the door-step, and ran off beyond the reach of his mother's arm.
               "Now, away to school with you, or I'll give you as much more!" cried Mrs. Harding,
                  as she advanced resolutely toward the place where Andrew paused on getting out of
                  her way.
               Finding that contention with his mother, under present circumstances, was rather
                  too serious a business, Andrew yielded to forces he was not able to resist, and
                  started off to school, conquered, but not subdued in spirit. The fire of his
                  mother's anger had hardened instead of softening him. Rebellion grew rank in his
                  young breast, as he moved on his way; and no sooner was he out of sight, than he
                  sat down on the roadside to deliberate on the question of going to school or
                  playing the truant.
               It was some time after Mrs. Harding returned into the house, before she was
                  sufficiently calm to reflect at all. The storm, though brief, had raged fiercely,
                  and sad were the wrecks it left behind—wrecks of peace and good resolutions. Never
                  in her life had she suffered such intense mental pain as now—never experienced a
                  state of mind so sad and self-condemnatory. New and better states had been
                  forming, and they had brought her within the sphere of higher and holier
                  influences. It was violence to these that occasioned such anguish of spirit. Good,
                  having gained a place in her heart, might be overshadowed, but not cast out. When
                  the storm raged, it could retire and hide itself far down in the calmer depths of
                  her spirit, to come into perception again when the tempest abated. And thus it was
                  now. The good was hidden, not extinguished, and its low voice was heard as soon as
                  the wild shrieking of the storm was silent. It was not strong enough to contend
                  with evil when evil had full sway; but, like the sunshine and the gentle dews, it
                  possessed a restoring and creating power; and, like them, in the peaceful days and
                  quiet nights, it went on with its heavenly work of restoration and recreation.
               What a deep calm reigned in the household, as Mrs. Harding came back among her
                  younger children, who received her with frightened looks, and went shrinking away
                  into distant corners—a calmness which, by its contrast, only made more apparent
                  the wild, half-insane excitement citement
                  from which every nerve of her spirit was still palpitating. The revulsion in Mrs.
                  Harding's mind was great. The first rebuking image that arose in her thoughts was
                  that of the stranger, whose coming and departure were almost like the changes in a
                  dream. So vivid was this impression, that she almost expected to see the woman
                  enter, and fix upon her those deep, sad eyes, whose expression she could never
                  forget.
               An unwonted sound came now upon her ears. It arose from the cradle. The eyes of
                  Mrs. Harding sought instantly the child. Sweet one! There was a look of fear on
                  her baby face—grievingly her lip was curled—a low murmur of pain was audible.
               Tenderly, very tenderly, was the infant lifted from its cradle-bed; and lovingly,
                  was it pressed to the bosom of Mrs. Harding. Soothing words in soothing tones were
                  poured into its ears from lips that touched them softly.
               As Mrs. Harding sat with the babe held close against her heart, all the exciting
                  incidents of the previous half hour passed before her mind in rapid review. The
                  conduct of Andrew had been very bad, and he needed correction; but she could not
                  justify her own action in the case, nor quiet the voice of self-reproach. She saw
                  that the evil in her only excited the evil in him—that angry words hardened him
                  into stubborn resistance. She felt sad, too, as she thought of the cruel stripes
                  she had given him—stripes laid on with the full strength of her strong arm. In
                  angry resentment, not sorrowing love, had she grasped the rod, and its strokes
                  excited only a spirit of rebellion. Oh! how unhappy she felt—unhappy even to
                  weeping. Her indignation against the storekeeper was but a feeble flame now. She
                  felt too deeply humiliated in consequence of her own misdeeds to cherish anger
                  against others.
               "In this state of mind the morning passed. At twelve o'clock, Andrew came in from
                  school, gliding through the door silently, and with an evident desire to avoid
                  notice. Mrs. Harding said nothing. She was glad to see him subdued in spirit, and
                  felt more of pity toward the boy than anger. Her husband soon followed, as it was
                  dinner-time. His brow was clouded. Something had gone wrong with him during the
                  forenoon. Silently and moodily he sat at the table, eating hurriedly, and taking
                  no notice of any one. In a shorter time than usual, he finished the meal, and,
                  rising, was about leaving the house, when Mrs. Harding said—
               "Didn't you tell me to send to the store for any thing I might want?"
               "Certainly I did. Why?"
               "Because Willits refused to let me have some sugar and rice, this morning, without
                  the money."
               "Oh no! He couldn't have done that. There are thirty-six dollars to my account on
                  his books, as I told you."
               "Well, he did, then; and I had to send the money before I could get what I
                  wanted."
               Harding waited to hear no more. "I'll soon settle that!" he exclaimed, as he went
                  hurriedly from the house. A rapid walk of a few minutes brought him to the store
                  of Willits, into which he strode with a heavy, resolute tread.
               "What do you mean," was his angry interrogation, "by sending such messages to my
                  wife?" And, as he spoke, he confronted the storekeeper with a threatening
                  scowl.
               The latter was startled, as well he might be, for Harding was in a fierce mood of
                  mind, and stood before him with his hand clenched, and meditated violence in his
                  look and manner.
               "Say! What do you mean?" repeated Harding.
               "I sent no insulting message to your wife," said the storekeeper.
               
               "It's false! You did!" exclaimed Harding.
               "And I say that I did not," retorted Willits, whose reddening face showed his
                  rising anger.
               "Why didn't you send her the sugar and rice this morning?" said Harding.
               "I did send it," replied the storekeeper.
               "Not until she furnished the money."
               "I beg your pardon, neighbour Harding. Andrew came for two pounds of sugar and two
                  pound of rice, which I have charged in your account."
               "Didn't you refuse to let him have them without the money?"
               "No, sir, I did not. Haven't you a balance on my books in your favour? Here are
                  the articles charged."
               And Willits opened his day-book and pointed to the recent entry.
               "I don't understand this," said Harding, looking bewildered.
               "There's some mistake. Who told you that I refused to send these articles without
                  the money?"
               "I must see further into this. Can't comprehend it."
               And as the carpenter said this, he turned away abruptly, and went back home.
               "Mary," said he, "didn't you tell me that Willits refused to let you have the rice
                  and sugar to-day without the money?"
               "Yes, I did; and I had to send the money before I could get them."
               "He denies it, and has the sugar and rice both charged to me."
               "What!"
               "He says that he didn't refuse to let you have the articles without the
                  money."
               "Andrew!"
               Mrs. Harding called to her oldest boy, in a quick, peremptory voice, turning
                  around as she spoke; but there was no answer.
               "Andrew!" she called again.
               "He's gone to school, mother," said Lucy.
               "It isn't school-time yet."
               "But he's gone. I saw him put on his hat, and go out through the back gate a
                  little while after father went away."
               Mr. and Mrs. Harding looked at each other for a few moments in a kind of blank
                  amazement. To both came a dim foreshadowing of the truth.
               "Did Andrew bring you that message?" said Harding, in a stern voice.
               "He did; and then I gave him the money to get the things I wanted."
               "And he went back with it to the store?"
               "Yes."
               "That will do."
               How the heavy brow of the carpenter contracted! There was something savage in his
                  face.
               "He'll remember this while he has breath in his body," he said fiercely, as he
                  left the house.
               On his way to his shop, he called in again at the store of Willits, and, by a few
                  questions, satisfied all lingering doubts as to the guilt of Andrew.
               As soon as two o'clock came, he went to the school-house and asked for his
                  son.
               "He hasn't been here to-day," was the teacher's reply to his question.
               "Are you certain of that, Mr. Long?"
               Harding was not prepared for this.
               "Altogether certain," answered the schoolmaster. "Was Andrew here this morning?"
                  He now addressed the scholars.
               "No, sir"—"no, sir"—"no, sir"—ran all around the room.
               
               "Have any of the boys seen him?" inquired Mr. Long.
               "I saw him," spoke up one of the scholars, "as I came to school just now."
               "Where?"
               "Sitting on the fence over by Miller's woods."
               "Did you speak to him?" inquired the schoolmaster.
               "Yes, sir. I asked him what he was doing; and he said, 'Nothing.' Then I asked him
                  if he wasn't going to school; and he said, 'Maybe so—after a while.' As I walked
                  along, I saw him going over into Miller's woods."
               "That will do," said the schoolmaster. And then he directed two of the older boys
                  to go over to Miller's woods, and if they saw Andrew, to bring him to school.
               Harding went back to his shop in a state of profound agitation. A new cause of
                  anger against the boy was added—namely, the disgrace to himself of standing before
                  the assembled village children as the father of a boy who had meanly played the
                  truant.
               During the afternoon, every thing seemed to go wrong with the carpenter. A man for
                  whom he had done some work disappointed him in regard to the payment; while
                  another, for whom work had been promised at a certain time, rated him soundly for
                  not being up to the letter of his contract. Moreover, Stark the tavern-keeper
                  called in and abused him for having said, as reported to him, that he was doing
                  more harm to the neighbourhood than a gang of thieves. Maddened by this assault,
                  coming, as it did, upon his unbalanced state of mind, Harding threw a mallet at
                  his head, which, happily, glancing by, went smashing through a window. The
                  frightened tavern-keeper beat a hasty retreat.
               Toward evening, the teacher called in to say, that the boys sent for Andrew had
                  found him, and that he refused to return with them to school. This was the last
                  crushing pound laid on the carpenter's panting self-control. The savage
                  imprecation that fell from his lips, startled the teacher, who turned off from him
                  instantly, and went on his way, oppressed by a feeling of troubled concern.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               WHEN Jacob Harding came home from his shop a little after sundown, he was blind
                  with passion. The more he had thought of Andrew's conduct, the stronger had grown
                  his indignation against him; and he was now prepared to mete out to him a degree
                  of punishment cruel in the extreme. Grief for the evil he had done was not so
                  prominent a feeling with Harding, as anger at the boy for having dared to venture
                  upon the commission of such flagrant outrages. "Liar! thief! truant!" Such were
                  the bitter words that came, every few moments, through the excited father's shut
                  teeth, as he strode homeward. "That a boy of mine should be guilty of such
                  things!" he repeated over and over again. "A boy of mine to disgrace me in this
                  way!
               And he would stretch forth his arms, with his large hands gripped so tightly, that
                  the nails almost penetrated the callous skin, clutching, in imagination, the
                  guilty child.
               "Where's Andrew?" he asked, almost fiercely, as he entered the house.
               Mrs. Harding lifted to his her troubled face, and answered, in a sad voice—there
                  was no trace of anger about her—
               
               "I haven't seen him since dinner-time."
               "Not home yet?"
               "No."
               Harding passed through the house into the yard, where he cut from a tree a stout,
                  tough rod—far too stout and strong for his vigorous arm to wield in the
                  chastisement of a tender child—and returning with it, laid it in full sight of the
                  younger children, on a table.
               "A liar, a thief, and a truant!" he exclaimed, in a voice of angry excitement. "It
                  will be the sorriest day of his life! I just want to get my hands on him!"
               Mrs. Harding answered nothing. She too had felt strong anger toward the boy; but
                  as the day wore on, and imagination pictured him writhing in the cruel hands of
                  his passionate father, anger changed to yearning pity. Not that she felt like
                  excusing him, or even palliating his crime and disobedience; but in her heart
                  revived the mother's tenderness, and this made her perceive, clearly, that in a
                  blind indignation against the boy, his father would destroy the salutary effects
                  of punishment, through an excessive administration.
               Slowly crept on the dusky twilight, and thicker and thicker fell the evening
                  shadows, closing in nearer and nearer to the carpenter's dwelling, so that the
                  disturbed inmates, constantly on the watch for Andrew, found their circle of
                  vision growing momently narrower.
               And now, sharp flashes of lightning began to stream forth from a heavy bank of
                  cloud that lay piled up in the west, and the freshening winds rustled the leaves
                  in the old elms that stood around the humble cottage.
               "There's a gust rising!" said Mrs. Harding, in a troubled voice, going to the door
                  and gazing anxiously around. "Where is that unhappy boy?"
               "Skulking in some of the neighbours' houses," gruffly replied the husband. "But he
                  might as well come home first as last. He can't escape me."
               Mrs. Harding sighed, and was about retiring from the door, when a heavy peal of
                  distant thunder jarred on the air.
               "Oh! I wish he was home!" she said; "we're going to have a terrible storm."
               The thick bank of clouds had now covered so large a space in the west, that all
                  the sun's retiring beams were hidden, and darkness was closing around her heavy
                  curtains.
               "The storm will bring him home," was all the reply made by the father.
               "I wish, Jacob," said Mrs. Harding, after waiting for nearly half an hour longer,
                  during which time the heavy concussive thunder sounded nearer and nearer, "that
                  you would step over to Mrs. Aaron's, and see if Andrew is not there. He goes with
                  John Aaron a good deal, and it may be that he is loitering with him now, afraid to
                  come home."
               Harding made no answer, but took up his hat and went out. The dwelling of Mrs.
                  Aaron was distant nearly an eighth of a mile, and thither the carpenter directed
                  his steps, walking rapidly. It had become very dark before he reached there—the
                  darkness invaded, every few moments, by brilliant streams of light from the cloudy
                  west.
               "Have you seen any thing of my Andrew?" inquired Harding, on reaching the
                  neighbour's house.
               "I have not." replied Mrs. Aaron, as she stood with the door held partly open.
               "Is your John at home?" was next asked.
               "My John? Oh yes, indeed! He's never away after dark."
               John came to the side of his mother.
               "Have you seen my Andrew to-day?" Harding spoke to the boy.
               
               "No, sir; I have not. He wasn't at school either in the morning of afternoon."
               "Are you certain about not having seen him to-day?"
               "Oh yes, sir. He hasn't been anywhere around here."
               "Where can he be?" said Mrs. Aaron, now manifesting a woman's concern.
               "Dear knows!" answered the carpenter, with some impatience of manner. "I only wish
                  I had my hands on him."
               "How long has he been away?" asked Mrs. Aaron.
               "Ever since dinner-time," was replied.
               "May be he is over at Mr. Lawson's" spoke up John. "Neither Henry nor Peter Lawson
                  were at school this afternoon. I shouldn't wonder if they'd all gone a fishing in
                  Baxter's mill-dam."
               "I'm obliged to you!" was almost roughly said by Harding, as he turned off
                  abruptly, and strode away in the direction of Lawson's farm-house, which was at
                  least a quarter of a mile from his own dwelling.
               The darkness was now so deep, that he could see only a few steps before him, save
                  when the broad-sheeted lightning threw its mantle of flame over the earth for an
                  instant, and then left the night blacker than before. The flashes came in quick
                  succession, and by their aid he walked on as steadily as if day had been abroad.
                  At Lawson's he gained some intelligence of his truant boy. Andrew had been with
                  Henry and Peter fishing, as was suggested by young Aaron, and had stayed there to
                  supper. But it was more than half an hour since he started for home.
               "You'll find him safe and sound when you get back," said Mr. Lawson; "so you
                  needn't give yourself any more uneasiness about him. I didn't notice that he was
                  staying so late, or I would have sent him away earlier. I told the boys to go with
                  him a part of the way, but he said he wasn't at all afraid, and went off by
                  himself."
               It did not take Harding long to retrace his steps homeward. Not in the least was
                  his anger against the child abated, nor had he changed, in the smallest degree,
                  his cruel purposes regarding him. He had often punished him severely; but the
                  severity now meditated was something far beyond any prior infliction.
               He was only a short distance from his dwelling, when a lightning gleam, that make
                  the air light as noonday, showed him the form of Andrew crouching down against a
                  large tree that stood a little off from the road. He saw it but for an instant:
                  for, in the next moment, the blackness of darkness was around him.
               "Andrew!" he called, sternly.
               Ere his voice died on the air, another flash quivered along the ground; but when
                  the lad's form had just been seen, no object was visible. Mr. Harding stood still,
                  and awaited, in silence, the next recurring flash. It came, but Andrew was not in
                  view.
               "Andrew!" he cried again. "Andrew! why don't you answer me?"
               The echo of his own voice was all the reply that came. He now advanced to the
                  tree, felt about it in the darkness, and searched all around with his eyes, as
                  flash after flash lit up the scene. But the form of Andrew was not again descried.
                  He called, threatened, and called, again and again. He searched around for a
                  considerable distance, but to no purpose. Concluding that the boy had gone home,
                  he kept on his way, and soon arrived at his dwelling.
               "Is he here yet?" was his sharp interrogation, as he stepped over the
                  threshold.
               "Haven't you found him?" asked Mrs. Harding, with a blanching face.
               "He was over at Lawson's until dark, and then started for home. I'm very sure I saw him up at the
                  turn in the road, sitting by the foot of an old beech-tree. A flash of lightning
                  made it as clear as day; but, when the next flash came, he was not there. I
                  called, and called, but he wouldn't answer me. He'll come creeping in here before
                  long. The rain will soon be pouring in torrents, and he'll never stand that."
               "O Jacob!" said the mother, in a tone of distress, "I'm afraid something has
                  happened to him."
               "Never fear. He's too bad for any thing to happen to him," was the harsh
                  response.
               "Don't talk so, Jacob. It's a fearful night. There! Oh, what a sharp flash! Go out
                  and call to him. Maybe he is close by, and afraid to come in. Tell him not to be
                  afraid—that you won't punish him. Do, Jacob!"
               "I will punish him, though! and I'll not lie about it,"
                  firmly answered Harding. "The moment I get my hands on him, I'll flog him within
                  an inch of his life, the desperate little vagabond! A pretty race he has run me,
                  after all his ill-doing—as if that wasn't enough."
               "What a crash!" exclaimed poor Mrs. Harding, her face blanching still whiter.
                  "Hark! is that wind or rain?"
               "Both," replied her husband, coolly. "He'll not be away long now."
               But the unyielding father erred in his prediction. The storm came down with
                  fearful violence, howling among the tall elms, crashing it thunder through the
                  air, and pouring out a deluge of rain; yet the boy ventured not to the door of his
                  father's house, where a more dreaded evil awaited him. He could bear the elemental
                  wrath, wild and fierce though it was, as something less to be feared than the
                  cruel anger of his justly incensed father.
               Nine, ten, eleven o'clock came; still the fearful tempest pest roared
                  without—still the harsh thunder boomed along the sky, or came sharply rattling
                  down, and still nothing was seen or heard of Andrew. Almost sick with anxiety and
                  alarm, Mrs. Harding, who had moved about the rooms incessantly—now listening at
                  the door or window, now gazing into the darkness, and now calling the name of the
                  boy—at length sunk down into a kind of hopeless state. That something terrible had
                  happened to Andrew, she felt certain; for she was sure he would not remain out in
                  storm and darkness, if he could make his way home. If softened at all toward his
                  erring son, Harding did not manifest the change. He had walked the floor
                  restlessly for a greater part of the evening, every now and then opening the door
                  to look out, and calling sternly the name of Andrew, who was, he persisted in
                  affirming, skulking somewhere near at hand. It was all in vain that the lad's
                  mother strove to turn aside the harsh anger of his father.
               "Ill not let him go to swift destruction, Mary," he would answer, with knitted
                  brows. "I'll not be a foolish father, and spare the rod. Come when he will, he has
                  got to feel the weight of this arm. It is all well enough for you to pity him; but
                  I have a stern duty to perform, and mean to execute it fully."
               "Try and not feel so angry against him, Jacob," pleaded the mother, laying her
                  hand on his arm. "We know not where he is, nor how dreadfully he may be suffering.
                  What if he should be dead! The lightning has struck very near, several times."
               "I would rather see him dead now, than swinging on the gallows twenty years
                  hence," said Harding, as he drew himself away from his tearful wife. "If he is
                  dead, he will be safe from the evil to come; but if alive, it shall be my business
                  to check the course of evil."
               It was between eleven and twelve o'clock, when Mrs. Harding went from the family
                  sitting-room into the adjoining chamber,
                  leaving her husband pacing the floor, and nursing his anger against the absent
                  boy. The height of the storm had passed. At more distant intervals, the feebler
                  flashes came, and the far-off thunder had a muffled roll. The winds were fast
                  dying away, and no longer swept through the air, in howling gust, or bore the fast
                  descending rain in fitful torrents against the windows. Every moment the rushing
                  sound without grew less; and by the time Mrs. Harding returned from the
                  chamber—scarce three minutes had elapsed since she left her husband—a deep
                  stillness had succeeded the tempest's wail. She came in with so changed a
                  countenance, that her husband could not help exclaiming—
               "Why, Mary! what is it?"
               "Jacob!" There was a depth of emotion in the voice of Mrs. Harding, as she grasped
                  with both hands her husband's arm, and lifted to his face her moistened eyes, that
                  surprised and subdued him. "Jacob," she repeated, gently drawing him toward the
                  chamber-door, "I want to show you something."
               Harding followed, passively.
               "Look there, Jacob! And she pointed to the low bed on which Grace was laid every
                  night beside Lotty, and where she usually slept soundly until Mrs. Harding
                  retired.
               Harding started at what he saw, with a quick ejaculation; but his wife clung to
                  his arm, saying, in a half whisper—
               "Hush, Jacob!—don't wake them now—don't!"
               The pause was fatal to his stern purpose. The face of Andrew was before him, pale
                  and shrunken with suffering; and close beside, almost touching it, on the same
                  pillow, was the calm, sweet, heavenly face of the babe. The boy had crept in
                  through the window, in the height of the storm, and, after putting off his wet
                  clothes, laid himself down beside little Grace, evidently with the hope that her
                  dove-like innocence would soften the fierce indignation of his father against him,
                  and there had fallen asleep. His hair was wet, and tear-stains marked his
                  cheeks.
               "Poor boy!" almost sobbed Mrs. Harding. She was overcome with tenderness. As she
                  breathed the words, a deep sigh parted the lips of the sleeping child, and, at the
                  same moment, Grace, moving in her sleep, drew her little arm across his neck, and
                  laid her warm, bright cheek to his.
               It would have required a harder, sterner heart than Jacob Harding's—hard and stern
                  as that was—to withstand the softening influence of a scene like this, coming as
                  it did after long hours of intense excitement, and in the solemn hush succeeding a
                  fearful tempest. A little while he stood as if spell-bound, and then turning
                  suddenly away, left the chamber. When his wife followed him into the next room,
                  she found him sitting in a chair, with his head bowed upon his bosom. She came up
                  to where he sat, and leaning against him, laid her hand upon his shoulder.
               "Jacob," she said, softly. It was the old, old voice that now entered his ears—the
                  voice that had sounded sweetest of all in the days when young love filled his mind
                  with dreams of an Elysian future. He neither moved nor spoke; but his heart was
                  melting.
               "Jacob—husband—dear husband!" How many years had passed—desolate, dreary years to
                  both their suffering spirits—since Mrs. Harding had spoken to her husband so
                  tenderly, and in words like these!
               "Say on, Mary!" And as the words passed his lips, he leaned toward her. How
                  naturally glided her arm from his shoulder to his neck, as her heart leaped with a
                  delicious impulse! The old, old voice, once so full of music, was ringing in her
                  ears again. It was the voice of her young
                  lover—that in which he had wooed and won her in the days of innocent, confiding
                  girlhood.
               "Say on, Mary," he repeated. How gently, almost humbly, he spoke! There was not a
                  trace of bitterness or passion in his tones.
               "Think of what the poor boy has suffered to-night, Jacob. A tender child, only
                  eight years old, exposed to such a fearful storm! Think of him as suffering and
                  repentant, Jacob—not as stubbornly bent on continuing in wrong. He looks so pale
                  and frightened, even in his sleep, that the sight of him makes my heart ache."
               "And think, too, Mary," answered Harding, "of his great offence. Will it be right
                  to let him go unpunished?"
               "Why should he be punished?" asked Mrs. Harding.
               "For his own good. He must be taught that evil deeds bring inevitable pain."
               "And have they not brought pain to-night? said Mrs. Harding. "Think, Jacob,
                  whether, for any wrong, you would have doomed him to the anguish and fear he must
                  have suffered to-night? I am sure you would not."
               "O Mary! I dare not let him escape my severe displeasure," replied Harding, his
                  voice taking a troubled tone. "For him to go on in this way, is certain ruin."
               "It is for us to save him from evil, if in our power, Jacob. But how shall we save
                  him. Severity, I fear, will not do it. He has been scolded, and driven, and
                  whipped, until I sometimes think he is hardened. A number of times I have noticed
                  of late, that when I speak mildly to him, he obeys more readily than when I am out
                  of patience. If I order him to do any thing in an angry or imperative voice, he
                  moves off sulkily, and, unless I follow him up, is certain to disobey me. But if I
                  say, 'Andrew, go and do so and so, that's a good boy,' he springs away and does
                  the errand in the shortest time, and with evident pleasure."
               "I wish to do right, Mary," said Harding, in an irresolute voice.
               "No one knows that better than I do, Jacob," answered Mrs. Harding. "But what is
                  right? Ah! that is the question. How ignorant and erring we are! We have tried
                  hard and harsh means with our children from the beginning, and they do not seem to
                  grow better. Let us try some gentler methods."
               "But what are we to do with Andrew? Let the past go unpunished?"
               "Unpunished, at least by the rod, Jacob. He expects that, and is, in some degree,
                  prepared for it. If we deal more gently by him, and let him understand that we are
                  grieved rather than angry at his conduct—that our punishment, whatever it may be,
                  is given in love, not indignation—he may repent far more deeply of his evil deeds,
                  than if stubborn anger be aroused through painful chastisement. Hush!"
               Mrs. Harding raised herself up and listened, as a voice came from the room they
                  had left a little while before. It was Andrew's voice. "O father!" they heard him
                  say distinctly, and in a tone of fear.
               Both arose quickly, and went into the chamber where he was lying.
               "Don't cut me so hard, father!—don't; oh, don't." His tones were full of
                  agony.
               "I'm so wet and frightened!" he murmured, a little while afterward. "Won't the
                  lightning strike me? Oh dear! oh dear! If father wouldn't cut me so hard!"
               The heart-full mother could not keep the tears from raining over her face; and
                  even Jacob Harding felt a woman's weakness stealing through his breast. He was
                  about moving away from the bed where his children slept, when Andrew started up, wide awake almost as
                  soon as his eyes were opened.
               "O father!" he exclaimed, the moment his bewildered mind was able to comprehend
                  his true position—"don't whip me—please don't! I've been very bad; but if you
                  don't whip me, I'll try and not be bad any more."
               And he stretched forth his hands imploringly, while his colourless face had such a
                  look of fear and sorrow, that the heart untouched by its expression must have been
                  of adamant.
               "You have been very wicked, Andrew," said his mother, in a low, serious, grieving
                  voice; "and I do not see how your father can help punishing you."
               "O mother! mother!" cried the child, bursting into tears, and bending over toward
                  her—she had stooped down by the bedside—"I know I have been wicked, and I'm so
                  sorry. I don't know why I did it. It seemed as if I couldn't help it. O mother!
                  how dreadful it was out in the woods, with the thunder and lightning all around
                  me! I was so frightened! But I was afraid to come in. I saw the candle in the
                  window, and heard you and father call me; but I didn't dare to answer. Once, when
                  the lightning made all as bright as day, I thought I saw Grace just a little way
                  before me on the ground. I ran right up to the spot, but she wasn't there! Then I
                  thought I'd get into the window, and lie down on the bed, just here, alongside of
                  her. Maybe, I said to myself, father, who loves little Grace so much, won't whip
                  me for her sake, if I promise not to be bad any more."
               "And do you promise, Andrew?" Mrs. Harding spoke very seriously.
               "I'd promise, if I thought father would believe me," sobbed the poor child.
               "Promise in earnest?"
               "Oh yes, mother!"
               "Then ask him to forgive you, my son!"
               There was a deep silence for some moments.
               "Father!" Timid, hesitating, almost fearful was the voice that broke on the hushed
                  air of the chamber.
               Harding neither moved from the spot where he stood, with averted face, nor
                  answered.
               "Father! O father!"
               The stern man was too much softened to resist the pleading anguish of that broken
                  voice.
               "Well, my son?" He did not mean to speak so gently; but his heart flowed in his
                  tones.
               "I've been very wicked, father." His utterance was choked, and he could say no
                  more.
               "Speak to him, Jacob," said Mrs. Harding, bending toward her husband.
               "Lie down, my son, and go to sleep. You have been very wicked, and I
                  intended to punish you severely; but if you will be a good boy, as
                  you promise, I may forgive you."
               Harding tried to speak calmly, and even a little sternly; but his voice was
                  scarcely steady, and betrayed the powerful struggle that was going on within. As
                  Andrew fell back, sobbing, on the pillow, from which, a little while before, he
                  had started up in fear, his father left the chamber, deeply agitated. He wished to
                  be alone, in order to recover his manly self-possession. His face was calm and
                  elevated when he rejoined his wife. In both their hearts, what a wild tempest had
                  raged, symboling the fierce storm that darkened the face of nature! But the azure
                  depths of their spirits were clear again—clear as the starry heavens that arched
                  above their lowly dwelling.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               MR. LONG, the village schoolmaster, after leaving the carpenter, took his way
                  homeward, oppressed by a troubled feeling. He was a man of humane impulses, and
                  these were excited by the cruel threats and savage looks of Harding. Andrew's
                  offence was heinous, deserving more than ordinary marks of displeasure; and he
                  had, himself, been thinking over various modes of punishment, in order, if
                  possible, to select that which would be most efficacious, when the young truant
                  presented himself in the morning. Miss Gimp, the dressmaker, was at his house when
                  he returned home. She was doing some work for Mrs. Long, and dropped in with it a
                  little before supper-time. Very naturally, she was invited to remain until after
                  tea. Indeed, Miss Gimp was generally a welcome guest, for she was chatty, and knew
                  the weak side of every woman in the neighbourhood. She was, moreover, in
                  possession of all the current gossip—good-natured and ill-natured—floating about,
                  far and near, and had a way peculiar to herself, and racy withal, of telling every
                  thing she knew, and a little more sometimes.
               "You look sober, Edward," said the schoolmaster's wife, as her eyes rested on her
                  husband's face, soon after he came in. "Don't you feel well?"
               "Something has happened that troubles me," replied Mr. Long. And then he looked
                  more serious.
               How quickly was the head of Miss Gimp elevated! What a sparkling interest was in
                  her two bright eyes!
               "Trouble you, Edward? What is it?"
               A shade of anxiety flitted across the pleasant face of Mrs. Long.
               "Nothing that particularly concerns myself," replied the schoolmaster.
               "Any thing wrong in the school?"
               "There's something wrong about one of the scholars. Andrew Harding has been
                  playing truant."
               "The ne'er do well!" exclaimed Miss Gimp; not so much in sorrow or anger, as from
                  a species of unconscious satisfaction at hearing a piece of bad news.
               "I'm afraid that boy will come to an evil end," remarked Mrs. Long.
               "He'll come to the gallows, without doubt," said Miss Gimp. "I never saw his
                  match. Not for a mountain of gold would I live in the house with him. I pity his
                  poor mother; but, then, she has herself to blame. I never saw a woman have so
                  little management with children. She lets them do as they please, and make as much
                  noise and disorder as they like, until she gets so worried she can't stand it any
                  longer; and then she screams at them, and boxes their ears right and left, in a
                  way to make one's blood cold. That's no way to bring up children."
               "Indeed, it is not," was the quiet response of the schoolmaster's wife.
               "Why, d'ye know," ran on Miss Gimp, "that on one occasion of my being there to fit
                  a dress for Mrs. Harding, Andrew—a little imp of Satan he is—forgive me for saying
                  so—Andrew threw a large case-knife at his sister Lucy. It came as nigh cutting her
                  ear off as could be—just touching it with the edge as it glanced by. If you had
                  seen the passion of his mother! It was awful! She grew almost black in the face;
                  and I thought she would never get done beating the boy. It made me sick at heart.
                  Oh! she is a woman of an awful temper! I
                  wouldn't have her tongue on me for the world. And so Andrew has been playing the
                  truant, ha!"
               How the voice of Miss Gimp changed, as she recollected herself!
               "I am grieved to say that he has," answered the schoolmaster, gravely.
               "Does his father know it?" asked Mrs. Long.
               "Yes; and I am sorry to say, is in a most dreadful passion about it. I called at
                  his shop as I came home just now, and the way he looked and spoke made me really
                  shudder."
               "He's a cruel-tempered man," said Miss Gimp. "I know all about him. His father was
                  little better than a savage, and used to beat his children about as if they were
                  dogs."
               "I pity Andrew, from my heart," said Mr. Long. "He has acted very badly; but he is
                  only a tender child, needing correction for his fault, but not able to bear the
                  cruelty in store for him. I feel unhappy about it."
               "How would it do," suggested Mrs. Long, "for you to go over, after tea, and try to
                  soothe his father, and thus break the heavy weight of his displeasure?"
               "Just what I was thinking about," said Mr. Long.
               "I wouldn't do any such thing," spoke up Miss Gimp, quickly. "Take my advice, and
                  don't go near him. He's a very strange man. As sure as you do, he'll insult you;
                  and, what is worse, beat Andrew twice as badly, from a fresh excitement of angry
                  feelings."
               "There may be something in that," remarked the schoolmaster's wife.
               "There is something in it," said Miss Gimp. "People like them can't
                  bear interference from others; and always repel intrusion by broad insult. Let
                  them alone, Mr. Long, to do with their own as they please. More harm than good
                  will arise from any attempt you may make to screen the young rebel. It's all very
                  kind, very humane in you, Mr. Long, and does great credit to your heart; but you
                  can't help them any."
               "There may be truth in your suggestion," answered the schoolmaster, in some doubt
                  and irresolution—he was flattered, in spite of himself, by Miss Gimp's
                  compliment—"and yet it does not seem right to leave a helpless child in the hands
                  of a man insane from anger, and not make an effort to save him from excessive
                  cruelty."
               Tea was soon after on the table. Mr. Long, still undecided in his mind, sat
                  thoughtful and nearly silent during the meal, while Miss Gimp rattled on, much to
                  the edification of Mrs. Long, who, in her agreeable tittle-tattle, quite forgot
                  poor Andrew Harding. A sudden roll of distant thunder interrupted the voluble play
                  of the gossip's tongue.
               "What's that!" she exclaimed—"not a gust coming up?"
               Mr. Long went to the door, and threw a glance around the horizon.
               "There are some heavy clouds in the west," said he.
               "And it threatens rain," added Miss Gimp, who now stood by his side. "Get me my
                  bonnet, if you please, Mrs. Long," said she, turning to the schoolmaster's wife.
                  "It's growing dark fast, and I must run home."
               "Don't be in a hurry. It isn't late. I'm sure it won't storm to-night," said Mrs.
                  Long, affecting a great deal of reluctance at parting with Miss Gimp, who, in her
                  turn, had just enough self-esteem to believe that the schoolmaster's wife felt
                  really bad about her "going away so early."
               Often, during the fearful storm that raged that night, did Mr. Long think of
                  Andrew Harding, and wonder how it was with him. He could not forget the cruel face and words of the boy's father: they
                  haunted his imagination and his thoughts.
               On the next morning, he went early, as was his custom, to the school-house. He was
                  sitting at his desk, engaged in study, when the sound of footsteps caused him to
                  look up. It was too soon to expect any of the scholars, and he was, therefore,
                  prepared to see a stranger. He almost started, as he saw the carpenter leading his
                  son, and within a few steps of the door.
               "Mr. Long, I have brought Andrew to school this morning."
               Harding had paused with one foot across the threshold. He spoke in a steady voice,
                  rather below his ordinary tone. "I preferred coming early, before the other
                  scholars arrived, as I wished to say a word about the lad."
               "Won't you step in?" said the schoolmaster, quite taken by surprise at the manner
                  of his visitor, in which was nothing of the fierce indignation apparent at their
                  last interview.
               "No, I thank you. You can go in, Andrew."
               The boy entered quietly, and went with a stealthy step to his usual seat.
               "I called to say, Mr. Long," resumed the carpenter, "that Andrew promises, if you
                  will forgive him, never again to be guilty of such bad conduct. I think his
                  punishment has already been severe enough, and of a character not likely soon to
                  be forgotten. He has been very wicked, but, I think, repents sincerely."
               "I am not angry with him," said the schoolmaster, "but grieved that any scholar of
                  mine should commit that most disgraceful of all offences—playing the truant. If
                  you think he has been sufficiently punished, and sincerely repents, the matter can
                  rest where it is; but I will not promise, for the future, should he offend again.
                  The example would be too pernicious."
               "I think you can trust him," answered the carpenter, as he moved back a few steps
                  from the door. "Good morning," he added, after standing silent for a moment or
                  two, and went away.
               Mr. Long felt rather strangely on finding himself alone with the boy, after this
                  brief interview with Harding. In both the father and son, a striking change was
                  apparent. As to the basis of the change, he was altogether ignorant. The natural
                  conclusion to which his mind came, almost without reflection, was, that the
                  carpenter had punished his child with a measure of severity from which his own
                  better consciousness now revolted, and that, as some reparation for his cruelty,
                  he now sought to screen him from further consequences. That both were greatly
                  subdued, was apparent at a glance.
               "Andrew," said the schoolmaster. He spoke kindly, but seriously.
               The child looked up timidly.
               "Come here, Andrew."
               The boy left his seat, and came toward the schoolmaster, with a slow movement, his
                  eyes fixed earnestly and inquiringly upon his face.
               There were unmistakable marks of suffering and fear in that young countenance;
                  and, as Mr. Long noted them, pity for the lad and a new interest in regard to him
                  were awakened in his mind.
               "Poor boy!" It was his involuntary mental ejaculation. Scarcely thinking of what
                  he was doing, he took Andrew, by the hand, and said, kindly—
               "I am sorry you were so naughty yesterday. How came you to do so?"
               The child's lips quivered a moment, and his eyes fell to the ground. A little
                  while he stood silent.
               "How came you to do so, Andrew?" The voice that said this was kind and
                  encouraging.
               "I don't know, Mr. Long," was answered; and now the boy's clear eyes—the schoolmaster was struck
                  with the softness of their expression—were raised to his. "It seemed as if I
                  couldn't help it. I didn't think much, at first, what I was doing; but when I got
                  a going, it was like running down hill. I could not stop myself."
               "You are sorry about it, are you not, Andrew?"
               "Oh yes, Mr. Long. I can't tell you how sorry I am. I wish I hadn't done it."
               "You will never do so again?"
               "Not if I can help it, Mr. Long"
               "You can help it, Andrew," said the schoolmaster, in a serious voice. "Every one
                  can help doing wrong."
               "I don't know." The child spoke half to himself, and in a tone so sad, that the
                  schoolmaster was touched by it. "It seems as if I couldn't help it,
                  sometimes."
               "Do you ever say your prayers, on going to bed at night?" asked the schoolmaster,
                  after a few moments of thoughtful silence.
               "I used to say them a good while ago; but I never do now," was answered.
               "You must begin again, Andrew, if you desire to be a good boy. Begin this very
                  night. Do not get into bed until you have knelt down and said, 'Our Father who art
                  in heaven.' Do Lotty and Philip say their prayers at night?"
               "No, sir. Mother doesn't teach any of us to say our prayers."
               "Do you ever read in the Bible?"
               "Mother won't let me have the Bible."
               "Why not?"
               "She says I dirty the leaves and pictures."
               "Have you no Testament?"
               "No, sir."
               "If I give you one, will you read in it?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "Very well, Andrew, I will bring you a Testament this afternoon, and it shall be
                  yours if you will learn a verse in it every day."
               The lad's face brightened with real pleasure.
               "Not all evil—no, not all evil!" were the school master's earnestly, inward spoken
                  words. "The innocence of childhood has been trampled on and overlaid; but there is
                  good ground still, ready for the hand of culture."
               "Andrew," said he, after a slight pause, "you must be on your guard when the other
                  boys come to school. It is known that you have played truant, and some of them
                  will be sure to say unkind things to you about it. Try and not get angry—try hard,
                  and I'm sure you can help it. Don't seem to mind what they say, and they'll soon
                  let you alone."
               The form of a boy darkened the door at this moment, and the conference of Andrew
                  and the schoolmaster was at an end.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               IT was evening. Lotty and Grace were sleeping, side by side, and Philip, a
                  restless, rather fretful child of four years, had some time since been taken off
                  to bed. Mrs. Harding, having cleared away the supper things, now busily plied her
                  needle. Her husband was near her, by the table, his head resting on his hand, and
                  his mind busy with a new train of thoughts that occupied it almost per force. Side
                  by side, on two low chairs, sat Andrew and his sister Lucy, younger by two years.
                  Andrew held open in his hands the Testament given him, according to promise, by
                  Mr. Long, and he was reading from it in a low voice, while Lucy leaned toward him,
                  listening intently. The mother's ears were open, as well as Lucy's, and took in
                  every word; and it was not long before Harding began to listen also. Andrew was
                  reading of the birth of Christ in the city of Bethlehem, and of the wise men who
                  came from the East, guided by the star that heralded his wonderful advent. It was
                  many, many years since the words of this strange history had been in this
                  thoughts; and now they came to him with a newly awakening interest. Andrew read
                  on—of the angel who appeared to Joseph in a dream, warning him of the evil designs
                  of Herod—of the cruel slaughter of the Innocents—of John the Baptist preaching
                  repentance in the wilderness of Judea—and of the baptism of the Saviour in
                  Jordan.
               All unconscious that his father and mother were listening, the boy continued to
                  read. What a power was in the divine word, coming to their ears, as it did, borne
                  on the voice of a child! There was a wonderful fascination about every fact and
                  every holy sentiment. They saw, in imagination, Jesus led up, of the Spirit, into
                  the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil; and when the rebuked tempter left him,
                  they felt a sense of pleasure at the triumph of good over evil, that passed with a
                  low thrill to the profoundest depths of their being. In the call of Simon and
                  Andrew, and James and John, the sons of Zebedee, they almost seemed to hear the
                  Lord speaking to them, and calling them to a new life. They saw him going about
                  through Galilee, teaching in the synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the
                  kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the
                  people. And when he went up into a mountain, and taught from thence the multitude,
                  the divine words he uttered came to them with a spirit and power that lifted their
                  souls into higher regions, and gave them perceptions of truths such as had never
                  come to them before.
               "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in
                  heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be
                  called the children of God."
               Many times, in earlier days—days in which some rosy gleams from the morning of
                  childhood mingled with the colder light of selfish maturity—had they heard these
                  beautiful sentences; but never had the words so penetrated their souls; never had
                  they felt such a sad, almost hopeless yearning to rise into the holy states of the
                  merciful, the pure in heart, and the peacemaker.
               Still Andrew read on, unconscious that other ears than Lucy's were hearkening to
                  his utterance intently.
               "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
                  glorify your Father which is in heaven."
               A low sigh from the mother's heart trembled, scarce audibly, on the air.
               
               "Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not
                  forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I say unto you,
                  Swear not at all: neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; nor by the earth, for
                  it is his footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king.
                  Neither shalt thou swear by the head, because thou canst not make one hair white
                  or black; but let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay: for whatsoever is more
                  than these, cometh of evil."
               "Cometh of evil—cometh of evil." How the words sounded in the ears of Jacob
                  Harding, over and over again, as if spoken directly to him!
               "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless 
                     them them
                     them
                   that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
                  despitefully use you and persecute you: that ye may be the children of your Father
                  which is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
                  sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. For if ye love them which love you,
                  what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your
                  brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? Be ye
                  therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."
               Tired with reading aloud, Andrew now closed his Testament, and said, in a kind
                  way, to his sister—
               "Come, Lucy—let's go to bed."
               Lucy made no objection, and the two children, who had learned to wait on
                  themselves, took a candle, and went off to their chamber, up stairs, without a
                  cross or angry word—something so unusual, that both father and mother noted it
                  with surprise.
               Plying her needle, sat Mrs. Harding, and near her, his hand shading his face from
                  the light, was her husband, almost motionless. In the minds of both lingered
                  passages just read from the Word of Life, while a deep calmness pervaded their
                  spirits. Not so much rebuked were they by the truths, condemnatory of the past,
                  which seemed spoken anew, as inspired by a dawning hope of something better in the
                  future. A dim foreshadowing of better and happier states came to both, and with it
                  an awakening tenderness each for the other, and a deeper, purer, more unselfish
                  love for their children.
               A little while they had heard Andrew and Lucy moving about in the chamber above;
                  then all was still. Presently there stole down a low murmur. The mother's hand
                  rested in her lap, and she raised her head to listen.
               "What is that?" she said, rising and going to the foot of the stairway.
               "Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts"——
               This much she heard distinctly, in the voice of Andrew.
               The murmuring sound was continued for a little while, and then all was silent.
               "What was it?" asked Harding, as his wife came back to her seat by the table.
               A moment or two Mrs. Harding gazed into her husband's face, as if to read his
                  state of mind, and then answered—
               "It was Andrew, saying his prayers."
               The hand that had been withdrawn from between the light and his face, was quickly
                  restored to its position by Harding, who turned himself a little farther away from
                  observation, and did not speak for nearly half an hour. That time was spent in an
                  almost involuntary review of the past, and in partially formed purposes to live a
                  better life in the future; if not for his own sake, at least for the sake of his
                  children.
               Very gently did sleep draw her dusky curtains around the weary heads of Mr. and
                  Mrs. Harding that night. Morning found
                  their spirits calm, hopeful, and yearning for the better life, of whose beatitudes
                  came to them some partial glimpses as they listened to the words of the Saviour,
                  teaching the multitudes that gathered to hear, as he sat upon the mountain of
                  Galilee.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               ONE day, a few weeks later in the course of events we are recording, Miss Gimp was
                  a little fluttered by seeing a handsome carriage draw up before her humble
                  dwelling. She looked, of course, for a richly dressed lady to emerge from so
                  elegant a vehicle; but, instead, a plainly attired girl, evidently a domestic in
                  some family, stepped upon the ground. The dressmaker was already in the door.
               "Does Miss Gimp live here?" asked the girl.
               "That is my name: will you walk in?" said the dressmaker.
               The girl entered, and took the chair that was proffered.
               "Are you very busy at this time?" she inquired.
               "Not very," answered Miss Gimp.
               "Have you a week to spare?"
               "I don't know about that," replied the dressmaker. "Who wants me for a week?"
               "Mrs. Barclay."
               "Mrs. Barclay, over at Beechwood?"
               "Yes. You made a dress for her last fall, I believe."
               "Yes. When does she want me?"
               "Right away, if you can come."
               Miss Gimp considered a little while.
               "I have two dresses to finish," said she; "after that, I can go to Mrs.
                  Barclay."
               "How long will it take you to finish these dresses?" asked the girl.
               "To-day and to-morrow."
               "Then you can come the day after to-morrow?"
               "Yes."
               "Very well. I'll say so to Mrs. Barclay. At what time in the morning will you be
                  ready?"
               "As early as you please."
               "Say nine o'clock?"
               "Yes."
               "Very well," said the girl; "I will be over for you, in the carriage, by that
                  time.
               Miss Gimp was very good at promising, and at performing also, when it suited her
                  to keep her engagements. In the present case, she meant to be as good as her word,
                  even though in keeping her word to Mrs. Barclay, she broke it to her very
                  particular friends, Mrs. Jarvis and the storekeeper's wife, for both of whom she
                  had promised to make dresses, as soon as the work on hand was finished. The
                  Barclays were wealthy people, and she could afford to disappoint her less
                  pretending neighbours, for the sake of making favour with them.
               According to appointment, the handsome carriage drew up before the dressmaker's
                  door exactly at nine o'clock on the day agreed upon, and Miss Gimp, conscious of
                  having acquired a new importance, was soon reposing among its luxurious cushions.
                  Past the dwelling of Mrs. Willits drove the elegant vehicle, and Miss Gimp did not
                  fail to lean from the window, to throw a smile at the storekeeper's wife, who
                  exclaimed to herself—
               
               "Why, bless us! What does all this mean?"
               A brisk drive of half an hour brought them to the stately residence of the
                  Barclays—the finest within a circle of twenty miles. Mrs. Barclays, a handsome but
                  dignified woman—her age was not over thirty-five—received the dressmaker kindly,
                  but with a manner that at once repelled all gossipping familiarity. She had sent
                  for her as a workwoman, to perform a needed service, and wished for nothing
                  beyond; and it was but a little while before Miss Gimp understood this clearly.
                  Two or three times during the first day, she tried to draw Mrs. Barclay out; but
                  it was of no use—the lady wanted her skill as a dressmaker; but, beyond this,
                  neither asked nor received and thing.
               "Proud—haughty—stuck up!" Many times did Miss Gimp repeat these words to herself,
                  by way of consolation in her disappointment at not being questioned by Mrs.
                  Barclay about people for whom she had worked. There were the Wilsons and the
                  Mayfields—she had made dresses for them, and quietly intimated the fact—of whom,
                  considering their position, Mrs. Barclay must want to hear the dressmaker's
                  opinion. But not the slightest sign of interest was manifested the lady. Once or
                  twice Miss Gimp alluded to them, in a way that she believed would draw Mrs.
                  Barclay out; but the allusion was met by a frigid silence.
               Mrs. Barclay had a daughter in her fifteenth year, who, though but a child, was as
                  reserved to the dressmaker as her mother. Miss Gimp tried hard to win her
                  confidence by a chatty familiarity; but Florence repelled all these
                  advances—politely, yet effectually.
               On the second day of Miss Gimp's rather uncomfortable sojourn in this family,
                  where she was appreciated only for her skill in mantua-making, she heard Mrs.
                  Barclay remark to her daughter in a low voice—
               "Your aunt Edith Beaufort will be here to-morrow."
               "She will!" There was a tone of surprise in the voice of Florence that instantly
                  quickened the ears of Miss Gimp, who bent closer to her work in order to seem
                  entirely absorbed therein.
               "Yes. I got a note from her a little while ago. Jacob brought it over," answered
                  the mother.
               "I thought she was going back to Clinton, after finishing her visit to Mrs.
                  Larch."
               "She intended doing so when she left here; but she wants to see your father about
                  some business matters that she says needs his attention."
               "How long is she going to stay?" inquired Florence.
               "A week, she says."
               "I don't like aunt Edith, and I can't help it," remarked Florence. "I never feel
                  pleasant when she is here; and am always relieved from a kind of pressure on my
                  feelings when she goes."
               "You should try to overcome this," said Mrs. Barclay. "Your aunt is always kind,
                  and, I think, much attached to you. She has her peculiarities, as we all have; and
                  toleration of individual peculiarities, as I have often said to you, is a common
                  duty we owe to each other."
               "I often wish, mother," replied the girl, in a gentler tone, "that I were more
                  like you—that I could forget and deny myself for the sake of others, as much as
                  you do."
               "It is not in our power," answered Mrs. Barclay, "to love others and seek their
                  good by a mere effort of the mind. Desire is fruitless, unless it flows into
                  action. What we have to do, is to be externally kind and forbearing—to do that
                  good for others which reason and religion enjoin upon us. This may require some
                  effort and self-denial in the beginning; but acts, from right principles, form
                  vessels in the mind, into which affections can flow and find a permanent abiding
                     place. What is mere duty at first,
                  becomes ultimately a delight"
               Florence bent her head, listening attentively, and seeking to find, in her
                  mother's earnestly spoken words, the power to overcome. And she did receive
                  strength.
               Miss Gimp, whose ears had taken in every word of this conversation, was puzzled to
                  comprehend its entire meaning. The words she understood; but to her such words
                  from the lips of Mrs. Barclay, whom she had regarded only as a proud woman of the
                  world, bewildered her. Could they be spoken sincerely? Yet there was no room for
                  doubt. They were the utterance of a mother—made only for the ears of a beloved and
                  confiding child. In spite of her wounded self-love, Miss Gimp could not but feel
                  respect for Mrs. Barclay. From that time, she was subdued and reserved in her
                  presence.
               On the next day, aunt Edith Beaufort came. She was a woman past the middle age;
                  tall and dignified in person; somewhat proud and stately in her carriage; and with
                  an eye that, when it looked at any one steadily, seemed to reach inward to the
                  very thoughts. A close observer would not fail to observe a certain cloaking of
                  her own purposes. While she sought to penetrate every one, she as sedulously kept
                  herself impenetrable.
               Mrs. Beaufort had none of the high-minded scruples that prevented her
                  sister-in-law, Mrs. Barclay, from listening to the idle or malicious gossip of the
                  dressmaker. On the other hand, she rather encouraged Miss Gimp to talk. On the
                  morning after her arrival, Mrs. Barclay and her daughter rode out. They were gone
                  a couple of hours, and a portion of this time was spent by Mrs. Beaufort in the
                  department where the dressmaker was at work.
               "What kind of a man," said she, during a pause in Miss Gimp's tittle-tattle, "is
                  your carpenter? Harding, I believe, is his name."
               "Oh, a very bad sort of a man," promptly answered Miss Gimp. "The worst man I ever
                  knew."
               A slight shadow flitted over the countenance of Mrs. Beaufort, and there was a
                  perceptible huskiness in her voice as she said—
               "Bad in what way?"
               "Why in every way."
               "Bad-tempered?" inquired Mrs. Beaufort.
               "You'd think so, if you'd ever seen him among his children. He came near killing
                  his oldest boy two or three weeks ago."
               "How?"
               "He stole money, and lied, and played truant into the bargain. His father beat him
                  almost to death."
               "He did!"
               "Yes, indeed! The poor little fellow is only eight years old, and if he did do
                  wrong, wasn't to be treated like a dog or a vicious horse."
               Mrs. Beaufort sighed, and fell into a state of mental abstraction, from which the
                  dressmaker soon aroused her, by saying—
               "The strangest and saddest thing of all is, somebody left a little helpless infant
                  at their door not long since."
               Mrs. Beaufort started.
               "Well, what of it?" she said, partially averting her face.
               "What of it? They might as well have placed a lamb among wolves."
               "Your speak strongly, Miss Gimp." Mrs. Beaufort now fixed her eyes upon her with a
                  searching look. "Have you heard of their ill-treating the child?"
               "Not particularly," answered Miss Gimp. "The fact is, nobody hardly ever goes
                  there. But what are you to expect of
                  people who treat their own children as if they were wild animals, instead of human
                  beings?"
               "Have you seen the stranger baby of whom you speak?" inquired the lady.
               "Oh yes."
               "What kind of a baby is it?"
               "One born for a better lot than that which has been so cruelly assigned to it. The
                  mother who could desert that child had a heart of stone. It is the sweetest,
                  loveliest little darling that ever I saw; and everybody says the same."
               "Does no one suspect from whence it came?"
               Miss Gimp looked knowing, as she answered—
               "Every one has the liberty of guessing, you know, madam."
               "True. But what ground for guessing is there in the present case?"
               "We know one thing for certain," replied Miss Gimp. "It came not a hundred miles
                  from Beachwood."
               "Ah!"
               Mrs. Beaufort manifested some surprise.
               "What reason have you for saying this?"
               "The woman who left it at Harding's was seen."
               "Who saw her?"
               There was, on the part of Mrs. Beaufort, an evident desire to conceal the interest
                  she felt in the subject, which did not escape the quick penetration of Miss
                  Gimp.
               "Harry Wilkins, a neighbour of mine, saw her. He met her carrying a basket, as he
                  was going over to Beachwood. She acted strangely, and this caused him to notice
                  her. As he was returning home, he met her again, without the basket. It was on the
                  very evening the babe was found."
               "And that is all you know about it?" said Mrs. Beaufort, the earnestness of
                  manner, shown a little while before, all gone.
               "All I know now, certainly, but not all I expect to know," replied Miss Gimp.
                  "Harry Wilkins says that he got a good at the young woman's face, and that he
                  would know it again among thousands. He thought he saw her about two weeks ago,
                  and, if it hadn't been just where it was, he would have been sure of it."
               The interest of Mrs. Beaufort reawakened.
               "Where did he think he saw her?" she inquired.
               "Over at Clifton."
               Mrs. Beaufort started. The eyes of Miss Gimp were fixed intently upon the lady, in
                  whose face she read much more than Mrs. Beaufort wished to reveal. The two looked
                  earnestly at each other for some moments, and then their eyes fell to the floor.
                  Nearly a minute of silence followed. Mrs. Beaufort then said, with apparent
                  indifference—
               "Over at Clifton?"
               "Yes, ma'am. He was riding over there to see a man on some business, when, just as
                  he came in sight of the village, a carriage drove by, having in it two ladies. One
                  of them, he is almost sure, was the woman he saw on the night the child was found.
                  If her vail hadn't been partly over her face, he would have been in no doubt. He
                  says he turned his horse, and rode after the carriage until he saw where it
                  stopped."
               "He did?"
               "Yes ma'am."
               "Did he describe the house?"
               "Yes. It was a large, old-fashioned stone house, with beautiful grounds about
                  it."
               "Didn't he ask who lived there?"
               "Yes; but he forgot the name. He's going over there in a few weeks, and then he
                  will learn all he can about the people
                  who live in the house. So you see, ma'am, we're likely to find out something."
               Mrs. Beaufort made no answer, but sat lost in the tangled maze of her own thoughts
                  for a long time. Ever and anon the dressmaker would cast stealthy glances toward
                  her, but the lady seemed all unconscious of observation. Her face, now in repose,
                  and taking its hue from the tenor of her thoughts, was one to puzzle a wiser
                  physiognomist than Miss Gimp. Its expression, even, she could see, was bad—bad, as
                  indicating the long predominance of selfish purposes and an overmastering
                  self-will. And yet it contained traces of an old beauty. The lines were sharpened
                  by pride and passion, not rounded by a debasing sensuality. Yet was not all bad. A
                  softness about the delicately formed mouth and gently receding chin, showed that
                  all the true woman in her had not suffered obliteration. Without speaking, she at
                  length arose, and went from the apartment with a slow, stately step.
               "I'll read that riddle before I'm done with it," said the dressmaker, letting her
                  hands fall into her lap, the moment she was alone, and raising her body into an
                  erect position. "My lady knows all about this matter, or I'm mistaken. Let me see.
                  Clifton? Didn't Florence Barclay say something about her aunt's going back to
                  Clifton? Be sure, she did! I remember it now distinctly."
               What a light came into the shrivelled face of Miss Gimp!
               "And then" she continued, "what interest, I wonder, could a woman like her feel in
                  a man like Harding, if there were not something behind the curtain? How did
                     she know there was such a man? It's all clear as
                  daylight. I see it as plain as I do that butterfly on the window. I'll call at
                  Harry Wilkins', as soon as I go home, and tell him to be sure and find out the
                  name of them people the next time he goes over to Clifton. I wouldn't be much
                  afraid to bet"—
               The door opened, and Mrs. Beaufort re-entered. She had a silk dress in her hand,
                  one of the breadths of which had received an ugly fracture.
               "Can you mend that neatly for me?" said she, as she held the dress toward Miss
                  Gimp.
               The latter examined the rent.
               "The edges are very much frayed out; but I will do the best I can."
               "I would like you to do it now. I wish to wear the dress this afternoon."
               Miss Gimp laid aside the work on which she was engaged, and commenced repairing
                  the damaged silk, while Mrs. Beaufort sat by, looking on.
               "You think," said the latter, speaking as if she were continuing a conversation,
                  "that your neighbours will ill-treat the babe?"
               "If they ill-treat their own children, what can you hope for other people's that
                  fall into their hands? It's my opinion that the neighbours ought to take it away
                  from them, and send it to the poor-house; and I've said so from the beginning. But
                  what is everybody's business in nobody's business."
               "Is Harding getting along pretty well?" Mrs. Beaufort inquired, after a pause.
               "Men like him never get along well," answered the uncompromising dressmaker.
               "Isn't he a good workman?"
               "The best in twenty miles round, I've heard it said. But what does that
                  signify?"
               "Does he drink?"
               "He's seen too often at Stark's tavern, if that indicates any thing. I can't say
                  that he gets drunk; but you know to what tavern-going leads."
               
               "Is he at all beforehand in the world?" inquired the lady.
               "He's in debt at the store. Mrs. Willits told me this herself, and that her
                  husband was going to stop trusting him. That doesn't look very much to me as if he
                  was beforehanded."
               Mrs. Beaufort sighed gently, as if some unpleasant thought had flitted across her
                  mind. Then she changed the subject, and did not once again allude to it, even
                  remotely. After the torn dress was mended, she thanked Miss Gimp, with a reserved
                  and dignified air, and withdrew from the room. The dressmaker did not see her
                  again, and only learned, incidentally, that she left for her home on the next
                  morning.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE feeble aspirations for a better life, which had been awakened in the breast of
                  Jacob Harding, struggled not toward activity without frequent assaults from the
                  tempter. Too deeply interwoven, in the very texture of his moral nature, were evil
                  inclinations, made strong by long indulgence, for good to gain an easy victory.
                  His life, for years, had been one of disorder, internal as well as external; and
                  now, when there came to him faint and far-off glimpses of the beauty and
                  desirableness of order, virtue, and religion, the new creation—it could be nothing
                  less—seemed so near to an impossibility, that his heart bowed, at times,
                  hopeless—almost despairing.
               External causes of disturbance were added to the awakening conflict within. On
                  some days, every thing would go wrong with him, and he would return to his home,
                  when evening closed, in so fretted a state of mind, that his coming fell upon his
                  household like a shadow. But the shadow darkened only for a little while. The
                  presence of Grace was a perpetual sunshine; and even the dense clouds that
                  gathered, at times, around the carpenter's stormy spirit, could not shut out the
                  light and warmth diffused so genially around her. With the babe in his arms, or
                  lying against his breast, the enemies of his spirit assaulted him in vain. Deeply
                  disturbed though he might have been by the conflicts of the day, peace now folded
                  her wings in his heart. However much doubt and despondency, arising from worldly
                  disappointments, had overshadowed him with gloom, the soft cheek of the little one
                  was never laid against his own without his feeling a tranquil confidence that,
                  even as God was providing for the helpless innocent, so would he provide for him.
                  In the clear depths of her beautiful eyes, he always saw a light that seemed to
                  make plainer the way before him.
               But, had not the babe's influence been felt by others of his household, as well as
                  by himself, Harding would have struggled for self-conquest in vain. Happily, over
                  all, the silent power of her beauty and innocence continued to prevail; and, in a
                  marked degree, over Mrs. Harding. Thus, in the better life, up to which all were
                  voluntarily or involuntarily aspiring, a kind of equipoise was established. The
                  disturbed forces had received a new and better adjustment. One great gain on the
                  part of both Harding and his wife was this: each had learned to repress the
                  utterance of captious or ill-natured words. In former times, unkindness of thought
                  found ever a quick outbirth in harsh, exciting language, that never failed to
                  produce a storm of passion. These storms, and their often fearful ravages, each
                  remembered too well; and in the mind of
                  each was a sufficient dread of their recurrence to induce a watchful
                  self-control.
               Since the fearful night in which Andrew suffered so many terrors, there had been a
                  marked change in this wayward boy. Mr. Long, the schoolmaster, seeing the
                  impression that remained, and feeling for him a kind interest, made it a point to
                  notice him, and, as carefully and judiciously as was in his power, awaken and
                  foster his self-respect. At least once a week, he would drop in at the
                  carpenter's, and never failed, on these occasions, to speak a word in praise of
                  Andrew's good conduct and studiousness. The lad's gratified look, whenever this
                  was done, gave him broad ground of hope for the future.
               The change in Andrew was another readjusted weight in the balancing of moral
                  forces to which we have referred. Without this particular readjustment, the new
                  equipoise seen in the carpenter's family could hardly have been maintained. Little
                  trouble was required in the management of the younger children, now that Andrew's
                  baleful influence over them was, in a great measure, withdrawn; and this left a
                  diminished evil pressure on the temper of Mrs. Harding.
               A man like Jacob Harding is never a popular man. He is sure to offend in his
                  business intercourse with others, and to make enemies. Of the carpenter, there
                  were few to speak a good word, beyond the fact that no better workman than he was
                  to be found. This reputation had insured him work that otherwise would have found
                  its way to the shop of a better-natured, but in no way so reliable a mechanic, who
                  lived in Beechwood. But there are men who will sacrifice their interests quicker
                  than their feelings. Two of this class, who had employed the carpenter for some
                  years, and given him a good deal of work in that time, becoming offended in
                  consequence of some hasty words on the part of Harding, withdrew their patronage
                  and influence, and gave both to a young beginner in a neighbouring village. One of
                  these men was about erecting a handsome dwelling, for which Harding had furnished
                  a part of the plans, and in the building of which he hand expected to make a
                  better profit than usually fell to his share. On learning the decision that had
                  been made in favour of a rival workman, the carpenter was oppressed with a sense
                  of discouragement so great, that it seemed to him as if a high mountain were
                  suddenly thrown across his path. Not as had been usual with him, when things went
                  wrong, did he give way to a burst of passion, when the fact was announced that his
                  old customers had withdrawn their work.
               "All right," he answered, in a voice of forced calmness; and the messenger who
                  brought the intelligence left his shop, little dreaming that the seemingly unmoved
                  carpenter had wellnigh staggered under his words as if they had been heavy blows.
                  Upon these two customers, Harding had depended for the best of his season's work.
                  All his other engagements were of minor importance, and the profit to accrue
                  therefrom scarcely sufficed to provide food for his table. Of the causes leading
                  to this result he was by no means ignorant. In his last interview with both of the
                  parties, he had suffered himself to get very much annoyed at certain propositions
                  which he thought involved a question of his honesty. Rough and plain spoken, he
                  flung back upon them the fancied imputation in so offensive a manner as to make
                  them angry, and they left him under a good deal of excitement. This, he doubted
                  not, would pass off, and leave them ready to complete arrangements with him as
                  before. But the sequel showed his error.
               Never before had the carpenter's way seemed so closely hedged—never had he felt
                  such an oppressive sense of doubt and fear as he looked into the future. Work he had usually had in plenty. It
                  came crowding in upon him from all sides, and he was oftener worried on account of
                  its superabundance than concerned for its continuance. He had not always executed
                  with promptness; and to this fact might be traced one of the causes of his want of
                  thrift.
               It was nearly half an hour after this unpleasant intelligence had been received,
                  and Harding stood leaning on his work-bench, the chisel with which he had been
                  cutting a mortice resting idly in his hand, when a form darkened his shop-door,
                  and a familiar voice said—
               "Good afternoon, friend Harding!"
               The carpenter lifted his eyes, and met the pleasant, always cheerful face of Mr.
                  Long, the schoolmaster, who was on his way home after the close of his afternoon
                  session.
               "You seem troubled," said the latter. Harding had looked at him, without
                  replaying. "There's nothing wrong with you, I hope? I thought I'd just drop in to
                  say that Andrew is getting on finely."
               "I'm glad to hear it." There was a huskiness in the carpenter's voice, that
                  betrayed his unhappy state.
               "None of your family sick, I hope?" said Mr. Long, with a kind interest that won
                  upon the carpenter's feelings.
               "All reasonably well, I thank you."
               "Any thing wrong in your business?"
               "I' m sorry to say that there is," replied Harding. "I have just lost my whole
                  season's work."
               "How comes that?" said Mr. Long.
               "Two buildings that I had engaged have gone into the hands of another carpenter,
                  and I am left without a single contract of any importance."
               "This is bad," remarked the schoolmaster.
               "It is bad for a man in my situation, with a large family on his hands. What I am
                  to do, Heaven only Knows!"
               Mr. Long was struck with the tone of despondency in which these words were
                  uttered. Obeying the prompting impulse of the moment, he answered—
               "You may trust in Heaven, Mr. Harding. He that feedeth the ravens will not suffer
                  you to want."
               The words of the schoolmaster produced a momentary disturbance in the mind of
                  Harding, who replied, with some bitterness of manner—
               "Oh! as for me, I don't pretend to have any claims on Heaven."
               "All men," replied Mr. Long, "have claims on their Maker for things needful to
                  sustain life, and give them the ability to perform useful service in the world.
                  For these you may look with confidence. Providence never hedges up a man's way in
                  one direction, without seeing that it is opened in another. All will come out
                  right, neighbour Harding—never fear."
               "But I do fear," was the desponding answer. "To my knowledge, no one else is going
                  to build this summer. Unless there comes a hurricane, unroofing half a dozen barns
                  and houses, I see no chance of a sufficiency of work during the season."
               Harding said this with affected humour; yet his tones failed to conceal the
                  bitterness and distrust within.
               "Not a good direction for any one's thoughts to flow." said Mr. Long, seriously.
                  "Providence will open the way before you, I trust, without the aid of hurricanes,
                  or any other ministers of destruction."
               "I hope so; but I see little to encourage me."
               Even while the carpenter said this, a neighbouring farmer entered his shop, and
                  asked the question—
               "Are you very busy just now, Mr. Harding?"
               "Not particularly so," was answered.
               "Will you call over, and see me in the morning? I wish to talk with you about
                  putting a new roof on my barn. I did think of trusting it until next spring,
                     but I've been examining it rather
                  closely to-day, and don't think it will be safe to run the risk, especially as
                  there is every prospect of large crops this summer. In fact, I've decided to have
                  a new roof. So, if you'll call over tomorrow morning, we will arrange to have it
                  done."
               Harding promised to see the farmer bright and early on the next morning. Receiving
                  this assurance, the latter departed. The schoolmaster had remained during this
                  brief interview, and when the farmer left, remarked, with a smile—
               "It is true as I said, neighbour Harding. Providence never hedges up a man's way
                  in one direction, without opening it in another."
               "But what's the use of it all?" replied the carpenter. "I would call this kind of
                  business mere child's play. Smith's money is just as good as Jones's, and will buy
                  as much pork and corn meal. And as for the work, one job is about as easy as
                  another."
               "Did it never occur to you," said Mr. Long, "that in the dealings of Providence
                  with men, something beyond the provision of mere food and raiment was involved.
                  Have your thoughts never reached beyond the question of pork and corn meal?"
               "I don't understand you." The carpenter looked slightly bewildered.
               "Man has two lives," said Mr. Long: "a life of the body and a life of the mind. To
                  one of these lives had been appointed a comparatively short duration; the other is
                  unending."
               The carpenter leaned his head in an attitude of attention; seeing which, Mr. Long
                  continued—
               "God is an eternal being; and it is plain, from the fact that he has given to the
                  spirit of man an eternal existence, that he must regard the wants and destiny of
                  the spirit as in every way of primary account, when compared with the wants and
                  destiny of the body. Let this thought find a distinct resting-place in your mind,
                  neighbour Harding, and then you will begin to have some glimpses of higher
                  truths."
               The schoolmaster paused for some moments, in order to let his words make their due
                  impression.
               "From which have you suffered most in life?" resumed Mr. Long. "From sickness of
                  the body, or sickness of the mind?"
               "Sickness of the mind?" Harding did not clearly apprehend the question; and the
                  schoolmaster modified it thus—
               "I should have said, from pain of body, or pain of mind?"
               "I've never had much sickness," said Harding, beginning to have a dim perception
                  of the schoolmaster's meaning.
               "And yet you have suffered deeply. Mentally—or in your spirit—you were in great
                  pain only a little while ago."
               "True, very true." The carpenter spoke partly to himself, as if new thoughts were
                  coming into distinct perception. "Yes, indeed, I have suffered pain of mind. I
                  always suffer pain of mind. As for bodily suffering, I can bear that; but mental
                  suffering drives me, at times, almost beside myself."
               "Did you never think of this before?" asked the schoolmaster; "that is, did you
                  never separate so distinctly, in thought, your mind from your body, and see in
                  each a distinct capacity for pleasure and pain?"
               "Never. And yet it seems strange how I could have failed to do so."
               "If pain of mind is more acute than pain of body," said Mr. Long, "is it not fair
                  to conclude that the mind, or spirit, is capable of far higher pleasures than the
                  body?"
               "Yes, I suppose that it is."
               "Let us take it for granted—and this is no difficult matter—that God, our Creator,
                  Preserver, and Redeemer deemer, is a
                  Being of infinite benevolence—that love is his essential nature: it will follow as
                  a consequence, that he not only desires, but seeks the good of his creatures. You
                  are one of this number; and one toward whom his heart must be moved with pity, for
                  your spirit had suffered much. Thus far in life, you have known little of the
                  enjoyment that God desires for all the children of men. Vainly have you sought for
                  pleasure in sensual delights: they have proved only serpents to sting you. What a
                  dark, weary was it has been to you!"
               "Yes, dark as Egypt at times," muttered the carpenter.
               "Let us go back a little," said the schoolmaster. "It is plain, that in the way
                  you have been going, matters have not improved much. You are no happier now than
                  you were six months ago."
               "I don't know about that," answered Harding. "I don't know about that. Maybe you
                  may think me foolish, but I can't help it. Since that strange baby came into our
                  family, I have felt like another man. I don't know how it is, but the dear little
                  thing has crept right into my heart, and brought with it something of its pure and
                  gentle nature. The truth is, Mr. Long, I'm not the same man I was before Heaven
                  sent that child to my door."
               "Heaven sent it. You have used the right words, neighbour Harding. All good gifts
                  are from Heaven In love to you, God bestowed this blessing; not to give ease, or
                  comfort, or pleasure to your body, but for the health and joy of your spirit. Ah!
                  I am glad to hear this confession from your lips. And now let me suggest a
                  thought. May not the disappointment you have suffered to-day, and which was for a
                  time so bitter, be productive of higher benefits than any you could have received,
                  had all things gone according to your wishes?"
               "I do not see your meaning clearly," said the carpenter.
               "Our present conversation would otherwise hardly have occurred," suggested Mr.
                  Long.
               "No; I think not."
               "Is it not clear, then? Think."
               "Perhaps you are right," said Harding, in a thoughtful manner. "You have certainly
                  filled my mind with new ideas. Come over and see me in the evening sometimes,
                  won't you? I'd like to talk with you again of these things. They sound
                  strangely—and yet my mind assents to them as true."
               "Nothing is truer" replied the schoolmaster, "than that the eyes of God are over
                  all his works, and that he leadeth his erring creatures by ways that they know
                  not, ever seeking to bring them from the darkness of natural evil into pure light
                  of his truth. And thus he is seeking to lead you, neighbour Harding. Ah! resist
                  not, but gently yield yourself to the divine guidance. But I have said enough for
                  the present. Yes, I will call over and see you, and if you still find interest in
                  these subjects, we will talk of them again."
               What a change had taken place with the carpenter in the brief space of half an
                  hour!—a change from deep agitation of mind, and a paralyzing distrust, to a calm
                  and hopeful spirit. Not to the fact of work having come from an unexpected
                  quarter, was this chiefly to be ascribed. That was but the foundation, so to
                  speak, on which a higher and juster conception of Providence had been erected. His
                  step was firmer, his head more elevated, and his countenance marred by fewer lines
                  of care, as he took his way homeward. No shadow fell across the threshold as he
                  entered; and no heart shrunk with fear at the sound of his voice, that seemed to
                  have found new tones and gentle modulations.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE schoolmaster's words, only dimly apprehended at first, lingered in the mind of
                  Harding; and, as he pondered them, new suggestions came, and new light seemed to
                  break in upon him. There was a higher and better life than the life of the
                  body—wants that no natural sources could supply—sufferings that no earthly
                  physician could alleviate. How clear all this became the longer his mind rested on
                  what his neighbour had said! and he half wondered that, until now, no perception
                  of such important truths had come to him.
               Happily, all things at home harmonized with the carpenter's state of mind on that
                  evening. Andrew he found, on his return, busy over his lesson; Lucy had dear
                  little Grace in her arms; and Lotty and Philip, who rarely disagreed if no one
                  interfered with them, were playing together, and singing to themselves as happily
                  as if nothing had ever ruffled the quiet surface of their feelings. The influence
                  of Mr. Long over Andrew, since his particular interest in him had been awakened,
                  and since he had discovered the right avenue by which to reach his feelings, was
                  remarkable. Having secured the good opinion of Mr. Long—to have the good opinion
                  of any one was a new experience for the lad—Andrew was particularly desirous to
                  retain it. A kind look—an approving word—what ample rewards were they for all
                  effort and self-denial! In these he found a pleasure far above any thing that evil
                  indulgence or wrong-doing gave; and, best of all, they left no sad, painful
                  after-consequences.
               "That's right, Andrew," said Mr. Harding, approvingly provingly, as he came in and
                  saw how the boy was occupied. "It gives me real pleasure to see you studying your
                  lessons."
               What a glow of delight did these words send to the heart of the boy! What a
                  beaming smile irradiated his countenance, as he looked up, gratefully, into his
                  father's face!
               Mr. Harding laid his hand gently upon Andrew's head. The act was involuntary, and
                  sprung from a passing mood of gentler feeling. How the touch thrilled along every
                  nerve in the child's being! Memory was at fault in her efforts to recall the time
                  when that hand rested upon him in affectionate approval before. Lower bent his
                  head, and closer to his face was the book lifted. None saw that his eyes were
                  suddenly dimmed, and none but he knew that the page before him was wetted by a
                  tear.
               A cry of pleasure from the babe now greeted the ears of Harding; and, in the next
                  moment, Grace was in his arms, and hugged tightly to his heart. At this instant, a
                  shadow fell across the threshold—the twilight was already gathering—and the
                  strange woman, who had visited them a few weeks previously, stood in the door. Her
                  dark, keen eyes took in the whole scene presented to her at a glance.
               "Good evening, friends," she said, half familiarly, half respectfully; and,
                  without invitation, she entered.
               "Good evening, madam," returned Harding, approaching her by a step or two. Grace
                  had laid her head close against his breast, and was nestling there with a happy,
                  confiding look on her sweet young face.
               "Will you take a chair, madam?"
               The chair was proffered and accepted. At the same time, the woman laid off her
                  bonnet.
               "You were so kind at my last visit, that I hardly feel like a stranger," said she,
                  as she adjusted her cap, and pushed
                  back under it a portion of her black hair, in which gray lines were visible.
               "That dear babe, again," she added, as she fixed her eyes intently on Grace. "I
                  never saw a lovelier creature."
               Mrs. Harding entered, at this moment, from the kitchen, where she had been
                  preparing supper. At sight of the woman, she started, and looked disturbed.
               "Good evening, ma'am."
               The stranger fixed her eyes penetratingly upon her.
               "Good evening," was coldly replied.
               "In passing this way again, I could not resist the inclination to call, if for no
                  other reason than to thank you for your former kindness, and to apologize for my
                  abrupt departure. It was necessary for me to be at Beechwood at a very early hour,
                  and I did not wish to disturb you, or tax your hospitality for an early
                  breakfast."
               The blandness and easy self-possession with which this was said, in a measure
                  overcame the instinctive repugnance of Mrs. Harding. Still, she did not like the
                  woman, and felt ill at ease in her presence. With as good a grace as possible, she
                  bade her welcome. From the woman's manner, it was evidently her intention to
                  remain to supper, and, in all probability, through the night. Indeed, she soon
                  intimated this to the carpenter and his wife, who could do no less than invite her
                  to remain with as much show of cordiality as possible. The object of her visit was
                  matter of little question to them. Too distinct was their remembrance of her
                  conduct on a previous occasion—and of the intimations then given by her—to leave
                  any room to doubt that she had a personal interest in Grace, and now came solely
                  on this account.
               All eye and all ear was the stranger to every thing that passed in the family of
                  Jacob Harding. The carpenter's face she scanned with so close a scrutiny, that he
                  often found his eyes drooping beneath the singular gaze that was fixed upon him.
                  The movements of Mrs. Harding were also closely observed, and not a word passed
                  between the children that she did not weigh its meaning.
               Whether it were from the presence of this dignified stranger, or from the subduing
                  effects of better states of mind, the children were unusually well-behaved and
                  orderly during supper-time. Lucy proposed to wait and be the nurse of Grace during
                  the meal; although her mother said that she could hold the babe and attend the
                  table well enough.
               After supper, the woman succeeded, after many ineffectual attempts, in alluring
                  Grace from Mr. Harding. The little one looked half frightened as she passed to the
                  arms of the stranger, and then immediately reached out her hands to go back. But,
                  being retained, her lips began to curve, and a low murmur of fear was audible.
               "Come back, then, darling!" said the carpenter, lovingly; and he took her from the
                  woman almost by force. What a happy change was seen instantly in the sweet young
                  face, and with what a manifest joy did the little one shrink to the manly breast,
                  and cling there as if it had found a home of safety!
               "You love that child?" said the woman. Her tones were grave, and her proud lips
                  firm.
               "Yes; better than any thing in this world."
               "It is not your own child?" added the woman.
               "It is mine by the gift of God," said the carpenter, with a depth of feeling in
                  his voice that surprised his auditor. "Some one—I do not think she is worthy the
                  name of woman—deserted it at our door."
               The woman moved uneasily, and partly averted her face.
               "Abandoned," continued the carpenter, "by her to whom God had given a precious
                  gift, the guardianship was transferred
                  to us. We have accepted it gladly—thankfully. And who will now dare
                  say the child is not ours? Such words must not be spoken here!"
               The natural warmth of Harding's temperament betrayed him into an indignant
                  vehemence, which caused the woman to shrink back from him a little way, and to
                  look surprised, almost fearful.
               "We cannot hear such words spoken," repeated the carpenter, in a gentler voice.
                  "God sent an angel to our household when he sent this babe; and we have made room
                  for her—room for her in our home, and room for her in our hearts."
               The woman sat for some time with her eyes upon the floor. She was evidently in
                  deep thought.
               "Rather say"—thus she spoke in a low voice—"that God lent her to
                  you—lent her, it may be, only for a little while. It is not well to fix the heart
                  too idolizingly upon a child. What if her real mother were to come and claim her
                  at your hands?"
               "There is her true mother," said the carpenter, firmly, and he
                  pointed toward his wife. "A woman gave her life, but she gave her
                     love—a mother's love. Her real mother! Madam! I would
                  spurn from the door the wretch who dared say that she brought into existence this
                  sweet young cherub, and then abandoned her to perish, or, mayhap, find an
                  unwelcome home among strangers."
               "Can an evil tree produce good fruit?" asked the woman, looking at the excited
                  carpenter almost sternly.
               "It is said not," he replied.
               "Could an evil-hearted mother give birth to so angelic a babe? Think, Mr.
                  Harding."
               "Could a good-hearted woman abandon her nursing infant? Think, madam."
               The woman's glance cowered beneath the steady eyes of the carpenter.
               "Can a sweet fountain send forth bitter waters?" The man spoke half to himself.
                  "No—no—no."
               "State the case as you will," said the woman, "and the difficulty is the same.
                  Here is a babe in which all goodness seems concentrated—I cannot believe, nor can
                  you, that the mother who gave it birth was all evil."
               "Why did she abandon it?" replied the carpenter.
               "Ah! there lies the question. Do you know?"
               "You need not ask."
               "She may not have acted freely. There may have been an array of circumstances that
                  crushed out, for a time, her true life. I can more easily believe this, than that
                  her heart was all evil. The baby in your arms contradicts that assumption."
               "Mercy!"
               This was the startled exclamation of Mrs. Harding, as she arose quickly to her
                  feet. Her eyes were fixed on the door, which had swung slowly open. Every glance
                  followed her own. A beautiful young woman, with face as white as marble, stood
                  there, motionless—statue-like. That face the carpenter's wife remembered but too
                  well. She had seen it once before, as it stood out on the background of darkness,
                  and every feature was daguerreotyped on her memory.
               "Edith! You here! What madness! Go! go!"
               The woman started up, and raising both hands, motioned her energetically to be
                  gone.
               "Baby! baby! Oh, my sweet baby!"
               And the young creature bounded forward. Ere the bewildered carpenter had time to
                  recover his self-possession, she had lifted Grace from his arms, and was hugging
                  her wildly to her heart.
               "Oh baby! Grace! Darling!" What a passionate tenderness was in her voice! "I was
                  wicked, wicked, wicked to give you up! But you are once more against my heart, and we will live or die
                  together! Baby! Sweet one! Oh! darling! darling!"
               She had moved about the room like one half crazed; but now, as a shower of tears
                  fell over her face, she dropped into a chair, and leaning over the child, which
                  she held close to her bosom, she mingled kisses, sobs, and tears, for some
                  minutes, in a very tempest of emotion.
               Meantime, the elder of the two women showed strong agitation, that was repressed
                  only by a vigorous effort. Now her face was dark with struggling passion; and now
                  so pale and ghastly, that it seemed as if her very life's love were suffering its
                  final assault. As soon as the first bewildering excitement was over, she went up
                  to the young woman, and laying her hand upon her with a firm grasp, said, in a
                  tone of remonstrance—
               "What madness has come over you, Edith? Give back the child, and come away. It is
                  as well cared for as you or I could desire."
               The other waved her hand with an imperative gesture as she replied—
               "It is useless, mother! My resolve is taken. I will not part with my child. Mine
                  it is—mine, born in lawful wedlock, and there is no earthly power strong enough to
                  drag it from my arms. You may turn from me, if you will. You may shut up your
                  heart against me; but mine shall be open to may child—my darling, darling child!
                  Sweet, sweet baby!"
               And she again hugged it to her heart.
               "The fountain is not dry yet, love," she murmured, in a low, tender voice, as she
                  bared her bosom, and drew the babe's soft face against it. "Drink again—drink! I
                  have kept it open for this hour—this hour that my heart told me would come—must
                  come. There—there. Drink, baby—drink. Drink, and God bless you!"
               And as the babe commenced drawing sweet life from this fountain of life, the
                  mother's eyes were lifted heavenward. Her cheeks glowed, and a thrill of exquisite
                  joy trembled along every fibre of her soul.
               "Father," she sobbed, "let my tears and thankfulness for this hour of restoration,
                  obliterate the record that darkens one page of my life's sad history."
               This scene was more than the woman she called her mother could witness unsubdued.
                  Hitherto her imperious will had ruled her complying child. But nature—free
                  nature—had now asserted her right, and swept aside all opposing forces. In Edith's
                  heart, the mother's love was stronger than the daughter's fear.
               "Edith, what am I to understand by all this?" said the woman, speaking with a
                  resolute calmness.
               "That I am ready to give up all for my child."
               "Give up me?"
               The woman held her breath for an answer. Edith did not reply, but bent lower over
                  her babe, and drew it closer to her heart.
               "Give up me?" repeated the woman.
               "Mother! As God liveth, I will keep this child. If you turn from me—if you cast me
                  off—well; but, as God liveth, I will keep my child!"
               For a little while the frame of the other quivered, as if attacked by a sudden
                  ague fit. Then stepping back a pace or two, she stood a few moments irresolute.
                  The door of the adjoining room was partly open. Into this she now passed with a
                  quick movement. A struggle had commenced that she wished to sustain all apart from
                  observation. Nearly ten minutes elapsed before her reappearance. Scarcely a change
                  of position or relation had occurred during her brief absence. Her face was very
                  calm, her step deliberate, and her manner self-possessed, like one who had passed
                  from doubtful questionings to a certainty.
               
               Going up to her daughter, she laid her hand again upon her, saying, as she did
                  so—
               "Edith, my child!"
               The voice was low, calm, and even tender.
               "Mother!"
               It was the bowed creature's simple response. She did not look up.
               "Edith, I may have erred—I know not. If so, it has been for your sake. Love and
                  pride have both been strong. But we will content no longer. In the future, your
                  own heart must lead you: I will oppose nothing."
               An electric thrill seemed suddenly to awaken the half-dormant sensibilities of the
                  young mother. She looked up with a blending of joy and surprise in her
                  countenance.
               "What do I hear? Speak the words again."
               "We will contend no longer, Edith. In the future, your own heart must lead you: I
                  will oppose nothing."
               The eyes of Edith closed as she leaned her head back against her mother, whose arm
                  now clasped her. How placid was her pale young face!—how soft, and tender, and
                  loving the sweet lips just parting with a smile!
               "You have made me happy. Can a mother ask more for her child?"
               It was all she said; but the words went trembling down into the agitated heart of
                  that strong, self-willed woman of the world, and accomplished their mission.
               A kiss—long and fervent—sealed the reconciliation and new compact.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               WHILE this scene was passing, little Lotty had crept into her mother's lap, and
                  was lying with her head close against her bosom. Since Grace came among them,
                  Lotty had found a new pleasure. She never tired of being with the babe, and the
                  babe never seemed happier than when Lotty was bending over her, and talking to her
                  in a language that only they understood.
               "Is she going to take Grace away from us?" she whispered two or three times to her
                  mother, as she looked on wonderingly, yet with an instinct of the truth.
               Mrs. Harding did not reply, for she could not; but, at each renewal of the
                  question, her arm drew, with an involuntary pressure, the little one closer to her
                  breast.
               "I'll be your little Grace, mother."
               These words, so unexpected, thrilled a new chord in her heart.
               "Grace is so sweet and so good," she answered, more from impulse than thought. The
                  words were scarcely uttered, ere she felt that they were spoken unwisely.
               "I will try to be good."
               There was a pleading softness in Lotty's tones that touched the mother's
                  sensibilities. She was asking for a love, deeper, purer, truer than she had ever
                  known—such a love as she had seen given to another.
               "I will try to be good, mother. I will try to be like Grace. But they won't take
                  her away, will they, mother?"
               "I hope not, dear."
               "If they do, mother, shan't I be your little Grace?"
               
               "Yes, if you will be good, like Grace."
               "I can't be good just like her. But I'll try, mother. And you won't scold me so,
                  will you, mother? Talk to me sweet and good, just as you talk to Grace—won't you,
                  mother?"
               And now the child's arms were stealing around the neck of Mrs. Harding, and her
                  eyes were looking up into her face, pleading and filled with tears.
               What language could have been more rebuking, more softening, more subduing? It
                  penetrated to the very inmost of her consciousness. Her only answer was a strong
                  embrace. How her heart enlarged toward Lotty!
               "You will love me, mother, if I'm good?"
               The child was not satisfied with mere dumb show.
               "Oh yes, my dear one!" answered Mrs. Harding, in a voice whose tenderness
                  satisfied the heart of Lotty. "I will love you. Be a good little girl, and I will
                  love you just as well as I love Grace."
               "I will be so good, mother," murmured the happy little one, as she
                  hid her face, and wept for very joy.
               Thus she was lying, when the elder of the two strangers, turning from her
                  daughter, between whom and herself so singular a reconciliation had taken place,
                  said, addressing Mr. Harding in a calm voice—
               "My friend, there was a meaning in the words I spoke a little while ago, that went
                  beyond my own thoughts. This young woman—the mother of Grace—is my child. I did
                  not expect her here this evening—nothing could have been farther from my
                  anticipations. I knew that she was almost dying to see her child—to have it again
                  in her arms, and I feared that its restoration might become necessary. Why she
                  abandoned it at your door, cannot now be explained; neither can we reveal who we
                  are, or where we came from. That secret, for the present, must remain with
                  ourselves. Enough, that the child is ours, and now returns to its true home and
                  its true mother. You and your excellent wife will never be forgotten. My daughter
                  has a heart that can feel gratitude—bad as you have pronounced her—and this you
                  will, ere long, know. Let me ask of you one thing, and that is, silence as to the
                  occurrences of this evening."
               The carpenter sat with his eyes upon the floor, during all the time that the woman
                  was speaking.
               As she ceased, he arose, and crossing the room, stood before the young woman, who
                  still held Grace in her arms.
               Reaching out his hands, and smiling, he said, in a voice of tender persuasion—
               "Come, Grace—come, love—come."
               The little one lifted her head from the woman's breast, bent toward the carpenter,
                  and smiled, in return, one of her sweetest, most loving smiles. The woman
                  instantly drew the child back, while a shade of fear went over her
                  countenance.
               "Don't be alarmed, madam," said the carpenter, in a respectful voice. "If she will
                  come, let her come. You may take her again. Grace, darling! Sweet one! Come!"
               Again the babe raised herself up, and leaned toward the carpenter. Again she
                  smiled sweetly, fluttered her tiny hands, and seemed anxious to get into his arms.
                  He reached out for her; but just as she seemed ready to spring to him, her eyes
                  wandered up to the loving face, so full of unutterable tenderness, that bent over
                  her; and then she fell back upon the bosom she knew to be her mother's.
               A shadow darkened on the carpenter's face.
               "Come, darling!" he repeated, extending his hands.
               She lifted her head again, stretched out her arms, and in the next instant was
                  tightly clasped to the carpenter's bosom.
               
               "Heaven bless you, sweet one! Bless you! bless you! An angel of love you have been
                  to us all! How can we give you up? Oh! no, no! It must not be! God gave you to us;
                  and shall we let any but the death-angel take you away?"
               The mother had started to her feet, and was now moving by the side of Harding, as
                  he paced about the room, her face full of alarm and anxiety.
               "Oh, sir! give me back my babe!" she cried, in a voice of deep supplication.
                  "Grace! Darling! Come to your mother!"
               Harding paused, and, by an effort, repressed the strong upheaving of emotion. As
                  he relaxed the tight clasp of his arms, the little one raised her head, and now
                  reached out her hands toward her mother.
               "Go back, then," he said, kissing her tenderly. "Go back. I cannot say nay, if it
                  is in both your hearts."
               As Grace returned, with a baby murmur of joy, to her mother's arms, the
                  carpenter's strength seemed to leave him, and he sunk into a chair, where for some
                  time he remained, with his head drooped upon his breast. From this state he was
                  aroused by hearing the elder of the two women say, addressing her daughter—
               "You came in the carriage?"
               "Yes."
               "How far is it away?"
               "About a quarter of a mile, on the road to Beechwood."
               "It is growing late. We must leave here."
               "You will not leave to-night?" said Harding, as he arose and came forward.
               "Oh yes; we must go," was answered.
               "To that I cannot consent"—the carpenter spoke firmly—"unless you go alone."
               "Alone!"
               The mother of Grace looked frightened.
               "Yes—alone. Did you think for an instant, that I would stand passive and see her
                  taken away by strangers, no matter what their claim? If so, you have mistaken
                  Jacob Harding. Who are you? Where do you live? These are questions that must be
                  fully answered."
               There was a manly dignity about the carpenter that compelled respect, and a
                  firmness of manner that showed him to be entirely in earnest.
               The two woman looked at each other with troubled glances.
               "You shall know all in good time," said the elder.
               "Now is the good time," was answered. "Believe me, when I say, that I love that
                  babe too well, to trust her even with her mother, when all the past is considered,
                  unless I know where to find that mother. I must hold you both to a higher
                  responsibility than your own conscience."
               "What is to be done?" almost sobbed the distressed young woman. "Oh that I were
                  once more at home with my babe! Kind sir"—and she turned to the carpenter with a
                  pleading look—"do let us go. I have the means of being generous to you, and I will
                  be generous. Gratitude for you kindness to my child has already suggested ample
                  benefits. Oh, sir! withdraw your opposition. There are reasons why we desire to
                  remain for the present unknown. Say that we may leave, and I will never cease to
                  ask for you Heaven's choicest blessings."
               "It cannot be," said the carpenter, with unwavering firmness. "That child never
                  leaves here unless I know all about those who take her away. Rely upon it, nothing
                  will turn me from this purpose."
               The two women now communed with each other, apart, for some minutes. The elder
                  then approached Harding, and said—
               "My name is Hartley; and I live in Overton."
               
               There was an unsteadiness of voice and eye as she spoke, that did not escape the
                  carpenter's notice.
               "It will not do," replied Harding, shaking his head.
               "What will do, then?" exclaimed the woman, in a quick, demanding
                  voice.
               Her whole manner changed. The fretted will, so used to reaching its purposes in
                  spite of all hinderances, could tamely brook this opposition no longer.
               Five times did Jacob Harding pace the room backward and forward before answering.
                  Then pausing before the woman, who had remained standing, he said—
               "One thing I have fully decided."
               "What?"
               The woman spoke eagerly.
               "That Grace does not leave here to-night."
               "Oh sir, don't say that!" cried the younger of the two strangers. Her pale face
                  blanched whiter.
               "I have said it, and will not change," answered the carpenter. "You can both
                  remain if you will. We will give you the best accommodations our poor abode can
                  offer. As for me, I want time to consider this matter. It is far too weighty to
                  receive a hurried decision. I must have a night's sleep upon it."
               "Oh, for patience!" exclaimed the elder of the women. "You may repent this, sir!
                  You know not whose will you are thwarting.
               "I confess my ignorance," said Harding, with a shade of irony in his voice; "and
                  therefore it is that I hesitate, and choose to act with circumspection."
               "We cannot remain here to-night. Impossible!"
               "Very well. You will find us all here to-morrow, or the day after."
               Seeing that Harding was not to be moved, the two women drew together in a distant
                  part of the room, and remained in whispered conversation for a long time.
               "My daughter cannot be induced to leave her child," said the mother, as she left
                  Edith, and came forward to where Harding was now seated by his wife. "She will,
                  therefore, remain, at least, until to-morrow. Then, I trust, you will permit her
                  to depart with her babe. Further hinderance on your part will be cruelty. Think of
                  what she has already suffered, and spare her further anguish. As for me, I will go
                  to-night."
               "You are welcome to stay, if it so please you," returned the carpenter.
               "My daughter's health has been feeble for some time," said the woman, "and she is
                  now quite overcome by fatigue and excitement. If you will let her retire early,
                  she will take it as a kindness."
               Mrs. Harding arose at this time, and laying the now sleeping Lotty in her father's
                  arms, passed from the room. In a few minutes she returned, and said the chamber
                  was ready, if the lady wished to retire. The mother and her daughter went in
                  together, and shut the door behind them. Mrs. Harding intended to enter the room
                  also, but the door closed so quickly, that she was left without. For a moment or
                  two she stood confused and undecided. Then turning to her husband, she said—
               "Jacob, what is to be done? How can we give her up?"
               "We will not, unless we know more of these persons than we now do," replied
                  Harding.
               "It is her mother," said Mrs. Harding.
               "Yes; that is plain. But who and what is she?"
               "If we only knew."
               "We must know." Harding spoke firmly. "Not until I have the fullest intelligence
                  in regard to them, will I consent to let them have the child. Hark! what is
                  that?"
               The carpenter listened.
               "What do you hear?"
               
               Mrs. Harding was startled by her husband's manner.
               "I thought I heard a noise."
               "What was it like?"
               "I don't know."
               Both listened for some moments.
               "Where was it?"
               "I can't tell whether it was in the house or out doors. It was nothing, probably.
                  I'm excited."
               Still they listened in a kind of breathless suspense.
               "I wonder if they have fastened that door: they are very still," said the
                  carpenter.
               Mrs. Harding stepped lightly to the door, and tried the lock.
               "It is fastened," she whispered back.
               "They must have turned the bolt very silently," remarked Harding. "Suppose you
                  knock, and ask if they want any thing."
               Mrs. Harding tapped gently. There was no answer She tapped again, but louder.
                  Still all remained silent within. She now rattled the lock, and called to the
                  inmates. The answer was fruitless: no answer to her summons was returned.
               "I don't like this," said Harding, starting up, and advancing to the door, against
                  which he threw his body with a force that broke the fastenings within. As the door
                  swung open, his eyes rested upon the open window. In an instant, all was
                  comprehended. Flinging the sleeping child he held in his arms upon the untumbled
                  bed, he sprung through the open window, and disappeared in the darkness.
               "A quarter of a mile from here, on the road to Beechwood." He remembered these
                  words, and ran swiftly in that direction, hoping to overtake the fugitives. The
                  sky was overclouded, and the night intensely dark. In vain the eye sought to
                  penetrate the thick vail of shadows. For more than half a mile, Harding pursued
                  his way toward Beechwood, and then stopped, with a heart-sickening consciousness
                  that longer search in that direction was hopeless. Returning with rapid steps, he
                  swept around in a wide circle, vainly seeking for the two women who had
                  disappeared so noiselessly, taking with them the dear angel of the household. But
                  all was of no avail. Under cover of the darkness, they had effected their escape.
                  After an hour spent in fruitless search, he came back, looking pale and
                  distressed. To the eager questionings of his tearful wife, he only answered—
               "Gone! gone! and not a trace of them left behind!" dropping into a chair as he
                  spoke, and trembling from exhaustion of body and mind.
               "Oh, Jacob! Jacob!" It was all the heart-stricken wife could say, as she leaned
                  over him, and wept bitterly.
               "Mary," said the carpenter, after he had grown calmer, "I have never had any thing
                  to hurt me like this. It seems almost as if a hand were grasping my heart, and
                  striving to tear it from my breast. Dear baby! And to lose her thus! I cannot bear
                  it, Mary!"
               "If we only knew where she was; if we could go to her sometimes," sobbed Mrs.
                  Harding.
               "If she had died and passed up into heaven," said the carpenter. "But to be stolen
                  from us, and taken, we know not where, perhaps to be abandoned again, and to
                  suffer, who can tell, what cruel treatment! Oh! the thought drives me half
                  distracted."
               "I do not think, Jacob, that her mother will part with her again. She loves her
                  child too deeply. My heart ached, as I looked at her, to think of what she must
                  have borne since she tore it from her bosom, and left it at our door. I wonder
                  that she was not bereft of reason. For her sake, I will try to bear the pain I
                  feel. Oh! if I only knew that all would be well with the babe."
               "That I must know, Mary," replied the carpenter, with regained firmness. "The woman said her name
                  was Hartley, and they lived at Overton. This may be true or false; but to Overton
                  I will go early in the morning. If the statement prove false, so much is settled,
                  and I can turn with more confidence my eyes in another direction. Of one thing I
                  am certain—they do not live very far from Beechwood."
               As best they could, the carpenter and his wife sought to console each other, and,
                  in the act, drew closer together in heart, and felt a mutual sympathy. How
                  deserted the house seemed to them! and their chamber, when they retired for the
                  night, felt lonely and cheerless. If the baby had died, and, a little while
                  before, been carried forth from that room to its mortal resting place, the feeling
                  of sadness and desolation that oppressed them could not have been stronger. Sleep
                  did not visit their pillows early. They were kept awake by thoughts of the sweet
                  babe that had so grown into their hearts, that it seemed a part of their life.
                  But, at last, their heavy eyelids closed, and then this dream came to Mrs.
                  Harding:—
               She was sitting in her own chamber, with an infant lying close against her bosom.
                  It had soft, brown, silken hair, curling in glossy circles about its forehead and
                  temples, and eyes down into whose blue depths she gazed until it seemed that
                  heaven was opening to her vision. It was not Grace—not the angel babe whose coming
                  and going were shrouded in mystery—but a new gift to her mother's heart. Full of
                  love and joy she bent over the lovely innocent, while her spirit uplifted itself
                  in thankfulness for a boon so precious. As she sat thus, a pale, sweet-faced woman
                  entered, also clasping an infant in her arms. She knew them both at a glance—the
                  mother of Grace, with her newly-regained treasure in her arms. Coming up slowly to
                  Mrs. Harding, she stood, for some moments, gazing upon her with a tender smile.
                  Then her lips parted with the words—
               "Our household angels!"
               A thrill of such exquisite pleasure went through the sleeper's mind, that she
                  awoke. Lotty was in her arms, and she drew her to her heart with a feeling of
                  maternal tenderness deeper than she had ever known for her child.
               "I'll be your little Grace, mother."
               The words seemed spoken in her ears again, and she raised herself up to see if
                  Lotty were not really waking. But no: Lotty was in the world of dreams.
               "Bless you, my baby!" murmured Mrs. Harding, as she laid her lips against the warm
                  cheek of the sleeper. "You shall be my little Grace."
               "Dear mother! I will be good if you will love me."
               She was dreaming.
               Gathering her little one closer in here arms, Mrs. Harding lifted her voice to
                  heaven, and prayed that she might be to her children a true mother. And her
                  prayer, rising from an earnest, yearning heart, did not return to her
                  fruitless.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               "QUICK!" ejaculated the elder of the two women, as she closed the door of the
                  little chamber into which the carpenter's wife had shown them, and slipped the
                  bolt silently. Gliding past her half-bewildered daughter, she raised the window,
                  which opened only a few feet from the ground, and springing out with the agility
                  of a girl, was ready to help Edith through the narrow way of egress they had
                  chosen.
               "Quick! quick! Step lightly."
               And the mother drew her arm around the slender form of Edith, and bore her onward
                  as if she had been only a child. Sweeping around the house, the two women gained
                  the road that passed only at a short distance from the door, and then pressed
                  forward, as fast as the darkness would permit, in the direction of Beechwood. They
                  were only a short distance away from the carpenter's dwelling, when the young
                  woman said, in a voice of alarm—
               "Hark! What is that?"
               Both paused to listen, and instantly became aware, by the sound of swiftly
                  approaching footsteps, that they were pursued.
               "O mother! what shall we do?" said Edith, in a frightened voice.
               Her companion answered not, but passing an arm around her waist, drew her off from
                  the road to a clump of bushes that opportunely offered a place of concealment.
                  Behind this they crouched just in time to hide their figures, which, from portions
                  of white in their garments, would, in all probability, have attracted the eyes of
                  Harding, whom they doubted not to be the individual approaching with such hasty
                  speed. He passed within only a few feet of them—so near, that his muttered words
                  reached their ears.
               "Come," said the elder of the women, as soon as Harding's heavy footsteps sounded
                  faint in the distance.
               "Not that way," objected her daughter.
               "Why not?" was sharply inquired.
               "He has just passed."
               "Is not the carriage in this direction?"
               "Yes."
               "Concealed in the woods?"
               "Yes."
               "He will not find it, but we must. Come! In this deep darkness lies our safety.
                  Here—give me the child."
               "No—no."
               And Edith resisted the attempts of her mother to get possession of Grace.
               "Why don't you give her to me? Foolish girl! I am stronger than you," said the
                  woman.
               "She is as light as a feather in my arms," replied Edith, who still kept hold of
                  the babe. "You lead the way, and I will follow as fast as you desire."
               The woman, with a slight murmur of impatience, gave up the brief contest, and
                  moved on again in the direction taken by the carpenter, her daughter following
                  close in her footsteps. Stopping every little while to listen, and then pressing
                  on, the two fugitives continued their way for about ten minutes, when Edith
                  said—
               "This is the place, mother. I told Mark to wait for me in the woods, off to the
                  left."
               Leaving the road, the two women sought for the carriage, but, to their dismay, it
                  was nowhere to be found.
               "Are you certain about the place, Edith?"
               Edith was very certain in the beginning, but the darkness was so bewildering, that her mind began to
                  waver.
               "I think it was here, mother."
               "O Edith! and so much at stake!" exclaimed her companion, rebukingly. "When will
                  you learn to rightly guard the future?"
               "The darkness is so deep," said Edith.
               "You should have thought of that, and taken a closer observation. What are we to
                  do?"
               "Mark!" called Edith.
               "Hush! Mad girl! Your voice may reach other ears than his."
               "Listen!" Edith spoke in a quick, eager tone.
               "What is that?"
               "It is the carriage, thank God!"
               And the excited young creature leaned her head against her mother, and sobbed
                  violently. Her voice had reached the coachman, who was only a short distance from
                  where they were standing, and his horses were in motion. But a few moments elapsed
                  before the two women were in the carriage.
               "Home, Mark—home!" whispered the mother, "and as swift as our horses' feet will
                  take us."
               "It is very dark, ma'am," answered the coachman.
               "You know the road, Mark," was the brief and significant answer.
               For a few minutes the carriage crept along almost noiselessly, until the road was
                  fairly gained; then, at a word from Mark, the horses sprung away at a speed that
                  satisfied even the impatient riders.
               For nearly two hours this speed was maintained, and then the foaming horses were
                  turned into a wooded lane that wound up to a fine old mansion, around which
                  clustered many evidences of wealth, taste, and aristocratic pride. Into this the
                  two women passed, and here, for the present, we will leave them.
               The morning that broke after that eventful night, found Mr. and Mrs. Harding in
                  trouble, grief, and great perplexity of mind. A tearful vail was over their whole
                  household. Not one of the inmates but grieved after dear little Grace, with a
                  sorrow that knew no words of comfort—no ray of consolation. All questioned, but
                  there was none who could answer.
               "What shall we do?"
               That was the doubtful inquiry of the carpenter and his wife, asked often of each
                  other, and answered only by troubled looks.
               "Shall we at once make it known to the neighbourhood?" asked Harding. "This it is
                  necessary for us speedily to determine. The child will be missed, sooner or later,
                  when we shall have to account satisfactorily for its absence."
               "Suppose you see Mr. Long, and ask his advice," said Mrs. Harding. "He is a good
                  man, and discreet."
               "Well suggested, Mary," said the carpenter. "I will see him without a moment's
                  delay."
               But even the schoolmaster failed to see the matter clearly on its first
                  presentation. To bruit the whole thing abroad, might prove a serious error; but,
                  in what way, a total ignorance of the parties concerned left altogether in doubt.
                  It was plain that they had acted with a desperation which only the gravest
                  considerations could justify. The crime of having abandoned an infant involved the
                  deepest disgrace, and it was no cause of wonder that they sought to escape the
                  penalty. On the other hand, the absence of the babe from the family of Harding
                  would not fail to attract attention, and the neighbours would have a clear right
                  to demand an explanation of the fact.
               "What had we best do, Mr. Long?"
               This was the earnest question of Harding, at the conclusion of his conference with
                  the schoolmaster.
               
               "Say nothing to any one else, at least for to-day," was the answer. "I will
                  testify, if necessary, to the fact that you came to me, and related the whole of
                  the strange circumstance, and that I advised you to keep silent for a day or two,
                  while you made earnest search for the parties who carried off the child. My word,
                  I am sure, will be all that is needed to screen you from suspicion of wrong."
               "I am very sure of that, Mr. Long, and will do as you suggest," replied the
                  carpenter. "And now, my first search must be made in the neighbourhood of Overton,
                  although I have little hope of finding them there. I saw deception in the woman's
                  unsteady eyes, when she mentioned this as her place of residence. One step brings
                  us to the point from which the next can be taken. I will regard this as the first
                  step in a search that must not be fruitless."
               "And it will not be fruitless, I trust," said the school-master, as Harding turned
                  from him, and went back home to advise his wife of the conclusion to which he had
                  arrived, after consulting with Mr. Long.
               Mounted on a good horse, the carpenter was soon on his way to Overton, a small
                  town some two miles beyond Beechwood. A widow lady, with whom he had some
                  acquaintance, resided there, and at her house he alighted on reaching the village.
                  After the customary greetings, and brief questions about family matters, Harding
                  said—
               "Do you know a lady, in Overton, by the name of Hartley?"
               "Oh yes! very well," was the answer.
               With what a strong throb did the heart of the carpenter bound at this reply, so
                  little expected!
               "Is she an elderly lady?" he next inquired.
               "She is past the middle age; yet no one would call her old."
               "Where does she live?"
               The woman took him to the door, and pointed to a fine old mansion, almost hidden
                  by majestic elms, that stood not far from her dwelling.
               "Has she a daughter?"
               "Yes; an only daughter."
               "Grown up?"
               "Yes."
               "The person I wish to see," said the carpenter; "and as my business is somewhat
                  urgent, I must bid you good morning."
               Turning almost abruptly from the woman, he sprung into his saddle, and galloped
                  away in the direction of Mrs. Hartley's, his mind already strongly excited in
                  anticipation of an interview, the termination of which involved so much, and was
                  yet so full of uncertainty. Passing from the public road into a gravelled lane,
                  lined on each side by tastefully cut cedars, he advanced toward a beautiful
                  dwelling, around which was every thing to indicate the possession of a cultivated
                  taste by the owner, and wealth for its gratification. But at these external
                  beauties he scarcely glanced. Too deeply was he absorbed by thoughts of the
                  approaching interview.
               Dismounting and fastening his horse, Harding advanced to the hall-door, and
                  lifting the heavy knocker, brought it down with a strong hand. The sound
                  reverberated loudly within. In a few moments, a servant answered his summons.
               "Is Mrs. Hartley at home?" asked the carpenter. The suspense from which he was now
                  suffering made his voice falter.
               "She is," was the quiet answer.
               "Can I see her?"
               "Will you walk in?" said the servant, politely.
               The carpenter entered, and was shown into one of the elegantly furnished
                  parlours.
               "What name shall I say?"
               
               Harding was about to give a wrong name, but his quickened moral sense instantly
                  objected, and he said—
               "No matter. Say that I wish particularly to see her."
               The servant hesitated for a few moments, and then left the apartment. Soon the
                  rustle of a lady's garments was heard on the stairs. Harding arose to his feet,
                  involuntarily, and stood almost holding his breath. A tall, dignified, middle-aged
                  woman, with a mild countenance, presented herself. It was not her of whom the
                  excited man was in search. The lady bowed, as she entered, and said—
               "My name is Mrs. Hartley".
               'Not the Mrs. Hartley I wish to see," replied the carpenter, in a tone that
                  betrayed the depth of his disappointment.
               "I know no other by my name," the lady answered. "You seem to be under some
                  mistake, sir. Perhaps, if you explain yourself, I may be able to set you right.
                  Will you not be seated?"
               As Harding resumed his chair, he said—
               "A woman was at my house last night—it is the second time she has called there—who
                  told me that she lived in Overton, and that her name was Mrs. Hartley."
               "Ah!" The lady was surprised. "What kind of a looking woman was she?"
               "In person, near your size, and, to all appearance, near your age."
               The lady's face flushed.
               "Near my size and age?"
               "Yes, ma'am; but, in countenance, you bear no resemblance," said the
                  carpenter.
               "And she said her name was Hartley, and that she resided at Overton?"
               "She did; but I questioned, in my own mind, her truthfulness at the time. Ah! how
                  cruelly have I been deceived!"
               "Deceived! In what way, sir?" asked the lady.
               "Pardon me," said the carpenter," if I decline an explanation: the reasons are
                  imperative."
               "You are the best judge of that. And yet, as my name has been used in so strange a
                  manner, it seems only right that I should be made acquainted, at least in some
                  degree, with the occasion of such an unwarrantable liberty. Can you describe the
                  woman to me?"
               Harding gave as accurate a description as possible of the person of whom he was in
                  search.
               "Did you observe a mole on her right cheek?" asked the lady.
               "Oh yes, madam! I remember that distinctly," said the carpenter, starting to his
                  feet. "Tell me! Do you know her?"
               "And she said her name was Hartley?"
               "Yes."
               "And that she lived at Overton?"
               "Her words, as my visit here attests."
               "A very singular statement," said the lady.
               "Oh, madam! tell me if you know her: do not keep me in suspense," urged the
                  carpenter, growing more excited.
               "I cannot imagine the reason of such singular conduct." The lady spoke to herself.
                  "Gave her name as Mrs. Hartley! What does it mean? There is some mystery here,"
                  she added, addressing the carpenter; "and as my name has become connected with it,
                  I have a right to ask for explanation. For what purpose did this woman come to
                  your house?"
               "From the description I have given, do you identify her?" asked Harding.
               "I do, clearly."
               The carpenter struck his hands together, exclaiming—
               "So much gained! so much gained! Oh, madam! tell me where I can find her!"
               
               "Not unless I know why you are in search of her. If you will not trust me, neither
                  will I trust you," replied the lady, firmly.
               Deeply perplexed was the carpenter again. He saw that the woman was right; and yet
                  he was as much in doubt respecting her, as she was respecting him. It was plain
                  that she knew the persons who had carried off the child; but what good or evil
                  might flow from a revelation of the strange facts connected with them, she was
                  unable to divine.
               "Does she live in Overton?" he asked, hoping to gain some admission.
               "I shall communicate nothing," said Mrs. Hartley, "unless I know the ground of
                  your inquiries. If, as I said before, you will not trust me, I will not trust
                  you."
               "We never know how for it is safe to trust an entire stranger," remarked
                  Harding.
               "Very true; and that is my reason for not giving information to a stranger, of
                  whose object I am entirely ignorant."
               "Will you answer me these question?" The carpenter spoke in an anxious tone. "Is
                  the lady in good social standing? And is she known as virtuous and
                  honourable?"
               "I can answer you freely. She is in good standing, and I have never heard any
                  thing against her of so grave a nature as this that you now allege—the assumption
                  of my name. This, sir, is a most serious allegation. The wherefore must involve
                  something more serious still."
               "That is certainly does," said the carpenter. "And this being so, it is but just
                  toward her that I should keep my own counsel until I see her face to face. That
                  she desires secrecy, is apparent in the fact, that she has misled me by assuming a
                  name that belongs to another. Ah, madam! if you would only give me the information
                  I seek!"
               The lady mused for some time; then, shaking her head, she answered—
               "I cannot meet your wishes."
               Harding sighed deeply. Rising, he moved toward the door of the apartment, his face
                  strongly marked by disappointment.
               "May I ask your address?" said Mrs. Hartley.
               It was given without hesitation.
               "Your errand here this morning is a very singular one, Mr. Harding," remarked the
                  lady, evidently unwilling to have him depart, without some disclosure of facts
                  about which her curiosity was in no small degree excited. "Is it not possible for
                  us so far to trust each other, as to impart the information each desires?"
               "Not at present, I fear," answered the carpenter. "Too many grave considerations
                  force themselves upon my mind, and enjoin circumspection. But of one thing I can
                  assure you: I shall not long remain in this suspense. Should the search of to-day
                  not prove successful, you will see me in the morning—perhaps this evening, when,
                  to gain the information I desire, I will disclose what now discretion warns me to
                  conceal."
               Bowing to the lady, who made no further effort to detain him, Harding withdrew,
                  and, mounting his horse, rode off at a quick pace. It was not his purpose, now, to
                  make further search in this direction. First, he wished to consult with Mr. Long,
                  and get his advice as to the propriety of disclosing to Mrs. Hartley the facts of
                  the previous evening, in order to get the information so much desired. And so,
                  turning his horse's head homeward, he pressed the animal to his utmost speed.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XV.
               IMMEDIATELY on his return from Overton, the carpenter went to see Mr. Long.
               "One step taken in the right direction," said the schoolmaster, after Harding had
                  finished his narration of what passed between him and Mrs. Hartley.
               "But what of the next?" asked Harding. "That is the question I am unable to
                  answer. A wrong step may involve most serious consequences. The parties in this
                  strange and disgraceful business evidently occupy a high social position, and are
                  exceedingly anxious to remain unknown. If I reveal all to Mrs. Hartley, in order
                  to gain the information I seek, it may be the cause of an irreparable injury. The
                  mother of Grace has, it is plain, acted under an influence from her imperious
                  mother that she was unable to resist; and the latter, moved by family pride, or
                  some other strong consideration, has taken an extreme step, the knowledge of
                  which, if it get on the wings of common report, must ruin her in the good opinion
                  of every one."
               "It is but just," remarked the schoolmaster, "to weigh every thing with the nicest
                  care, where so much is involved. I think you were altogether right in withholding
                  from Mrs. Hartley the information she asked, and I cannot blame her for being
                  equally discreet."
               "But what step can next be taken? I have not a single clue by which to trace out
                  the fugitives. They escaped in the darkness, and left no sign of their
                  departure."
               "Did not the young woman say something about her carriage being near at hand, on
                  the road to Beechwood?"
               "Yes. She said it was a quarter of a mile away."
               "It might be worth your while," said the schoolmaster, "to examine the ground, a
                  little off from the road, and see if you can find the mark of wheels. The
                  carriage, most probably, was withdrawn from the public way, in order to escape
                  observation."
               "Of what use will it be?" said the carpenter.
               "Possibly, the direction taken may be ascertained."
               Harding shook his head doubtfully.
               "Very small indications are sufficient often to lead to important results,"
                  remarked the schoolmaster. "When we are altogether in the dark, we accept the
                  feeblest ray, and hail it gladly, as the harbinger of approaching light. But some
                  other course may have suggested itself to your mind."
               Harding shook his head, saying—
               "I am, to use your own words, altogether in the dark. Not a single beam of light
                  is on the way before me."
               "Then do as I suggest, my friend."
               "I very seriously doubt," said the carpenter, "
                     the the
                     the
                   truth of what they said about the carriage being in the direction of
                  Beechwood. I followed them quickly, but saw nothing of either them or the
                  carriage, although I kept on for at least half a mile."
               "The carriage was, of course, withdrawn from the road, and concealed from view. I
                  do not wonder at your not seeing it. The women, most probably, heard you coming
                  after them, and hid behind some sheltering object, until you passed. The distance
                  you went gave them an opportunity to gain the vehicle, and make their escape. As
                  you did not meet the carriage on returning, the inference is plain, that the
                  direction taken was not toward Beechwood. Now, if you can only find where it
                  turned off from the road, and can thence follow the wheel-marks to the place of
                  concealment, you may be able to trace them still farther, and thus determine,
                     with more or less certainty, the
                  course taken. It will be something gained, to know that they did or did not go
                  toward Beechwood."
               "I will act at once upon your suggestion," said the carpenter. "No time is to be
                  lost."
               Just about the place which had been indicated, Harding found the deep impression
                  of wheels in the soft turf, turning off abruptly from the beaten road. Following
                  these, he discovered the spot where a carriage had been standing for some time, as
                  was clear from the hoof-marks on the ground. It was behind a clump of trees.
                  Beyond this, he could follow the tracks, until they were again lost in the road.
                  One thing he was able to determine clearly: the carriage neither came from nor
                  returned toward Beechwood. Between the place at which it had been stationed and
                  the little settlement where the carpenter lived, a road leading to the town of
                  Clifton branched off. He tried to follow the wheel-marks in the road, in order to
                  be sure that the vehicle actually went toward Clifton; but the hard, beaten
                  surface, and the mingling of other wheel-tracks, made this impossible.
               It was now midday, and Harding returned home, intending, immediately after dinner,
                  to start for Clifton, and devote the remainder of the day to searches in that
                  direction. He found his wife waiting him in troubled suspense. A few words
                  sufficed to give her the meager result of his efforts to discover their visitors
                  of the previous evening. Her sad face and red eyes told but too plainly how she
                  had spent the hours since his departure. The children were subdued in manner, and
                  their sober faces showed how sincerely they were grieving for the loss of their
                  sweet little playmate. Lotty had kept close beside her mother during all the
                  morning; and whenever the latter sat down, overcome by her feelings, to weep, the
                  child would come and lean against her, or draw her tiny arms about her neck, and
                  say—
               "If they don't bring her back, I will be your little Grace, mother."
               How the words went thrilling to the mother's heart, going deeper and deeper every
                  time they were repeated, until at last she could not help clasping the little one
                  passionately to her bosom.
               Harding, after eating a few mouthfuls of the dinner which he found awaiting his
                  return, had left the table, and was preparing to leave the house, when Miss Gimp,
                  the dressmaker, who had only half an hour before got home from Beechwood, came in
                  with a look of importance on her thin face. In that particular crisis, she was far
                  from being a welcome visitor; the more especially, as it was inferred by them from
                  her manner, that she had by some means gained intelligence of what had occurred.
                  She felt the reserve with which they treated her, and was somewhat piqued thereat;
                  nevertheless, she could not keep back from them all that was in her mind, and
                  said, soon after she came in, in order to introduce the subject—
               "How is that dear little babe?" glancing around the room. "Asleep, I suppose?"
               Was this a ruse to bring them out? Both Mr. and Mrs. Harding thought so; and
                  therefore made no reply.
               "I met a lady over at Beechwood," said Miss Gimp, "who asked about you and that
                  babe with a good deal of interest."
               "Indeed!"
               Both Mr. and Mrs. Harding's indifference was gone.
               "Who was she?"
               Miss Gimp looked mysterious
               "I don't feel at liberty to mention her name," she answered, with affected
                  gravity.
               "Was she an elderly lady?" inquired the carpenter.
               "She was neither very old nor very young," said Miss Gimp.
               
               "Though somewhat past middle age," remarked the carpenter, who saw that it was
                  necessary to excite a little the dressmaker's curiosity, by appearing to have some
                  knowledge of the person to whom she referred.
               "Yes," said Miss Gimp, looking at the carpenter rather warily.
               "With dark, penetrating eyes, and a peculiarly dignified, almost commanding
                  manner."
               "I found her pleasant and affable enough," said Miss Gimp.
               "She can be so when it suits her purpose."
               "Ah! you know her, then?" remarked the dressmaker, thrown off her guard.
               "I have met her, I presume."
               "She did not intimate this."
               Miss Gimp looked a little puzzled.
               "It was not necessary, I presume. Did you meet her in her own house?"
               "Me? No, indeed. I haven't been to Clifton."
               "Ah! True enough. You were at Beechwood?"
               "Yes. At Mrs. Barclay's. Mrs. Beaufort"—
               The dressmaker stopped suddenly; for she saw by the eager manner with which the
                  carpenter bent toward her, that he was merely leading her on to tell what she knew
                  about the lady to whom she had referred.
               "Mrs. Beaufort of Clifton, the widow of General Beaufort?" said Harding, pressing
                  on to the dressmaker so closely, that she could only answer in the
                  affirmative.
               "Yes; it was Mrs. Beaufort," she replied. "She is a sister of Mrs. Barclay, and
                  was making a short visit at Beechwood while I was there."
               "Did she leave yesterday?"
               The carpenter asked the question in so indifferent a tone, that Miss Gimp was
                  altogether deceived as to the amount of interest he felt.
               "Yes. She went away some time in the afternoon, I believe. Her going was thought
                  rather sudden by the family. In fact, I heard Mrs. Barclay say to her daughter—the
                  words were not meant for my ears—that she couldn't conceive what motive Mrs.
                  Beaufort had for leaving so abruptly, and at so late an hour in the day."
               "You will excuse me, Miss Gimp," said the carpenter, partly turning away, and
                  taking up his hat from a chair.
               "Men are always excusable," returned Miss Gimp. "Business has the first claim. So
                  make no apologies."
               "Mary!"
               Harding looked at his wife, and she arose and followed him to the door.
               "I am going over to Clifton," said he, "and will come back as early as possible.
                  In the mean time, be on your guard with Miss Gimp, and do not, on any account, let
                  her know what happened last night."
               "Never fear, Jacob; she will learn nothing from me," returned Mrs. Harding. "But
                  do you think that woman was Mrs. Beaufort of Clifton?"
               "I am sure of it."
               "Don't be too certain, Jacob. The disappointment, should the supposition prove
                  untrue, will only be the greater."
               "There is not a shadow of doubt on my mind, Mary—not a shadow. Good-by! I will be
                  back as early as possible.
               And the carpenter hurried away.
               "You know, then, all about this Mrs. Beaufort?" said Miss Gimp, in the most
                  insinuating way, as Mrs. Harding came back into the room.
               "The lady about whom you were speaking to my husband just now?"
               The utter indifference with which Mrs. Harding said this, surprised in no small
                  degree the dressmaker.
               
               "Yes. Mrs. Beaufort, who resides at Clifton."
               Mrs. Harding shook her head. "On the contrary, I know nothing about her."
               "Nothing? Well, that's strange! I'm sure your husband does, if you don't."
               Miss Gimp was puzzled, disappointed, and a little fretted.
               "That may all be," answered Mrs. Harding. "He sees a great many people who never
                  come in my way."
               "But, really, now, Mrs. Harding, just in confidence"—Miss Gimp leaned toward the
                  carpenter's wife, and put on her most insinuating look—"don't you know something
                  about Mrs. Beaufort? I'm sure you do. She had a great deal to say about you."
               "Had she?"
               "Yes, indeed; and about the baby in particular. Where is it?" and Miss Gimp's eyes
                  looked around, searchingly.
               'What about the baby?" said Mrs. Harding.
               "And you don't know her at all?"
               Mrs. Harding shook her head.
               "It's my opinion, then, that she knows a great deal more about that baby than you
                  do."
               Almost impossible did Mrs. Harding find it to repress the strong desire she felt
                  to question Miss Gimp closely, and to gain all she knew at the price of entire
                  confidence; but her better judgment gave her self-control.
               "That may be," she answered; "for we know nothing of its history. All I can say
                  is, that I hope she may have as clear a conscience about the child as we
                  have."
               "Clear a conscience! How?"
               And Miss Gimp's eyes went searching about the room again, and even tried to
                  penetrate the adjoining chamber, through a small opening in the door.
               "We have done our duty by the babe."
               Miss Gimp was puzzled.
               "How is the sweet little cherub?" she asked.
               "Well," was the brief answer.
               "Asleep, I suppose?"
               "When did you leave Beechwood?" asked Mrs Harding, not appearing to notice the
                  dressmaker's question.
               "This morning."
               "How long were you there?"
               "Several days."
               "At Mrs. Barclay's, you said, I believe?'
               "Yes. She sent her carriage for me, and took me over."
               "And returned you in the same way?"
               "Of course. She's very much of a lady, only so cold and reserved. Mrs. Beaufort,
                  her husband's sister, is a very different kind of woman."
               "In what respect?"
               "Oh! she's so pleasant and talkative."
               "What kind of a looking person is she?" asked Mrs. Harding.
               "Tall, and very dignified. I never saw such a penetrating pair of black eyes in my
                  life. They seem to look right through you sometimes. She takes a great deal of
                  interest in you, let me tell you."
               "Does she, indeed? I wonder why!"
               How hard was it for the carpenter's wife to maintain her exterior
                  indifference!
               "No, you don't wonder," said Miss Gimp, whose close observation detected the
                  hidden excitement the other was so anxious to conceal. "You know that you are
                  dying, this minute, to hear all I can tell about Mrs. Beaufort."
               "If you really think so," remarked Mrs. Harding, forcing a smile, "pray have
                  compassion on me, and relieve my great suspense."
               The dressmaker was at fault again.
               "Oh!" she replied, with ill-concealed vexation, "if you are so indifferent about the matter, I shall
                  not trouble myself to enlighten you. I thought you would naturally feel an
                  interest in learning something about a person who evidently knows a good deal more
                  than you do about little Grace, and who, it is plain, has her eyes pretty closely
                  fixed on you."
               Saying this, Miss Gimp arose, and made a movement toward the door. She was very
                  confident that this act would break down, at once, the assumed indifference of
                  Mrs. Harding. But she erred. The latter was too clearly aware of how much was at
                  stake to suffer herself to be thrown from her guard. All the information of any
                  value possessed by Miss Gimp had been communicated. She saw this, as her mind grew
                  calm and clear, and she was pleased that the prying gossip was about to depart. It
                  was in vain that the dressmaker lingered, and tried to strike some new chord of
                  interest. Nothing vibrated to her touch; and she withdrew, utterly disappointed in
                  the object of her visit, and in a very bad humour with both the carpenter and his
                  wife, whom she failed not to abuse, in round terms, during three neighbourly
                  visits paid by her ere reaching her own dwelling.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               IN a large chamber, the costly furniture of which was in the fashion of an earlier
                  day, sat a pale but beautiful young woman, gazing fondly upon the lovely face of a
                  sleeping child. She had no eye, no ear, no thought for any thing but the babe;
                  for, as she sat thus, an elderly woman entered, and moved across the room, without
                  attracting observation, until she stood close beside her.
               "Edith!"
               The young woman started, and her face slightly flushed.
               "I did not hear you come in, mother," she said.
               "You can neither hear nor see any thing, now, but that child."
               The mother spoke with some harshness of manner.
               Edith raised her eyes—they were not tearful, but calm and resolute—and fixing them
                  on the face of her mother, she said, speaking slowly, yet firmly—
               "Have I not said, mother, that this babe is dearer to me than life? Believe me,
                  they were no idle words, uttered under excitement. For her sweet sake, I am
                  prepared to give up every thing—to endure every thing. Let us, then, contend no
                  longer."
               "Think of the consequences, Edith! Cannot you think of these? Remember that
                  Colonel D'Arcy will be here next week."
               "Well?"
               "And that he comes to claim your hand."
               "Claim my hand?"
               "It is promised," said Mrs. Beaufort.
               "By whom?"
               
               "By yourself. He has your written acceptance of his marriage offer."
               "My written acceptance?"
               "Yes. But why need you be reminded of this?"
               Edith raised one hand, and clasping it tightly against her forehead, sat for some
                  moments with a bewildered look.
               "My written acceptance of Colonel D'Arcy's hand! Why do you say that, mother?"
               "Because it is the truth. You wrote the letter of acceptance yourself."
               "I did! When?"
               Edith looked more surprised than ever.
               "Scarcely two months have passed," was the firm answer.
               "Ah!" A gleam of light shot across the young woman's face. "That, too," she added,
                  with a sigh, "is becoming clear. By what dark spirit was I possessed? Mother! I
                  have been on the very brink of insanity. The extorted pledges then made I now
                  repudiate, as I have already repudiated the cruel act of abandoning my precious
                  babe. Had I been in my right mind, I dare not now pray for forgiveness. The act of
                  accepting Colonel D'Arcy is yours, mother, not mine. Your thought—your
                  purpose—guided my hand when I wrote the letter, as it guided and controlled my
                  actions on that day, of all days the darkest in the calendar of my unhappy life.
                  But I have returned into my own proper self. I am clothed and in my right mind
                  again; and, Heaven helping me, from this day forth I yield to no influence but
                  that of my own sense of right and duty! I can work and suffer, mother. I can bend
                  to any hard necessity that may come; but false to my woman's heart I will not be!
                  The widow's tears are not yet dry on my cheeks, and shall I turn my heart from all
                  its pure love? You need not scowl at me, mother—I did love him with a full heart,
                  tenderly. He was my husband, my excellent, true, noble-minded husband, poor and in
                  humble station though he was; and the duty of public acknowledgment that I owe to
                  his memory, to myself, and to his child, I am resolved to make, and that right
                  speedily. My first great error was the concealment of our marriage from the world;
                  the second was suffering him to go away alone. Oh that I could have been with him
                  in his last extremity! My hand should have been the one that smoothed his
                  pillow—my voice the last that sounded in his ears. Ah, mother!—hard, proud,
                  exacting mother! With what memories have you cursed your child!"
               Gradually had voice and manner deepened, until both displayed an almost fierce
                  energy, before which Mrs. Beaufort—for she it was—felt herself cowering. Hitherto
                  her imperious will had ruled her daughter; but now her power over her was at an
                  end, and she felt that it was so. The darling scheme, to compass which she had
                  trampled the most sacred obligations under foot—making her suffering child a
                  participator, even at the risk of dethroning her reason—had come to naught; and in
                  its hopeless failure, other ruin was involved. Gone for ever—she saw, in this
                  second strong encounter with Edith, that it was so—gone for ever was all power to
                  bend that young spirit to her will. But, what next? Could she turn from her child
                  in proud anger, and go forward on her life-path alone? She asked herself the
                  question; and the very thought caused a quick gasping for breath, as if she were
                  about to suffocate. A little while she remained standing near Edith; then, without
                  replying, she went slowly from the room.
               An hour afterward she returned, entering the chamber of her daughter as
                  noiselessly as before. A low, sweet, cooing voice stole into her ears as she
                  passed through the door, and thrilled her whole being with a strange emotion tion—a mingling of exquisite pleasure
                  and pain. It was the baby's voice. Little Grace was lying on the bed, and over her
                  bent Edith.
               "Darling! Sweet one! Darling!"
               Thus her mother spoke to her, and at each tenderly uttered word, she answered with
                  a loving response.
               "My sweet baby!"
               And a shower of kisses followed the words.
               The babe still answered, with its sweet, low murmur, every word and every act of
                  endearment. She lay, partly elevated on a pillow, and in such a position that Mr.
                  Beaufort could see her face, while she remained unobserved by her daughter. The
                  hour passed alone had been one of strong self-conflict—ending with self-conviction
                  of wrong. The proud, unscrupulous woman of the world chafed for a time against the
                  iron bars of necessity with which she found herself enclosed, and then gave up the
                  vain struggle.
               "Hard, proud, exacting mother! With what memories have you cursed your child!" How
                  the words continued to ring in her ears, until chords were thrilled which had
                  given forth no sound for years. Calmness succeeded to powerful emotion; and with
                  this subsiding of the storm, came touches of gentler feeling.
               "My poor child!" she sighed to herself, as some vivid realizations of what Edith
                  had suffered startled her into a new consciousness.
               This was Mrs. Beaufort's state of mind when she entered Edith's chamber. It was
                  not the first time that the voice of Grace had awakened echoes in her heart None
                  but she knew the struggle that it cost to part with the babe, when cruel pride and
                  worldly interests demanded its abandonment. Angry as she had been at her
                  daughter's secret marriage with a young man in humble life, when the fact was made
                  known to her, and almost driven to madness when the babe came to mar all the
                  well-schemed future—still, in its lovely innocence, that babe had glided into her
                  heart, and made for itself a place there in spite of all her efforts to keep it
                  out and to cast it our. Witness her two visits at the carpenter's, in venturing
                  which so much was endangered.
               In full view was the babe's face, as she entered the room of Edith. What a
                  heavenly beauty radiated therefrom! What a winning sweetness was in her murmured
                  replies, as she answered to the voice of her mother!
               "Edith!" said Mrs. Beaufort.
               Edith started, as before, and a shadow fell on her countenance, as she turned
                  toward her parent.
               "Edith, my daughter!" There was a tremulousness in the tones of Mrs. Beaufort,
                  that betrayed her softened feelings. A few moments Edith looked into her face,
                  doubtingly; then she saw that her eyes were dimmed by gathering tears.
               "Oh, my mother! my mother!" she exclaimed, in a voice of passionate entreaty;
                  "will you not take this precious darling to your heart, as once you took me?" And
                  she lifted Grace quickly from the bed, and held her toward her mother. "Her hands
                  are outstretched, mother! She asks for a place in your heart. Will you not let her
                  in? A Heaven-sent blessing to us both she will prove—an angel in our home to smile
                  away the darkness that has overshadowed it so long Dear mother! gather us both in
                  your arms! Mother! mother!"
               The last brief struggle was over. Around them both the arms of Mrs. Beaufort were
                  flung, and, with a strong compression, she drew them to her heart.
               "My child! my child!" she sobbed, as her tears fell over the face of Edith and the
                  babe. "Even so let it be. There is room enough for both. I will take her in.
                  Nay—she is there already."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVII.
               MRS. BEAUFORT, the widow of General Beaufort, a man of wealth, who had attained
                  considerable political distinction during his lifetime, was left with an only
                  daughter, Edith, for whom she had large ambition. A very selfish and self-willed
                  woman, she yet loved this child with an absorbing intensity rarely witnessed.
                  Edith was a part of herself, and she loved herself in its reproduction in her
                  child, with a largely increased vitality.
               But very unlike her mother was Edith. In her, the milder, better traits of her
                  father predominated, and this gave room for the acquirement, by such a woman as
                  Mrs. Beaufort, of almost unbounded control over her. From the beginning, the most
                  implicit obedience had been exacted; and as it was ever an easy sacrifice for
                  Edith to give up her own will, the requirement of her mother came to be the law of
                  her actions.
               While Edith remained a child, the current of these two lives—that of the mother
                  and daughter—flowed on together at the same velocity, and in channels bending ever
                  in the same direction. But there came a time when the surface of that gently
                  gliding child-life began breaking into ripples—when the heart claimed its freedom
                  to love what its own pure instincts regarded as lovely.
               From the earliest time, had the thoughts of Mrs. Beaufort reached forward to the
                  period when Edith's hand would be claimed in marriage; but not once had qualities
                  of mind and heart elevated themselves, in the prospective husband, above family,
                  wealth, and high position in the world.
               As Edith grew up, and the pure young girl expanded into lovely womanhood, her
                  personal attractions, as well as her station in life, drew suitors around her; but
                  all failed to win their way into her affections. Among these was a Colonel D'Arcy,
                  a man of wealth and station, who in every thing satisfied the ambition of Mrs.
                  Beaufort. Well-educated, accomplished, possessing a fine person and a large share
                  of self-esteem, Colonel D'Arcy, on approaching the lovely heiress, might have
                  exclaimed with Cæsar, at the battle of Ziecla, "Veni, vidi, vici!"
               But he came, he saw, and did not conquer. The heart of Edith was too
                  true in its perceptions to make an error here. Utterly repulsive to her was this
                  confident suitor. The sphere of his quality surrounded him like the subtle odour
                  of a noxious plant, and her delicate moral sense perceived this quality the
                  instant he approached. That he repelled instead of attracting her, D'Arcy saw at
                  their earliest interview. This piqued his pride, and, in the first excitement
                  occasioned by Edith's cool reception, he vowed that he would "win her and wear
                  her." It did not take long to satisfy the gallant colonel that the storming of a
                  fort was an easier task than the storming of a heart. That of Miss Beaufort he
                  found impregnable under all his known modes of warfare.
               That the mother favoured his suit, Colonel D'Arcy saw from the beginning: but a
                  proud confidence in his own powers would not let him stoop to solicit her as an
                  ally. Yet he had to do so in the end. Against their joint assault, aware, as he
                  had become, of Mrs. Beaufort's influence over her daughter, he was certain there
                  would only be a short resistance. Here, again, he erred. Edith unhesitatingly
                  declared to her mother that no power on earth would induce her to accept the hand
                  of Colonel D'Arcy, for whom she had the most intense repugnance. Never before had
                  her daughter so boldly set at naught her will. The fiery indignation of Mrs.
                     Beaufort fort burned fiercely for a
                  time, and in her blind passion she did not hesitate to utter the maddest threats
                  of consequences, if there was not an instant compliance with her wishes.
               "I can imagine nothing so dreadful as to become the wife of that man," Edith would
                  answer—shuddering as she answered—every intemperate appeal. And little beyond this
                  did she say; for all her words, she knew, must fall idly on her mother's ears.
               Meantime, at the house of a friend in the neighbourhood, she met with a young man,
                  named Percival, who was paying a short visit there. He resided in the city of B—,
                  distant a hundred miles, where he was pursuing the study of law. He was poor, with
                  few interested friends, and had the world all before him. At their first meeting,
                  Henry Percival did not know even the name, much less the social position of Miss
                  Beaufort; and she was as ignorant of all that appertained to him. But from the
                  eyes of each looked forth upon the other a congenial spirit, that was seen and
                  recognised.
               The progressive steps of their intimacy we will not pause to relate. On the part
                  of Percival, there was no design, in the beginning, to win the heart of Edith; and
                  when he saw that it was his, and reflected on the wide disparity of their
                  possessions, the discovery saddened his spirit, for he saw, darkening over both
                  their futures, a stormy cloud.
               On returning home to pursue his studies, he arranged with Edith for a regular
                  correspondence, which was conducted for nearly a year, without becoming known to
                  Mrs. Beaufort. At the end of that time, he came back to Clifton, when he and Edith
                  were secretly married. The precipitation of this act was caused by Mrs. Beaufort's
                  acceptance of Colonel D'Arcy in the name of her daughter, and the actual
                  appointment of a day, some two or three months distant, when the nuptial
                  ceremonies were to take place.
               In order to free Edith from the martyrdom in which her life was passed, and to get
                  for ever rid of Colonel D'Arcy, the young couple resolved upon this step. It was
                  taken, and notice thereof at once communicated to Mrs. Beaufort, coupled with the
                  intelligence that the bridegroom and bride would present themselves before her
                  after the lapse of a week, and claim forgiveness and a blessing.
               We will not attempt to describe the state of mind into which Mrs. Beaufort was
                  thrown by this undreamed-of intelligence. Her very life's love was assailed and
                  threatened with extinction. No eye but that of Heaven saw her, as, in the secrecy
                  of her own chamber, she endured the wild conflict of passion that succeeded; but
                  marks of the fearful storm were too plainly visible on her altered face, when she
                  came forth in her stately composure.
               The week passed, and then Edith and her young husband presented themselves. The
                  first she received with icy coldness; the latter she overwhelmed with bitter
                  denunciation and the most withering scorn.
               "Come, Henry," said the young wife, laying her hand upon his arm, and drawing him
                  away—"I will not hear you addressed in such language, even by my mother. You are
                  my husband, and the wide world is ours."
               There was a simple dignity, blended with unmistakable purpose in this, that
                  confounded as well as surprised Mrs. Beaufort. Edith had already turned away, and
                  was moving with her husband toward the door through which they had just
                  entered.
               "Edith! Girl!"
               The voice of the mother arose almost into a cry of anguish.
               Edith paused, and turning, looked back. Her face was colourless, and all its lines rigid from
                  excessive emotion; but it was resolute.
               "I have cast my lot in life, and with deliberation, mother," she said. "You left
                  me no other course. Death I could have met calmly, but not the destiny you
                  assigned me. This man is my husband, chosen from all other men, and with him I
                  shall go through the world. If you receive not him, you cannot receive me."
               "Mad girl! mad girl!" exclaimed Mrs. Beaufort, as she staggered back a few steps,
                  and sunk upon a chair. "How have you flung to the stormy winds every dearest hope
                  of my life!"
               Edith left her husband's side, and going quickly to her mother, laid her hand
                  gently upon her hot forehead, on which the veins were swollen into chords. The
                  touch of that soft hand thrilled magnetically along every nerve. For some minutes
                  Mrs. Beaufort sat entirely passive.
               Ah! she could not live without her child; and never did she feel that truth more
                  deeply or more painfully. Indignant pride would have flung her off and disowned
                  her for ever; but intense love clung to her even as the drowning cling to a
                  straw.
               "O Edith! my child! what have you done?"
               As these words came almost sobbing from her lips, Mrs. Beaufort arose and went
                  from the room with unsteady steps.
               When, after the lapse of two hours, she rejoined Edith and her husband, it was to
                  meet them with a kindness of manner that took both by surprise. Below this assumed
                  exterior, Percival, who had a quick, penetrating mind, saw concealed a sinister
                  purpose; but Edith, too happy at so broad a concession, believed that her mother
                  had resolved to make the best of circumstances, which no act of hers could change.
                  The first inquiries made by Mrs. Beaufort were in reference to the publicity which
                  had been given to the marriage. On learning that every thing had been conducted
                  with the strictest secrecy, and that the fact was only known to one or two pledged
                  friends, who were to be relied upon, she expressed much satisfaction, and at once
                  proposed further measures of concealment for the present.
               To these proposals, Percival and Edith, after some persuasion, were induced to
                  accede; and at an early day the young man returned to B—alone, to enter upon the
                  practice of his profession, he having been just admitted to the bar.
               Six or seven months elapsed, during which time Percival had twice visited Clifton,
                  arriving, by arrangement, late in the evening, and not showing himself to any
                  visitor during the brief period he remained. To both himself and Edith, this
                  secrecy was growing daily more and more oppressive and repugnant, and it was only
                  maintained through the powerful influence of Mrs. Beaufort.
               About this time, a gentleman from New Orleans called upon Percival, and made him
                  liberal offers if he would go to the South. This person's name was Maris. He had
                  been in correspondence for some two years with Percival's legal preceptor, and at
                  his instance made the proposition to which we have referred. The opening promised
                  to be so largely advantageous, that the young man felt bound to accept of it.
                  Previously to doing so, he repaired to Clifton to consult with his wife and
                  mother-in-law. Edith made some feeble objections; but Mrs. Beaufort was so decided
                  in her approval, that she acquiesced, and immediate preparations for departure
                  were made.
               For three months letters came regularly from Percival, whose residence was New
                  Orleans. He spoke with animation of his opening prospects, and shadowed forth, in
                  ardent fancy, a future of brilliant success in his profession. Then came a longer
                  silence than usual; then a letter from
                  Mr. Maris, announcing Percival's dangerous illness with a Southern fever. Two
                  weeks more—weeks of agony to the young wife—and the terrible news of his death
                  came, with mournful details of the last extremity. In the midst of Edith's wild
                  anguish, a babe was born—the sweet little Grace, in whom the reader feels so
                  tender an interest. Around this event, Mrs. Beaufort threw every possible vail of
                  concealment, even going so far as to bribe to secrecy, by most liberal
                  inducements, every member of her household that became necessarily aware of the
                  circumstances.
               Weak in body and mind—prostrate, in fact, under the heavy blow that fell so
                  suddenly upon her—Edith became passive in the hands of her mother, and obeyed her,
                  for a time, with the unquestioning docility of a little child. Even her mind, in
                  its feeble state, became impressed with the idea of secrecy, so steadily enjoined
                  by Mrs. Beaufort; and, in presence of the few visitors whom she could not refuse
                  to see, she assumed a false exterior, and most sedulously concealed every thing
                  that could awake even a remote suspicion that she had been a wife, and was now a
                  mother.
               Meantime, under all the disadvantages of its position, the babe was steadily
                  winning its way into a heart that, from the beginning, shut the door against it,
                  with a resolute and cruel purpose. Mrs. Beaufort could never come where it was,
                  without feeling a desire to take it in her arms, and hug it to her bosom; and the
                  more she resisted this desire, the stronger it became, until the conflict
                  occasioned kept her in a constant state of excitement.
               A few weeks after the news of Percival's death was received, Colonel D'Arcy
                  visited Clifton. On being announced, Edith positively refused to see him; and her
                  feeble state warranted, even in her mother's view, the decision. He remained only
                  a short time; but, on leaving, placed in the hands of Mrs. Beaufort an epistle for
                  her daughter, couched in the tenderest language, and renewing previous offers of
                  his hand.
               Percival out of the way, Mrs. Beaufort was now more than ever resolved to compass
                  this darling scheme of her heart—the marriage of her daughter with Colonel D'Arcy.
                  The first step in its sure accomplishment was to get the child out of the way. But
                  how was this to be done? It was a fine, healthy child, more than usually forward
                  for its age, and in no way likely to die speedily, unless—unless? Did thoughts of
                  murder stir in the mind of that proud, selfish, cruel woman? Such thoughts were
                  suggested, and even pondered! But other thoughts—of disgrace and punishments—came
                  quickly to drive them out. The abandonment of Grace was next determined upon. To
                  effect this, she first induced Edith—who, from grief, sickness, and incessant
                  persecution, had entirely lost her mental equipoise—to write a letter of
                  acceptance to Colonel D'Arcy. Passive hopelessness left her a mere instrument in
                  her mother's hands. For her acts she was scarcely responsible. The letter of
                  acceptance passed speedily from her, and went on its mission, beyond recall. This
                  fact of acceptance was a great power gained over Edith—a power that Mrs. Beaufort,
                  seeing her vantage ground, used with a heartless rigour, that finally led to the
                  cruel act of desertion already known to the reader.
               For two weeks subsequent to Edith's return home, after placing the basket
                  containing her babe at the door of Mr. Harding—she had resisted all persuasion,
                  entreaty, and command of her mother to leave that task for another—she retained
                  but little consciousness of surrounding circumstances. The trial proved too great;
                  and her over-tried spirit sought protection and repose in partial oblivion. Slowly
                  recovering, her first sane thoughts were of her babe; and, though she said nothing
                  of her purpose to her mother, she was
                  fully resolved, the moment strength came for the effort, to regain possession
                  thereof, publicly acknowledging it and her marriage, and, if that sad necessity
                  were imposed, go forth from her mother's house into the world alone.
               The meeting at Harding's was quite as great a surprise to Edith as to her mother;
                  but it was all the better, as giving occasion for the unqualified declaration of
                  her future purpose—a declaration that, as has been seen, she was prepared to
                  sustain.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               "IF the heart is not satisfied, mother, life at best is a heavy burden."
               Mrs. Beaufort and her daughter were sitting together, on the day after their
                  recovery of Grace, and talking calmly of the future. Hopeless of attaining her
                  ambitious ends, the former had given up the struggle, so long continued. Even
                  though but a few hours had passed since the unequal strife with Edith, she was
                  becoming clearly conscious that her course of action toward her child had been far
                  from just or humane, and that her position gave her no right to exercise so
                  tyrannical an influence. No longer compelled, by her own selfish purposes, to
                  cherish a feeling of antipathy toward Grace, she found her heart beginning to flow
                  forth toward the lovely infant. Such was the nameless attraction possessed by the
                  babe, that even with all her powerful reasons for wishing to annihilate her, if
                  that were possible sible, Mrs. Beaufort had not been able to resist the sphere of
                  her love-inspiring innocence. Now, when no barrier to affection reared itself, her
                  heart turned toward the infant, and opened itself with eagerness to take her in.
                  Quick to perceive the real change in her mother's feelings toward Grace, Edith
                  placed the little one in her arms, and with a thrill of exquisite delight saw it
                  drawn impulsively to her bosom. In that moment, the work of reconciliation was
                  accomplished. Against the winning attractions of Grace, Mrs. Beaufort had striven
                  from the beginning, but never with perfect success. It was all in vain, that, to
                  satisfy pride and ambition, she had cast her off; even in the separation, her
                  heart had mirrored the babe's sweet image; turned ever and anon toward her; and
                  yearned for her restoration. And now, when she came back to brighten, with her
                  seraphic presence, the darkness of their unhappy home, and no strong motive for
                  thrusting her out remained, her heart leaped toward her, panting with its
                  long-endured thirst to love, and receiving her therein with joy and gladness.
               "O mother!" added Edith, as they sat together, each striving for, and feeling the
                  way toward a truer reconciliation, "how vainly do we seek for happiness, if we
                  seek it beyond the range of our own true wants! We must look inward—not outward.
                  We must ask of our hearts—not of the world—how, and where, and with what
                  companionship we are to spend our life's probation. As for me, I desire nothing
                  beyond my own home, and an entire devotion of all I have and all I am to my child.
                  If that will satisfy me, why should any one seek my unhappiness by dragging me
                  into uncongenial spheres, or cursing me with associations against which my whole
                  nature revolts with loathing? As for Colonel D'Arcy—I speak of him now, because
                  you are better prepared to understand me than ever before—his friendship even
                  oppresses me. But, when he seeks a nearer association— presumes to ask of me the love given but once, and
                  never to be given again—I am almost suffocated with disgust. Yield him my hand,
                  mother! Never while I have strength to bind it to my side. I would brave a
                  thousand deaths in preference. He is a bad man—I know it by the quick repugnance
                  that fills my heart whenever he comes near me. Did he possess a single germ of
                  true manliness, he would not pursue me after all that has passed."
               A servant interrupted them by announcing that a strange man had called, and asked
                  to see Mrs. Beaufort.
               "What is his name?" inquired the lady.
               "He wishes to see you a moment; but would not give his name."
               "What kind of a looking man?"
               The servant described him.
               "Say that I will be down in a few moments." As the servant withdrew, the whole
                  manner of Mrs. Beaufort changed. "It is Harding," said she.
               Edith started, and turned pale, at the same time lifting Grace from her mother's
                  arms.
               "What is to be done? How did he find his way here?"
               "We must see him," said Mrs. Beaufort, after a few moments of hurried
                  reflection.
               "Both of us?"
               "Yes, Edith, both of us. And he must see Grace. Nothing is left now, but to
                  conciliate, and bring him, a certain degree, into our confidence. He and his wife
                  proved faithful to the trust reposed in them. They loved our little Grace truly,
                  and cared for her tenderly; and they must have their reward. There was a fine
                  manliness about his conduct last night, that raised him high in my estimation. I
                  think he can be trusted."
               "But he frightened me so, mother: he spoke so harshly, and seemed so cruel."
               "Was he not right, Edith, in seeking to prevent our taking away the babe,
                  strangers as we were, and refusing, as we did, to give any satisfaction as to our
                  personality? He was right, and I approved his manly firmness at the time."
               "I wish you would meet him alone, mother."
               "I do not think that will be best," replied Mrs. Beaufort. "We must not let him
                  see that we are afraid of him. Our relations are very different from what they
                  were last evening; and if we show a consciousness of our real position, he will
                  not be slow to perceive his own."
               The room into which the carpenter had been shown was a large parlour, richly
                  furnished, its six windows draped with heavy curtains of red satin damask. Around
                  the walls were hung many pictures, among which his eyes soon recognised his two
                  visitors of the previous night, Mrs. Beaufort and her daughter. The portrait of
                  Edith had been taken some five years previous, and, while it still bore to her a
                  striking resemblance, had all the innocent sweetness of gentle girlhood. As he
                  gazed, with a kind of fascination, upon this pictured countenance, it seemed to
                  change and grow life-like, and he almost started to his feet as he saw the eyes of
                  dear little Grace looking down, with a loving expression, from the canvas. He was
                  scarcely freed from the illusion, when he became aware that footsteps drew near
                  the door. Turning, he met the calm, dignified face of Mrs. Beaufort, and the pale,
                  timid, half-frightened countenance of her daughter, who held the babe he had lost
                  closely drawn to her bosom.
               "Mr. Harding!" said Mrs. Beaufort, speaking with entire self-possession, and
                  giving her hand to the carpenter as she advanced to meet him. "So you have found
                  us, my good friend," she added; "and it is, perhaps, as well. We had powerful
                  reasons for desiring to remain unknown. Under the circumstances, this was hardly possible. You, at least, were
                  not to be baffled in your search, as this early visit testifies. Sit down, Mr.
                  Harding. We had better understand each other fully."
               Harding was somewhat bewildered by the calmness of his reception. From the
                  dignified countenance of Mrs. Beaufort, his eyes turned to the sweet babe that lay
                  so closely drawn against the breast of its mother: as they did so, a softened
                  expression passed over his rough face.
               "Grace! Grace!" he said, tenderly, and advancing, reached out his hands.
               Edith moved off a pace or two; but the little one, the moment she heard the
                  well-known voice, started up, and, with a glad murmur, fluttered her rosy fingers,
                  and leaned eagerly forward, while her whole face was lit up with a joyful
                  recognition. Edith drew her back, while an expression of anxiety and alarm dimmed
                  her countenance.
               "Let her come to me, ma'am," said the carpenter, in a respectful voice—it trembled
                  with feeling.
               Edith glanced toward the door, fearfully. Harding understood the meaning of
                  this.
               "You need not mistrust me, ma'am." He stepped to the door, and closed it. As he
                  returned to where she stood he continued—"Jacob Harding has gone thus far in life
                  without a treacherous action, and he will not violate his honour now. Let her come
                  to me; oh! let her come! Let me feel the dear one again in my arms, where she has
                  lain so many, many times."
               Mrs. Beaufort, seeing that her daughter still hesitated, took Grace from her arms,
                  and placed her in those of the carpenter. As Harding received the precious burden,
                  he clasped her passionately, and spoke to her in the most endearing tones. The
                  little one answered him with her sweet love-language, and even drew her tiny arms
                  about his neck. How wildly he kissed her! Dim were his eyes as he restored her to
                  her mother; and he spoke not for emotion was too strong.
               "I am foolish," he said, as he recovered himself. "It is not manly, I know; but
                  that child has, from the beginning, softened my heart, until it has become weak as
                  a woman's. How you could ever have parted with her"—this thought restored his
                  self-possession, and he spoke with something of a rebuking sternness—"passes my
                  comprehension."
               "And it passes mine! it passes mine!" murmured Edith, speaking to herself, as she
                  bent lower over the babe, which the carpenter had restored to her arms.
               "As for the past," said Mrs. Beaufort—she spoke with a calmness and
                  self-possession that had its effect on Harding—"that must sleep, my friend, with
                  its errors and sufferings, as far as memory will let it sleep. All I will say of
                  it to you is, that I had ambitious views in regard to my daughter, which she
                  frustrated by a secret marriage. The death of her young husband, a few months
                  afterward, and while I was yet able to prevent the fact from becoming known,
                  revived all my ambitious hopes. The birth of this child I was able to conceal;
                  and, moreover, succeeded in so overshadowing the mind of its mother, as to induce
                  her, in a moment of partial derangement, to abandon it at your door—not yours by
                  choice, but by accident. The rest you know. The mother's heart was too strong in
                  my child. Her babe is again on her bosom, and there it must remain. Her grateful
                  thanks are yours for the tenderness with which you have cared for the babe; and
                  she will not let her gratitude, believe me, rest in her mind a fruitless
                  sentiment. For the present, all we ask of you is discretion. Let the knowledge of
                  our personality in connection with this matter remain wholly with you and your
                  wife. Of course the babe must now be acknowledged, and we shall proceed, without
                  delay, to give public, indisputable evidence of my daughter's marriage. As to the
                  abandonment of the child, with the circumstances attending it, if all becomes known in each minute particular, we
                  shall suffer strong opprobrium. Very naturally, I wish to escape this myself, and
                  especially to save my daughter from the charge of having abandoned to strangers,
                  of whom she knew nothing, her own tender infant. Can we trust in your prudence?
                  Will you not bind yourselves to us—you and your wife—by a new debt of
                  gratitude?"
               It was some time before Harding made any answer. His mind was bewildered by what
                  Mrs. Beaufort said. Plain enough was it, that the angel of their household was to
                  return to them no more; and the shadow already on his heart fell colder and
                  darker.
               "All does not lie with us," he remarked, scarcely reflecting on what he said.
               "Why not on you?"
               Mrs. Beaufort spoke anxiously.
               "The dressmaker you saw at Mrs. Barclay's yesterday directed my suspicions toward
                  you."
               "What!"
               Mrs. Beaufort grew excited.
               "Miss Gimp told me that you manifested a singular interest in us and the babe. I
                  asked her to describe you, and knew you by the description in a moment; therefore
                  I am here."
               "Bad—bad. That is bad. I was imprudent."
               Mrs. Beaufort spoke to herself.
               "I have also seen Mrs. Hartley of Overton."
               The face of Mrs. Beaufort flushed.
               "She knew you by my description."
               "Well?"
               "But refused to say who you was or where I could find you, unless I gave her my
                  entire confidence."
               "Which you——".
               "Did not," replied Harding. "Every thing was so much involved in mystery, that I
                  chose to be discreet."
               "That was well, But Miss Gimp—does she know of what took place last night?"
               "No one knows it out of my family, except Mr. Long, the schoolmaster, whose
                  prudence is altogether to be relied on."
               It was now Mrs. Beaufort's turn to be silent. For many minutes she sat revolving
                  in her mind all the difficult aspects of the affair in which she had become
                  involved. At length she said—
               "Mr. Harding, all we ask of you now is, entire silence to every one for the
                  present, in regard to what has transpired. We will offer you no personal
                  inducement to secure this, for that would be an insult to your manliness of
                  character. But you have laid us, and can still lay us, under a heavy burden of
                  gratitude. May we trust you?"
               "As entirely as you can trust yourselves," was the unhesitating answer. "I see no
                  good that can arise from bruiting the matter abroad. Why, then, shall it be done?
                  But there is one thing I must ask."
               "Name it."
               "The privilege for my wife of seeing the babe. Ah, ma'am! you know not how she
                  loves it. For many weeks it slept in her bosom, until it has grown to be a part of
                  herself. You know not her distress at its loss. Her eyes have been full of tears
                  ever since. To use all, the child has been as an angel. Strife has ceased in its
                  blessed presence, and the lowest murmur of its sweet voice has been a 'Peace, be
                  still,' to the wildest storm of passion."
               "Bring her here to-morrow," said Mrs. Beaufort, with a good-will in her voice,
                  that betokened her earnestness. "We would send our carriage, but for reasons that
                  need not be suggested to you."
               "Yes; bring her over," added Edith. "I wish to see her and know her. She has laid my heart under a
                  debt of gratitude."
               Harding arose. "Once more let me feel her in my arms," said he, as he fixed his
                  eyes lovingly on the infant.
               The timid mother did not hesitate, but resigned to him the babe, that looked up
                  fondly in his face, and smiled its sweetest smile.
               "God bless you and keep you." Harding spoke with deep feeling. He could say no
                  more. Kissing the pure lips and brow many times fervently, he handed the babe back
                  to her mother. As soon as he had recovered his self-possession, he withdrew
                  formally, saying that he would see them, in company with his wife, some time
                  during the next day. A few minutes afterward, he was galloping homeward as fast as
                  his horse's feet would carry him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               THOUGH removed from them, as to bodily presence, the angel of their household
                  still remained with the carpenter and his family. Not a member thereof, from the
                  rugged father down to little Lotty, but saw ever before the eyes of their spirits,
                  the dear young face that brought sunlight into their darkened dwelling; but they
                  saw her with tear-moistened vision. She was no longer theirs in physical
                  actuality; but present as in a dream that is never forgotten. Subdued even to
                  sadness, the intercourse between the members of the family was marked by a tender
                  regard, the one for the other. Each felt the other's grief at the loss of Grace,
                  and desired to lighten instead of increasing its pressure. As for Lotty, since
                  Grace left them, she had sought to win for herself that regard in her mother's
                  heart which the stranger had occupied. She was too young for reflection, and only
                  obeyed a heaven-inspired instinct. And as she knocked at the too long closed door
                  of her mother's heart, that door gradually yielded, until at last the rusty hinges
                  opposed no resistance, and it swung wide open to take her in.
               The intelligence brought back from Clifton, while it set the tears of Mrs. Harding
                  to flowing afresh, because it extinguished all hope of the babe's restoration to
                  her arms, relieved her mind greatly. There was a certainty about this
                  intelligence, that settled the doubtful question of its fate. It was, and would be
                  well with the child. Her love for it could ask no more, though her heart was
                  bleeding from the separation.
               To the eager questions of the children—"Where is Grace?" "Have you seen Grace, father?" "Isn't she
                  coming back any more?"—Mr. Harding answered with as much information in regard to
                  her as he deemed prudent, assuring them, at the same time, that if Grace did not
                  come to them again they should go to see her.
               During the evening, Mr. Long, the schoolmaster, called to learn the result of
                  Harding's visit to Clifton. To him, as a friend fully to be confided in, the
                  carpenter related the occurrences of the day.
               "She has been such a blessing, such a comfort to us," said Mrs. Harding, as they
                  sat talking of Grace.
               "God has given you many comforts, many blessings," answered the schoolmaster, as
                  he glanced meaningly toward her children, who were all present, quiet,
                  half-wondering auditors. Andrew, over whom Mr. Long had already acquired great
                  influence, was standing beside his teacher, proud of the notice and gratified with
                  the kindness ever extended to him by his judicious friend; while Lotty, who had
                  climbed into her mother's lap, was lying close against her breast, looking
                  contented—even happy.
               It was on the lips of Mrs. Harding to reply, "If they were only like Grace." But
                  her conscience rebuked her for the thought ere it found utterance, and she
                  remained silent. But she took the lesson to her heart, and as she did so, drew her
                  arm involuntarily tighter around Lotty, who, feeling the pressure, looked up at
                  her mother with a smile of love. In return, the soft cheek of the mother was bent
                  down until it rested on the sunny hair of her child.
               The schoolmaster saw that he was clearly understood, and did not mar the good
                  impression of his words by seeking to enforce their meaning.
               On the next morning, quite early, Mr. and Mrs. Harding, accompanied by Lotty,
                  started for Clifton. They had to pass the door of Miss Gimp, the dressmaker, on
                  their way, and she failed not to discover the fact that the carpenter and his wife
                  were riding out together—an event too noteworthy to be regarded with
                  indifference.
               "What does this mean? Where are they going?"
               Such were her rather excited questions, as she laid aside her work, and took her
                  place at the window, to note the direction they would take.
               "Over to Clifton? Hardly. Yes—I declare!—if they haven't taken the road to
                  Clifton! Ah, ha! There's something in the wind. I wonder if they can be going over
                  to Mrs. Beaufort's. I thought I could see deeper into the mind of Mrs. Harding
                  than she cared for. I was sure she knew more about Mrs. Beaufort than was
                  pretended. But whose child is it? I'd give my little finger to know."
               Unable to work with this mystery on her mind, Miss Gimp drew on her bonnet, and
                  ran over to see Mrs. Willits, the storekeeper's wife, for just a minute.
               "Our carpenter is getting up in the world," said she, as soon as she could thrust
                  in the words, after meeting her friend.
               "So I should think," answered Mrs. Willits, who had seen Harding go by; "riding
                  out with his wife at a time when other people are at work. My husband can't afford
                  such indulgence."
               "They were always a shiftless set."
               Miss Gimp spoke with some indignation. She could not forgive Mrs. Harding for the
                  impenetrable reserve she had thrown around herself at their interview on the
                  previous afternoon—a reserve felt to be both a wrong and an insult.
               "And will come to beggary in the end," said Mrs. Willits. "It was only last
                  evening that I heard Mr. Grant going on about Harding at a great rate. It appears
                  that he had promised to call over early in the morning to consult with him in
                  regard to a job that Grant, the farmer, wanted done. Mr. Grant waited at home until dinner-time, but no
                  carpenter came. It made him terribly angry. He stopped at our store in the
                  evening, and the way he talked about Harding would have done you good to hear. He
                  gave it to him right and left, I can assure you."
               "Didn't keep his promise with him?"
               "Not he—Mr. Indifference or Mr. Independence, whichever you choose to call
                  him."
               "Mr. Shiftless, you'd better say."
               "Well, Mr. Shiftless, then. And now he's playing the gentleman—riding out with his
                  wife as coolly as if he hadn't lost a good job!"
               "Mr. Grant won't have any thing more to do with him?"
               Miss Gimp spoke with a kind of pleased inquiry.
               "Not he."
               "Serves him right."
               "Of course it does. He said that early this morning he would go to Beechwood and
                  engage a carpenter there; and he swore—for he was in a great passion—that if
                  Harding starved, he'd never handle a dollar of his money so long as he lived."
               "I don't blame him," said Miss Gimp.
               "Nobody can blame him," responded Mrs. Willits.
               "D'ye know," remarked the dressmaker, lowering her voice, and speaking
                  mysteriously, "that in my opinion something more than a mere pleasure ride takes
                  them out this morning."
               "What are they after? where are they going?" inquired Mrs. Willits, brightening up
                  at this intimation on the part of Miss Gimp.
               "They took the road to Clifton, I'm certain."
               "To Clifton! Well, what great and mighty business takes them over to Clifton, I'd
                  like to know?"
               "Something about that child they've got, I'll venture my existence," said Miss
                  Gimp.
               "What of it?"
               Mrs. Willits brightened up still more.
               "I think I can guess where it came from."
               "Indeed!"
               "Of course, it is only guess-work; but, in putting this and that together, you
                  know, we often get very near the truth. I've been sewing at Mrs. Barclay's in
                  Beechwood."
               "Yes."
               "You've heard of Mrs. General Beaufort, who lives in Clifton?"
               "Yes."
               "Well, I never knew it before; but she's the sister of Mr. Barclay."
               "Is she?"
               "Yes. And she came over to see her brother about something while I was there."
               "Well?"
               "One day, when all the family were out, she came into the room where I was alone,
                  sewing, and made herself quite sociable. After talking around a while, she asked
                  if I knew Harding and his family. I said that I did. Then she wanted to know what
                  kind of people they were. Of course, I couldn't give them a very exalted
                  character, and didn't. It was plain enough to be seen that she had some secret
                  interest in them. Who first spoke of that little foundling baby, I can't now
                  remember; but the moment it was named, I saw that she knew a great deal more about
                  it than she cared me to guess. In order to bring her out, I spoke of Harding and
                  his wife in the strongest manner—taking good care to say, that in placing that
                  child in their hands, it was like putting a lamb among wolves. She grew uneasy and
                  excited at this; so much so, that she clearly felt that she was betraying herself,
                  and left me abruptly. That afternoon she went away, very unexpectedly to the
                     family mily. Depend upon it, Mrs.
                  Willits, she knows all about that baby."
               "Why don't you go to see Mrs. Harding, and feel around her?" inquired the
                  storekeeper's wife, who had become much interested in the dressmaker's gossip.
               "I've been already," answered Miss Gimp. "I came away from Mrs. Barclay's a day
                  sooner than I intended, and on purpose."
               "Ah? Well, what did you make out of her?"
               "Nothing certain. I saw Harding and his wife, but they were as close-mouthed as
                  terrapins."
               "Did you speak to them of Mrs. Beaufort?"
               "Yes; and its just my opinion that they got out of me all I know, and didn't let
                  me see below the surface of their thoughts. I was so provoked!'
               "And so you learned nothing?" said Mrs. Willits
               "Nothing certain. But it takes sharper people than they are to hide things from my
                  eyes. That both were greatly interested in Mrs. Beaufort, and knew far more about
                  her than they chose to tell, was plain enough; and that their ride over to
                  Clifton, this morning, is to see her, I do not in the last doubt."
               "I shouldn't wonder at all," remarked Mrs. Willits. "Mrs. General Beaufort! That
                  is news. Has she a daughter?"
               "I don't know," replied Miss Gimp.
               "Why didn't you ask Mrs. Barclay?"
               "Just what I've said to myself twenty times over. I'm provoked to death at my own
                  stupidity."
               "How soon are you going over there again?"
               "I can't tell. I don't think Mrs. Barclay will want me very soon."
               "We must find out in some way."
               "Yes, indeed. I'll not rest until I know all about it. You remember that Harry
                  Wilkins saw a woman carrying a basket on the night the child was left at
                  Harding's?"
               "Yes."
               "Very well. He told me that he's certain he saw the same woman, riding in a
                  carriage, in the neighbourhood of Clifton. Put this and that together, Mrs.
                  Willits, and it isn't very hard to make out a case."
               "I should think not. Depend upon it, you're fairly on the track. Harding isn't
                  riding out, this morning, for nothing. Had they the baby with them?"
               "That I couldn't see. I tried my best to look over into Mrs. Harding's arms, but
                  her husband was on the side next to me, and though I got up into a chair, it was
                  of no use. But I shouldn't at all wonder."
               "I'll tell you how you can find out."
               "How?"
               "Just by running over to their house for a minute. Of course, nobody's at home but
                  the children."
               "That's it," replied Miss Gimp, starting up. "I'll go this instant." And she
                  stepped toward the door.
               "Don't forget to stop as you come back," said the storekeeper's wife.
               "Oh! no. I'll be sure to call.
               And Miss Gimp left with the sprightly step of a young girl of sixteen. In some
                  twenty minutes, she returned.
               "Well?" said Mrs. Willits, as she came in.
               "No child there," answered the dressmaker.
               "No? Indeed?"
               "True as preaching."
               "Where is it?"
               Miss Gimp shook her head.
               "Who was there?"
               "Only Philip and Lucy."
               "Couldn't they tell?"
               "They couldn't, or wouldn't—which, I am at a loss to say. I never saw such mum,
                  stupid little wretches in my life."
               
               "Did you ask them where their father and mother had gone?"
               "Yes."
               "What answer did they make?"
               "Said they didn't know."
               "They lied, I suppose—instructed by their parents."
               "As like as not," answered Miss Gimp. "But isn't it dreadful to think of? Who can
                  wonder if they go to destruction?"
               "Nobody. And so the child is gone?"
               "Yes. No doubt they took it with them, this morning. But I'll find out all about
                  it, by hook or by crook, see if I don't."
               And with this assurance, the dressmaker, who had a good deal of work on hand, to
                  be ready by a certain time, took her departure to renew her vain efforts at
                  meeting her engagements. To promise was a part of her profession—and not to keep
                  these promises to the letter, the other part. Having the interests of the whole
                  neighbourhood to attend to, it was impossible to be entirely punctual in such
                  unimportant matters.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               IT was past midday when the carpenter and his wife returned from Clifton, each
                  with sober but not troubled countenances. Their anxieties about the babe's welfare
                  were fully satisfied; but they came back with the sad assurance that its sweet
                  smile had faded from their home for ever—that an angel had departed from among
                  them, and with it, they feared, the sweet, angelic influences that, in so brief a
                  time, had made their desert to blossom as the rose.
               A hurried dinner was prepared, and then Harding went to his shop, that had now
                  been closed for nearly two whole days. It was his intention to go from there,
                  immediately, to farmer Grant's to make 
                     ararngements
                     arrangements
                   about the new roof, which he had promised to attend to immediately. He
                  was just on the eve of doing so when a neighbour stopped at the door, and
                  said—
               "Why, what's been the matter, Harding? I was about going over to your house, to
                  see if you were sick or dead."
               "I've had a little business to attend to, which has taken all my time for nearly
                  two days," replied the carpenter; "but I'm through with it now, and at my post
                  again."
               "You've lost a job by it, I'm thinking," said the neighbour.
               "How so?"
               "I heard Grant abusing you right and left for not keeping an engagement, yesterday
                  morning. He said you promised to come over and see him about a new roof to his
                  barn; and that he waited in for you a greater part of the day. He was dreadfully put out; and in the
                  afternoon, rode over to Beechwood, and engaged a carpenter there."
               "Are you sure of that?" asked Harding, as his countenance fell.
               "Very sure. I saw him riding over, myself."
               "I'm sorry. If he'd known why I was unable to keep my engagement, he
                  would not have acted so hastily. I was, this moment, about going to see him."
               "It won't be of any use, I can tell you. Why didn't you send him word that it was
                  out of your power to see him?"
               "I should have done so, but didn't think of it."
               "And, what is more," said the neighbour, "Mr. Edgar was going to engage you to
                  build an addition to his house; but Grant talked so strong about you—saying, among
                  other things, that you were not to be depended upon—that he concluded to employ
                  another carpenter. So you see, this 'little business' of yours has proved rather a
                  bad business. But, good morning! I mustn't stop here."
               The neighbour departed. As he turned his back, Harding folded his arms, and
                  leaning hard against his workbench, gave way to feelings of despondency, not
                  unmingled with reproaches toward Heaven for the hardness, even injustice, of these
                  cruel reactions.
               "I've done nothing to merit this," said he, in partial utterance of his true
                  feelings. "Nothing! nothing! Then why am I left without work, though my hands are
                  strong and my heart willing? God never hedges up a man's way in one direction
                  without opening it in another—so says the schoolmaster—and so I began to think
                  when Grant came with the offer of one job after I had lost another. But now the
                  way that opened so encouragingly before me is closed, even before I had set my
                  foot therein. I wonder in which direction it will now open?"
               The bitterness of distrust was in both Harding's voice and countenance.
               "There's no use in folding your arms and standing idle," said a voice, speaking
                  within him.
               "Of course, not. But what am I to do? There's not a single stroke of work on
                  hand." The carpenter answered his own thought thus, speaking aloud.
               "Do something—make something. There are lumber and tools in your shop."
               As the inward voice said this, the eyes of Harding rested on a half-finished pine
                  table, which he had commenced in an idle hour, and thrown aside for other work. It
                  was suggested to him to complete the table rather than not do any thing. This
                  suggestion he resisted for a time, because he had no heart to work, particularly
                  as the work promised no return.
               "Finish the table. Somebody will want it."
               The voice spoke again. With something like blind obedience to this inward monitor,
                  the carpenter commenced working on the table. The effort naturally relieved his
                  mind from the heavy pressure under which it was bowed down. He felt better, but
                  did not know why. He had yet to learn that in all useful work the mind rests with
                  a degree of calmness; that there is a power in true mental or bodily labour, to
                  sustain the spirit in doubt, pain, or sorrow. Once engaged in his task, he pursued
                  it with a natural ardour, and, at the end of two hours, a well-made table stood
                  finished in his shop. He was looking at it with a certain degree of pleasure, when
                  Stark, who had been very shy of him for some weeks, presented himself at the
                  shop-door.
               "The very article I want," said the tavern-keeper, as his eyes fell on the table.
                  "Is it to order, or on sale?"
               Three dollars of anybody's money will buy it," answered the carpenter.
               
               "Enough said," returned Stark, drawing out his purse. "Here's the coin. I'll send
                  my Tom over for it in half an hour. And, see here, Harding, if you've got time, I
                  wish you'd make me two good, strong benches, about eight feet long. Some chaps got
                  to skylarking over in my house last night, and smashed one all to pieces for me.
                  How much will you charge for them?"
               The carpenter took a piece of chalk, and figured up the cost of the wood.
               "Two dollars apiece," said he.
               "Very well. Make them. How soon will they be done?"
               "As I've nothing particular on hand to-day, I'll get out the stuff this afternoon,
                  and finish them some time early in the morning."
               "That will do." And the tavern-keeper went his way, leaving three dollars in the
                  carpenter's pocket, and his mind something easier. The stuff for the two benches
                  was got out, and the work on both nearly completed by sundown, when Harding closed
                  his shop and returned home. On his way, the gloomy, desponding state of mind
                  returned. As he looked into the future, only a wall of darkness loomed up before
                  him. His best customers had left him—the season was advanced—and no ground to
                  build a hope upon was under his feet. Mrs. Harding saw the heavy contraction of
                  his brows as he entered, and it caused a shadow to fall upon her heart. Had the
                  evil spirit, which the presence of Grace drove out, come back to him again? Alas!
                  alas! if it were so! Yes, the evil spirit had come back, but, as yet its power
                  over him was small. It lay in his breast as a live coal, and only waited for the
                  fuel of excitement, to kindle a blaze of destructive passion. Happily, that fuel
                  was not supplied. There was nothing in his home to fret or disturb him. His wife
                  spoke to him so kindly, that he could not but answer kindly, and the children were
                  so quiet among themselves, that no cause of annoyance or anger existed in that
                  direction. Still, he remained gloomy, almost entirely silent.
               "I don't know what is going to become of us, Mary," said he, as they sat together,
                  after the children had gone to bed. The gentleness and kindness of his wife's
                  manner had gradually subdued the state of irritability that threatened so much of
                  evil; and now he felt like drawing nearer to her—letting her share his anxieties,
                  and offer him her sympathy.
               "Why do you say this, Jacob?" Mrs. Harding raised her eyes to the sober face of
                  her husband.
               "I haven't a stroke of work."
               "How comes that?" The interrogation was so gently made, that it encouraged,
                  instead of repressing confidence.
               "Dear knows! I don't just understand it. To me, it seems very strange, that just
                  now work should all stop, when there's not been a day before, in ten years, that I
                  hadn't as much as I could do. I promised Mr. Grant to call yesterday morning about
                  putting a new roof on his barn. But you know why I couldn't see him. He got angry
                  because I didn't keep my appointment, and gave the job to a carpenter over in
                  Beechwood."
               "That's only a single job," said Mrs. Harding, without seeming to be in the least
                  troubled by the gloomy prospect before them. "You're a good workman, that every
                  one knows. And I've often heard you say, that a man who does good work, never need
                  fear but what he'll have enough to do."
               "Yes, Mary; but look how far the season is advanced. Every good job that I
                  expected has gone into other hands, and I don't know a soul that now talks of
                  building even a pig-pen this year. I feel completely disheartened. If we were only
                  a little beforehand, I wouldn't feel so
                  bad. But we are not. Every thing is run down, and I haven't ten dollars
                  ahead."
               Just then some one knocked at the door. Harding opened it, and found a strange
                  man, with a large bundle in his hand. His own name was inquired for.
               "I am the person," he answered.
               "Mrs. Beaufort sent this letter to you"—handing a letter—"and this bundle to Mrs.
                  Harding"—reaching out the package.
               "Won't you come in?" said the carpenter, as he received the letter and
                  package.
               "No, sir. It is late, and I must ride over to Clifton to-night."
               The man departed, and Harding turned back into the house. Breaking the seal of the
                  letter with unsteady hands, he opened it, and read—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I wish to see you tomorrow. Come over early. If I am not mistaken, I
                              can serve your worldly interests materially. I learn that you are a
                              good workman, and faithful in the performance of whatever you may
                              undertake. I am about putting up several outbuildings, and making some
                              important alterations in my house. It is partly in reference to these
                              matters that I wish to see you.
                           
                              "EDITH BEAUFORT."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Within this letter, another, directed to Mrs. Harding, was enclosed.
               "O Jacob! Just see here!" By the time her husband had gathered the meaning of his
                  letter, Mrs. Harding was in full possession of the contents of hers. As she thus
                  exclaimed, she held up two bank bills, each claiming the valuation of fifty
                  dollars, while her face had a bright, joyful, wondering expression.
               "Why, Mary!" ejaculated the bewildered carpenter, as he reached out for the letter
                  of his wife. It read—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Accept, dear madam, from one who can never forget, and never repay
                              the debt she owes you, the enclosed as a first act of justice. Use it
                              for yourself and children. Accept, also, a few small presents for
                              yourself and them. I have talked much with my mother about you and
                              your good husband since you left us this morning; and I think, if
                              there is nothing to bind you to your present place of abode, that we
                              shall soon have you near us. We are about making some extensive
                              repairs, improvements, and alterations in and around our home, and my
                              mother thinks that your husband is just the man to whom she can safely
                              intrust their execution. She desires him to see her in the morning.
                              Urge him to come without fail.
                           
                              "Yours, with gratitude,
                              "EDITH PERCIVAL."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "It is broad daylight now." Such were the carpenter's words, after sitting silent
                  for some moments.
               "The darkest hour is just before daybreak, you know," said Mrs. Harding, her eyes
                  filling with glad tears.
               "Providence never hedges up a man's way in one direction, without opening in
                  another. So Mr. Long said to me; and so I tried to believe. But how can one
                  believe with a mountain rising up in his path, and thick darkness on either side
                  of him? I cannot."
               "But let us not forget, Jacob"—Mrs. Harding's voice was subdued, almost
                  humble—"what more the schoolmaster said in his kind and earnest talks with
                  us."
               "What did he say, Mary?"
               "That the hedging up of our way in life, and the opening of new paths, are not for
                  the alone sake of worldly good."
               "Yes, I remember." The carpenter bowed his head thoughtfully.
               "But for the sake of heavenly and eternal good," continued Mrs. Harding. "How much
                  he talked of our mental wants, and of
                  our mental sufferings! and as he talked, did we not both see and feel, that mere
                  bodily wants and sufferings were nothing in comparison to these? The natural event
                  of finding a babe at our door, which we received with reluctance, how much delight
                  of mind it produced! Now, it was in providence, as Mr. Long said, that the babe
                  was so left at our door; and does it not seem, that it was so provided for, in
                  order that, through this natural event, our spirits might become better and
                  happier? Surely, we are all better and happier for the presence of dear little
                  Grace among us?"
               "Have I not said so a hundred times, Mary?" There was light in the carpenter's
                  face as he said this.
               "And will we not all be better and happier, if we can be where our eyes, every
                  little while, may look upon her angel face? Oh yes, I know we will, for the sight
                  of that face will lift our hearts upward, and make us desire that spiritual
                  innocence of which, as Mr. Long so beautifully said, she was the perfect bodily
                  correspondent. And the desire will prompt us to resist the evils of our nature;
                  and if we resist evil, you know, it is said that it will depart from us. Dear
                  husband!"—and as Mrs. Harding, animated with her subject, leaned toward him, and
                  laid her hand upon his arm, the carpenter saw, as of late he had seen so many
                  times, the sweet beauty in her face that had charmed and won his love in the time
                  gone by—"dear husband! let us believe that the hedging up of your way in the old
                  direction, and the opening of it in this, is not so much for the sake of worldly
                  prosperity as for the higher good of our spirits. Oh! is not peace of mind more to
                  be desired than all earthly benefits? It is, Jacob; my heart—your heart—replies
                  that it is. Let us, then, in accepting the earthly good, look still higher, and
                  claim the better portion that may be ours."
               "You are learning these wise lessons faster than I am, Mary," said the carpenter,
                  with a tenderness of manner that went to the heart of his wife. "In the school of
                  good I shall be, I fear, a slow learner. But the apter scholar must have patience
                  with my poor progress. I am hasty, moody, and passionate by nature, Mary, as you
                  know too well. As you overcome, give me aid. If you can keep your heart in the
                  sunlight, mine will not long remain under the cloud. If your sky continues serene,
                  the storm will soon pass from mine. Try and remember this, Mary, and in my darker
                  moods, bear with me. You will surely have your reward."
               "And in my darker moods, Jacob," answered his wife—"and they will come—for I, too,
                  am hasty and passionate: you must bear with me. Oh, let us help one another!"
               The pledges and promises of that hour were never forgotten, as the brighter,
                  happier future attested. On examining the package sent by the mother of Grace, it
                  was found to contain various articles of clothing for Mrs. Harding and her
                  children, besides a handsome vest pattern, and a dozen fine silk handkerchiefs for
                  the carpenter. They were gratefully received, coming, as they did so timely, and
                  under circumstances that did not make the gift a burdening obligation. Tranquil
                  was their sleep that night, and the morning of a new day found them looking
                  hopefully into the brightening future.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXI.
               A MONTH later in the progress of events, and we find the carpenter and his family
                  residing in a small, neat house, on the estate of Mrs. Beaufort, happily relieved
                  from all anxiety about the "bread that perishes," and surrounded with more of
                  taste and comfort than they had ever known. Harding had already entered, actively,
                  upon the execution of such work as Mrs. Beaufort first desired, and, thus far, was
                  giving every satisfaction. Why should this not be? for he was quick and skilful in
                  all the branches of his trade, and perfectly honest in the execution of whatever
                  might be intrusted to him. All that could be done to make Mrs. Harding's new home
                  a pleasant one was done by Mrs. Percival, who came over, almost daily, to see her,
                  accompanied by her babe, whose visits to the carpenter's family ever seemed like
                  the shining in of sunbeams. Grace was still the angel of their household, beating
                  back through her sweet presence to their bodily eyes, or, when absent, to the eyes
                  of their spirits, the natural passions, which, like evil beasts, were striving to
                  devour the innocent affections just born in their hearts, and which were daily
                  gaining strength and beauty. Bright moments to Harding, in the day's circle of
                  hours, were those in which the babe, borne in the arms of her nurse, came out to
                  see him at his work. If he laid down his axe, his saw, or his plane at such times,
                  that he might take the happy little one, and hold her against his heart, who could
                  blame the act, or deem him an idler from his tasks? Not a stroke the less was
                  given for these moments of self-indulgence—if we may call them by so cold a
                  name—for they sent new life through the carpenter's nerves, and fresh vigour to
                  his willing hands.
               Only a few weeks were permitted to pass ere the public announcement of Edith's
                  marriage was made, accompanied by such evidence to all interested friends, as
                  removed even the shadow of doubt or suspicion. The fact of the babe's abandonment
                  by its mother at the door of a stranger, was never clearly understood. That it had
                  been in the carpenter's family was known; but under what peculiar circumstances it
                  came there, was a matter of question even to the neighbours of Harding. Beyond
                  this narrow circle, it was taken for granted, that in order to conceal the
                  marriage and birth of the child, Mrs. Harding had been selected as the nurse, and
                  pledged to secrecy in regard to its parentage. Even among the carpenter's old
                  neighbours, this theory finally prevailed, in consequence of its adoption by Miss
                  Gimp.
               "I always said"—so the dressmaker gossiped, after having settled to her own
                  satisfaction all the difficulties presented by the case—"that Mrs. Harding knew a
                  great deal more about the child than she cared to tell. I said this in the
                  beginning, and I've never altered my mind. You can't make me believe that people
                  like the Hardings would take a strange babe into their house, and treat it even
                  better than one of their own, unless well paid for it. It isn't in nature, much
                  less in the nature of such people."
               And this solution of the matter was pretty generally adopted, thus saving the
                  young mother that crushing odium which must have followed the clear annunciation
                  of her act, even done as it was in a state of partial derangement.
               Two months only had passed, since Edith was presented to her friends in her true
                  character, when Colonel D'Arcy, not to be baffled in the pursuit of her hand,
                  wrote her a long, earnest letter of sympathy and confidence fidence, begging forgiveness at the same time for
                  the ardour of his attentions at a period when she must have been bowed to the
                  earth with sorrow—a sorrow of which he was "necessarily ignorant"—and asking the
                  privilege of occasionally visiting at her mother's house as a friend. Not to leave
                  the matter solely to her unbiassed decision, the gallant colonel wrote also to
                  Mrs. Beaufort, mentioning his letter to her daughter; and frankly saying to her
                  that, notwithstanding the secret marriage of Edith, and birth of a child, now that
                  her husband was dead, he was ready again to offer his hand. Instantly, the
                  smouldering ambition of this proud woman was fanned into a blaze; and, once more,
                  she resolved to compass, if possible, the long-desired marriage of her daughter.
                  The acknowledgment of Edith's true relation—that of the widowed wife of an
                  obscure, young adventurer—would, she had not doubted, at once settle all so far as
                  D'Arcy was concerned; and this was why she strove so desperately to prevent its
                  taking place. In consenting to publicity, she had abandoned her ambitious hopes.
                  Now, they all started again into vigorous life. The hand of her daughter was yet
                  deemed worthy of possession, even by Colonel D'Arcy; the marriage, so dear to her
                  heart, might yet be accomplished; and she instantly resolved that its failure
                  should not be in consequence of any want of effort on her part.
               The two letters came by the same post. Edith had just finished reading hers, when
                  Mrs. Beaufort, the ardour of whose reawakened purpose impelled to an immediate
                  interview with her daughter, entered the room where she sat, with the flush of
                  outraged womanhood yet warm upon her cheeks.
               "Is your letter from Colonel D'Arcy?" inquired the mother, slightly hesitating, in
                  the conscious conviction that the subject would be disagreeable.
               "It is," was Edith's simple yet firm response.
               "He knows of your marriage?"
               "Yes."
               "May I see your letter?"
               Edith handed the letter to her mother, who after reading it, said—
               "What answer will you make?"
               "None," was replied.
               "None! That will be uncourteous."
               "He is entitled to no courtesy from me," was the decisive answer, "and will get
                  none."
               "But, Edith"—Mrs. Beaufort's face was flushing, and her eyes beginning to
                  glitter.
               "Mother!"—Edith interrupted her—"what I have said to you, hitherto, about this
                  man, was said from the heart; and I give it a repeated utterance, hardly
                  repressing a cry of abhorrence. His very name is an offence; and his presence
                  here, if you permit him to come, will be to me an outrage. I understand the hidden
                  import of his glossing letter clearly; but he writes to me in vain. No—not even as
                  a friend will I receive him. Mother!—"
               A hurried step was heard this instant in the hall, and Edith, checking the
                  utterance of what was on her tongue, started, with eager eyes and changing cheeks,
                  to the floor. With hands raised and partly extended, and her gaze riveted on the
                  entrance to the room, she stood, her ear bent to the sounding tread of a man's
                  approaching feet. An instant more, and uttering wildly the cry—
               "Henry! Oh, my husband! my husband!" she threw herself upon the breast of a tall,
                  handsome, embrowned young man, who sprung forward to receive her, and catching her
                  eagerly in his arms, covered her face with kisses.
               "O Henry! am I dreaming?" sobbed the bewildered young creature, as, disengaging
                  herself partly from his arms, she gazed
                  into his face, pressing the hair back with both hands from his ample forehead.
               "Not dreaming, Edith, dear," he answered. "The dream is part—this is the glad
                  awakening."
               "My husband! My dear, dear husband!" And, fondly, Edith laid her head upon his
                  bosom. A moment only it rested there; then, starting up, she caught him by the
                  arm, and, drawing him toward a door that opened into an adjoining room, said—
               "Come."
               He followed, as she led.
               "Look!"
               They had entered, and were beside a cradle in which their babe was sleeping.
               "It is ours, Henry!—our sweet, precious one!—our darling Grace!" And lifting it
                  tenderly, she laid it in his arms.
               As if a blasting spectre had met her vision, Mrs. Beaufort fled to her chamber at
                  the sight of Percival, and was now hidden from all eyes but those of her Maker.
                  She had fully believed him dead, and had rejoiced in his death; his sudden
                  appearance, therefore, was as of one risen from the dead. His coming, too, just as
                  old schemes, so long cherished, were about being reconstructed, to scatter all her
                  mad ambition to the wind, seemed so like Heaven's mockery, that, with a crushed,
                  helpless feeling, she shrunk into herself, and bowed her spirit in the bitterness
                  of forced submission.
               Two hours afterward—Edith, who knew her too well to intrude during the time, had
                  not even tapped at her chamber-door—she came forth, and received the husband of
                  her daughter with a degree of cordiality altogether unexpected.
               "We believed you dead, Mr. Percival," said she. "Can you explain why we were
                  deceived by false intelligence? Mr. Maris wrote to us, first, that you were very
                  ill, and soon after, that you had died of a malignant southern fever."
               "I was ill, very ill, for a time," the young man answered, "but not of a malignant
                  southern fever. The physician at the hospital to which I was sent to die, and
                  where, in providence, I was permitted to recover, strongly suspected that I had
                  been unfairly dealt by—some of my symptoms resembling in a marked degree the
                  effects of poison."
               "Poison!" Mrs. Beaufort looked startled as she gave almost involuntary utterance
                  to the word.
               "Yes; and I have now but little doubt that such was the case; for I learn, with no
                  small surprise, that after my reported death, Colonel D'Arcy renewed his offers
                  for the hand of Edith."
               "Colonel D'Arcy! What of him? What had he to do with your sickness?" Mrs.
                  Beaufort's countenance became suddenly clouded.
               "I know not that he had any thing to do with it," replied Percival; "but this I
                  know, he was a friend of Mr. Maris, and visited him on the night I was taken sick.
                  They drank wine together, and both urged me with such gracious kindness to take a
                  glass of sherry with them, that I could not refuse. Colonel D'Arcy touched his
                  glass to mine, and said, in a singularly altered voice, so it struck me at the
                  moment—
               "'Your good health, Mr. Percival.'
               "I did not like the man, for out of his eyes an evil spirit had ever looked at me.
                  On this particular occasion, that spirit seemed to glare upon me with a kind of
                  malignant triumph. Soon after drinking the wine, I felt an unusual heat in my
                  stomach, which gradually pervaded my system. My head grew heavy and painful, and
                  my body hot and sluggish. On complaining of indisposition, Mr. Maris advised me to
                  go home, saying that a few hours' rest would restore me. But so far from that, I was in a raging fever all night, and
                  early on the next morning, at his suggestion, as I afterward learned of Mr. Maris,
                  I was sent to the hospital to die. An ordinary fever would have run to its crisis,
                  terminating in favour of or against the patient, in a certain number of days; but
                  the fever which had seized upon me was altogether different, and seemed as if it
                  would never tire drinking at my vitals. When, at last, its fire abated, I was left
                  so much exhausted, that small hope of recovery was felt by either physician or
                  attendants. It was more than two months before strength sufficient to bear the
                  weight of my body was gained. Then the life-current began to flow more freely; and
                  a few weeks of rapid convalescence placed me so near to health, that I ventured to
                  make this homeward journey. Soon after I was taken to the hospital, a man named
                  Henry Percival died in one of the sick wards. Mr. Maris, I suppose, took it for
                  granted that my death was the one reported, and immediately communicated the fact
                  to you."
               For a considerable time after the young man ceased speaking, Mrs. Beaufort sat
                  with her eyes upon the floor, evidently in deep and troubled thought.
               "There's a dark mystery here," she said, at length, speaking partly to herself.
                  "Mr. Maris, then, is a particular friend of Colonel D'Arcy?" she added, raising
                  her eyes.
               "They appeared to be very intimate. I often saw them together."
               "It's a strange story." She again seemed speaking to herself. "And I can't make it
                  all out. Colonel D'Arcy?—Mr. Maris?—poison?"
               As Percival looked at her fixedly, he saw a low shudder pass through her frame. A
                  dark suspicion entered his mind on the instant, but he resolutely thrust it out;
                  and, in doing so, he was but just to Mrs. Beaufort. If he had been dealt by
                  foully, of which there was small reason to doubt, she was no party to the wicked
                  deed.
               A few days afterward, Colonel D'Arcy, following up his letters with a degree of
                  confident assurance, made a visit to Clifton, in order to throw the weight of his
                  personal influence in the scale, and thus secure a preponderance in his
                  favour.
               Mrs. Beaufort, now that all blinding antagonism toward Percival was laid aside,
                  and closer contact gave her a better view of his character and a clearer
                  appreciation of his worth, began to find herself drawn toward him with a power of
                  attraction, at first resisted, but hourly gaining strength. His intelligence was
                  of a different order from that by whose glitter she had been attracted through
                  life. It was not the obtrusive intelligence which is assumed for
                  effect—illustrating only the pride of its possessor—but had in it a soul of moral
                  wisdom—a beautiful humanity, warm with a higher life. Often, as he talked, she
                  listened with something akin to wonder; and, as her eyes rested upon his animated
                  countenanace, she saw in it a manly beauty, caught from the inspiring soul, that
                  compelled a half-reluctant admiration. Not unfrequently, at these times, would the
                  face of Colonel D'Arcy present itself before the eyes of her mind with singular
                  vividness, yet ever marred by an expression, well remembered as peculiarly its
                  own, but now, as seen in contrast with the fine countenance of Percival,
                     felt to be cruel, selfish, and debasingly sensual. Almost with a
                  shudder, at such times, would she close her bodily eyes, seeking to destroy the
                  unpleasant vision. It was on an occasion like this that the servant announced
                  Colonel D'Arcy.
               "Impossible!" exclaimed Mrs. Beaufort, thrown entirely from her guard.
               The name was repeated.
               "Tell him that I will be down in a few minutes," she said, recovering herself.
               
               For some moments the three looked at each other in doubt and irresolution. All of
                  them knew well the object of his visit. Percival was the first to speak.
               "Let us," said he, "go down together and receive him. He thinks I am dead, if he
                  thinks of me at all. Should my suspicions be true, at sight of me he will be
                  thrown from his guard and betray himself. Come! Let us go at once."
               And he arose, moving on a pace or two in the direction of the door. Mrs. Beaufort
                  and Edith followed, as if impelled by his will—the latter carrying Grace in her
                  arms.
               Side by side they entered the parlour where D'Arcy sat awaiting some member of the
                  family.
               "Colonel D'Arch!"
               Mrs. Beaufort inclined her body gracefully, and smiled upon her visitor with a
                  bland smile. But he saw not the motion nor the smile, for his eyes were riveted
                  instantly on the calm face of Percival, who, with his young wife shrinking to his
                  side and holding her babe against her bosom, looked at him steadily and sternly.
                  Only for a moment did he stand in the attitude of astonishment assumed as the
                  unexpected apparition confronted him—then, with a look of dismay and a exclamation
                  of terror, he swept past the little group and fled from the house.
               "I did not err in my suspicions," said Percival, speaking with entire
                  self-possession. "He is guilty of having sought my life. Dear Edith!" he added, as
                  he drew an arm around her, and pressed his lips to her pure forehead—"how thankful
                  am I for your dear sake that his wicked purpose failed."
               "My children!"
               The arms of Mrs. Beaufort were flung suddenly around them both.
               "My children!"
               Her voice choked, and what she would have said further, remained unspoken. Pride
                  could not suffer her to betray the strong agitation she felt.
               There were a few moments of silence. Then she disengaged her arms, and turning
                  from them, retired with slow and stately steps to her own apartments.
               
               One scene more, briefly sketched, and the curtain must fall upon our
                  characters.
               A few months have glided pleasantly by. The nearer view that Mrs. Beaufort now had
                  of the son-in-law accepted with such an intense reluctance, enabled her to see the
                  higher qualities of mind with which he was endowed; as well as the sterling
                  virtues already developed in one so young. Her estates were large, and needed the
                  intelligent care of a man who had some acquaintance with legal and landed affairs.
                  This knowledge, the education of Percival had in a measure supplied; and his calm
                  judgment and integrity of purpose were a guarantee for the rest that Mrs. Beaufort
                  was very ready to accept: and the result involved no measure of
                  disappointment.
               So well pleased was she with our friend the carpenter, that she soon made a
                  contract with him to remain as overseer on her estate, at a liberal salary.
               It was a warm afternoon near the close of the ensuing May, that Mrs. Percival
                  stepped across the broad green lawn that sloped gently from her mother's fine old
                  mansion, and took her way to the pleasant cottage-home of the carpenter and his
                  family, that stood only at a short distance. On entering, she found no one in the
                  sitting-room; but, with the familiarity of a friend who knows the awaiting welcome
                  at all times, she pushed open the door of the adjoining apartment, when a sight
                  met her eyes that made the blood leap
                  warmer from her heart. A week before, had been born in that chamber, another babe;
                  and it was to see the mother and inquire after her wants, if any were unsupplied,
                  that Mrs. Percival had now come. She supposed that Harding was absent at work, but
                  this was not so. The fact was, scarcely an hour passed during each day, since the
                  little stranger came, that he did not run in to look at its fair young face, or
                  take it in his great, strong arms, and bear it about the room. He was sitting now
                  near the bed, where lay his happy wife, with her face turned toward him and the
                  babe; and he was holding the tender little one on his arm, and gazing with a look
                  that could not be mistaken for love, down upon the sweet image of innocence.
                  Around were grouped the children, and little Lotty, standing between her father's
                  knees, was laying her white finger softly on the baby's cheek, and talking to it
                  fondly.
               As Mrs. Percival swung open the door, and at a glance comprehended the scene, she
                  said, with a pleasant familiarity that her previous intercourse with them
                  warranted—
               "Ah! nursing that baby again, Mr. Harding? Why, one would think you'd never had a
                  baby in your house before!"
               "We never knew the value of a baby," replied the carpenter, "until yours came to
                  us and won our hearts. Ah! She was the Angel of our Household, and it was a hard
                  trial to see her go forth never to return again. But God has given us another
                  angel."
               "And may she be dearer to you than the one you have lost," said Mrs. Percival, as
                  she reached over and took the precious burden from the arms of Mr. Harding. "Have
                  you chosen a name for it yet?"
               Mrs. Harding glanced toward her husband.
               "It was chosen the hour of her birth," answered the carpenter.
               "Is it Grace?"
               Mrs. Percival smiled as she made the inquiry.
               "No other name would express our love for her. Yes, it is Grace!"
               "May she indeed prove, as I am sure she will, the Angel of your Household," said
                  Mrs. Percival, with touching solemnity.
               An audible "Amen" broke the stillness that followed; and, as we repeat the word,
                  the curtain falls.
