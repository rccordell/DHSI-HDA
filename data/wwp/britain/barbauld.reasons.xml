<lb/>lated to display a pompous scene of national worship, their
<lb/>purpose might very justly be derided, and their utility safely
<lb/>denied. There would be a species of pride, even in our
<lb/>acts of humiliation and penance, if they did not generate a
<lb/>train of serious and sober reflections, suited to the present
<lb/>aspect of the times, as well as to our participation in the
<lb/>events which they have produced. We shall not reap any

<lb/>instructions from this religious exercise, unless our attention
<lb/>be directed to the circumstances which rendered it necessary.
<lb/>There are, indeed, in the history of nations, as in the lives
<lb/>of individuals, seasons of sorrow and calamity, when no
<lb/>employment is so pleasant, or useful, as that of <quote>lifting
<lb/>the eyes upwards,</quote> and of counting, as it were, the links
<lb/>of the chain, that connects us with heaven. We are, how­
<lb/>ever, performing a service, as displeasing to God, as it is
<lb/>uninstructive to man, if, upon such an occasion, we neg­
<lb/>lected to enquire into the causes of the misfortunes we la­
<lb/>ment, or if we did not feel the sincerest penitence for the
<lb/>sins, whose pardon we implore.
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">It is necessary, therefore, that we should not join in the
<lb/>appointed duties of the day, but with rational and proper
<lb/>conceptions of the end of such an institution. If we
<lb/>imagine that we ought to enter our churches, to pour out
<lb/>our spleen, and express our malice to our enemies, to mingle
<lb/>execrations against <emph>them</emph> with our prayers for
<emph>ourselves</emph>, we
<lb/>have grossly misunderstood its purpose and its principles.
<lb/>Let us not be deceived. It is not surely an act of pub­
<lb/>lic expiation, which is intended to absolve us, as it were,
<lb/>from our former accounts with heaven, and to give us cou­
<lb/>rage and vigour in the future perpetration of our crimes.
<lb/>Nor let us reason thus with ourselves:—<said rend="bestow((pre(“))(lb))">The atheists of
<lb/>France never offer up a prayer, nor proclaim public fastings.
<lb/>Surely, then, our austerity and abstinence will obtain
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">“the</mw>
<pb n="3"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">3</mw>
<lb/>the divine assistance and co-operation in our cause.</said>—
<lb/>We cannot subsidize the Deity, as we have subsidized his
<lb/>majesty of Sardinia. Unless our hearts be penitent, the
<lb/>solemn repetition of liturgies, and the formal confession of
<lb/>our sins, will avail us nothing against the judgments which
<lb/>a whole year of slaughter and devastation has stored up
<lb/>against us. We cannot bribe him into complacence, after
<lb/>having laid waste, and destroyed the fairest scenes of his
<lb/>creation. But when we approach the altar of Peace, with
<lb/>our arms streaming with blood, and our hearts swelling with
<lb/>meditations of still more complete and bloody vengeance,
<lb/>we are only displaying to the world a disgusting alliance
<lb/>of the fiercest barbarity with the most abject superstition.
<lb/>Let us, therefore, clearly apprehend the nature, and the
<lb/>object of the duties, which have been enjoined us, by the
<lb/>public authority of the nation. But let me conjure you to
<lb/>lay aside that ferocious and unrelenting malice, which is
<lb/>more calculated for the synagogues of Satan, than the
<lb/>temples of the Almighty. This is a day of repentance!
<lb/>If we have committed any sins as a nation, we are called
<lb/>upon to confess them with sincere and unfeigned penitence;
<lb/>and if we have suffered any calamities, it is our duty to
<lb/>deplore them with emotions of earnest piety, and with
<lb/>humble hopes of divine forgiveness. A verbal acknow­
<lb/>ledgement of our errors, however, and an idle and whining
<lb/>lamentation over our misfortunes, is as inconsistent with our
<lb/>duty, as it is unworthy of our dignity. We must resolve

<pb n="4"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">4</mw>
<lb/>to turn from our evil conduct; and we must listen to a
<lb/>lesson of instruction, under the pressure of affliction. Un­
<lb/>less we do this, the confession of our crimes will resemble

      <p rend="first-indent(1)">We are, my brethren, a great nation, if we are considered
<lb/>with regard to our power, our resources, our connections,
<lb/>and dependencies. Whatever, therefore, may be the part
<lb/>which we act in the great drama of the world, it is not at
<lb/>least an unimportant, or trifling part. If we have con­
<lb/>ducted our affairs with imprudence, or temerity; if our
<lb/>measures have been dictated by passion, instead of being
<lb/>conceived in wisdom, the effects of our misconduct must be
<lb/>very extensively and severely felt. We have had it in
<lb/>our power, by moderate and enlightened, or by violent and
<lb/>precipitate counsels, to add to, or to diminish considerably,
<lb/>the general bulk of human happiness. If, instead of availing
<lb/>ourselves of our natural strength, and our acquired greatness,
<lb/>that qualified us to sit as the judge and arbiter of sur­
<lb/>rounding nations, we have communicated to them a passion
<lb/>for war, and an ambition of conquest, our sin is grievous
<lb/>in proportion to our means of avoiding it. If the mea­
<lb/>sures, which have been fruitful of so much destruction and
<lb/>slaughter, might have been averted by a temperate and con­

<lb/>ciliatory spirit, we are awfully responsible to Providence
<lb/>for the neglect, or abuse of the trusts communicated to us.
<lb/>If, in our conduct of war, we have been guilty of unne­
<lb/>cessary acts of perfidy; and if, while our own island is re­
<lb/>sounding with exclamations against anarchy and sedition,
<lb/>we ourselves have been industrious in seducing the subjects
<lb/>of another government from their allegiance, we stand con­
<lb/>victed before God, of hypocrisy, as well as treachery. If,
<lb/>at home likewise, we have been guilty of intolerance and
<lb/>oppression, and if we have punished, with the same un­
<lb/>discerning severity, the exertions of mistaken zeal with the
<lb/>most base and ignominious crimes, we have abundant rea­
<lb/>son for national penitence. These are some of those of­
<lb/>fences, of which, as they stand the foremost in the cata­
<lb/>logue, it behoves us seriously and earnestly to repent.
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">But if this be the guilt of the nation, it is the guilt of
<lb/>the people. Every one, according to the true and legi­
<lb/>timate maxims of civil government, has an immediate or
<lb/>remote participation in the counsels of the legislature. The
<lb/>right of exercising a judgment on public measures, exists
<lb/>independently of the sanctions of human institutions. We
<lb/>may sell our vote, and throw away our integrity at elections:
<lb/>but no man can barter away the moral capacities of his
<lb/>nature; and no man can suppress the faculties, which dis­
<lb/>criminate between right and wrong. Government itself can­
<lb/>not lawfully exist without some expression of popular con­

<pb n="6"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">6</mw>
<lb/>sent, as its foundation. This, my brethren, is a maxim,
<lb/>which cannot be superseded; it forms a part of the charter
<lb/>which God himself has given to man. The decisions of a
<lb/>Scotch judge, or the decrees of a British minister, can neither
<lb/>annul, nor suspend its sacred authority. Every individual,
<lb/>therefore, among you, if he be not in love with servitude,
<lb/>even the meanest individual, may decide on the propriety
<lb/>and expedience of all public measures: since, as a part
<lb/>of a nation, he participates in the benefits, or evils which
<lb/>may result from them. He may abandon, for a while, the
<lb/>ordinary sphere of his actions; he may quit the anvil, or
<lb/>the loom, and search keenly and narrowly for the sources
<lb/>of every public mischief, or misfortune. A nation is not
<lb/>governed by a system of laws alone; for the wisest rules
<lb/>of legislature may consist with the grossest usurpation. The
<lb/>energy of laws is instrumental, and secondary only; and
<lb/>they derive their sanction and authority from the will of
<lb/>the people. I have reverted to the origin of civil govern­
<lb/>ment, that it might clearly appear to you, that every one
<lb/>of you is involved in the guilt of public and national of­
<lb/>fences. We have, therefore, on this occasion, a privilege
<lb/>of greater importance, than that of making a ceremonial
<lb/>confession of our sins, or of joining in a peculiar form of
<lb/>public worship. Each of us may exercise a kind of ma­
<lb/>gisterial authority, and erect his own judgment into a tri­
<lb/>bunal for the cognizance of political affairs.

<lb/>required a nice and accurate scrutiny, the situation of our af­

<lb/>and solemn appeal to our attention. In the course of one
<lb/>year, events have taken place, which must have roused into
<lb/>reflection the dullest mind, and baffled the keenest skill of
<lb/>political conjecture. War, indeed, to him who has not
<lb/>shut his eyes to the uniform tenor of history, neither ex­

<lb/>the picture which it presents to us at this moment, if we
<lb/>calculated all its immediate, or remote evils, is even more
<lb/>disgusting and melancholy, than the contests, fierce and
<lb/>sanguinary as they were, which in former ages have deso­
<lb/>lated the world. The common intelligence of the day has
<lb/>frequently displayed as diversified an image of destruction,
<lb/>as that which is to be found in the fields of Cannæ, or
<lb/>the deserts of Zama. The ordinary details of carnage,
<lb/>which, as they are familiarized to our minds, are heard of
<lb/>with indifference, are replete with relations of distress,
<lb/>and sufferings as various as the accidents and chances of
<lb/>battle. Or if the descriptions of this melancholy scene are
<lb/>not so minute, or ample, a short arithmetical computation
<lb/>informs us of the numbers, who have perished <emph>with so
<lb/>much glory;</emph> of those who, <quote>though in the catalogue they

<lb/>always characteristic of war, whenever it has taken place,
<lb/>and under what circumstances soever it has been under­
<lb/>taken, there are other consequences which distinguish all
<lb/>the contests of modern times from those of remoter pe­
<lb/>riods of society. The states of antiquity experienced only
<lb/>half of the evils of war; when all its calamities consisted
<lb/>in the destruction and bloodshed, which the contending
<lb/>armies let loose upon each other. In the present age,
<lb/>when nations cannot arrive at prosperity, nor even obtain
<lb/>subsistence, but by commercial intercourse, it cannot surely
<lb/>be contemplated, but in a shape of much greater and more
<lb/>aggravated horror.
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">It is impossible, my brethren, that similar reflections
<lb/>should not have frequently suggested themselves to your
<lb/>minds, in almost every period of the present war. It
<lb/>is impossible, that you should have been ignorant of those
<lb/>multiplied spectacles of distress, which every manufacturing
<lb/>town exhibits. It is impossible, not to trace these evils to
<lb/>their true and productive source: and if they have been
<lb/>incurred rashly, or precipitately, with too little regard for
<lb/>public happiness, and too much regard to the voice of pas­
<lb/>sion, they must be acknowledged to constitute a very ne­
<lb/>cessary and ample theme of national repentance. They
<lb/>are not susceptible of any exaggerations, were I inclined,
<lb/>or were I able to heighten them, with the colours of
<lb/>pathetic discourse. You must have observed the universal

<lb/>gloom, which pervades our whole kingdom; you must have
<lb/>observed how much the face of society is clouded, amidst
<lb/>a sullen and melancholy cessation from almost every active
<lb/>employment and cheerful exertion. And, do you imagine,
<lb/>that the starving artizan and impoverished manufacturer are
<lb/>much indebted to those, who have contributed to seduce
<lb/>us into a measure, which has been hitherto so unprofitable
<lb/>and destructive; and which, from its nature and principle,
<lb/>cannot inspire us with any rational and well-grounded hopes
<lb/>of its success? Is any consolation held out to them in
<lb/>the pompous, and perhaps fallacious annunciations of success,
<lb/>which are uttered with so much eagerness and exultation;
<lb/>when the same wind, that wafts into our harbours the detail
<lb/>of our victories, may convey to them the intelligence of
<lb/>bankrupt debtors, and intercepted cargoes?
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">Since, however, we have undertaken the enterprize against
<lb/>France, it is our duty, that we may be able to ascertain
<lb/>whether it be a theme of rejoicing, or an object of re­
<lb/>pentance, to examine the principles on which it has been
<lb/>conducted. In such an enquiry, a knowledge of the cha­
<lb/>racters and dispositions of those, into whose alliance we
<lb/>have entered, will be very necessary and useful. If their
<lb/>dispositions are to be estimated, or their purposes calculated
<lb/>by the zeal which they have displayed in the cause of human
<lb/>happiness, I cannot say that the examination would termi­

<lb/>in which our allies have borne a very strenuous and active
<lb/>part; but it is a transaction, with whose memory the abhor­
<lb/>rence of mankind will be coeval, while history shall be read,
<lb/>and oppression hated. It need not be observed, that I al­
<lb/>lude to the interference in the Polish government. With
<lb/>these ferocious tyrants, the love of liberty is a crime of
<lb/>the blackest enormity; and the reformation of those gloomy
<lb/>and gothic systems of usurpation, which mankind have dig­
<lb/>nified with the name of Government, is a most dangerous
<lb/>and alarming species of treason. Perhaps, at some future
<lb/>and happier period of our affairs, when more indulgence will
<lb/>be shewn to the boldness of truth, it may be said, that it
<lb/>was more becoming the dignity, as well as the interests of
<lb/>England, had she interfered in the behalf of that unhappy
<lb/>people, instead of engaging in an impotent and unfortunate

 against France. It may then be said, that re­

<lb/>injustice and oppression. It may then be said, that she
<lb/>would eventually have consulted her own safety, as well
<lb/>as her glory, had she interposed as a seasonable check to
<lb/>so dangerous and destructive a spirit of aggrandizement.
<lb/>When we consider who were the actors in the scene, we
<lb/>need not be told, that faith solemnly pledged was violated,
<lb/>and treaties of the most sacred obligation disregarded.
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">I have deviated somewhat from the reflections, which
<lb/>more peculiarly belong to the duties of this occasion; but
<lb/>some allusion to this disgraceful event was necessary to let
<lb/>in a proper light on the system of policy pursued by our
<lb/>allies; and in whose guilt, as far as we are subservient to
<lb/>its purposes, we ourselves are partakers. If, indeed, we
<lb/>estimated their concern for the happiness of the human race,
<lb/>by the general tenor of the manifestoes,<anchor xml:id="a02" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n02"/>
 which they have
<lb/>assiduously published, we might think that they were ac­
<lb/>tuated by the purest motives of reverence towards God, and

<lb/>clarations, be inclined to suppose that their's was a confe­
<lb/>deracy against tyranny, disorder, and irreligion; and that
<lb/>instead of contending against a free, they were anxious
<lb/>only to liberate an enslaved nation. But, were we to follow
<lb/>these heroic knights, who have sallied forth against atheism
<lb/>and oppression, to their own territories, we should not sus­
<lb/>pect them of too violent an attachment to liberty, in its
<lb/>theory, or in its enjoyment. We should neither see a
<lb/>prosperous and thriving people, nor an equal and liberal
<lb/>system of laws. A ruined and degraded peasantry, a people
<lb/>without any principle of virtuous pride, or any sense of
<lb/>their own dignity, form the completest description of their
<lb/>maxims of government. The king of Prussia, and the other
<lb/>rulers of Germany may be the leaders of <emph>armies</emph>, but they
<lb/>can scarcely be said to be the governors of <emph>men:</emph> for the
<lb/>discipline, which converts their subjects into soldiers, seems
<lb/>to have depressed the faculties, in which man's pre-eminence
<lb/>over other animals chiefly consists. All freedom of en­
<lb/>quiry, which has a tendency to improve the political con­
<lb/>dition of mankind, is strictly inhibited. A laborious com­
<lb/>mentator may compose a dissertation on a particle, and ana­
<lb/>lyze the beauty of a preposition. But in Germany, it
<lb/>need not be said that neither a Locke nor a Milton were
<lb/>ever permitted to discuss the principles, and display their
<lb/>enlightened schemes of civil government.

<lb/>sideration. It is, I acknowledge, very difficult to con­
<lb/>jecture upon the events of political contests. But there is
<lb/>much more cause of alarm, in the ambition of these united
<lb/>powers, than in the spirit of proselytism imputed to the
<lb/>French. Singly, they were sufficiently powerful; but in
<lb/>their coalition, they present to our minds an image of gi­
<lb/>gantic and bloated strength, which seems to require a strong
<lb/>and effectual barrier. We have as much reason to be
<lb/>alarmed at their mode of fraternization, as that of the na­
<lb/>tion with whom we are at war: for they conquer, not
<lb/>to liberate, but to enslave. Their march is not ushered
<lb/>in with songs in praise of liberty, with the festive dance,
<lb/>or the shouts of an applauding people. Destruction and
<lb/>slavery are in their train, and should they be victorious,
<lb/>Europe would begin a new æra of darkness and barbarity.
<lb/>These are events which ought to have entered into our cal­
<lb/>culations, if we acted wisely and providently, and even
<lb/>now we ought not to be entirely free from alarm, though
<lb/>perhaps the danger is more remote, or more doubtful.
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">Have we, then, acted with the prudence that became
<lb/>us, in uniting with characters, whose purity is so ques­

<lb/>tended treaties. Those pretences are now no more, and
<lb/>the opportunity of profiting by them, is past. To a
<lb/>people, earnestly desirous of peace, and deeply impressed
<lb/>with a sense of its benefits, if they had afforded grounds of
<lb/>negotiation, they would not have afforded occasion for
<lb/>arms. If, from the very beginning, we were determined
<lb/>to prevent our neighbours from erecting the system of their
<lb/>own government, if we were resolved to rebuild the
<lb/>Bastille, and to reanimate the lifeless trunk of exhausted
<lb/>despotism, it is the most exquisite hypocrisy, to resort
<lb/>to these stale and forgotten pretences. Every twig and
<lb/>every reed, however, we are willing to seize. We are now
<lb/>sedulously pleading our indignation at their crimes, and dis­
<lb/>playing our sorrow for their excesses. We have made our­
<lb/>selves the instruments of divine justice, and we say that we
<lb/>are fighting, to punish the French for their wickedness. But
<lb/>whence have we derived this new maxim of hostility? Oh,
<lb/>most enlightened discovery! How have we improved the
<lb/>law of nations! Had this beautiful maxim been made
<lb/>known before, how often would the very pillars of the
<lb/>earth have been shaken by the trampling of crusaders against
<lb/>vice and wickedness! Long ago should we have carried
<lb/>our arms into Spain, to punish her priesthood for the vic­
<lb/>tims devoted to their inquisition. We should have car­

<lb/>cruelty and oppression, we ourselves ought at least to be
<lb/>free from all those imputations, which we have so pro­
<lb/>fusely scattered on our enemies. And are there no com­
<lb/>plaints preferred to heaven against us? Has the African,
<lb/>who is made the object of commercial calculations and
<lb/>bargains, ever had any reason to invoke blessings upon our
<lb/>heads, while he feels the maddening sense of violated right,
<lb/>and protracted cruelty? Have our eastern armies never in­
<lb/>vaded the territories of an unoffending people, and broken
<lb/>down the barriers, which nature herself seems to have erected
<lb/>as limits to our ambition, and as lessons to our avarice? We
<lb/>cannot, indeed, hear the execrations, which we may have

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">17</mw>
<lb/>of our rapacity and oppression. The coast of Guinea, or
<lb/>the natives of India, do not represent their wrongs by am­
<lb/>bassadors. But we may read them in the very nature of
<lb/>man, and in those feelings, which teach him to revolt at
<lb/>tyranny and usurpation, in every climate and quarter of
<lb/>the globe.
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">Such reflections as these, my brethren, were they allowed
<lb/>to have the weight, which they deserve, would perhaps ef­
<lb/>fectually cure us of that spirit of intolerance, and of that
<lb/>want of forbearance, which we have lately discovered.
<lb/>Upon an occasion of this kind, it cannot but be very ser­
<lb/>viceable, to meditate upon all these topics with seriousness
<lb/>and concern. We have, unquestionably, the privilege of
<lb/>exercising the severest judgements on the crimes of other
<lb/>nations. It is good, it is salutary thus to do. But the
<lb/>attempt of rooting out vice by violence has ever been un­
<lb/>succesful, even when exerted upon an individual. There
<lb/>are certain passions, which take the deepest root, when the
<lb/>strongest efforts are used to prevent and check their growth.
<lb/>Besides, we ought not to decide in the tone of an harsh and
<lb/>rigorous morality upon excesses, which, there is every reason
<lb/>to conclude, have arisen rather from peculiar circumstances,
<lb/>than general principles. Let us recollect, that a state of
<lb/>anarchy (for that is a crime, of which the French have been
<lb/>copiously accused) is a temporary evil only; and that, as
<lb/>it seems almost necessary to follow the first acquisition of

<lb/>so valuable a gift, as liberty, it ought not to fall within the
<lb/>jurisdiction of too strict and stern a rule of justice. It is
<lb/>almost natural, that when the ordinary modes of admini­
<lb/>strating affairs are suspended, or superseded, a licentiousness
<lb/>of some sort or other should precede the new establishment
<lb/>of things. When we reflect likewise, that they were so
<lb/>long oppressed by excessive burdens and tyrannical imposts,
<lb/>that they were under the galling yoke of subordination to
<lb/>so many proud and insolent orders of men, we cannot be
<lb/>surprized that the first effort of popular strength should have
<lb/>been proportioned to the degree of its restraint and op­
<lb/>pression. Retaliation is the privilege of misery; and in
<lb/>the first moments of their liberty, men are too apt to exer­
<lb/>cise it with little moderation, or prudence; to be flushed
<lb/>with the restitution of their rights, and to feel the natural
<lb/>insolence, which victory is so apt to generate in the mind of
<lb/>man. We cannot be surprized, that in such a state as
<lb/>this, the tardy operations of law should give way to the
<lb/>hasty decisions of resentment. In the midst of universal
<lb/>turbulence and confusion, private wrongs are not forgotten,
<lb/>and all who have been obnoxious for their tyranny, and
<lb/>even for their wealth or power, feel the undistinguishing
<lb/>stroke of popular vengeance.
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">But dreadful as such a state of things is, it cannot be

<lb/>ther, but by means of those securities which regular go­

<lb/>found in the first moments of newly-acquired liberty, lest
<lb/>we be suspected of too warm an attachment to despotism:
<lb/>for anarchy must necessarily be short-lived; but it is from

<lb/>we have displayed, by this perverse and inconsistent con­
<lb/>duct, our zeal for the blessings of peaceful and regular go­

<lb/>been productive of the most destructive consequences, by
<lb/>our attempts to excite insurrections against the public autho­

      <p rend="first-indent(1)">We have now, my brethren, an opportunity to enquire
<lb/>into the probability of ultimate success in the enterprize,
<lb/>which we have undertaken. It is now time to reckon on the
<lb/>advantages of our commercial treaty with the prince of
<lb/>Hesse and Sardinia; to examine, whether the price which
<lb/>we have paid for human blood, with so much mercantile
<lb/>accuracy and precision, is likely to fulfil the expectations of
<lb/>profit, with which we entered into <emph>so honourable an agree­
<lb/>ment.</emph> Perhaps, at this time, we may be able to make the
<lb/>enquiry, with our judgements more improved, and our pas­
<lb/>sions more subdued, than when we began the contest:
<lb/>for we cannot be proud in the midst of disgrace, we cannot,
<lb/>surrounded by loss and defeat, feel the arrogance of victory.
<lb/>We ought indeed to have reasoned on the improbability of

<lb/>advantage, before we were instructed by calamity. Had we
<lb/>listened to the voice of history and experience, we should
<lb/>have reckoned France in the number of those nations, who,
<lb/>in defence of their liberties, have gathered courage from en­
<lb/>thusiasm, and strength from despair; for the efforts, which her
<lb/>enemies have made to dissolve her government, have afforded
<lb/>her a principle of union; and she has imbibed so much of a
<lb/>sense of freedom, that the very memories of her citizens
<lb/>must be obliterated, before her former tyranny can be
<lb/>restored.
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">A revolution so complete, both with regard to her mode
<lb/>of government, and to the public sentiments which uphold
<lb/>it, is unprecedented in the long story of the world. She
<lb/>has not only abolished monarchy, but she has diffused a
<lb/>kind of oblivion over the mind, that the image of it can
<lb/>scarcely be found in the thoughts of her people. Her armies
<lb/>have exhibited a species of zeal, and even a spirit of mar­
<lb/>tyrdom in their cause, which seems almost to present us with
<lb/>a picture of human nature, that is totally new and extraor­
<lb/>dinary. She has done all this, while powerful and dis­
<lb/>ciplined forces were ravaging her frontiers, and while the
<lb/>fiercest discontents and factions were dividing her at home.
<lb/>She has poured on astonished foes, an army composed of
<lb/>all ages and sexes; and the atchievements of their promis­
<lb/>cuous multitudes have far surpassed the most renowned ex­
<lb/>ploits of skilful and disciplined troops.

      <p rend="first-indent(1)">Such, my brethren, always have been, and such always

<lb/>We cannot expect to overturn a government, which is ce­

<lb/>wash out of the minds of the French the knowledge of their
<lb/>rights, and the love of their liberty: for were our arms,

      <p rend="first-indent(1)">We have profited very little of the lights of reason and
<lb/>philosophy, which have hitherto beamed upon us, if we
<lb/>wish to check their future progress, or if we regret that
<lb/>their advancement has been too rapid. One of the most dis­
<lb/>tinguishing characteristics of man's nature, is its gradual
<lb/>improvement, and its unlimited march towards moral and in­
<lb/>tellectual perfection. A free and unrestricted intercourse
<lb/>of opinions, and the silent dissemination of truth, are the
<lb/>safest modes of effecting any melioration in the condition of
<lb/>mankind; and the attempt is dangerous to impede the ope­
<lb/>ration of causes which are preparing us for the final desti­
<lb/>nation of our existence, with so much stillness and tran­
<lb/>quility. If we did not perversely interfere, by endeavouring
<lb/>to interpose the barrier of unjust authority to the acquisition
<lb/>of truth, all revolutions that have taken place might have
<lb/>been accomplished without violence or anarchy.
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">The advantages, which the present age enjoys, have been
<lb/>derived from the liberal and fearless spirit of discussion,
<lb/>which has distinguished it from all others. It has put to
<lb/>flight a train of political and religious superstitions; it has
<lb/>taught mankind to ascertain the nature of their social rights,
<lb/>and, by purging religion of its mysteries and absurdities, it
<lb/>has divested it of its terrors, and displayed only its conso­
<lb/>lations. It is not possible for knowledge to be long sta­
<lb/>tionary, or the human faculties to be in a perpetual state of

<milestone unit="sig" n="F3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">37</mw>
<lb/>depression and inactivity. The energies of reason may be
<lb/>frightened into silence for a while, and the intellectual
<lb/>powers may be constrained into dulness: but, in pro­
<lb/>portion to the length of their depression, and the seve­
<lb/>rity of their restraint, they will be communicated in a
<lb/>gentle diffusion, or poured out in a violent eruption. It is
<lb/>impossible, however, to prevent its propagation and growth.
<lb/>The effort to stop the motion of our globe itself, is equally
<lb/>as absurd and impotent, as an attempt to impede the endless
<lb/>revolutions of that little world, the mind of man.
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">Let us, therefore, endeavour to hasten the intellectual
<lb/>progress of man, as far as we are able, by leaving to every
<lb/>one the undisturbed right of private judgement. Let us
<lb/>watch, with an anxious and trembling jealousy, the conduct
<lb/>of those, who administer our affairs, and to whom we
<lb/>have delegated the important functions of government. That
<lb/>we may be able, likewise, to decide with propriety, and
<lb/>to think with accuracy upon all political questions, let us
<lb/>confer together upon these subjects, and communicate to
<lb/>each other the fruits of our several enquiries. Let us not
<lb/>imagine that political knowledge is beyond the sphere of our
<lb/>duties, or the reach of our understandings; for happily those
<lb/>maxims, which have the most important reference to civil
<lb/>action, are the least recondite and abstruse; and the most
<lb/>useful principles are those which are the most fitted for
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">common</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">38</mw>
<lb/>common reception and communication. They may indeed
<lb/>have been perverted, or obscured by those pernicious so­
<lb/>phistries, which have been devised to bewilder and perplex
<lb/>the common sense of mankind; and they may have been
<lb/>removed from vulgar apprehension and enquiry, by a veil
<lb/>of mysterious and artful policy: but a very little judge­
<lb/>ment and diligence will be sufficient to clear away that mass
<lb/>of misconstructions and perversions, by which they may have
<lb/>been overwhelmed.
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">For instance, when we are told (and it does not need an
<lb/>elaborate train of reasoning to tell us) that the origin of all
<lb/>government is the will of the people, and that its object is
<lb/>the general good, we shall perceive the necessity of a pure
<lb/>and uncorrupt legislature. We shall then look with indig­
<lb/>nation at the shameless prostitution of the public revenue,
<lb/>as the reward of apostacy, and the bribe of dishonest ser­
<lb/>vices. We shall then enter into the business of reform,
<lb/>by demanding the separation of corruption from the com­
<lb/>monwealth, and by demanding from those, who have been
<lb/>seduced into so unnatural an alliance, a restitution of the
<lb/>gifts and the emoluments, which are now the pledges of
<lb/>their connexion, and the monuments of their shame.
</p>
      <p rend="first-indent(1)">If we do this with zeal and earnestness, we shall exhibit
<lb/>on our days of fastings, and other occasions, a truly penitent

<lb/>people. Until we do this, we may be religious, but we
<lb/>cannot be virtuous; and were we to roll ourselves in the
<lb/>dust, and clothe ourselves with sackcloth and ashes, without
<lb/>serious and vigorous resolution of amendment, we should
<lb/>only deserve the contempt of man for our superstition, and
<lb/>the vengeance of heaven for our hypocrisy.
