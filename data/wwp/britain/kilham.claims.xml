        <p>Since this appeal was put to press, <orgName>the Committee of the
	    <lb/>Wesleyan Missionary Society</orgName> have received the mournful in­
	  <lb/>telligence, that their much esteemed and valued Missionary,
	  <lb/><persName>Richard Marshall</persName>, who had laboured with such encouraging
	  <lb/>success in this station, during most of the last two years, died of
	  <lb/>fever after a sickness of five days, during the present rainy
	  <lb/>season. His estimable widow, with her infant child, arrived in
	  <lb/><placeName>Bristol</placeName> on the <date when="--01-10">1st of 10th month</date>: they also had been sick of
	  <lb/>fever, and ordered by their medical attendant to return to <placeName>Eng­
	    <lb/>land</placeName>, as the only hope, humanly speaking, of their lives being
	  <lb/>preserved. <persName>A.M.</persName> appeared, on her arrival, much restored, and
	  <lb/>gave a very satisfactory account of the state of the mission in the
	  <lb/><placeName>Gambia</placeName>. Her friends, who knew and justly loved her, have
	  <lb/>since received the very unexpected and affecting intelligence,
	  <lb/>that two days after her arrival she was suddenly called away
	  <lb/>from this state of mortality.</p>

	    <lb/>sion, when rescued from the slave-ships, presents
	    <lb/>a very peculiar and a very powerful claim to our
	    <lb/>interest and regard; and the enquiry ought to be
	    <lb/>fairly met as to what really is its present state,
	    <lb/>and what the impediments to its more rapid ad­
	    <lb/>vancement.</p>
          <p>If from feelings of individual compassion a
	    <lb/>Christian philanthropist had rescued from the
	    <lb/>hold of a slave-ship one helpless child, and
	    <lb/>placed it under care for shelter and instruction,
	    <lb/>would he not feel so much interest for his rescued
	    <lb/>charge, as fully to inform himself from time to time
	    <lb/>how the child was cared for and instructed?—
	    <lb/>whether its physical wants as to food, shelter,
	    <lb/>and medical care were suitably provided for, and
	    <lb/>its mind receiving the advantages of appropriate
	    <lb/>instruction and judicious Christian care?</p>
          <p>But have the advocates of the African cause
	    <lb/>as yet obtained all the information of the state of
	    <lb/>the liberated slaves, the children, and the people,
	    <lb/>when landed in <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, which their depen­
	    <lb/>dent position in society has called for?—the chil­
	    <lb/>dren especially, who from their greater helpless­
	    <lb/>ness do assuredly claim much of a parent's care
	    <lb/>from the friends of <placeName>Africa</placeName> in this country? And
	    <lb/>is it not much to be desired, that regular reports
	    <lb/>should be furnished as to the manner in which
	    <lb/>these children are disposed of on arrival in the
	    <lb/>colony, and how they are subsequently provided

	    <lb/>and cared for; how lodged, and fed, and taught?
	    <lb/>Whether means are provided for maintaining their
	    <lb/>health, or restoring them when sick, and for pro­
	    <lb/>moting their effectual instruction and improve­
	    <lb/>ment? Although much has been done for the
	    <lb/>colony of <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName> by the friendly care and
	    <lb/>liberal aid of Government, and many lives have
	    <lb/>been sacrificed in exhausting labour, by devoted
	    <lb/>agents of <orgName>the Missionary Societies</orgName>, the colony is
	    <lb/>yet, it must be allowed, but in a state of infancy,
	    <lb/>both as respects its civil and religious advance­
	    <lb/>ment: at the same time, the limited state of the
	    <lb/>population as to numbers, is such as loudly to call
	    <lb/>for enquiry into the cause, when it is considered
	    <lb/>how many have been brought in, from year to
	    <lb/>year, from the captured slave-vessels.</p>
          <p>With regard to many of the apprenticed chil­
	    <lb/>dren, there is very great reason for anxious fear
	    <lb/>as to what becomes of them; little or no notice
	    <lb/>being taken of them officially after they have
	    <lb/>been put out. It is well known, that many of
	    <lb/>the poor natives who take them as apprentices,
	    <lb/>imagine that the money which they pay for the
	    <lb/>indenture, constitutes a kind of purchase of the
	    <lb/>child, and that they are then at liberty to do with
	    <lb/>him or her whatever they please. There is
	    <lb/>ground to fear that not a few are by some means
	    <lb/>taken away from the colony, and again made vic­
	    <lb/>tims of the horrid trade in human beings.</p>

          <p>That there is a great, a distressing mortality
	    <lb/>among the children, is, to those who make a lit­
	    <lb/>tle enquiry in the colony, a painfully conspicuous
	    <lb/>fact; yet the <emph>extent</emph> of that mortality there does
	    <lb/>not appear to exist, in any printed reports, the
	    <lb/>means of ascertaining. We do not learn, either
	    <lb/>with regard to the children placed out as ap­
	    <lb/>prentices, or in the schools, how many have
	    <lb/>lived, and how many have died. Neither are we
	    <lb/>informed how many in the schools <emph>can read</emph>, and
	    <lb/>how many know <name>English</name> so far as to <emph>understand</emph>
	    <lb/>what they read.</p>
          <p>And with regard to education, from what has
	    <lb/>been observed of African capacity, when intel­
	    <lb/>ligible means of instruction are given, it appears
	    <lb/>very evident, that were suitable measures adopted
	    <lb/>to prepare for them the elements of instruction,
	    <lb/>in a clear and simple form, these children would
	    <lb/>be far from being backward, either in applying to
	    <lb/>the acquisition of useful knowledge, or in im­
	    <lb/>bibing what they are taught. But in the system
	    <lb/>hitherto pursued in the schools, of using English
	    <lb/>lessons only, for children, to whom <name>English</name> is
	    <lb/>quite a foreign language, (excepting that they
	    <lb/>have a very few words in occasional and collo­
	    <lb/>quial use,) whilst the native languages, for con­
	    <lb/>versation, are of course in general use among
	    <lb/>themselves, can it be expected that the lessons
	    <lb/>thus learned should prove any more than mere

	    <lb/><emph>sound</emph> to the pupil? What would be the con­
	    <lb/>sequence, if we gave to an English child, at
	    <lb/>home, a Latin book to learn without any English
	    <lb/>translation, and just taught it to spell and read
	    <lb/>the Latin words? Would the child, by practising
	    <lb/>in this way, acquire a knowledge of that lan­
	    <lb/>guage? Assuredly not: and it would be very un­
	    <lb/>just to complain of the want of capacity in the
	    <lb/><name>Africans</name> in <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, as the cause of their
	    <lb/>not having advanced more than they have, when
	    <lb/>that which has been offered to them as a medium
	    <lb/>of school instruction, must have been to them
	    <lb/>quite as unintelligible as a French, or Latin, or
	    <lb/>German book, without translation, would be to
	    <lb/>an English child.</p>
          <p>For more than a century a prepossession was
	    <lb/>indulged in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, for teaching the Eng­
	    <lb/>lish language to Gaelic children, by English
	    <lb/>books alone; and the children were thus taught
	    <lb/>to read the English Scriptures, and to repeat
	    <lb/>English catechisms: and they did this, and, so far
	    <lb/>as sound could satisfy, they appeared to be well
	    <lb/>advanced; but they conversed constantly in the
	    <lb/><name>Gaelic</name>, and were unable to give any account of
	    <lb/>what they had so freely read and repeated in
	    <lb/><name>English</name>.</p>
          <p>Eventually their directors found their mis­
	    <lb/>take, and now the Gaelic children, as well as the
	    <lb/><name>Welch</name> and some of the native <name>Irish</name>, receive

	    <mw rend="align(center)" type="pageNum">6</mw>
	    <lb/>more effectual instruction in <name>English</name> through
	    <lb/>the medium of their own native languages.</p>
          <p>And even with regard to the adult population,
	    <lb/>the public instruction given to the liberated
	    <lb/><name>Africans</name> cannot be expected, under present cir­
	    <lb/>cumstances, to contribute greatly to their im­
	    <lb/>provement, since they are so much strangers to
	    <lb/>the English language, and have not the medium
	    <lb/>of their own languages in use, through which
	    <lb/>they might receive instruction. Let the friends
	    <lb/>of <placeName>Africa</placeName> be only willing to meet this difficulty,
	    <lb/>and provide means for its removal, by opening
	    <lb/>the doors for intelligible communication with the
	    <lb/>people, through the Native languages, and it will
	    <lb/>soon be discovered that <name>Africans</name> have powers to
	    <lb/>cultivate, and dispositions to improve, that would
	    <lb/>well repay the Christian labours of their European
	    <lb/>brethren. And let it be remembered, that as im­
	    <lb/>mortal and responsible beings, and equally with
	    <lb/>ourselves dependent on Redeeming pwer and
	    <lb/>love, they claim our sympathy and our Christian
	    <lb/>care.</p>
          <p>It is not only for the welfare and advancement
	    <lb/>of the <name>Africans</name> in <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, that we are 
	    called
	    <lb/>upon to do what we can for the improvement of
	    <lb/>the people of that colony, and for the attainment
	    <lb/>of an intelligible medium of instruction for them­
	    <lb/>selves and for their children; we have also to
	    <lb/>take into view the prospective, yet deeply inter­

	    <lb/>esting object of preparing, through the various
	    <lb/>languages now spoken in <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, the
	    <lb/>means of Christian instruction to many nations
	    <lb/>of <placeName>Africa</placeName> at a distance from that colony, whose
	    <lb/>minds we cannot hope to reach but through such
	    <lb/>a medium. With an object of so deep interest
	    <lb/>before us, what a field does <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName> pre­
	    <lb/>sent! Surely the cultivation of this field, to as
	    <lb/>great an extent as circumstances are now calling
	    <lb/>for, is a Christian duty that cannot be with­
	    <lb/>held.</p>
          <p>The work of translation into a great number
	    <lb/>of unwritten languages, must indeed be an en­
	    <lb/>gagement of close mental labour and of anxious
	    <lb/>responsibility. It is well known, that one great
	    <lb/>hindrance to the prosecution of such work in
	    <lb/><placeName>Africa</placeName>, is the relaxing effect of the climate on

	    <lb/>that <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, from its peculiar circum­
	    <lb/>stances, in being a centre for the reception of
	    <lb/>people from so many nations, does undoubtedly
	    <lb/>afford scope for much being done there, could
	    <lb/>agents be found prepared for the work, and ca­
	    <lb/>pable of bearing the difficulties of the climate.

	    <lb/>may <emph>carry on</emph> this work, if the means could now
	    <lb/>be found of giving to some of the most intelli­
	    <lb/>gent and well-disposed among them, such edu­
	    <lb/>cation as to prepare them for it, and at the same

	    <lb/>such elementary principles and introductory ar­
	    <lb/>rangements in the concern, as the present cir­
	    <lb/>cumstances of the colony are calling for.</p>
          <p>In order to raise a native agency to assist in
	    <lb/>the important and responsible work of African
	    <lb/>translations, it would be requisite that the best
	    <lb/>opportunities be afforded for the natives intro­
	    <lb/>duced to this work, to gain a knowledge of the
	    <lb/>English language, from whence both elemen­
	    <lb/>tary books and Scripture lessons would have
	    <lb/>to be translated, previously to the more extensive
	    <lb/>engagement of their assisting in the translations
	    <lb/>of the Scriptures at large.</p>
          <p><placeName>England</placeName> would, no doubt, afford the best op­
	    <lb/>portunities for the natives of <placeName>Africa</placeName> to obtain a
	    <lb/>knowledge of our language, and <placeName>England</placeName> would
	    <lb/>also afford the means for a strict revisal and exa­
	    <lb/>mination of translations attempted, were intelli­
	    <lb/>gent natives here to give the required evidence.
	    <lb/>When the awfulness of the work of Scripture
	    <lb/>translation is considered, it must indeed be felt
	    <lb/>that every advantage of examination and revisal
	    <lb/>is greatly to be desired.</p>
          <p>But, alas for poor <placeName>Africa</placeName>! how little has yet been
	    <lb/>done for that wide continent, with its thousands
	    <lb/>of peopled towns and villages: how little is yet
	    <lb/>known there of the great and important work of
	    <lb/>Scripture translations, or of the widely extended

	    <lb/>labours of the <orgName>British and Foreign Bible Society</orgName>,
	    <lb/>the rivers and streams of whose Christian bounty
	    <lb/>have so richly flowed, even far and near, in every
	    <lb/>other quarter of the habitable world. Oh! that
	    <lb/>the powerful appeal of those who sit in <quote>the
	      <lb/>dark places of the earth</quote>, surrounded by <quote>habi­
	      <lb/>tations of cruelty</quote>, might be heard and regarded.
	    <lb/><quote>Are we not the children of one Father?</quote> Why
	    <lb/>then should difficulties deter those whom Divine
	    <lb/>Providence has favoured with many spiritual
	    <lb/>and temporal blessings, from coming forward
	    <lb/>in devotedness of heart in the Redeemer's
	    <lb/>cause, to the help of this benighted and afflicted
	    <lb/>people?</p>
          <p>Were some who feel deeply in this cause to

	    <lb/>portion of property, and thought, and care, much
	    <lb/>might, through the blessing of Divine Goodness,
	    <lb/>be speedily effected. And although an uncer­
	    <lb/>tainty must be incurred, as to whether natives
	    <lb/>engaged as assistants in translation would them­
	    <lb/>selves become sincere <name>Christians</name>, or be negli­
	    <lb/>gent and regardless of the advantages pre­
	    <lb/>sented to them; yet experience has proved, that
	    <lb/>even where native agents themselves lose, by
	    <lb/>their own subsequent misconduct, the privileges
	    <lb/>which they might have enjoyed, the benefit of

	    <lb/>advantage of thus employing the translators is far
	    <lb/>from being lost.</p>
          <p>It is true, indeed, that since <orgName>the Church Mis­
	      <lb/>sionary Society</orgName> have now lately commenced,
	    <lb/>among their own agents, African translations,
	    <lb/>much good may be hoped from this work being
	    <lb/>carried on by them in <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, should the
	    <lb/>lives of the individuals, to whom the work has
	    <lb/>been committed in that colony, be long con­
	    <lb/>tinued. Yet it is well known, that their benevo­
	    <lb/>lent Christian interest in this cause would lead
	    <lb/>them greatly to rejoice in every facility for the
	    <lb/>promotion of the work, and they would hear
	    <lb/>gladly of the adoption of measures for its being
	    <lb/>carried forward extensively, both in <placeName>Africa</placeName> and
	    <lb/>in <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>
          <p>Were a few well-chosen <name>Africans</name> to be
	    <lb/>brought, on their own desire, to this country,
	    <lb/>from some of the principal tribes, so selected
	    <lb/>as to retain their languages by conversing
	    <lb/>with each other, they might, in an Institution
	    <lb/>prepared here for their reception, rapidly ac­
	    <lb/>quire the English language and become va­
	    <lb/>luable assistants in translation; and preserv­
	    <lb/>ing the general forms and structure of their
	    <lb/>own languages, these translations, written from
	    <lb/>their dictation by their English friends appointed
	    <lb/>to the work, would, if well attended to, be found
	    <lb/>clear and intelligible when hear or read in the

	    <lb/>native districts. <name>Europeans</name> engaged in the
	    <lb/>translation, might at the same time acquire suf­
	    <lb/>ficient knowledge of these languages, to check or
	    <lb/>prevent the passing of erroneous translations re­
	    <lb/>specting important truths.</p>
          <p>African agents thus trained and employed,
	    <lb/>might some of them, it is hoped, in a future day,
	    <lb/>whilst in <placeName>England</placeName>, give valuable help in the
	    <lb/>translation of the Scriptures; whilst others, hav­
	    <lb/>ing spent two or three years in this country, and
	    <lb/>given their assistance in translating merely ele­
	    <lb/>mentary lessons, might return, prepared to pur­
	    <lb/>sue with respectability some other engagement
	    <lb/>in the colony from whence they came: yet all
	    <lb/>persons thus received into the Institution, to have
	    <lb/>the opportunity, on returning home, of continued
	    <lb/>communications with their friends here, by occa­
	    <lb/>sional correspondence, so long as their conduct
	    <lb/>should be such as to leave the way open for such
	    <lb/>communication.</p>
          <p>Should encouragement be given for the prose­
	    <lb/>cution of this work, it would, in present circum­
	    <lb/>stances, it is hoped, be easy to obtain a good selec­
	    <lb/>tion of pupils, who would gladly come over for a few
	    <lb/>years to learn our language, and to assist in trans­
	    <lb/>lations in some of the principal languages of <placeName>Africa</placeName>.
	    <lb/>Already has the advantage of such translations
	    <lb/>been experienced in a school on the <placeName>river Gambia</placeName>,
	    <lb/>in which the Jolof elementary and Scripture
	    <lb/>lessons are now used, which a few years ago were

	    <lb/>prepared and printed in <placeName>England</placeName> under the
	    <lb/>sanction of a <orgName>Committee of Friends for promoting
	      <lb/>African Instruction</orgName>. These lessons have not
	    <lb/>only been used in schools for teaching the Jolof
	    <lb/>children both their own language and the Eng­
	    <lb/>lish, but some of the young men have also read
	    <lb/>the Jolof Scripture lessons contained in them to
	    <lb/>their families at home. From that station are

          <p>At the same time, from the villages of libe­
	    <lb/>rated <name>Africans</name> in <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, we hear perpe­
	    <lb/>tually, in the printed statements, the report of
	    <lb/>discouragement and complaint. The people
	    <lb/>understand but little of the instructions offered,
	    <lb/>and the children in the schools are under similar
	    <lb/>disadvantages. Still there is sounded among
	    <lb/>some in that colony, the alarm of a supposed im­
	    <lb/>possibility of giving any other instruction than
	    <lb/>through the English language only; the lan­
	    <lb/>guages of the natives being so many and so
	    <lb/>little known. Allowing, that so far as the resi­
	    <lb/>dence in an English colony is intended, it is in­
	    <lb/>deed desirable that the <name>English</name> should be known
	    <lb/>as a <emph>general</emph> language among the people, and be
	    <lb/>their common medium of communication; still,
	    <lb/>in the attainment even of this object, we shall
	    <lb/>find, that to cultivate, to a certain extent,
	    <lb/>each of the distinctly ascertained native lan­
	    <lb/>guages spoken in the colony, would be the most
	    <lb/>facile and effectual means of teaching the natives
	    <lb/><name>English</name>. But if the English language itself be
	    <lb/><emph>not understood</emph> by the <name>Africans</name>, how can it be
	    <lb/>the <emph>medium</emph> of instruction either in their religious
	    <lb/>assemblies or in their schools? What foreigner,
	    <lb/>either German, French, or African, can teach the
	    <lb/>English but through his own vernacular language,
	    <lb/>unless it be just so much as can be gained by
	    <lb/>signs, as in teaching the deaf and dumb? This

	    <mw rend="align(center)" type="pageNum">14</mw>
	    <lb/>system of teaching only by signs and motions, even
	    <lb/>if desired, could not easily be practised in <placeName>Africa</placeName>,
	    <lb/>where all engagements requiring much thought
	    <lb/>and application are, on account of the relaxing
	    <lb/>influence of the climate, so peculiarly difficult to
	    <lb/><name>Europeans</name>. Let the friends of African education
	    <lb/>then avail themselves, in teaching <name>English</name>, of
	    <lb/>the advantages of the simplest and most effec­
	    <lb/>tual system of instruction, that of <emph>teaching 
	      <lb/>through the medium of something already known
	      <lb/>to the pupil</emph>, and acquiring at least the elements
	    <lb/>of <name>English</name>, through the familiar means of intro­
	    <lb/>ductory lessons in the native languages, with
	    <lb/>the <name>English</name> attached to them.</p>
          <p>In the attempt to reduce a new language to
	    <lb/>writing, it is undoubtedly requisite to use great
	    <lb/>care in every step of a work so responsible, and
	    <lb/>especially in attempting to convey in such lan­
	    <lb/>guage any religious truth: still, by close atten­
	    <lb/>tion and repeated examination of what is pre­
	    <lb/>pared, it is possible to obtain clear and imtelligi­
	    <lb/>ble translations even of Scripture lessons; trans­
	    <lb/>lations which may be clearly understood by the
	    <lb/>natives who read them. From Scripture lessons,
	    <lb/>if thus gained in each principal language, and
	    <lb/>read occasionally among the people by whom
	    <lb/>they were understood, might now we hope that
	    <lb/>even a few words thus conveyed, would avail
	    <lb/>more for their real instruction than ten thou­

	      <lb/>ble, and long at the end: or when required to be
	      <lb/>sounded long in the beginning or middle of a

	      <lb/>show the long sound.</item>

            <item><label>5th</label>. To use the compound vowel sound of <mentioned>ai</mentioned><lb/>for the English sound <mentioned>i</mentioned>, and the letters <mentioned>iu</mentioned> for the
	      <lb/>English sound of <mentioned>u</mentioned>.</item>
            <item><label>6th</label>. When a guttural sound is to be described,
	      <pb n="19"/><milestone n="C2r" unit="sig"/><mw rend="align(center)" type="pageNum">19</mw><lb/>to adopt the letter nearest to it, as <mentioned>h</mentioned> or <mentioned>k</mentioned>, and

	      <lb/>scribe that sound.</item>
          </list>
          <p>This system is so simple in practice, that if
	    <lb/>adhered to, there is but little liability to write in
	    <lb/>a way that would not be easily read.</p>
          <p>A satisfactory degree of correctness may be at­
	    <lb/>tained in translation, if care be only taken clearly
	    <lb/>to ascertain the first steps in the work; as by
	    <lb/>writing down from the voice of a native, the
	    <lb/>names of <emph>visible objects</emph>, as man, boy, &amp;c. which
	    <lb/>are either present in the room, or the pictures of
	    <lb/>them present. Afterwards, <emph>visible actions</emph>; as
	    <lb/>walk, run, and so on: next, <emph>obvious qualities</emph>, 
	    <lb/>added to some of the nouns; as a round table, a
	    <lb/>little bird; and thus to proceed taking down dif­
	    <lb/>ferent classes of words and short sentences, until
	    <lb/>by degrees not only a considerable stock of words
	    <lb/>may be obtained, but a sufficient number of
	    <lb/>sentences from which to ascertain what parts of
	    <lb/>speech are in general use; and, in time, to form
	    <lb/>deductions on the structure of the language.</p>
          <p>It is necessary, in obtaining some of the parts
	    <lb/>of speech, and their variations, to give a sentence
	    <lb/>in several different forms for translation, so as to
	    <lb/>ascertain perhaps an adverb, a preposition, &amp;c.

          <p>The very great responsibility attaching to that

	    <lb/>and counsel as to any points on which there
	    <lb/>might be more than common obscurity, or liability
	    <lb/>to mistake. Such a Committee would, no doubt,

	    <lb/>plishment, or that the means of its pursuance
	    <lb/>may be inadequate and soon fail. There are
	    <lb/>certain simple principles for the prosecution of
	    <lb/>this work, which are allowed and understood by
	    <lb/>not a very few persons, and are regarded as being
	    <lb/>solid and worthy to be acted upon. May the
	    <lb/>important object of endeavouring, should Divine
	    <lb/>Providence permit, to raise up an African agency
	    <lb/>to assist in preparing the means of intelligible
	    <lb/>instruction, in an Institution for translations in
	    <lb/><placeName>England</placeName>—may this important object be freely
	    <lb/>sanctioned by the friends of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and perse­
	    <lb/>veringly pursued, trusting in Him who can at
	    <lb/>His pleasure raise up and preserve agents for
	    <lb/>carrying on His own beneficent designs on the
	    <lb/>earth, and who has again and again evinced that	    
	    <lb/>it is His Divine will to carry on <emph rend="slant(upright)case(allcaps)">His own</emph>
	    <lb/>designs by instrumental agency! May it be ours

          <p>Although fully aware that <name>Friends</name> in encourag­

	    <lb/>has been alluded to, have regarded the concern as
	    <lb/>a part of a common cause, in which, if good
	    <lb/>could be done, their attention was called for, for
	    <lb/>the sake of the cause itself; it would yet be un­
	    <lb/>grateful not to acknowledge the obligation which
	    <lb/>indeed the writer sensibly feels towards <name>Friends</name>

	    <lb/>who have so kindly given every facility for the
	    <lb/>prosecution of this work, not only in taking
	    <lb/>charge, for several years, of the two native
	    <lb/><name>Africans</name> who assisted in the first translation,
	    <lb/>(that of the lessons now used in the <placeName>Gambia</placeName>,)
	    <lb/>but in every subsequent step, providing the re­
	    <lb/>quisite expences for promoting the design, and
	    <lb/>facilitating with the most friendly confidence and
	    <lb/>aid its further prosecution.</p>
          <p>The obligations of the writer to a few endeared
	    <lb/>friends in particular, must ever be combined with
	    <lb/>the remembrance of the earliest, and every sub­
	    <lb/>sequent step which has been taken in this
	    <lb/>deeply interesting cause—a cause which they
	    <lb/>have most kindly and essentially promoted by
	    <lb/>their judgment, by their literary aid and counsel,
	    <lb/>by the unremitting kindnesses of Christian sym­
	    <lb/>pathy and hospitality, and in various other ways
	    <lb/>in which liberal help could be given in the fur­
	    <lb/>therance of an arduous and responsible engage­
	    <lb/>ment—an engagement, the difficulties of which
	    <lb/>are not worthy to be considered, when so much
	    <lb/>lessened by the sympathy and aid of Christian
	    <lb/>kindness, and accompanied as they have been by
	    <lb/>the sustaining belief that the pursuance of this
	    <lb/>cause is in consonance with the will of the Most
	    <lb/>High, and the feeling, that in His will alone we
	    <lb/>find our rest.

	    <lb/>ments, yet its ultimate object, when directed to
	    <lb/>the attainment, for a suffering and benighted
	    <lb/>people, of that divine revelation in the Scriptures
	    <lb/>of Truth, with which we have ourselves been so
	    <lb/>mercifully favoured, the prospect of this attain­
	    <lb/>ment may well give a deep and lasting interest to
	    <lb/>long-continued exertions in such a cause—an
	    <lb/>interest which will live, and grow, and still ex­
	    <lb/>pand, when occupations that need the zest of
	    <lb/>novelty for their support shall cease to excite
	    <lb/>their wonted attraction.</p>
          <p>It should never be forgotten, that Translations
	    <lb/>are as indispensably requisite to the cause of
	    <lb/>Christian education in heathen lands, as Schools
	    <lb/>are necessary to the effectual diffusion of the
	    <lb/>Holy Scriptures. We must be satisfied to com­
	    <lb/>mence with the earliest steps, and should surely
	    <lb/>feel great thankfulness for the favour of being
	    <lb/>permitted to take any step in a cause so precious
	    <lb/>as that of preparing, in the least degree, to open
	    <lb/>the way for our African brethren to a knowledge
	    <lb/>of those sacred records which direct to <quote>Him of
	      <lb/>whom <persName>Moses</persName> and the prophets wrote.</quote></p>
          <p>With an object in view so important and so
	    <lb/>delighful to every feeling of Christian love, it is

            <p>The observations contained in your commu­
	      <lb/>nication on the advantage of preparing elemen­
	      <lb/>tary books in this country, in preference to
	      <lb/><placeName>Africa</placeName>, meet my entire concurrence. The more
	      <lb/>I reflect on the subject the more I see the very
	      <lb/>great importance of studying the native lan­
	      <lb/>guages in every point of view; but especially, as
	      <lb/>you remark, when connected with the great and
	      <lb/><choice><sic>and</sic><corr/></choice> blessed object of advancing the cause of our
	      <lb/>Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Of the dangers to which <name>Africans</name>, especially
	      <lb/>young persons, are exposed when brought to this
	      <lb/>country for instruction, I am fully sensible. I
	      <lb/>trust, however, it may be found, that with pro­
	      <lb/>per attention to situation and management, they
	      <lb/>are not wholly insurmountable.</p>
            <p>With respect to the great difficulty of sus­
	      <lb/>taining the mental exertion necessary in the
	      <lb/>study of languages, while resident in <placeName>Africa</placeName>, I
	      <lb/>can speak in some measure from experience.
	      <lb/>It appears to me next to impossible that the

	      <lb/>work can be carried on with any thing like de­
	      <lb/>sirable speed, by an individual or two exposed to
	      <lb/>the debilitating effects of a tropical climate;
	      <lb/>while, in order to be performed effectively, such
	      <lb/>supervision as you suggest would, I think, be
	      <lb/>necessary. For though the <emph>sounds</emph> must un­
	      <lb/>doubtedly be learned from natives, yet as to the
	      <lb/>manner of <emph>expressing</emph> those sounds, and as to
	      <lb/>the construction of any particular language,
	      <lb/>valuable assistance might probably be derived
	      <lb/>from individuals in this country who are well
	      <lb/>acquainted with language in general. So
	      <lb/>far, therefore, as I have yet considered the
	      <lb/>subject, I conceive that a work of this kind
	      <lb/>would be best carried on conjointly, in <placeName>England</placeName>
	      <lb/>and in <placeName>Africa</placeName> at the same time.</p>
            <p>When I reflect on the great labour required
	      <lb/>to communicate knowledge to <name>Africans</name>, through
	      <lb/>the medium of <name>English</name>, and the degree of uncer­
	      <lb/>tainty which exists as to the precise result of
	      <lb/>that labour, I am forcibly impressed with the 
	      <lb/>very great importance of adopting another plan;
	      <lb/>that is, of endeavouring to open the natural chan­
	      <lb/>nel of communication between them and us, by
	      <lb/>becoming acquainted with their languages, and
	      <lb/>by reducing them to writing. Indeed, I can
	      <lb/>scarcely help wondering that such a plan should
	      <lb/>not have been more decidedly adopted, and more
	      <lb/>vigourously pursued in times past.  Having, how­

	      <lb/>who may give themselves to this work, the ines­
	      <lb/>timable treasure of the Scriptures shall be laid
	      <lb/>open to all the tribes of our African brethren who
