        <p><persName rend="case(smallcaps)" ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Anna Lætitia Barbauld</persName>, a name long dear to the
<lb/>admirers of genius and the lovers of virtue, was born at
<lb/>the village of <placeName>Kibworth Harcourt</placeName>, in <placeName>Leicestershire</placeName>, on
	  <lb/><date when="1743-06-20"><name>June</name> 20th, 1743</date>, the eldest child and only daughter of
<lb/><persName ref="p:jaikin.mti">John Aikin</persName>, <abbr>D. D.</abbr> and
<persName ref="p:jaikin.cld">Jane</persName> his wife, daughter of the
<persName ref="p:jjennings.apk">Rev.
<lb/>John Jennings</persName> of <placeName>Kibworth</placeName>, and descended by her mother
<lb/>from the ancient family of <name>Wingate</name>, of
<placeName>Harlington</placeName> in <placeName>Bed­
<lb/>fordshire.</placeName>
</p>
        <p>That quickness of apprehension by which she was
<lb/>eminently distinguished, manifested itself from her earliest
<lb/>infancy.  Her mother thus writes respecting her in a letter
<lb/>which is still preserved: <quote>I once indeed knew a little girl
<lb/>who was as eager to learn as her instructers could be to
<lb/>teach her, and who, at two years old, could read sentences
<lb/>and little stories in her <emph>wise book</emph>, roundly, without spelling,
<lb/>and in half a year more could read as well as most women;
<lb/>but I never knew such another, and I believe never shall.</quote></p>
        <p>Her education was entirely domestic, and principally
<lb/>conducted by her excellent mother, a lady whose manners
<lb/>were polished by the early introduction to good company
<lb/>which her family connexions had procured her; whilst
<lb/>her mind had been cultivated and her principles formed,
<lb/>partly by the instructions of religious and enlightened
<lb/>parents, partly by the society of the celebrated <persName ref="p:ddoddridg.wpd">Dr. Dod­

dridge</persName>, who was for some years domesticated under her
<lb/>parental roof.
</p>
        <p>In the middle of the last century a strong prejudice still
<lb/>existed against imparting to females any tincture of clas­
<lb/>sical learning; and the father of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Miss Aikin</persName>, proud as he
<lb/>justly was of her uncommon capacity, long refused to grat­
<lb/>ify her earnest desire of being initiated in this kind of
<lb/>knowledge.  At length, however, she in some degree
<lb/>overcame his scruples; and with his assistance she enabled
	  <lb/>herself to read the <name>Latin</name> authors with pleasure and advan­
<lb/>tage; nor did she rest satisfied without gaining some
	  <lb/>acquaintance with the <name>Greek</name>.
</p>
        <p>The obscure village of <placeName>Kibworth</placeName> was unable to afford
<lb/>her a single suitable companion of her own sex: her
<lb/>brother, the late <persName ref="p:daikin.unb">Dr. Aikin</persName>, was more than three years her
<lb/>junior; and as her father was at this period the master of
<lb/>a school for boys, it might have been apprehended that
<lb/>conformity of pursuits, as well as age, would tend too nearly
<lb/>to assimilate her with the youth of the ruder sex by whom
<lb/>she found herself encompassed.  But maternal vigilance
<lb/>effectually obviated this danger, by instilling into her a
<lb/>double portion of bashfulness and maidenly reserve; and
<lb/>she was accustomed to ascribe an uneasy sense of constraint
<lb/>in mixed society, which she could never entirely shake off,
<lb/>to the strictness and seclusion in which it had thus become
<lb/>her fate to be educated.  Her recollections of childhood
<lb/>and early youth were, in fact, not associated with much of the
<lb/>pleasure and gaiety usually attendant upon that period of
<lb/>life: but it must be regarded as a circumstance favourable,
<lb/>rather than otherwise, to the unfolding of her genius, to
<lb/>have been thus left to find, or make in solitude her own
<lb/>objects of interest and pursuit.  The love of rural nature
<lb/>sunk deep into her heart; her vivid fancy exerted itself
<lb/>to colour, to animate, and to diversify all the objects which
<lb/>surrounded her: the few, but choice authors of her father's
<lb/>library, which she read and re-read, had leisure to make
<pb n="xi"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">xi</mw>
<lb/>their full impression,—to mould her sentiments and to form
<lb/>her taste; the spirit of devotion, early inculcated upon her
<lb/>as a duty, opened to her by degrees an exhaustless source
<lb/>of tender and sublime delight; and while yet a child, she
<lb/>was surprised to find herself a poet.
</p>
        <p>Just at the period when longer seclusion might have
<lb/>proved seriously injurious to her spirits, an invitation given
<lb/>to her learned and exemplary father to undertake the office
<lb/>of classical tutor in a highly respectable dissenting academy
<lb/>at <placeName>Warrington</placeName> in <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>, was the fortunate means of
<lb/>transplanting her to a more varied and animating scene.
<lb/>This removal took place in <date when="1758">1758</date>, when
<persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Miss Aikin</persName> had
<lb/>just attained the age of fifteen; and the fifteen succeeding
<lb/>years passed by her at <placeName>Warrington</placeName>, comprehended probably
<lb/>the happiest, as well as the most brilliant portion of her
<lb/>existence.  She was at this time possessed of great beauty,
<lb/>distinct traces of which she retained to the latest period of
<lb/>life. Her person was slender, her complexion exquisitely
<lb/>fair, with the bloom of perfect health; her features were
<lb/>regular and elegant, and her dark blue eyes beamed with
<lb/>the light of wit and fancy.
</p>
        <p>A solitary education had not produced on her its most
<lb/>frequent ill effects, pride and self-importance: the reserve
<lb/>of her manners proceeded solely from bashfulness, for her
<lb/>temper inclined her strongly to friendship and to social
<lb/>pleasures; and her active imagination, which represented
<lb/>all objects tinged with hues <quote>unborrowed of the sun,</quote>
<lb/>served as a charm against that disgust with common char­
<lb/>acters and daily incidents, which so frequently renders the
<lb/>conscious possessor of superior talents at once unamiable
<lb/>and unhappy.  Nor was she now in want of congenial
<lb/>associates.  <orgName>Warrington academy</orgName> included among its tutors,
<lb/>names eminent both in science and in literature: with
<lb/>several of these, and especially with <persName ref="p:jpriestle.nnm">Dr. Priestley</persName> and <persName ref="p:denfield.aob">Dr.
<lb/>Enfield</persName> and their families, she formed sincere and lasting
<lb/>friendships.  The elder and more accomplished among the
<pb n="xii"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">xii</mw>
<lb/>students composed an agreeable part of the same society:
<lb/>and its animation was increased by a mixture of young
<lb/>ladies, either residents in the town or occasional visitors,
<lb/>several of whom were equally distinguished for personal
<lb/>charms, for amiable manners, and cultivated minds.  The
<lb/>rising institution, which flourished for several years in high
<lb/>reputation, diffused a classic air over all connected with it.
<lb/><persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Miss Aikin</persName>, as was natural, took a warm interest in its
<lb/>success; and no academic has ever celebrated his <foreign xml:lang="la">alma
<lb/>mater</foreign> in nobler strains, or with a more filial affection, than
<lb/>she has manifested in that portion of her early and beautiful
<lb/>poem, <title>The Invitation,</title> where her theme is this <quote>nursery of 
<lb/>men for future years.</quote>
</p>
        <p>About the close of the year <date when="1771">1771</date>, her brother, after sev­
<lb/>eral years of absence, returned to establish himself in his
<lb/>profession at <name>Warrington</name>; an event equally welcome to her
<lb/>feelings and propitious to her literary progress.  In him
<lb/>she possessed a friend with discernment to recognise the
<lb/>stamp of genius in her productions and anticipate their
<lb/>fame, combined with zeal and courage sufficient to vanquish
<lb/>her reluctance to appear before the public in the character
<lb/>of an author.  By his persuasion and assistance, her <title>Poems</title>
<lb/>were selected, revised, and arranged for publication: and
<lb/>when all these preparations were completed, finding that
<lb/>she still hesitated and lingered,—like the parent bird who
<lb/>pushes off its young to their first flight, he procured the
<lb/>paper, and set the press to work on his own authority.
<lb/>The result more than justified his confidence of her success:
<lb/>four editions of the work (the first in <choice><abbr>4to</abbr><expan>quarto</expan></choice>, the succeeding
<lb/>ones in <choice><abbr>8vo</abbr><expan>octavo</expan></choice>,) were called for within the year of publication,
<lb/><date when="1773">1773</date>; compliments and congratulations poured in from all
<lb/>quarters; and even the periodical critics greeted her Muse
<lb/>with nearly unmixed applause.
</p>
        <p>She was not permitted to repose upon her laurels: her
<lb/>brother, who possessed all the activity and spirit of literary
<lb/>enterprise in which she was deficient, now urged her to
<pb n="xiii"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">xiii</mw>
<lb/>collect her prose pieces and to join him in forming a small
<lb/>volume, which appeared, also in the year <date when="1773">1773</date>, under the
<lb/>title of <bibl rend="pre(“)post(”)"><title>Miscellaneous
Pieces, in Prose</title>, by <persName ref="p:daikin.unb">J.</persName>
	    and <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">A. L.
<lb/>Aikin</persName>.</bibl>  These likewise met with much notice and ad­
<lb/>miration, and have been several times reprinted.  The
<lb/>authors did not think proper to distinguish their respective
<lb/>contributions, and several of the pieces have in consequence
<lb/>been generally misappropriated.  The fragment of <title><persName>Sir Ber­
<lb/>trand</persName></title> in particular, though alien from the character of
<lb/>that brilliant and airy imagination which was never con­
<lb/>versant with terror, and rarely with pity, has been repeat­
<lb/>edly ascribed to <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName>, even in print.
</p>
        <p>Having thus laid the foundation of a lasting reputation
<lb/>in literature, <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Miss Aikin</persName> might have been expected to pro­
<lb/>ceed with vigour in rearing the superstructure; and the
<lb/>world awaited with impatience the result of her further
<lb/>efforts.  But an event, the most important of her life, was
<lb/>about to subject her to new influence, new duties,—to alter
<lb/>her station, her course of life, and to modify even the bent
<lb/>of her mind.  This event was her marriage which took
	  <lb/>place in <date when="1774-05"><name>May</name>, 1774</date>.
</p>
        <p>The <persName ref="p:rbarbauld.jad">Rev. Rochemont Barbauld</persName>, whom she honoured
<lb/>with her hand, was descended from a family of French
<lb/>protestants.  During the persecutions of <persName ref="p:louisxiv.znn">Louis XIV.</persName>, his
<lb/>grandfather, then a boy, was carried on board a ship, in­
<lb/>closed in a cask, and conveyed to <placeName>England</placeName>.  Here he set­
<lb/>tled and had a son who became a clergyman of the Estab­
<lb/>lishment, and on the marriage of one of the daughters of
<lb/><persName ref="p:georgeii.gba">George II.</persName> to the elector of <placeName>Hesse</placeName>, was appointed her
<lb/>chaplain, and attended her to <placeName>Cassel</placeName>.  At this place his
<lb/>son <persName ref="p:rbarbauld.jad">Rochemont</persName> was born and passed his childhood: on the
<lb/>breaking up of the household of the electress, he spent a
<lb/>year at <placeName>Paris</placeName>, and then accompanied his father to <placeName>England</placeName>,
<lb/>who destined him for the church, but, somewhat unadvis­
<lb/>edly, sent him for previous instruction to the dissenting
<lb/>seminary of <name>Warrington</name>.  The principles which he here

<lb/>imbibed, impelled him to renounce all his expectations from
<lb/>the Establishment; though by such a renunciation, which
<lb/>threw him upon the world without a profession and with­
<lb/>out fortune, he raised obstacles which might well have
<lb/>appeared insuperable, to the completion of that union on
<lb/>which he had long rested his fondest hopes of earthly
<lb/>felicity.  Whilst the prospects of the young couple were
<lb/>still full of uncertainty, some distinguished persons, amongst
<lb/>whom was <persName ref="p:mmontague.cvx">Mrs. Montague</persName>,—at once admirers of the
<lb/>genius of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Miss Aikin</persName> and patrons of a more enlarged
<lb/>system of female education than was then prevalent,—were
<lb/>induced to propose to her to establish under their auspices
<lb/>what might almost have been called a College for young
<lb/>ladies.  On a distant view, the idea had something noble
<lb/>and striking, but it was not calculated to bear a close ex­
<lb/>amination; and it called forth from her the following re­
<lb/>marks, well worthy of preservation, as a monument of her
<lb/>acuteness and good sense, and of the just and comprehen­
<lb/>sive ideas which, at a rather early age, and with slender
<lb/>opportunities of acquainting herself with the great world,
<lb/>she had been enabled to form of the habits and acquirments
<lb/>most important to females, and particularly to those of rank
<lb/>and fashion.  It is also interesting as an instance of the
<lb/>humility with which she estimated her own accomplish­
<lb/>ments.

        <quote rend="bestow((pre(“))(p))">
          <p>A kind of Literary Academy for ladies (for that is
<lb/>what you seem to propose), where they are to be taught
<lb/>in a regular systematic manner the various branches of
<lb/>science, appears to me better calculated to form such
<lb/>characters as the <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Precieuses</foreign> or the 
<foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Femmes sçavantes</foreign>
<lb/>of <persName ref="p:moliere.uso">Moliere</persName>, than good wives or agreeable companions.
<lb/>Young gentlemen, who are to display their knowledge to
<lb/>the world, should have every motive of emulation, should
<lb/>be formed into regular classes, should read and dispute
<lb/>together, should have all the honours and, if one may so
<lb/>say, the pomp of learning set before them, to call up their
<pb n="xv"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">xv</mw>
<lb/>ardour:—it is their business, and they should apply to it as
<lb/>such.  But young ladies, who ought only to have such a
<lb/>general tincture of knowledge as to make them agreeable
<lb/>companions to a man of sense, and to enable them to find 
<lb/>rational entertainment for a solitary hour, should gain
<lb/>these accomplishments in a more quiet and unobserved
<lb/>manner:—subject to a regulation like that of the ancient
	    <lb/><name>Spartans</name>, the thefts of knowledge in our sex are only
<lb/>connived at while carefully concealed, and if displayed,
<lb/>punished with disgrace.  The best way for women to
<lb/>acquire knowledge, is from conversation with a father, a
<lb/>brother or friend, in the way of family intercourse and
<lb/>easy conversation, and by such a course of reading as they
<lb/>may recommend.  If you add to these, an attendance upon
<lb/>those masters which are usually provided in schools, and
<lb/>perhaps such a set of lectures as <persName ref="p:mferguson.fij">Mr. Ferguson's</persName>, which it
<lb/>is not uncommon for ladies to attend, I think a woman will
<lb/>be in a way to acquire all the learning that can be of use
<lb/>to those who are not to teach or engage in any learned
<lb/>profession.  Perhaps you may think, that having myself
<lb/>stepped out of the bounds of female reserve in becoming
<lb/>an author, it is with an ill grace I offer these sentiments:
<lb/>but though this circumstance may destroy the grace, it
<lb/>does not the justice of the remark: and I am full well
<lb/>convinced that to have a too great fondness for books is
<lb/>little favourable to the happiness of a woman, especially
<lb/>one not in affluent circumstances.  My situation has been
<lb/>peculiar, and would be no rule for others.
</p>
          <p>I should likewise object to the age proposed.  Their
<lb/>knowledge ought to be acquired at an earlier period,—
<lb/>geography, those languages it may be proper for them to
<lb/>learn, grammar, &amp;c., are best learned from about nine to
<lb/>thirteen or fourteen, and will then interfere less with other
<lb/>duties.  I should have little hopes of cultivating a love of
<lb/>knowledge in a young lady of fifteen, who came to me
<lb/>ignorant and untaught; and if she <emph>has</emph> laid a foundation,
<pb n="xvi"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">xvi</mw>
<lb/>she will be able to pursue her studies without a master, or
<lb/>with such a one only as <persName ref="p:jrousseau.nea">Rousseau</persName> gives his <persName rend="slant(italic)" ref="p:sophie.ppw">Sophie</persName>.  It is
<lb/>too late then to <emph>begin</emph> to learn.  The empire of the passions
<lb/>is coming on; a new world opens to the youthful eye; those
<lb/>attachments begin to be formed which influence the hap­
<lb/>piness of future life;—the care of a mother, and that alone,
<lb/>can give suitable attention to this important period.  At
<lb/>this period they have many things to learn which books and
<lb/>systems never taught.  The grace and ease of polished
<lb/>society, with the established modes of behaviour to every
<lb/>different class of people; the detail of domestic economy,
<lb/>to which they must be gradually introduced; the duties, the
<lb/>proprieties of behaviour which they must practise in their
<lb/>own family, in the families where they visit, to their friends,
<lb/>to their acquaintance:—lastly their behaviour to the other
<lb/>half of their species, with whom before they were hardly
<lb/>acquainted, and who then begin to court their notice; the
<lb/>choice of proper acquaintance of that sex, the art to con­
<lb/>verse with them with a happy mixture of easy politeness
<lb/>and graceful reserve, and to wear off by degrees something
<lb/>of the girlish bashfulness without injuring virgin delicacy.
<lb/>These are the accomplishments which a young woman has
<lb/>to learn from fourteen or fifteen till she is married, or fit to
<lb/>be so; and surely these are not to be learned in a school.
<lb/>They must be learned partly at home, and partly by visits
<lb/>in genteel families; they cannot be taught where a num­
<lb/>ber are together; they cannot be taught without the
<lb/>most intimate knowledge of a young lady's temper, con­
<lb/>nexions, and views in life; nor without an authority and
<lb/>influence established upon all the former part of her life.
<lb/>For all these reasons, it is my full opinion that the best
<lb/>public education cannot at that period be equally serviceable
<lb/>with—I had almost said—an indifferent private one.
</p>
          <p>My next reason is, that I am not at all qualified for the
<lb/>task.  I have seen a good deal of the manner of educating
<lb/>boys, and known pretty well what is expected in the
<pb n="xvii"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2(5)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">xvii</mw>
<lb/>care of them; but in a girl's boarding-school I should be
<lb/>quite a novice: I never was at one myself, have not even
<lb/>the advantage of younger sisters, which might have given
<lb/>me some notion of the management of girls; indeed, for
<lb/>the early part of my life I conversed little with my own sex.
<lb/>In the village where I was, there were none to converse
<lb/>with; and this I am very sensible, has given me an awk­
<lb/>wardness in many common things, which would make me
<lb/>most peculiarly unfit for the education of my own sex.  But
<lb/>suppose I were tolerably qualified to instruct those of my
<lb/>own rank;—consider, that <emph>these</emph> must be of a class far
<lb/>superior to those I have lived amongst and conversed with.
<lb/>Young ladies of that rank ought to have their education
<lb/>superintended by a woman perfectly well-bred, from whose
<lb/>manner they may catch that ease and gracefulness which
<lb/>can only be learned from the best company; and she should
<lb/>be able to direct them, and judge of their progress in every
<lb/>genteel accomplishment.  I could not judge of their music,
<lb/>their dancing; and if I pretended to correct their air, they
<lb/>might be tempted to smile at my own; for I know myself
<lb/>remarkably deficient in gracefulness of person, in my air
<lb/>and manner, and in the easy graces of conversation.  In­
<lb/>deed, whatever the kind partiality of my friends may think
<lb/>of me, there are few things I know well enough to teach
<lb/>them with any satisfaction, and many I never could learn
<lb/>myself.  These deficiencies would soon be remarked when
<lb/>I was introduced to people of fashion; and were it possible
<lb/>that, notwithstanding, I should meet with encouragement,
<lb/>I could never prosecute with any pleasure an undertaking
<lb/>to which I should know myself so unequal: I am sensible
<lb/>the common boarding-schools are upon a very bad plan, and
<lb/>believe I could project a better, but I could not execute it.

        <p>The arguments thus forcibly urged, appear to have con­
<lb/>vinced all parties concerned, that she was right in declin­

	    <lb/>lessons of <name>English</name> composition superintended by <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Bar­
	      <lb/>bauld</persName>.  On <name>Wednesdays</name> and <name>Saturdays</name> the boys were cal­
<lb/>led in separate classes to her apartment: she read a fable,
<lb/>a short story, or a moral essay, to them aloud, and then
<lb/>sent them back into the school-room to write it out on the
<lb/>slates in their own words.  Each exercise was separately over­
<lb/>looked by her; the faults of grammar were obliterated, the
<lb/>vulgarisms were chastised, the idle epithets were cancelled,
<lb/>and a distinct reason was always assigned for every correc­
<lb/>tion; so that the arts of enditing and of criticizing were in
<lb/>some degree learnt together.  Many a lad from the great
	    <lb/>schools, who excels in <name>Latin</name> and <name>Greek</name>, cannot write prop­
<lb/>erly a vernacular letter, for want of some such discipline.</quote>

<lb/>Barbauld</persName>; and she relieved the dryness of a study seldom
<lb/>rendered interesting to children, by so many lively strokes
<lb/>of description, and such luminous and attractive views of
<lb/>the connexion of this branch of knowledge with the revo­
<lb/>lutions of empires, with national manners, and with the
<lb/>natural history of animals, that these impressive lectures
<lb/>were always remembered by her auditors less among their
<lb/>tasks than their pleasures.
</p>
        <p>A public examination of the boys was always held at the
<lb/>close of the winter session: at the termination of the sum­
<lb/>mer one they performed a play; and upon <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName>
<lb/>principally devolved,—together with the contrivance of
<lb/>dresses and decorations, and the composition of prologues,
<lb/>epilogues, and interludes—the instruction of the young
<lb/>exhibitors in the art of declamation.  In this branch she
<lb/>likewise excelled; and the neglected, though delightful
<lb/>arts of good reading and graceful speaking were nowhere
<lb/>taught with more assiduity and success.
</p>
        <p>In <date when="1775">1775</date> <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> committed to the press a small
	    <lb/>volume entitled, <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Devotional
Pieces compiled from the
<lb/>Psalms of <persName ref="p:david.yei">David</persName>, with Thoughts on the Devotional Taste,
<lb/>and on Sects and Establishments.</title>  As a selection it did
<lb/>not meet with great success; nor did the essay escape
<lb/>without some animadversion.  It was afterwards separated
<lb/>from the <title>Psalms</title> and reprinted with the <title>Miscellaneous
<lb/>Pieces</title>, and will be further noticed in the sequel.
</p>
        <p>The union of <persName ref="p:rbarbauld.jad">Mr.</persName> and <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> proved unfruitful,
<lb/>and they sought to fill the void, of which in the midst of
<lb/>their busy avocations they were still sensible, by the adop­
<lb/>tion of a son out of the family of <persName ref="p:daikin.unb">Dr. Aikin</persName>.  Several par­
<lb/>ticulars relative to this subject will be found in the letters
<lb/>of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> to her brother:—it is sufficient here to
<lb/>mention that they received the child when somewhat under
<lb/>two years of age, and that his education became thence­
<lb/>forth a leading object of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld's</persName> attention.  For
<lb/>the use of her little <persName ref="p:cbarbauld.gfq">Charles</persName> she composed those <title>Early

<milestone unit="sig" n="2(6)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">xx</mw>
Lessons</title> which have justly gained for her the reverence
<lb/>and love of both parents and children; a work which may
<lb/>safely be asserted to have formed an æra in the art of ear­
<lb/>ly instruction, and to stand yet unrivalled amid numberless
<lb/>imitations.
</p>
        <p>The solicitations of parents anxious to obtain for their
<lb/>sons what they regarded as the best tuition, now induced
<lb/>her to receive as her own peculiar pupils, several little boys
<lb/>to whom she condescended to teach the first rudiments of
<lb/>literature.  <persName ref="p:tdenman.zes">Thomas Denman</persName>, Esq., now a distinguished
<lb/>member of the legal profession and of the <orgName>House of Com­
<lb/>mons</orgName>, was committed to her care before he had accomplish­
<lb/>ed his fourth year. <persName ref="p:wgell.wlt">Sir William Gell</persName>, the zealous explorer
<lb/>of the plain of <placeName>Troy</placeName>, was another of her almost infant
<lb/>scholars; and it was for the benefit of this younger class
<lb/>that her <title>Hymns in Prose for Children</title> were written, in
<lb/>which it was her peculiar object (to use her own words in
<lb/>the preface) <quote xml:id="ALB4">to impress devotional feelings as early as
<lb/>possible on the infant mind,</quote>—<quote xml:id="ALB5">to impress them, by con­
<lb/>necting religion with a variety of sensible objects, with all
<lb/>that he sees, all he hears, all that affects his young mind
<lb/>with wonder or delight; and thus, by deep, strong and
<lb/>permanent associations, to lay the best foundation for prac­
<lb/>tical devotion in future life.</quote>
</p>
        <p>None of her works is a fairer monument than this, of the
<lb/>elevation of her soul and the brightness of her genius.
<lb/>While discarding the aid of verse, she everywhere bursts
<lb/>forth into poetry;—while stooping to the comprehension of
<lb/>infancy, she has produced a precious manual of devotion,
<lb/>founded on the contemplation of nature, fitted to delight
<lb/>the taste and warm the piety of the most accomplished
<lb/>minds and finest spirits.
</p>
        <p>Meantime <orgName>Palgrave school</orgName> was progressively increasing
<lb/>in numbers and reputation, and several sons of noble fami­
<lb/>lies were sent to share in its advantages; of whom may be
<lb/>named, the late amiable and lamented <persName ref="p:bdaer.nfb">Basil Lord Daer</persName>

<lb/>(a favourite pupil), and three of his brothers, including the
<lb/>last Earl of <placeName>Selkirk</placeName>; two sons of <persName ref="p:ltempleto.nbq">Lord Templeton</persName>, <persName ref="p:lmore.fne">Lord
<lb/>More</persName>, <persName ref="p:laghrim.mta">Lord
<placeName>Aghrim</placeName></persName>, and the Honourable <persName ref="p:aphipps.emj">Augustus Phipps</persName>:
<lb/>these, who were parlour-boarders, enjoyed most of the
<lb/>benefit of the conversation and occasional instructions of
<lb/><persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName>; and all, it is believed, quitted the school
<lb/>with sentiments towards her of high respect and attach­
<lb/>ment.
</p>
        <p>A course of honourable and prosperous exertion must
<lb/>always be productive of satisfaction to a well-constituted
<lb/>mind; and in this view <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> might regard with
<lb/>complacancy her situation at <placeName>Palgrave</placeName>.  Its cares and its
<lb/>monotony were also relieved by vacations, which she and
<lb/><persName ref="p:rbarbauld.jad">Mr. Barbauld</persName> usually passed either in agreeable visits to
<lb/>their friends in different parts of the country, or in the
<lb/>more animated delights of <placeName>London</placeName> society.  As their con­
<lb/>nexions were extensive, they were now enabled to procure
<lb/>themselves a considerable share of that amusing and in­
<lb/>structive variety of s<choice><sic/><corr>c</corr></choice>enes and characters which forms the
<lb/>peculiar charm of the metropolis.  At the splendid mansion
<lb/>of her early and constant admirer <persName ref="p:mmontague.cvx">Mrs. Montague</persName>, <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs.
<lb/>Barbauld</persName> beheld in perfection the imposing union of litera­
<lb/>ture and fashion;—under the humbler roof of her friend
<lb/>and publisher, the late worthy <persName ref="p:jjohnson.dpy">Joseph Johnson</persName> of <name>St. Paul's
<lb/>Church-yard</name>, she tasted, perhaps with higher relish, <quote>the
<lb/>feast of reason and the flow of soul,</quote> in a chosen knot of
<lb/>lettered equals.  Her own connexions introduced her to
<lb/>leading characters among the dissenters and persons of
<lb/>opposition-politics;—those of <persName ref="p:rbarbauld.jad">Mr. Barbauld</persName> led her among
<lb/>courtiers and supporters of the establishment. Her own
<lb/>candid spirit, and courteous though retiring manners, with
<lb/>the varied graces of her conversation, recommended her
<lb/>alike to all.
</p>
        <p>The business of tuition, however, to those by whom it is
<lb/>faithfully and zealously exercised, must ever be fatiguing
<lb/>beyond almost any other occupation; and <persName ref="p:rbarbauld.jad">Mr.</persName> and <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs.

<lb/>Barbauld</persName> found their health and spirits so much impaired
<lb/>by their exertions, that at the end of eleven years they
<lb/>determined upon quitting <placeName>Palgrave</placeName>, and allowing them­
<lb/>selves an interval of complete relaxation before they should
<lb/>again embark in any scheme of active life.  Accordingly,
<lb/>in the Autumn of <date when="1785">1785</date> they embarked for <placeName>Calais</placeName>; and after
<lb/>extending their travels as far as <placeName>Geneva</placeName>, returned to winter
<lb/>in the south of <placeName>France</placeName>. In the spring they again bent their
<lb/>course northwards, and after a leisurely survey of <placeName>Paris</placeName>
	  <lb/>returned to <placeName>England</placeName> in <date when="1786-06">the month of <name>June</name> 1786</date>.  The re­
<lb/>mainder of that year they pased chiefly in <placeName>London</placeName>, un­
<lb/>decided with respect to a future place of residence; but
<lb/>early in the following one, <persName ref="p:rbarbauld.jad">Mr. Barbauld</persName> having been
<lb/>elected their pastor by a small dissenting congregation at
<lb/><placeName>Hampstead</placeName>, they fixed themselves in that agreeable village,
<lb/>where for several years <persName ref="p:rbarbauld.jad">Mr. Barbauld</persName> received a few young
<lb/>gentlemen as his pupils, while <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> gave daily
<lb/>instructions to a young lady whose mother took up her
<lb/>residence at <placeName>Hampstead</placeName> for the benefit of this tuition:—
<lb/>some years after, she accepted another pupil on a similar
<lb/>plan.
</p>
        <p>Her brother, who placed no small part of his own pride
<lb/>in the efforts of her genius and the extension of her fame,
<lb/>observed with little complacency that her powers were
<lb/>wasted in supineness or in trivial occupations; and early
<lb/>in <date when="1790">1790</date> he apostrophized her in the following sonnet:

<lb/>This animating expostulation conspiring with the events
<lb/>of the spirit-stirring times which now approached, had the
<lb/>effect of once more rousing her to exertion.  In <date when="1790">1790</date>, the
<lb/>rejection of a bill for the repeal of the <name>Corporation and
<lb/>Test Acts</name> called forth her eloquent and indignant <title>Address
to the Opposers</title> of this repeal: her <title>Poetical Epistle to
<persName ref="p:wwilberfo.igt">Mr.
<lb/>Wilberforce</persName> on the rejection of the bill for abolishing the
<lb/>Slave Trade</title> was written in <date when="1791">1791</date>.  The next year produc­

<lb/>the expediency and propriety of public or social Worship</title></title>:
<lb/>and her <title>Sins of Government Sins of the Nation, or a Dis­
<lb/>course for the Fast</title>, appeared in <date when="1793">1793</date>.  She also supplied
<lb/>some valuable contributions to <bibl><author><persName ref="p:daikin.unb">Dr. Aikin's</persName></author> popular book for
children, <title>Evenings at Home</title></bibl>, the first volume of which
<lb/>appeared in <date when="1792">1792</date>: but her share in this work has generally
<lb/>been supposed much greater than in fact it was: of the

        <p>By this time, the effervescence caused by the French

<lb/>could seldom excite herself to the labour of composition,

<lb/>tion of two critical essays; one prefixed to an ornamented

<lb/>appeared in <date when="1795">1795</date>, the second in <date when="1797">1797</date>.  Both are written
<lb/>with elegance, taste, and acuteness; but, on the whole,
<lb/>they are less marked with the peculiar features of her

<lb/>style than perhaps any other of her prose pieces.

        <p>No event worthy of mention occurred till <date when="1802">1802</date>, when
<lb/><persName ref="p:rbarbauld.jad">Mr. Barbauld</persName> accepted an invitation to become pastor of
<lb/>the congregation (formerly <persName ref="p:dprice.uqp">Dr. Price's</persName>) at <placeName>Newington
<lb/>Green</placeName>: and quitting <placeName>Hampstead</placeName>, they took up their abode
<lb/>in the village of <placeName>Stoke Newington</placeName>.  The sole motive for
<lb/>this removal, which separated them from a residence
<lb/>which they liked and friends to whom they were cor­
<lb/>dially attached, was the mutual desire of <persName ref="p:daikin.unb">Dr. Aikin</persName> and
<lb/><persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> to pass the closing period of their lives in
<lb/>that near neighbourhood which admits of the daily and

<lb/>The evening which was the object of these earnest aspira<choice><sic/><corr>t</corr></choice>­
<lb/>ions had now arrived; and it proved a long, though by no
<lb/>means an unclouded one; twenty years elapsed before the
<lb/>hand of death sundered this fraternal pair.
</p>
        <p>A warm attachment to the authors of what has been cal­
	  <lb/>led the Augustan age of <name>English</name> literature,—on whom her
<lb/>own taste and style were formed,—was observable in the
<lb/>conversation of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName>, and often in her writings;
<lb/>and she gratified this sentiment by offering to the public,
<lb/>in <date when="1804">1804</date>, a <title>Selection from <title>the Spectator</title>, <title>Tatler</title>, <title>Guardian</title>
<lb/>and <title>Freeholder</title>, with a Preliminary Essay</title>, to which she
<lb/>gave her name.<anchor xml:id="a02" rend="post(†)" corresp="#n02"/> This delightful piece may perhaps be
<lb/>regarded as the most successful of her efforts in literary
<lb/>criticism; and that it should be so, is easily to be accounted
<lb/>for.  There were many striking points of resemblance be­
<lb/>tween her genius and that of <persName ref="p:jaddison.clp">Addison</persName>.  As prose writers,
<lb/>both were remarkable for uniting wit of the light and
<lb/>sportive kind with vividness of fancy, and a style at once
<lb/>rich and lively, flowing and full of idiom: both of them
<lb/>rather avoided the pathetic: in both, <quote>the sentiments of
<lb/>rational and liberal devotion</quote> were <quote>blended with the
<lb/>speculations of philosophy and the paintings of a fine im­
<lb/>agination:</quote> both were admirable for <quote>the splendour they
<lb/>diffused over a serious, the grace with which they touched
<lb/>a lighter subject.</quote>  The humorous delineation of manners
<lb/>and characters indeed, in which <persName ref="p:jaddison.clp">Addison</persName> so conspicuously
<lb/>shone, was never attempted by <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName>:—in poetry,
<lb/>on the other hand, she surpassed him in all the qualities of
<lb/>which excellence in that style is composed.  Certainly this
<lb/>great author could not elsewhere have found a critic so
<lb/>capable of entering, as it were, into the soul of his writings,
<lb/>culling their choicest beauties, and drawing them forth for
<lb/>the admiration of a world by which they had begun to be

<lb/>neglected.  <persName ref="p:rsteele.fcd">Steele</persName> and the other contributors to these
<lb/>periodical papers are also ably, though briefly, character­
<lb/>ized by her; and such pieces of theirs are included in the
<lb/>
<lb/><title>Selection</title> as could fairly claim enduring remembrance.
</p>
        <p>The essay opens with the observation, <quote>that it is equally
<lb/>true of books as of their authors, that one generation pas­
<lb/>seth away and another cometh.</quote>  The mutual influence
<lb/>exerted by books and manners on each other is then re­
<lb/>marked; and the silent and gradual declension from what
<lb/>might be called the active life of an admired and popular
<lb/>book, to the honourable retirement of a classic, is lightly,
<lb/>but impressively, traced; closed by remarks on the muta­
<lb/>tions and improvements which have particularly affected
<lb/>the works in question.  To young persons chiefly the
<lb/><title>Selection</title> is offered, as containing the <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">essence</soCalled> of a cel­
<lb/>ebrated set of works.  An instructive account is added of
<lb/>each of these in particular, of the state of society at the
<lb/>time of their appearance, the objects at which they aimed,
<lb/>and their effects.  This essay will not be found in the
<lb/>present volumes, because it was considered that to separate
<lb/>it from the selection which it was written to introduce,
<lb/>would be to defeat its very purpose.
</p>
        <p>During the same year (<date when="1804">1804</date>) <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> was pre­
<lb/>vailed upon to undertake the task of examining and making
<lb/>a selection from the letters of <persName ref="p:srichards.rqe">Richardson</persName> the novelist and
<lb/>his correspondents, of which a vast collection had remain­
<lb/>ed in the hands of his last surviving daughter; after whose
<lb/>death they were purchased of his grandchildren. It must
<lb/>be confessed that, on the whole, these letters were less
<lb/>deserving of public attention than she had probably expect­
<lb/>ed to find them; and very good judges have valued more
<lb/>than all the remaining contents of the six duodecimo vol­
<lb/>umes which they occupy, the elegant and interesting life
<lb/>of <persName ref="p:srichards.rqe">Richardson</persName>, and the finished reviewal of his works

        <p>It is probable that <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> consented to employ
<lb/>herself in these humbler offices of literature, chiefly as a
<lb/>solace under the pressure of anxieties and apprehensions of
<lb/>a peculiar and most distressing nature, which had been
<lb/>increasing in urgency during a long course of time, and
<lb/>which found their final completion on the <date when="1808-11-11">11th of <name>Novem­
<lb/>ber</name>, 1808</date>, in the event by which she became a widow.

<lb/>And though the escape of a sufferer from the most melan­
<lb/>choly of human maladies could not in itself be a subject
<lb/>of rational regret, her spirits were deeply wounded, both
<lb/>by the severe trials through which she had previously
<lb/>passed, and by the mournful void which always succeeds
<lb/>the removal of an object of long and deep, however painful,
<lb/>interest.  An affecting <title>Dirge</title> will be found among her
<lb/>poems, which records her feelings on this occasion.  She
<lb/>also communicated to the <title>Monthly Repository of Theology
<lb/>and General Literature</title>, a memoir of <persName ref="p:rbarbauld.jad">Mr. Barbauld</persName>; in
<lb/>which his character is thus delineated.

<lb/>common ones, but his character was not a common one.
<lb/>His reasoning powers were acute, and sharpened by exer­
<lb/>cise; for he was early accustomed to discussion, and ar­
<lb/>gued with great clearness; with a degree of warmth in­
<lb/>deed, but with the most perfect candour towards his
<lb/>opponent.  He gave the most liberal latitude to free in­
<lb/>quiry, and could bear to hear those truths attacked which
<lb/>he most steadfastly believed; the more <emph>because</emph> he stead­
<lb/>fastly believed them; for he was delighted to submit to
<lb/>the test of argument, those truths, which he had no doubt
<lb/>could, by argument, be defended.  He had an uncommon
<pb n="xxviii"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="3(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">xxviii</mw>
<lb/>flow of conversation on those points which had engaged his
<lb/>attention, and delivered himself with a warmth and anima­
<lb/>tion which enlivened the driest subject.  He was equally
	    <lb/>at home in <name>French</name> and <name>English</name> literature; and the exqui­
<lb/>site sensibility of his mind, with the early culture his taste
<lb/>had received, rendered him an excellent judge of all those
<lb/>works which appeal to the heart and imagination.  His
<lb/>feelings were equally quick and vivid; his expressive
<lb/>countenance was the index of his mind, and of every in­
<lb/>stantaneous impression made upon it.  Children, who are
<lb/>the best physiognomists, were always attracted to him, and
<lb/>he delighted to entertain them with lively narratives suited
<lb/>to their age, in which he had great invention.  The vir­
<lb/>tues of his heart will be acknowledged by all who knew
<lb/>him.  His benevolence was enlarged; it was the sponta­
<lb/>neous propensity of his nature, as well as the result of his
<lb/>religious system.  He was temperate, almost to abstemious­
<lb/>ness; yet without any tincture of ascetic rigour.  A free,
<lb/>undaunted spirit, a winning simplicity, a tendency to en­
<lb/>thusiasm, but of the gentle and liberal kind, formed the
<lb/>prominent lineaments of his character.  The social affec­
<lb/>tions were all alive and active in him.  His heart overflow­
<lb/>ed with kindness to all,—the lowest that came within his
<lb/>sphere.  There never was a human being who had less of
<lb/>the selfish and worldly feelings,—they hardly seemed to
<lb/>form a part of his nature.  His was truly the charity which
<lb/>thinketh no ill.  Great singleness of heart, and a candour
<lb/>very opposite to the suspicious temper of worldly sagacity,
<lb/>made him slow to impute unworthy motives to the actions
<lb/>of his fellow-men; yet his candour by no means sprung
<lb/>from indifference to moral rectitude, for when he could no
<lb/>longer resist conviction, his censure was decided and his
<lb/>indignation warm and warmly expressed.  His standard of
<lb/>virtue was high, and he felt no propensities which disposed
<lb/>him to lower it.  His religious sentiments were of the most
<lb/>pure and liberal cast; and his pulpit services, when the
<pb n="xxix"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="3(5)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">xxix</mw>
<lb/>state of his spirits seconded the ardour of his mind, were
<lb/>characterized by the rare union of a fervent spirit of de­
<lb/>votion, with a pure, sublime philosophy, supported by argu­
<lb/>ments of metaphysical acuteness.  He did not speak the
<lb/>language of any party, nor exactly coincide with the sys­
<lb/>tems of any.  He was a believer in the pre-existence of
<lb/>Christ, and, in a certain modified sense, in the atonement;
<lb/>thinking those doctrines most consonant to the tenour of
<lb/>scripture;…but he was too sensible of the difficulties
<lb/>which press upon every system, not to feel indulgence for
<lb/>all, and he was not zealous for any doctrine which did not
<lb/>affect the heart.  Of the moral perfections of the Deity he
<lb/>had the purest and most exalted ideas; on these was chiefly
<lb/>founded his system of religion, and these together with his
<lb/>own benevolent nature led him to embrace so warmly his
<lb/>favourite doctrine of the final salvation of all the human
<lb/>race, and indeed, the gradual rise and perfectibility of all
<lb/>created existence…. His latter days were oppressed by
<lb/>a morbid affection of his spirits, in a great degree heredita­
<lb/>ry, which came gradually upon him, and closed the scene
<lb/>of his earthly usefulness; yet in the midst of the irritation
<lb/>it occasioned, the kindness of his nature broke forth, and
<lb/>some of his last acts were acts of benevolence.</quote>

        <p><persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> had the fortitude to seek relief from de­
<lb/>jection in literary occupation; and incapable as yet of any
<lb/>stronger effort, she consented to edit a collection of the
<lb/>British Novelists, which issued from the press in <date when="1810">1810</date>.  The
<lb/>Introductory Essay shows extent of reading combined with

        <p>In the following year she compiled for the use of young

<lb/>braced her mind, as it were, to the tone of original com­

<milestone unit="sig" n="3(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">xxx</mw>
<lb/><title><date when="1811">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</date></title>,—the longest, and perhaps
<lb/>the most highly finished, of all her poems.  The crisis at
<lb/>which this piece was produced, and concerning which it
<lb/>treats, was confessedly one of the most distressful within
<lb/>the memory of the present generation, and the author's
<lb/>own state of spirits deepened the gloom.  She, like <persName ref="p:cassandra.nex">Cas­
<lb/>sandra</persName>, was the prophetess of woe: at the time, she was
<lb/>heard perhaps with less incredulity, but the event has hap­
<lb/>pily discredited her vaticination in every point.  That the
<lb/>solemn warning which she here attempted to hold forth to
<lb/>national pride and confidence, should cause her lines to be
<lb/>received by the public with less applause than their intrin­
<lb/>sic merit might well have claimed, was perhaps in some
<lb/>degree to be expected; that it would expose its author—
<lb/>its venerable and female author—to contumely and insult,
<lb/>could only have been anticipated by those thoroughly ac­
<lb/>quainted with the instincts of the hired assassin of reputa­
<lb/>tion shooting from his coward ambush.  Can any one read
<lb/>the touching apostrophe,
<quote rend="break(yes)pre()post()"><lg type="poem" rend="align(center)" subtype="indeterminate"><l>Yet O my country, name beloved, revered;—</l></lg></quote>
<lb/>the proud and affectionate enumeration of the names which
<lb/>encircle the brow of <placeName>Britain</placeName> with the halo of immortal glory;
<lb/>of the spots consecrated by the footsteps of genius and vir­
<lb/>tue, where the future pilgrim from the West would kneel
<lb/>with beating heart; the splendid description of <placeName>London</placeName>
<lb/>with all its <quote>pomp and circumstance</quote> of greatness,—the
<lb/>complacent allusion to <quote>angel charities,</quote> and <quote>the book of

<lb/>that this strain was dictated by the heart of a true patriot,
<lb/>a heart which feared because it fondly loved?
</p>
        <p>This was the last of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld's</persName> separate publica­
<lb/>tions.  Who indeed, that knew and loved her, could have
<lb/>wished her to expose again that honoured head to the
<lb/>scorns of the unmanly, the malignant, and the base?  Her

<lb/>fancy was still in all its brightness; her spirits might have
<lb/>been cheered and her energy revived, by the cordial and
<lb/>respectful greetings, the thanks and plaudits, with which it
<lb/>was once the generous and graceful practice of contempo­
<lb/>rary criticism to welcome the re-appearance of a well-
<lb/>deserving veteran in the field of letters.  As it was, though
<lb/>still visited by
<quote rend="break(yes)pre()post()"><lg type="poem" rend="align(center)" subtype="indeterminate"><l>…the thoughts that voluntary move</l><l>Harmonious numbers,</l></lg></quote>
<lb/>she for the most part confined to a few friends all partici­
<lb/>pation in the strains which they inspired.  She even laid
<lb/>aside the intention which she had entertained of preparing
<lb/>a new edition of her <title>Poems</title>, long out of print and often
<lb/>inquired for in vain;—well knowing that a day must come
<lb/>when the sting of Envy would be blunted, and her <emph>memory</emph>
<lb/>would have its fame.
</p>
        <p>No incident worthy of mention henceforth occurred to
<lb/>break the uniformity of her existence.  She gave up all
<lb/>distant journeys; and confined at home to a narrow circle
<lb/>of connexions and acquaintance, she suffered life to slide
<lb/>away, as it were, at its own pace,
<quote rend="break(yes)pre()post()"><lg type="poem" rend="align(center)" subtype="indeterminate"><l>Nor shook the outhasting sands, nor bid them stay.</l></lg></quote>
<lb/>An asthmatic complaint, which was slowly undermining
<lb/>her excellent constitution, more and more indisposed her
<lb/>for any considerable exertion either of mind or body: but
<lb/>the arrival of a visitor had always the power to rouse her
<lb/>from a state of languor.  Her powers of conversation
<lb/>suffered little declension to the last, although her memory
<lb/>of recent circumstances became somewhat impaired.  Her
<lb/>disposition,—of which sensibility was not in earlier life the
<lb/>leading feature,—now mellowed into softness, pleasingly

<lb/>Her manners, never tainted by pride,—which, with the
<lb/>baser but congenial affection of envy, was a total stranger
<lb/>to her bosom,—were now remarkable for their extreme
<lb/>humility: she spoke of every one not merely with the can­
<lb/>dour and forbearance which she had long practised; but
<lb/>with interest, with kindness, with an indulgence which
<lb/>sometimes appeared but too comprehensive; she seemed
<lb/>reluctant to allow, or believe, that any of her fellow-
<lb/>creatures had a failing, while she gave them credit gratui­
<lb/>tously for many virtues. This state of mind, which, with
<lb/>her native acuteness of discernment, it must apparently
<lb/>have cost her some struggles to attain, had at least the
<lb/>advantage of causing her easily to admit of such substitutes
<lb/>as occurred for those contemporary and truly congenial
<lb/>friendships which, in the course of nature, were now fast
<lb/>failing her.  She lost her early and affectionate friend
<lb/><persName ref="p:mkenrick.umn">Mrs. Kenrick</persName> in <date when="1819">1819</date>.  In <date when="1822-12"><name>December</name> 1822</date> her brother
<lb/>sunk under a long decline, which had served as a painful
<lb/>preparation to the final parting.  A few months later she
<lb/>lost, in the excellent <persName ref="p:mtaylor.fpg">Mrs. John Taylor</persName> of <placeName>Norwich</placeName>, perhaps
<lb/>the most intimate and most highly valued of all her distant
<lb/>friends; to whose exalted and endearing character she bore
<lb/>the following well-merited testimony in a letter addressed
<lb/>to one of her daughters.

        <p>
          <lb/>
          <quote>Receive the assurance of my most affectionate sympathy
<lb/>in those feelings with which you must be now contemplat­
<lb/>ing the loss of that dear woman, so long the object of your
<lb/>respect and affection; nor indeed yours only, but of all who
<lb/>knew her.  A prominent part of those feelings, however,
<lb/>must be, that the dear object of them is released from suf­
<lb/>fering, has finished her task, and entered upon her re­
<lb/>ward…. Never will she be forgotten by those who
<lb/>knew her!  Her strong sense, her feeling, her energy,
<lb/>her principle, her patriot feelings, her piety rational yet
<lb/>ardent,—all these mark a character of no common sort.
<lb/>When to these high claims upon general regard are added
<pb n="xxxiii"/>

<mw type="pageNum">xxxiii</mw>
<lb/>those of relation or friend, the feeling must be such as no
<lb/>course of years can efface.</quote>
        </p>
        <p>A gentle and scarcely perceptible decline was now slop­
<lb/>ing for herself the passage to the tomb:—she felt and hail­
<lb/>ed its progress as a release from languor and infirmity,—
<lb/>a passport to another and a higher state of being.  Her
<lb/>friends, however, flattered themselves that they might
<lb/>continue to enjoy her yet a little longer; and she had con­
<lb/>sented to remove under the roof of her adopted son, that
<lb/>his affectionate attentions and those of his family might be
<lb/>the solace of every remaining hour.  But Providence had
<lb/>ordained it otherwise:—she quitted indeed her own house,
<lb/>but whilst on a visit at the neighbouring one of her sister-
<lb/>in-law <persName ref="p:maikin.lpa">Mrs. Aikin</persName>, the constant and beloved friend of near­
<lb/>ly her whole life, her bodily powers gave way almost sud­
<lb/>denly; and after lingering a few days, on the morning of
	  <lb/><date when="1825-03-09"><name>March</name> the 9th, 1825</date>, she expired without a struggle, in the
<lb/>eighty-second year of her age.
</p>
        <p>To claim for this distinguished woman the praise of
<lb/>purity and elevation of mind may well appear superfluous.
<lb/>Her education and connexions, the course of her life, the
<lb/>whole tenour of her writings, bear abundant testimony to
<lb/>this part of her character.  It is a higher, or at least a
<lb/>rarer commendation to add, that no one ever better loved
<lb/><quote>a sister's praise,</quote> even that of such sisters as might have
<lb/>been peculiarly regarded in the light of rivals. She was
<lb/>acquainted with almost all the principal female writers of
<lb/>her time; and there was not one of the number whom she
<lb/>failed frequently to mention in terms of admiration, esteem,
<lb/>or affection, whether in conversation, in letters to her
<lb/>friends, or in print.  To humbler aspirants in the career of
<lb/>letters, who often applied to her for advice or assistance,
<lb/>she was invariably courteous, and in many instances essen­
<lb/>tially seviceable.  The sight of youth and beauty was
<lb/>peculiarly gratifying to her fancy and her feelings; and
<lb/>children and young persons, especially females, were

<mw type="pageNum">xxxiv</mw>
<lb/>accordingly large sharers in her benevolence: she loved
<lb/>their society, and would often invite them to pass weeks or
<lb/>months in her house, when she spared no pains to amuse
<lb/>and instruct them; and she seldom failed, after they had
<lb/>quitted her, to recall herself from time to time to their
<lb/>recollection, by affectionate and playful letters, or welcome
<lb/>presents.
</p>
        <p>In the conjugal relation, her conduct was guided by the
<lb/>highest principles of love and duty.  As a sister, the unin­
<lb/>terrupted flow of her affection, manifested by numberless
<lb/>tokens of love,—not alone to her brother, but to every
<lb/>member of his family,—will ever be recalled by them with
<lb/>emotions of tenderness, respect, and gratitude.  She pass­
<lb/>ed through a long life without having dropped, it is believ­
<lb/>ed, a single friendship, and without having drawn upon
	  <lb/>herself a single enmity which could properly be called
<lb/>personal.
</p>
        <p>We now proceed to offer some account of the contents
<lb/>of the present volumes, with a few remarks on the genius
<lb/>of their author.  The small bulk of the writings of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs.
<lb/>Barbauld</persName>, compared with the long course of years during
<lb/>which she exercised the pen, is a sufficient proof that she
<lb/>offered to the public none but the happiest inspirations of
<lb/>her Muse, and not even these till they had received all the
<lb/>polish of which she judged them susceptible.  To a friend
<lb/>who had expressed his surprise at not finding inserted in
<lb/>her volume a poem which he had admired in manuscript,
<lb/>she well and characteristically replied; <said>I had rather it
<lb/>should be asked of twenty pieces why they are not here,
<lb/>than of one why it is.</said>  Her representatives have in the
<lb/>present instance followed, to the best of their judgment, a
<lb/>similar principle of selection.  Out of a considerable num­
<lb/>ber of pieces which appear from their dates to have been
<lb/>rejected by herself from her first publication, they have
<lb/>printed only two: that agreeable <foreign xml:lang="fr">jeu d'esprit</foreign> <title>The Invento­
<lb/>ry of the Furniture of <persName ref="p:jpriestle.nnm">Dr. Priestley's</persName> Study</title>, probably omit­
<pb n="xxxv"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="4(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">xxxv</mw>
<lb/>ted in the first instance for reasons which no longer exist;
<lb/>and the elegant <title>Lines on The Deserted Village</title>, which are
<lb/>given partly for the sake of connecting the name of their
<lb/>author as a contemporary with that of a poet who has been
<lb/>so long enrolled among the classics of his country.  It may
<lb/>be also mentioned, that <persName ref="p:ogoldsmit.zre">Goldsmith</persName>, whose envy is well
<lb/>known, bore involuntary testimony to the merit of these
<lb/>lines, by exhibiting no sentiment but mortification on hear­
<lb/>ing them read with applause in a <placeName>London</placeName> circle.
</p>
        <p>Of the pieces composed since the first publication of
<lb/><persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld's</persName> <title>Poems</title> (which form the larger part of the
<lb/>present collection;) the two longest, the <title>Epistle to
<persName ref="p:wwilberfo.igt">Mr.
<lb/>Wilberforce</persName></title>, and <title><date when="1811">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</date></title>, have
<lb/>already appeared in separate pamphlets; and the first of
<lb/>them is added to the last edition of the <title>Poems</title>: several of
<lb/>the smaller ones have also been inserted in periodical
<lb/>works.  Corrected copies of most of those now printed for
<lb/>the first time, were found among her papers, evidently pre­
<lb/>pared for insertion in the enlarged volume which she long
<lb/>meditated, but never completed.
</p>
        <p>The <title>Poems</title> have been disposed, with some unimportant
<lb/>exceptions, in chronological order, as nearly as it could be
<lb/>ascertained.  When the productions of a writer extend
<lb/>over so long a period as nearly sixty years, they become
<lb/>in some measure the record of any age,—a document for
<lb/>the historian of literature and opinions; and they ought to
<lb/>be arranged with some view to this secondary object, by
<lb/>which their interest is enhanced.  It is also agreeable to
<lb/>trace the author's progress from youth to age, by changes
<lb/>of style, or the succession of different trains of thought.
<lb/>In the writings of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName>, however, the character
<lb/>of the style varies little from the beginning to the end.  It
<lb/>is nowhere to be found in an unformed state; for so re­
<lb/>lentlessly did she destroy all her juvenile essays, that the
<lb/>editor is not aware of the existence of a single piece which
<lb/>can be ascertained to have been composed before the age
<pb n="xxxvi"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="4(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">xxxvi</mw>
<lb/>of twenty; the printed ones are all, it is believed, of a con­
<lb/>siderably later date.  Her earliest pieces too, as well as
<lb/>her more recent ones, exhibit in their imagery and allusions
<lb/>the fruits of extensive and varied reading.  In youth, the
<lb/>power of her imagination was counterbalanced by the
<lb/>activity of her intellect, which exercised itself in rapid, but
<lb/>not unprofitable excursions over almost every field of know­
<lb/>ledge.  In age, when this activity abated, imagination
<lb/>appeared to exert over her an undiminished sway.
</p>
        <p>The quality which principally distinguishes the later
<lb/>productions of her Muse is pathos.  In some tempers sen­
<lb/>sibility appears an instinct, while in others it is the gradual
<lb/>result of principle and reflection, of the events and the
<lb/>experience of life.  It was certainly so in that of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs.
<lb/>Barbauld</persName>.  Her <title>Epistle to <persName ref="p:denfield.aob">Dr. Enfield</persName>, on his revisiting
<lb/><placeName>Warrington</placeName> in <date when="1789">1789</date></title>, is the first of her poems which in­
<lb/>dicates deep feeling; and this was dictated by the tender
<lb/>recollections of departed youth, and the memory of an
<lb/>honoured parent, the first near connexion from whom she
<lb/>had been parted by death.  Her other pathetic pieces,
<title>The Lines on the Death of <persName ref="p:mmartinea.uto">Mrs. Martineau</persName></title>—<title>the Dirge</title>—
<lb/>the <title>Thought on Death</title>—the <title>Lines on the Illness of the
<lb/>late King</title>—those <title>on the Death of the <persName ref="p:pcharlott.xyt">Princess
Charlotte</persName></title>—
<lb/>the <title>Octogenary Reflections</title>, and a few others, may easily
<lb/>be traced either to particular afflictive incidents of her
<lb/>life, or to reflections naturally arising under the influence
<lb/>of declining years and domestic solitude.  By the reader
<lb/>of taste and sentiment these will not be esteemed the least
<lb/>interesting portion of the collection.
</p>
        <p>The second volume of the present work contains a
<lb/>selection from the private correspondence of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Bar­
<lb/>bauld</persName>, her entire share of the <title>Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose</title>
<lb/>written by herself and her brother conjointly, her three
<lb/>pamphlets, and several occasional pieces,—some of them
<lb/>now first given to the world, others reprinted from period­
<lb/>ical works where they appeared anonymously.

        <p>It is equally true of the style of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> in prose
<lb/>as in verse, that it was never produced to the public till it
<lb/>had reached its perfect stature: the early volume of <title>Mis­
<lb/>cellaneous Pieces</title> contained specimens in various kinds
<lb/>which she never surpassed.  In the allegory of <title>the Hill of
<lb/>Science</title> she tried her strength with <persName ref="p:jaddison.clp">Addison</persName>, and sustained
<lb/>no defeat.  The <title>Essay on Romances</title> is a professed imita­
<lb/>tion of the style of <persName ref="p:sjohnson.jyg">Dr. Johnson</persName>; and it was allowed by
<lb/>that celebrated rhetorician himself, to be the best that was
<lb/>ever attempted; because it reflected the colour of his
<lb/>thoughts, no less than the turn of his expressions.  Here
<lb/>it appears as a foil to the <quote>easy and inimitable graces</quote> of
<lb/>her own natural manner.  Of the <title>Essay against Inconsist­
<lb/>ency in our Expectations</title>, the editor feels it superfluous to
<lb/>speak: it has long been acknowledged to stand at the head
<lb/>of its class.
</p>
        <p>Of a different character are her <title>Thoughts on the Devo­
<lb/>tional Taste, on Sects and on Establishments</title>.  This piece
<lb/>betrays, it must be confessed, that propensity to tread on
<lb/>dangerous ground which sometimes appears an instinct of
<lb/>genius.  It recommends a spirit of devotion which yet she
<lb/>is obliged to allow to be in some measure incompatible
<lb/>with an enlightened and philosophical theology.  That
<lb/>part, however, which delineates the characteristics of sects
<lb/>and of establishments, and balances their respective advan­
<lb/>tages and inconveniences, evinces great acuteness and a
<lb/>rare impartiality; and the whole must be admired as
<lb/>eloquence, if it cannot be altogether acquiesced in as rea­
<lb/>son.
</p>
        <p>Amongst her later pieces, two which first appeared in
<lb/>the <title>Monthly Magazine</title>,—the <title>Essay on Education</title>, and that
<lb/>on <title>Prejudice</title>, which may be regarded as in some measure
<lb/>a sequel to it,—have justly earned for her not merely
<lb/>applause, but gratitude.  The first served to calm the
<lb/>apprehensions of many an anxious parent,—who had risen
<lb/>from the examination of the numerous conflicting systems

<mw type="pageNum">xxxviii</mw>
<lb/>of education then fashionable, alarmed rather than edifi­
<lb/>ed,—by pointing out, that the success of the great and
<lb/>familiar process of fitting a human creature to bear well
<lb/>his part in life, depended not for its success on elaborate
<lb/>schemes of artificial management, such as few have leisure
<lb/>to attend to or power to execute; but, most of all, on cir­
<lb/>cumstances which no parent can controul; and next, on
<lb/>examples such as discreet and virtuous parents in any sit­
<lb/>uation of life are enabled to give, and give indeed uncon­
<lb/>sciously.  The second essay encourages the parent to use
<lb/>without scruple the power of influencing the opinions of
<lb/>his child which God and nature have put into his hands,
<lb/>and not to believe on the word of certain speculatists, that
<lb/>it is either necessary or desirable to abstain from imbuing
<lb/>his offspring with what he conceives to be important and
<lb/>salutary truths, from the dread of instilling prejudices and
<lb/>crippling the efforts of his infant reason.  In these excel­
<lb/>lent productions we are uncertain which most to admire,
<lb/>the sagacious and discriminating intellect, the practical
<lb/>good sense and acute observation of life which suggest the
<lb/>remarks, or the spirited and expressive style which rouses
<lb/>attention, strikes the imagination, and carries them with
<lb/>conviction to the heart.

        <p>It appears from a letter of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld's</persName>, that she early
	  <lb/>read with great delight, though in an <name>English</name> translation,
<lb/><title>the Dialogues of <persName ref="p:lucian.vdl">Lucian</persName></title>.  Perhaps we may remotely trace
<lb/>to the impression thus produced, the origin of her witty and
<lb/>ingenious <title>Dialogue between <persName>Madame
	      Cosmogunia</persName> and a
<lb/>philosophical Inquirer of the Eighteenth Century</title>, as well
<lb/>as of her <title>Dialogue in the Shades</title>.  The allegorical or
<lb/>enigmatical style, however, in which the first of these
<lb/>pieces is composed, seemed peculiarly adapted to her
<lb/>genius; and the skill and elegance with which she com­
<lb/>posed in this difficult manner is further attested by her
<lb/><title>Letter of <persName ref="p:jbull.oys">John Bull</persName>, by the Four Sisters</title>, (published in
<lb/><title>Evenings at Home</title>,) by many entertaining Riddles, a few

<lb/>of which are now included among her <title>Poems</title>, and by seve­
<lb/>ral little fancy pieces scattered among her familiar letters.
<lb/>Even her conversation was often enlivened with these
<lb/>graceful sports of wit and imagination.
</p>
        <p>Of the three Pamphlets now republished among her
<lb/>Prose Works, the editor has only to observe, that though
<lb/>composed on particular occasions, these pieces were not
<lb/>formed to pass away with those occasions: they treat of
<lb/>subjects permanently interesting to the champion of reli­
<lb/>gious liberty, to the conscientious patriot, and to the chris­
<lb/>tian worshipper,—and they so treat of them, that while
	  <lb/><name>English</name> eloquence is made a study, while <name>English</name> literature
<lb/>is not forgotten, their praise shall live, their memory shall
<lb/>flourish.
</p>
        <p>It only remains to speak of her familiar letters.  These
<lb/>were certainly never intended by herself to meet the pub­
<lb/>lic eye.  She kept no copies of them; and it is solely by
<lb/>the indulgence of her correspondents or their representa­
<lb/>tives,—an indulgence for which she here desires to offer
<lb/>her grateful acknowledgements,—that the editor has been
<lb/>enabled to give them to the world.  She flatters herself
<lb/>that their publication will not be considered as a trespass
<lb/>either against the living or the dead: some of them, par­
<lb/>ticularly a considerable proportion of those addressed to
<lb/><persName ref="p:daikin.unb">Dr. Aikin</persName>, seemed to claim insertion as biographical re­
<lb/>cords; and those written during her residence in <placeName>France</placeName>,
<lb/>in the years <date when="1785">1785</date> and <date when="1786">1786</date>, appeared no less curious and
<lb/>valuable at the present day for the matter they contain,
<lb/>than entertaining and agreeable from the vivacity with
<lb/>which they are written.  But it was impossible not to be
<lb/>influenced also by the desire of thus communicating to
<lb/>those admirers of <persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld's</persName> genius who did not enjoy
<lb/>the advantage of her personal acquaintance, a just idea of
<lb/>the pointed and elegant remark, the sportive and lambent
<lb/>wit, the affectionate spirit of sympathy, and the courteous
<lb/>expression of esteem and benevolence, which united to

<milestone unit="sig" n="4(4)v"/>

<lb/>form at once the graces of her epistolary style and the in­
<lb/>expressible charm of her conversation.
</p>
        <p><persName ref="p:abarbauld.ibw">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> composed at different periods a consider­
<lb/>able number of miscellaneous pieces for the instruction and
<lb/>amusement of young persons, especially females, which
<lb/>will appear in a separate form about the close of the pres­
<lb/>ent year.

            <l>To fold, and starch, and clap, and iron, and plait.</l>
