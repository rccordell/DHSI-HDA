<lb/>volume are presented to the public with all the diffidence
<lb/>and anxiety of a literary novice conscious of a bold and
<lb/>arduous undertaking. As I am not, however, aware of any
<lb/>circumstances in my own case which peculiarly appeal to
<lb/>the indulgence of the reader, I shall decline any further ex­
<lb/>posure of feelings purely personal, and proceed to the proper
<lb/>business of this introduction,…to offer such preliminary
<lb/>remarks on the plan of the work as may be necessary to
<lb/>prevent misapprehension.</p>
        <p>Let me in the first place disclaim entirely the absurd
<lb/>idea that the two sexes ever can be, or ever ought to be,
<lb/>placed in all respects on a footing of equality. Man when
<lb/>he abuses his power may justly be considered as a tyrant;
<lb/>but his power itself is no tyranny, being founded not on
<lb/>usurpation, but on certain unalterable necessities;…sanc­
<lb/>tioned, not by prescription alone, but by the fundamental
<lb/>laws of human nature. As long as the bodily constitution of
<lb/>the species shall remain the same, man must in general assume
<lb/>those public and active offices of life which confer authority,
<lb/>whilst to woman will usually be allotted such domestic and
<lb/>private ones as imply a certain degree of subordination.</p>
        <p>Nothing therefore could, in my opinion, be more foolish
<lb/>than the attempt to engage our sex in a struggle for stations
<pb n="vi"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="A3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">vi</mw>
<lb/>that they are physically unable properly to fill; for power
<lb/>of which they must always want the means to possess them­
<lb/>selves. No! instead of aspiring to be inferior men, let us
<lb/>content ourselves with becoming noble women:…but let
<lb/>not sex be carried into every thing. Let the impartial voice
<lb/>of History testify for us, that, when permitted, we have been
<lb/>the worthy associates of the best efforts of the best of men;
<lb/>let the daily observation of mankind bear witness, that no
<lb/>talent, no virtue, is masculine alone; no fault or folly ex­
<lb/>clusively feminine;…that there is not an endowment, or
<lb/>propensity, or mental quality of any kind, which may not
<lb/>be derived from her father to the daughter, to the son from
<lb/>his mother. These positions once established, and carried
<lb/>into their consequences, will do every thing for woman.
<lb/>Perceiving that any shaft aimed at her, must strike in its
<lb/>recoil upon some vulnerable part of common human nature,
<lb/>the <name>Juvenals</name> and <name>Popes</name> of future ages will abstain from
<lb/>making her the butt of scorn or malice. Feeling with gra­
<lb/>titude of what her heart and mind are capable, the scholars,
<lb/>the sages, and the patriots of coming days will treat her as
<lb/>a sister and a friend.</p>
        <p>The politic father will not then leave as a
<soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)slant(italic)">legacy</soCalled> to
<lb/>his daughters the injunction to conceal their wit, their learn­
<lb/>ing, and even their good sense, in deference to the
<soCalled rend="slant(italic)pre(“)post(”)">natural
<lb/>malignity</soCalled> with which most men regard every woman of a
<lb/>sound understanding and cultivated mind; nor will even the

        <p>To mark the effect of various codes, institutions, and
<lb/>states of manners, on the virtue and happiness of man, and
<lb/>the concomitant and proportional elevation or depression of
<lb/>woman in the scale of existence, is the general plan of this
<lb/>work. The historical and biographical authorities from which
<lb/>its facts and many of its sentiments are derived, will easily
<lb/>be recognised by the literary reader, who will know how
<lb/>to estimate my correctness and fidelity: for the use of
<lb/>other readers a few notes are subjoined.</p>
        <p>With respect to arrangement, I may remark, that as a
<lb/>strictly chronological one was incompatible with the design
<lb/>of tracing the progress of human society not in one country
<lb/>alone, but in many, I have judged it most advisable to form
<lb/>to myself such an one as seemed best adapted to my own
<lb/>peculiar purposes, moral and poetical. We have no records
<lb/>of any early people in a ruder state than some savage tribes of
<lb/>the present day; and it would be in vain to seek amongst the

<lb/>tors of the noblest nations of modern <placeName>Europe</placeName> ought not to
<lb/>be classed with families of men whose name has perished from
<lb/>the earth, or wandering hordes of which we do not yet know
<lb/>whether or not they contain a living seed of future greatness.</p>
        <p>In the way of explanation I have little more to add. I
<lb/>make no specific claims for my sex. Convinced that it is
<lb/>rather to the policy, or the generosity, of man, than to his
<lb/>justice that we ought to appeal, I have simply endeavoured
<lb/>to point out, that between the two partners of human life,
<lb/>not only the strongest family likeness, but the most complete
<lb/>identity of interest subsists: so that it is impossible for man
<lb/>to degrade his companion without degrading himself, or to
<lb/>elevate her without receiving a proportional accession of dig­
<lb/>nity and happiness. This is the chief <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">moral of my song;</soCalled>
<lb/>on this point all my examples are brought to bear. I regard
<lb/>it as the Great Truth to the support of which my pen has
<lb/>devoted itself; and whoever shall rise from the perusal of
<lb/>these epistles deeply impressed with its importance, will
<lb/>afford me the success dearest to my heart,…the hope of
<lb/>having served, in some small degree, the best interests of
<lb/>the human race.</p>
        <p>With respect to the Miscellaneous Poems, I have only to
<lb/>announce, that they comprise such pieces of mine contained
<lb/>in <title>The Athenæum</title>, and the earlier volumes of <title>The Monthly
<lb/>Magazine</title>, as appeared to me in any respect worthy of pre­
<lb/>servation; and that to these two others have been added.</p>

<lb/>Turkish haram—mean and childish character of the women, haughy yet
<lb/>contemptible one of the men—fatal effects of polygamy—Man cannot
<lb/>degrade the female sex without degrading the whole race. Ancient
<lb/><name>Germans</name>— their women free and honoured—hence the valour of the men,
<lb/>the virtue of both sexes, the success of their resistance to <placeName>Rome</placeName>. Chi­
<lb/>valry personified and depicted—his valour—his devotion to the ladies,
<lb/>his pure and romantic love—his lady described as endowed with all
<lb/>virtues and graces, but found to be a visionary being, only existing in
<lb/>the Fairy land of <persName>Spenser</persName>—contrasted by the giddy and unprincipled
<lb/>women introduced into the French court by <persName>Francis I</persName>. Gallantry,
<lb/>the parasite and treacherous corruptor of the sex—Man always
<lb/>suffers by degrading woman—public freedom dependent on domestic
<lb/>virtue. <placeName>Switzerland</placeName> virtuous when first made free—virtuous still,
<lb/>though opprest by <placeName>France</placeName>—<name>Swiss</name> women died fighting for their country.
<lb/><placeName>France</placeName> not pure enough for freedom, yet had some heroines—<persName>Cordé</persName>—
<lb/><persName>Roland</persName>. Transition to <placeName>England</placeName>—address to the author's female com­
<lb/>panions—survey of its female characters from the earliest times. <persName>Boa­
<lb/>dicea</persName>—<persName>Ethelfleda</persName>. Revival of letters gives consequence to women—<persName>Sir
<lb/>Thomas More</persName> and his daughter—<persName>Lady Jane Grey</persName>—<persName>Queen Elizabeth</persName>—
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Hutchinson</persName>—<persName>Lady Russell</persName>. Enumeration concluded—Exhorta­
<lb/>tion to <name>Englishmen</name> to look with favour on the mental improvement of
<lb/>females—to English women to improve and principle their minds, and by
<lb/>their merit induce the men to treat them as
friends. Valediction.</p>

                <p>On the obscure and much controverted subject of chivalry, I find it ne­
<lb/>cessary in this place to hazard a few observations. Several circumstances
<lb/>convince me, and especially some striking facts in the history of <persName>Alboin</persName> king
<lb/>of the <name>Lombards</name>, and in that of the northern pirates, that a truly chivalrous
<lb/>spirit of honour and generosity had been introduced into the commerce of
<lb/>warriors with each other, in all the relations of peace and war, long before
<lb/>the refinements of gallantry, or even a tolerable decency of behaviour
<lb/>towards the weaker sex, came to be considered as incumbent on the brave
<lb/>and the noble. I also find that e<unclear reason="obscured">ven</unclear> during those ages when the spirit of
<lb/>chivalry is supposed to have been at its height, and when a very romantic
<lb/>kind of gallantry did in fact prevail, in the times, for instance, commemo­
<lb/>rated by the narrative <persName>Froissart</persName>, when, for their ladies' love, a party of
<lb/>young knights took a solemn vow to keep one of their eyes blinded with a
<lb/>silken patch till they should have achieved some signal deed of arms,…
<lb/>manners were still gross, and morals extremely corrupt. In <placeName>France</placeName>, the
<lb/>nuptial tie, seldom cemented by mutual preference and inclination, has in
<lb/>no age been sufficient to restrain the wanderings of the imagination, or
<lb/>preserve the innocency of domestic life. In <placeName>Spain</placeName>, an absurd spirit of
<lb/>jealous rigour long fostered in both sexes the taste for clandestine amours;
<lb/>and the Spanish or Portuguese author of <title>Amadis de <placeName>Gaul</placeName></title>, accounted the

<lb/>and peerless <persName>Oriana</persName> herself as more fortunate in the constancy of her lover,
<lb/>but not more discreet in her loves, than the hapless <persName>Dido</persName> of ancient story.
<lb/>In <placeName>England</placeName> and the northern parts of the continent, if morals were some­
<lb/>what more pure during these ages than in the south, manners were still
<lb/>more coarse. I am compelled to infer, that it was not till knight errantry,
<lb/>ceasing to exist in reality, had become a frame for the poetic fictions of a
<lb/>dignified and learned age, that it assumed the pure and lofty character
<lb/>which delights us in the beautiful coinage of <persName>Spenser's</persName> brain, stamped
<lb/>with the impress of all the Virtues, and superscribed with the titles of a
