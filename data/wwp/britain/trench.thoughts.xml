            <lb/>when these pages were written. Religion <emph rend="slant(italic)">is</emph> now taught
            <lb/>as <emph rend="slant(italic)">a branch</emph> of education at least. And did <name>Christianity</name>
            <lb/>consist of outward <term>ordinances</term>,—<gloss>fixed rules of conduct</gloss>,—
            <lb/>and assent to certain dogmas, it might be so taught. But
            <lb/>the truth is, that though the facts and doctrines of our
            <lb/>religion may be <emph rend="slant(italic)">learnt</emph> by the pupil, their results, their
            <lb/>practical consequences, must be imbibed from the teacher's
            <lb/>own life. Her temper, her views, her hopes, must <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">tell
            <lb/>of the doctrine,</quote> whether, at least, <emph rend="slant(italic)">she</emph> believes its truth.
            <lb/>And if this comment be wanting, our children may be
            <lb/>reading the <rs type="title">Scriptures</rs> daily, yet may not, after all, be re­

            <lb/>bring forth fruit to them, may it not rather be in spite of,
            <lb/>than in consequence of, their education? Such a view
            <lb/>of the subject, I conceive, would have been taken by the

        <note type="editorial" xml:id="n004" target="#a004" rend="pre(*)place(foot)"><p rend="first-indent(1)">Great as is the improvement in this class of books
            <lb/>since these pages were written; yet, the false notions of
            <lb/>religion and morality conveyed in many popular, and, in
            <lb/>some respects, useful works of the present day, are very
            <lb/>extraordinary.</p></note>
        <note type="editorial" xml:id="n005" target="#a005" rend="pre(*)place(foot)"><p rend="first-indent(1)">From the mode of life usually adopted by the highest
            <lb/>classes of our countrymen, this advantage is denied to their
            <lb/>children. They see them, doubtless, daily, but how rarely
            <lb/><emph rend="slant(italic)">alone</emph>. Until a young person is come out, she is the com­
            <lb/>panion of her governess, not of her mother. And doubt­
            <lb/>less this exchange may, in some cases, be valuable to the
            <lb/>child; but how shall the mother answer for her personal
            <lb/>neglect of the precious talent committed to her!</p>
        <p rend="first-indent(1)">I am aware that a mother, who <emph rend="slant(italic)">does</emph> devote the largest
            <lb/>portion of her time to her children, will be assailed and
            <lb/>perplexed by the reproaches of most of her acquaintance.
            <lb/>Her friends will urge the claims of society upon her; and
            <lb/>it will be well, therefore, if she settle honestly with her
            <lb/>own conscience what these claims really are. They are
            <pb xml:id="pbn001" corresp="#pb001"/>
            <lb/>not, we find, permitted to interfere with the wordly calling
            <lb/>of our husbands. The lawyer may devote himself to his
            <lb/>clients,—the merchant to his counting-house; official men
            <lb/>may plead their indispensable engagements; but when a
            <lb/>mother would devote herself to the calling evidently
            <lb/>marked out for her by Providence, she is told of the <emph rend="slant(italic)">claims
            <lb/>of society</emph>! An illustrious exception to the above remark
            <lb/>will, however, readily occur to the reader's mind.</p></note>

            <lb/>Aware, doubtless, that these visits, profitable to both
            <lb/>parties, if made in company with a parent or older friend,
            <lb/>may do much harm to a young person if made alone.
            <lb/>Those who have seen something of the poor, are aware of
            <lb/>the quantity of low flattery poured into the ears of the
            <lb/>young people who visit them. By the better sort, pro­
            <lb/>bably, <emph rend="slant(italic)">well meant</emph>, (though not, from that circumstance, less
            <lb/>pernicious,) but, by the more numerous and designing class,
            <lb/>intended to answer their own purposes in disposing their 
            <lb/>young visiters to listen more favourably to the claims they
            <lb/>put forth.</p></note>
        <note type="editorial" xml:id="n007" target="#a007" rend="pre(*)place(foot)"><p rend="first-indent(1)">It may be doubted whether field sports do at all en­
            <lb/>hance the sufferings of the brute creation, since the death
            <lb/>they meet with in this way, is, probably, the least painful
            <lb/>that could be devised: and since we conceive that we
            <lb/>have a right, not only to kill, but to breed up—<emph rend="slant(italic)">on purpose to
            <lb/>kill them</emph> for the table,—tame animals,—we can scarcely
            <lb/>be scrupulous about destroying wild ones for the same
            <lb/>purpose.</p>
        <p rend="first-indent(1)">With respect to the Insect tribes also, much false sen­
            <lb/>sibility, and subsequent hardness of heart, may be excited,
            <lb/>by representing their sufferings as much greater than they
            <lb/>really are—as something even analogous to our own. But
            <lb/>the fly, whose depredations on our sugar-basin are not
            <lb/>disturbed, even by the loss of a leg in the service, need
            <lb/>not be made an object of sympathy. Nor, perhaps, have
            <lb/>the wasps, who sip their deadly syrup to the last, much
            <lb/>right to complain of the cruelty of their fate. But if we
            <lb/>make our children feel that this <emph rend="slant(italic)">is</emph> the case, their hearts
            <lb/>must either become hardened under constant exposure
            <lb/>to scenes of this nature, or themselves the slaves of a
            <lb/>morbid sensibility.</p></note>

            <lb/>Editor's hands a short time ago, during
            <lb/>her residence in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>; and anxious to
            <lb/>be the means of diffusing more widely,

            <lb/>eventful and interesting; but this wish
            <lb/>has been readily relinquished, under the

          <lb/>against all animals, foreign and domestic, in 
          <lb/>terms calculated to excite the most lively appre­

          <lb/>some apprehension, one night, at observing

          <lb/>probably had been pointed out to him in an 
          <lb/>injudicious manner. We have known artful

          <lb/>greater ease. It were well if such artifices were
          <lb/>confined to nurses. By a little address, the child
          <lb/>was induced to approach these shadows; and, on

          <lb/>his mother's hands and his own, he soon became

          <lb/>For this purpose, the greatest care has been taken to seize upon all those striking

          <lb/>a vivid picture of scenes past, but induce him to argue from effects to their causes.
          <lb/>While the philosophy of history, therefore, is sedulously taught, it is taught in a 
          <lb/>manner calculated to gratify both young and old, by affording to the one class
          <lb/>ample scope to reflection; to the other, matter that stirs and excites, while it
