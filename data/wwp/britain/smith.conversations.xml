	now due to overlapping hierarchies and misnamed header and
	titlepage elements.Fixed all overlapping problems
	caught by running validation. Solution: to add p elements
	around a quote element which contains the embedded text. In
	all of these cases I have changed the previously encoded q
	element to quote. This must still be done for the rest of the
	text.The file now completely validates except for
	issues including the recently changed procedures for encoding
	printer and publisher information!Changed all q
	elements to quote elements, recognizing that anything that
	would otherwise be labelled q should be subsumed by sp. In
	addition, double quotation marks seem to be assumed as present
	before and after everything tagged as q. Therefore I've added
	this information into the previously empty tagsdecl section of
	the header. A proof-reader (or myself) should look for quote
	elements with no renditional information that are not
	surrounded by quotation marks in the text.Added missing
	surrounding div element to the second conversation. Currently,
	each conversation is encoded as a div type=chapter. These
	chapters are sometimes broken into multiple parts, encoded div
	type=part. This is not a correct label according to the markup
	docs, but I'm going to make sure the encoding is consistent
	before changing all type="part"'s to type="section". The
	markup docs suggest that it would be appropriate to create a
	type=conversation because these "chapters" are so-labelled by
	the text.</item>

	extensive list of errors -- more than the 200 that the
	validation program will display -- have deterred me from
	running supra. The file does not validate at this time,
	largely due to issues involving incorrect type attribute on
	lg's, various overlapping speech and quote elements, and an
	absence of a castlist in the hyperdiv.Created hyperdiv
	element inside of the outermost text element.Changed id
	values of text elements to discern between those which are
	subdivisions of the two-volume book and those which are poems
	embedded within text elements.Created a castlist inside
	of the hyperdiv with castitem and role elements for all
	characters as of now tagged as speaking with who= attribute on
	sp. Renamed the value of who= elements throughout the text to
	make the role ID's consistent with current
	practice.Revalidated using version 1.1.21a of WWP-store
	DTD. Errors now number less than 200 and all errors are due
	either to misnamed lg elements or to wrongly encoded

<lb/>without any intention of publishing it. I
<lb/>wished to find some short and simple pieces
<lb/>on subjects of Natural History, for the use
<lb/>of a child of five years old, who on her
<lb/>arrival in <placeName>England</placeName> could speak no <name>English</name>,
<lb/>and whose notice was particularly attracted
<lb/>by flowers and insects. Among the collec­
<lb/>tions avowedly made for the use of children,
<lb/>I met with very few verses that answered
<lb/>my purpose, and therefore I wrote two or
<lb/>three of the most puerile of the pieces that
<lb/>appear in these volumes. Some friends
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">A</mw>
<pb n="iv"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="A1v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">ii</mw>
<lb/>were pleased with them, as well as with the
<lb/>slight alterations I made in others already
<lb/>in their possession; and a near relation
<lb/>sent me several which she had composed on
<lb/>purpose, and one or two which had long
<lb/>lain in her port-folio. Thus encouraged,
<lb/>my collection insensibly increased. I grew
<lb/>fond of the work; and when it contained,
<lb/>as I imagined, enough to answer my origi­
<lb/>nal intention, I sent it up to be printed;
<lb/>but I found that there was not manuscript
<lb/>enough to make even a very small volume.
<lb/>I therefore undertook to enlarge the book
<lb/>by Conversations, but I suffered some bor­
<lb/>rowed and altered pieces to remain, which
<lb/>I should have taken out, had I known that
<lb/>I need not have retained them for want of
<lb/>a sufficient number of original composi­
<lb/>tions. Of this, however, I was not aware
<pb n="v"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="A2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">iii</mw>
<lb/>till the First Volume was arranged, and the
<lb/>prose written; and as my trespass on others
<lb/>has not been great, I trust it will be forgiven
<lb/>me. There are seven pieces not my own,
<lb/>some of them a little altered, to answer my
<lb/>first purpose of teaching a child to repeat
<lb/>them; and five of my own reprinted. Of
<lb/>the remainder, though the Relation to
<lb/>whom I am obliged objected to my distin­
<lb/>guishing them by any acknowledgment,
<lb/>it is necessary to say, that where my inter­
<lb/>locutors <emph>praise</emph> any Poem, the whole or the
<lb/>greater part of it is <emph>hers</emph>.
</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(1)break(yes)">It will very probably be observed, that the
<lb/>pieces towards the end of the Second Vo­
<lb/>lume are too long for mere children to
<lb/>learn to repeat, and too difficult for them
<lb/>to understand. It is, however, impossible
<lb/>to write any thing for a particular age;

<lb/>some children comprehend more at eight
<lb/>years old, than others do at twelve; but
<lb/>to those who have any knowledge of Geo­
<lb/>graphy or Mythology, or who have a taste
<lb/>for Botany, the two last pieces will not be
<lb/>found difficult. I confess, that in the progress

<lb/>that it was necessary to go continually to

<lb/>There are two sorts, I believe, of them; one is

                <p>No; but I do not think
<lb/>you would find so much satisfaction in it, as
<lb/>in letting your chafer enjoy his liberty, and
<lb/>wander from flower to flower, for they feed on
<lb/>several sorts. You might have found them on
<lb/>those beautiful <seg xml:id="a003" corresp="#n003">guelder roses</seg>, which you know
<lb/>were in bloom about a fortnight since in the
<lb/>shrubbery, but the trees were too high for you
<lb/>to see them creeping among the round white
<lb/>bunches of blossoms, which the servants and
<lb/>country people, aptly enough, call snow-balls.
<lb/>But there is an admirable description of these
<lb/>flowers in the poem of the Task, you know,
<lb/>which I read to you the other day. The
<lb/>Poet calls it a rose from the usual name, and
<lb/>describes it—

                <p>Apis mellifica, the common honey
<lb/>bee, is an insect of important use to mankind.
<lb/>A hive contains from 16,000 to 20,000 bees,
<lb/>of which one only is a female; of the rest, some
<lb/>are drones, but the greater part of them work­
<lb/>ing bees. On which last, the care of the young
<lb/>depend, as well as the making of honey,

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">31</mw>
<lb/>which they collect from almost every flower,
<lb/>while by a different process, they form the
<lb/>wax of the pollen of flowers, and build their hex­
<lb/>agon cells so regularly and neatly, that human
<lb/>art cannot imitate them. The eggs of the
<lb/>queen, or the only female bee, are laid in these,
<lb/>and each is then filled with honey: they have
<lb/>the art of extracting the nectar from almost all
<lb/>plants, even those which to us appear to have
<lb/>but little odour. The blossoms of the <seg xml:id="a016" corresp="#n016">heath</seg>,
<lb/>of thyme, of rosemary, and those of fruit trees,

                <p>There are many other sorts
<lb/>of bees, you know; and there are other in­
<lb/>sects, such as <seg xml:id="a017" corresp="#n017">wasps</seg> and 
<seg xml:id="a018" corresp="#n018">hornets</seg>, that resem­

<lb/>ingeniously the nests where they raise their
<lb/>young; but in elegance of taste, and delicacy
<lb/>of manners, these are very inferior. They
<lb/>live on fruit, meat, and even on other insects.
<lb/>The author, who writes under the name of
<lb/><persName>Hector St. John</persName>, an American farmer, relates
<lb/>that in <placeName>America</placeName>, it is very common to sus­
<lb/>pend an hornet's nest in the middle of the
<lb/>ceiling of a room where the family live, that
<lb/>these insects may relieve them from the great
<lb/>number of flies with which the houses are in­
<lb/>fested, and that it is usual for the hornets to
<lb/>settle on the faces of children, with no other
<lb/>intention than to carry away the flies; while
<lb/>the children accustomed to them express no
<lb/>fear, and never are stung. These hornets, and
<lb/>their near relations, the wasps, are great ene­

<lb/>mies of the bees, not only by stealing their
<lb/>honey, but because they kill the industrious
<lb/>labourers themselves. In the vast woods of
<lb/><placeName>America</placeName> there are wild bees that make great
<lb/>quantities of honey in the hollows of trees,
<lb/>and the settlers and <name>Indians</name> are guided to
<lb/>these treasures by a bird, who knows where
<lb/>they are deposited. There are many other
<lb/>particulars, which at some future time we
<lb/>will collect. At present our business is with
<lb/>the honey-bee of our own country.</p>

                <p>Your remark is perfectly
<lb/>just, my son; and you see, that read properly,
<lb/>there is a false quantity in the line. But such
<lb/>licences are now very frequently taken in

<lb/>relax in the severity of our criticism, and re­

                <p>And a very likely place is
<lb/>the old room at the end of the green-house;
<lb/>I have hardly ever failed to meet with several
<lb/>sorts there; and as early as last <name>March</name>, I
<lb/>found one of the most beautiful and delicate
<lb/>of English butterflies. Probably the next night's
<lb/>frost killed it, for on the following day I could
<lb/>not find it, and if it had got out, it would have
<lb/>found no flowers to feed on, for the weather
<lb/>afterwards became very severe. However, there
<lb/>is a yellow butterfly, with dark iron coloured
<lb/>spots, and pointed wings, which is frequently
<lb/>seen abroad before the common cabbage-fly,
<lb/>so usual and so destructive in gardens, is hardy

<lb/>enough to venture. When I was very young,
<lb/>I was very fond of catching butterflies, to
<lb/>paint from nature, but I was soon disgusted
<lb/>with the attempt to kill them. It appeared
<lb/>so cruel, to impale an insect on a pin, and let
<lb/>it flutter for hours, and even days in misery,
<lb/>that I could never bear to do it. I was after­
<lb/>wards shewn how to kill them immediately,
<lb/>by pouring a drop of æther on their heads;
<lb/>but I thought I had no right to deprive one
<lb/>of these beautiful creatures of their short exis­
<lb/>tence, which in some sorts lasts only a day.
<lb/>And therefore I contented myself with copy­
<lb/>ing from flies in collections already made.
<lb/>There are some of these insects in the <placeName>East
<lb/>and West Indies</placeName>, of a very large size and the

<lb/>while the weather was so very hot, I went up
<lb/>stairs into your book-closet with a wax taper;
<lb/>the window was open, and I put the candle
<lb/>down on your table under it, when in an in­

<lb/>it that it was put out; which was fortunate
<lb/>enough for the rest, at least for a little time,
<lb/>since they seemed determined to be burnt to
<lb/>death. However, as I wanted a book which I

<lb/>candle, and in an instant the foolish insects
<lb/>were trying which could singe itself first. I
<lb/>remember thinking then, that they were like

<lb/>of them, even after they were singed, flew
<lb/>back into the candle.</p>

<lb/>less more was known of the popular supersti­
<lb/>tion of their country. But chimeras equally
<lb/>wild and absurd have often been entertained
<lb/>by persons, who have the advantage of living
<lb/>in countries where knowledge is more univer­
<lb/>sally diffused. Some particular noises, though
<lb/>they can easily be accounted for, have appalled
<lb/>persons of reason and courage; and as you re­
<lb/>member I told you, when were talking of
<lb/>the hedge-hog, that some animals and birds
<lb/>are thought by the illiterate country people to
<lb/>be unlucky and to betoken misfortune. I

                <p>Assuredly not. It is not by
<lb/>such means that a foreknowledge of events
<lb/>would be communicated. I knew another
<lb/>poor woman, who lost half her time in wait­
<lb/>ing for <soCalled>lucky</soCalled> days, and made it a rule never
<lb/>to begin any work, write a letter on busi­
<lb/>ness, or set out on a journey on a <name>Friday</name>:
<lb/>so her business was never done, and her fortune
<lb/>suffered accordingly. It would have been
<lb/>much wiser for her to have considered, that
<lb/>every day is lucky in which we possess strength
<lb/>of mind and body to do our duty, in whatever
<lb/>line of life we are placed; and that persons

                <p>I was reading in some voyage
<lb/>that the sea is sometimes all bright with light,
<lb/>something like that of the glow-worm, and
<lb/>that it was supposed to be occasioned by sea
<lb/>insects.</p>

                <p>Many different opinions
<lb/>have arisen as to that appearance. Some have
<lb/>thought the light owing, as you say, to sea in­
<lb/>sects, and others to a degree of putridity;
<lb/>because whiting, and some other fish which
<lb/>are in a state of decay, shine if taken into a
<lb/>dark room. But there may be other causes.
<lb/>It has happened in particular states of the air
<lb/>at sea, that phosphoric lights have been seen
<lb/>on the rigging and masts of ships; and on the
<lb/>land such phenomena are not very unfrequent.
<lb/>A gentleman and his servants were once riding
<lb/>up one of the high <placeName>Sussex</placeName> downs in a gloomy
<lb/>or rather stormy evening in Autumn, and on
<lb/>a sudden the servant, who followed his master,
<pb n="53"/>

<lb/>cried out in extreme terror that his horse's
<lb/>ears and mane were on fire. The master, a

<lb/>on, <said>Don't <choice><sic>h</sic><corr>b</corr></choice>e frightened, <persName>Thomas</persName>, for my
<lb/>horse's ears and mane are on fire too.</said> And
<lb/>in fact the fire continued wavering about for
<lb/>some time, and was probably of the same na­
<lb/>ture as those wandering fires which are called
<lb/>igneus fatuus; and seem to have been always
<lb/>known under the names of Will-with-the
<lb/>wisp, Jacko'-lanthorn, or the friar's-lanthorn.
<lb/>Though <persName>Dr. Darwin</persName> says, he has travelled in

<lb/>less of this extraordinary quality; while the
<lb/>more robust of the genera do not possess it at
<lb/>all. There is one sort which bears no flower
<lb/>in this country, and is of so very frail a tex­
<lb/>ture, that the approach of an insect, or the
<lb/>breathings of the air, cause its leaves imme­
<lb/>diately to fall, and fold over each other. Your

<lb/>I met him this morning on horseback: he was
<lb/>smarter than ever, with leather breeches, boots,
<lb/>and a <distinct>knowing</distinct> coat, which he desired me to
<lb/>admire, as well as his horse, which his father,
<lb/>he said, had just purchased for him, that he
<lb/>might sport a <distinct>figure</distinct> and cut a <distinct>dash</distinct> at the

<lb/>had two servants with him, with whom he
<lb/>had been betting, he said, on the horses that

<lb/>have lent me his old poney.</p>

                <p>Certainly; a strict adherence
<lb/>to truth is the basis of every other good qua­

<lb/>exist. But while the truth should be our first

<lb/>superior to most other boys, that I sometimes

                <p>They never think about poor

<lb/>with every luxury about them, and how others
<lb/>fared they were never taught to consider. Self-

<lb/>while they fly about from one place to another

<lb/>toil these flashing men could not exist, are
<lb/>wholly overlooked. I do not mean however

<lb/>position that is rather gaining ground. How­
<lb/>ever, since we can do but little, <persName>Emily</persName>, to
<lb/>amend them, let us endeavour to correct our
<lb/>own faults, and we shall seldom want employ­
<lb/>ment, if we candidly examine ourselves. And
<lb/>now while <persName>George</persName> is gone to poor <persName>Jack</persName>, let us
<lb/>read these two little poems on two favourite
<lb/>early flowers. The first I wrote, as I now re­
<lb/>collect, when, after having been some time in
<lb/>town, I went in Spring to pass a few days at a
<lb/>place, where in my early years I had lived fre­
<lb/>quently for two or three months at a time, with
<lb/>some young people of nearly my own age.
<lb/>We had made gardens of our own, as you and
<lb/>your brothers and sisters do now, and planted
<lb/>several flowers. After a long absence, I once
<lb/>more revisited the spot; it had been converted
<lb/>into a yard to dry the household linen; yet
<lb/>among the grass with which our former par­
<lb/>terres was now covered, and notwithstanding the
<lb/>frequent inroads of pattens and bucking baskets,
<lb/>a few of our former favourites raised their heads
<lb/>here and there among the posts and lines. The
<lb/><seg xml:id="a049" corresp="#n049">yellow hellebore</seg> and the 
<seg xml:id="a050" corresp="#n050">snow-drop</seg> were the
<lb/>most remarkable. The latter of these, you
<lb/>know, is indigenous in this country, and often

<lb/>grows spontaneously on the edges of fields and
<lb/>in extensive orchards, whitening the ground
<lb/>with its elegant drooping blossom. It is sup­
<lb/>posed that the roots, if boiled and treated like
<lb/>those of the <seg xml:id="a051" corresp="#n051">orchis</seg>, of which saloop is made,
<lb/>would be equally nutritious; but at present
<lb/>its greatest merit seems to be in its delicate
<lb/>white petals, those within being elegantly
<lb/>veined with green; and its early appearance, as
<lb/>the advanced guard, if I may use a military
<lb/>expression, of the loveliest productions of nature,
<lb/>and as announcing, though yet at a distance,
<lb/>the approach of the loveliest season of the year.</p>

<lb/>waited to hear what <persName>Mr. Grant</persName>, the Apothe­

<lb/>thought of him. And as I remained there, I
<lb/>saw two of those large bees, which we call
<lb/>humble bees, go into a small hole in the ground.
<lb/>They seemed to unload themselves just as the
<lb/>honey bees do; for one of them came out
<lb/>again while I remained there, without that
<lb/>yellow meally substance on his thighs which
<lb/>I saw when he went in, and which I suppose
<lb/>is the material with which the cells are made;
<lb/>and therefore I thought these humble bees
<lb/>might have in some hollow place in the bank,

<lb/>of what we call humble bees—the apis ter­
<lb/>restris or earth bee, and the apis nemorum or
<lb/>wood bee, and some others; but those two are,
<lb/>I believe, the commonest sorts, and the first
<lb/>is what you saw go into his subterraneous
<lb/>house. As they appear as busy as the common
<lb/>honey bee, and to collect the nectar and the
<lb/>pollen of flowers in the same manner, it is
<lb/>probable that their habits are nearly the same;

<lb/>yet I never recollect having heard that their

<lb/>are known to frequent. And it was on the
<lb/>supposition that they were not equally provi­
<lb/>dent with their congeners, the honey bee, that,
<lb/>as a lesson of industry and forecast, the verses
<lb/>were composed which I am going to repeat.
<lb/>They were written for a little girl, who had
<lb/>expressed great curiosity on this subject. Af­
<lb/>ter all, however, it is probable that my moral
<lb/>is given at the expence of the humble bee's

                <p>Beyond comparison. The
<lb/><placeName>Forest of Orleans</placeName> covered many leagues, and
<lb/>is still very extensive, though not of its former
<lb/>magnitude. There are other forests in <placeName>France</placeName>
<lb/>of immense extent, though many, and espe­
<lb/>cially those that were appropriated to the
<lb/>amusement of the King and Princes of the
<lb/>blood and nobility, as hunting grounds, are
<lb/>much lessened since the revolution. And as
<lb/>the people of <placeName>France</placeName> use no other fuel than

<lb/>a succession by carefully planting and pre­

<lb/>possessed with a notion that coal is unwhole­
<lb/>some. The woods of <placeName>Germany</placeName>, many of
<lb/>which are of oak, cover immense portions of
<lb/>the country, and feed very great droves of
<lb/>swine. But even these, and the pine forests
<lb/>of <placeName>Sweden</placeName>, <placeName>Russia</placeName>, and <placeName>Norway</placeName>, are described
<lb/>as being inferior in extent and magnificence
<lb/>to the stupendous forests of <placeName>America</placeName>, which,

<lb/>still cover unmeasured extents of country, and

<lb/>attack man, unless trod upon, or otherwise
<lb/>provoked: when they move, the horny rings
<lb/>in their tails, falling over each other, make a
<lb/>kind of tinkling sound, which gives notice of
<lb/>their approach; but the rattle-snake is, you
<lb/>know, said to possess the power of fascination;
<lb/>so that if a bird, a mouse, or squirrel, once
<lb/>sees the creature fix its eyes upon it, the
<lb/>wretched animal, perfectly conscious of the
<lb/>fatal attraction, cannot escape, but, as if be­
<lb/>witched, it is impelled to approach its enemy,
<lb/>and it comes nearer and nearer, still uttering
<lb/>cries of distress and terror, till the jaws of the
<lb/>monster close upon it. It has sometimes
<lb/>seemed to me, that there are people exactly in
<lb/>the case of the animal thus fascinated by the
<lb/>rattle-snake. How often does one see that a

                <p>It is rather prejudice against
<lb/>them from their ugliness, than any real in­
<lb/>jury they do, that causes these reptiles to be
<lb/>so generally persecuted; and I much doubt

<lb/>on the gardener's cucumbers, or injure their
<lb/>roots. <seg xml:id="a065" corresp="#n065">Vipers</seg> are dangerous; and I once
<lb/>saw an instance of a boy being severely bitten

                <p>There is another sort too, a great

<lb/>an evening, heard as it usually is in solitary
<lb/>and remote places near water, where it in­
<lb/>habits: the grasshopper is a dweller among
<lb/>meadows, and is of the same species as the
<lb/>cicada, those little creatures which, when you
<lb/>are walking in the grass, seem to fly some
<lb/>yards before you. Of this race are the insects
<lb/>called Cicala, in <placeName>Italy</placeName>, and other warm coun­
<lb/>tries, whose chirping is at some seasons so
<lb/>loud, as to be very annoying, and who are so
<lb/>voracious as often to strip the shrubs and trees
<lb/>of their leaves at a very early period of the
<lb/>Italian Summer.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(1)break(yes)">To this family, the grilli and cicada, also
<lb/>belongs the <seg xml:id="a067" corresp="#n067">locust</seg>; which has covered whole
<lb/>countries as with a cloud, and carried famine
<lb/>and desolation with it wherever their terrific
<lb/>hosts have settled, eating up every green leaf
<lb/>and blade of grass, and even the thatch of the
<lb/>houses, and every vegetable substance they
<lb/>alighted upon. But fortunately they never
<lb/>find their way to these northern regions. And
<lb/>see, <persName>George</persName>, here is another insect, which in
<lb/>this country is only of very trifling inconve­
<lb/>nience to the husbandman or the gardener,
<lb/>but in some parts of the world is so destructive,
<lb/>as to inflict ruin on those whose property it

<lb/>seizes upon: I mean the ant. Look at that
<lb/>brown hillock under the trees, it seems all alive
<lb/>and in motion. It is formed by the <seg xml:id="a068" corresp="#n068">horse or
<lb/>wood-ant</seg>, one of the largest of a numerous
<lb/>species, some of which are as industrious,
<lb/>though less useful than bees. But in the <placeName>West
<lb/>Indies</placeName> such immense swarms of the <seg xml:id="a069" corresp="#n069">black ant</seg>
<lb/>have sometimes appeared, that the ground for

                <p>Certainly they are of use,

<lb/>Of these little creatures just before us, who
<lb/>are so busy, some in carrying those straws,
<lb/>and others white substances about, the first
<lb/>are providing a place for the reception and
<lb/>security of the young, while some are carry­
<lb/>ing the young themselves; but their toil will
<lb/>probably be rendered in a great degree use­
<lb/>less, for the pheasants, with which these
<lb/>woods abound, find in these insects a prin­
<lb/>cipal article of their food, and devour great
<lb/>quantities whenever they can meet with them.
<lb/>The black game, and all other fowls of that
<lb/>sort, as well as many smaller birds, also eat
<lb/>them; and the good housewives send children
<lb/>into the woods to collect the pupa, or what

                <p>It is that large black butterfly,

<lb/>which I saw in the garden yesterday.</p>

                <speaker>Mrs. Talbot</speaker>
                <p>The same; but perhaps I
<lb/>have not been altogether correct in my poe­
<lb/>tical history, insomuch as I have described
<lb/>the butterfly as emerging from the retreat it
<lb/>had chosen during the cold months; but it is
<lb/>more probable that the individual insect in
<lb/>question has been produced this Summer.
<lb/>For the progress of this species I understand
<lb/>to be, that a few that have passed the incle­
<lb/>ment season in the chrysalis state, are seen on
<lb/>the wing early in <name>May</name>; soon after which the
<lb/>female lays her eggs singly on the leaves of
<lb/>nettles. The caterpillar, immediately on
<lb/>being hatched, sews the leaf on which it finds
<lb/>itself round it like a case; the effect of won­
<lb/>derful instinct, to preserve itself from a par­
<lb/>ticular species of fly called the ichneumon,
<lb/>which otherwise would destroy it, by deposit­
<lb/>ing its eggs in the soft body of the caterpillar.
<lb/>But, as the caterpillar must have food as well
<lb/>as shelter, it feeds on the tender part of this
<pb n="111"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">111</mw>
<lb/>covering, till the leaf becomes in too ruinous
<lb/>a state to be longer inhabited; then crawling
<lb/>to another, it again wraps itself up; and this
<lb/>happens till it is nearly full grown, and so
<lb/>much increased in size, that one leaf will not
<lb/>serve it both for food and raiment. It there­
<lb/>fore becomes more ambitious, and reaching
<lb/>the top of the nettle, connects several leaves
<lb/>together to make its house, and supply its
<lb/>appetite; till being at length full grown, it
<lb/>suspends itself from a leaf, and puts on the
<lb/>armour that nature directs it to assume before
<lb/>its last and complete state of existence, which
<lb/>happens in sixteen or twenty days, according
<lb/>to the temperature of the air. Then the ugly
<lb/>deformed caterpillar is metamorphosed into
<lb/>the beautiful butterfly, one of which by some
<lb/>singular chance I found to-day.

<lb/>of the happiness we hoped to be enjoying in

<lb/>you is surely not worth thinking of, since your

                <p>My children, I am the more
<lb/>earnest with you on this occasion, as I so well
<lb/>recollect with regret, how ill I bore disap­
<lb/>pointment myself, when I was a girl, and how
<lb/>frequently I was weak enough on such occa­
<lb/>sions to lose my own temper, and try that of
<lb/>the good aunt whose care I was under. A
<lb/>rainy day when I was promised a long walk,
<lb/>or to pass the morning with any favourite
<lb/>play-fellow, seemed then to be a misfortune
<lb/>which was not to be endured. I remember
<lb/>that a party of ladies who lived at some dis­
<lb/>tance, and with whom my family were on
<pb n="116"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">116</mw>
<lb/>terms of ceremonious visiting, happened to
<lb/>arrive one morning just as I was eagerly setting
<lb/>out to see the river fished, that ran through
<lb/>the grounds, and about the sport it would
<lb/>afford, I had heard a great deal for some days
<lb/>before. Every body was gone but my aunt
<lb/>and I; and already I had heard by the boys
<lb/>and people that were running backwards and
<lb/>forwards, of the great pike that had been taken,
<lb/>and the quantity of fine fish they expected.
<lb/>The ladies, I thought, need not detain me, as
<lb/>I could not amuse them, and was sure they
<lb/>could not amuse me; so I was earnestly soli­
<lb/>citing leave to go, and had nearly obtained it,
<lb/>when they all entered the room, and with
<lb/>them a girl of my own age, who was at home
<lb/>for the holidays, and whom her mother brought
<lb/>to exhibit, as she was remarkably accom­
<lb/>plished for her age; and I believe it was in­
<lb/>tended to mortify my aunt by the comparison.
<lb/>The little <soCalled>Miss</soCalled> was formally introduced to me,
<lb/>and no hope remained of my seeing the river
<lb/>fished; I ought, you know, to have made
<lb/>light of such a trifling deprivation, and have
<lb/>been civil to my visitor. Instead of that I was
<lb/>silent, and I am afraid sullen; while she dis­
<pb n="117"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">117</mw>
<lb/>played all her acquirements; played on the
<lb/>piano forte, sung a fashionable air, shewed a
<lb/>new pas grave, which her dancing-master had
<lb/>lately introduced, and desired with an air of
<lb/>triumph to see my drawings, which when I
<lb/>was obliged by authority to fetch, she turned
<lb/>over in a mighty negligent way, as not likely
<lb/>to be worth her criticism; and the elder ladies
<lb/>hardly deigned to look at them; <persName>Lady Prunely</persName>
<lb/>gravely assuring my aunt, that a much better
<lb/>method was now adopted than that which I
<lb/>seemed to have been taught by. My patience
<lb/>was now quite exhausted; and all this affront­
<lb/>ing parade of superiority as I then thought
<lb/>it, operating upon my mind embittered by
<lb/>disappointment, I forgot every thing but my
<lb/>extreme desire to escape from society I did
<lb/>not like, to an amusement particularly pleasing
<lb/>to me. Under pretence therefore of carrying
<lb/>away my drawing book, I hurried as fast as I
<lb/>could to the river, where my brothers were
<lb/>highly enjoying themselves, while the men in
<lb/>dresses on purpose waded into the shallow
<lb/>water, and threw quantities of fish on the
<lb/>banks. My eagerness was not exceeded by
<lb/>that of the boys, in the midst of whom I was
<pb n="118"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">118</mw>
<lb/>presently busy in putting the fish into baskets
<lb/>to be carried to the ponds; and in despite of
<lb/>my maid's lectures that morning about my
<lb/>white frocks and petticoats, I was as deep in
<lb/>the mud as the boys themselves, when my
<lb/>persecutors, <persName>Lady Prunely</persName>, her elegant daugh­
<lb/>ter, and the whole party appeared, and a
<lb/>message was sent to me to join them imme­
<lb/>diately, as they could not think of approaching
<lb/>very near on account of the dirt. Most un­
<lb/>willingly I attempted to obey; but there were
<lb/>several nets that had been thrown on the bank;
<lb/>in one of them I became entangled, and en­
<lb/>deavouring impatiently to disengage myself,
<lb/>I fell among the mud and weeds with which
<lb/>the bank was covered; and a more deplorable
<lb/>object than I appeared when I recovered my
<lb/>feet cannot be imagined. I escaped an heavy
<lb/>censure at that moment, because I was not in
<lb/>a condition to approach the nice group who
<lb/>beheld my disgrace, as they thought it, with
<lb/>horror and amazement. But <persName>Lady Prunely</persName>,
<lb/>who had an high opinion of her own sagacity
<lb/>and superior knowledge, took that opportunity
<lb/>to advise my aunt very seriously to send me

                <p rend="first-indent(1)break(yes)">This advice, though it was given in the

<lb/>latitudes. Nor is this a luxury unattended
<lb/>with extensive benefit; for great numbers of
<lb/>people are supported by the culture, not in­
<lb/>deed of exotics, and rare plants, for that
<lb/>branch of gardening, however great its present

<lb/>Roses blown by artificial heat are more delicate

<lb/>their scent be more exquisite, and indeed I
<lb/>doubt it; but they are usually more free from
<lb/>blight, and those insects which sometimes
<lb/>destroy our garden roses. Since we are upon
<lb/>this subject, I will repeat to you a little poem
<lb/>written some years ago by your aunt, in
<lb/>which the effect of the culture of the rose by
<lb/>artificial heat is represented, as being like

                <p>I will endeavour to explain
<lb/>it as well as I can. It is a very usual figure in
<lb/>modern poetry; and has, in many instances,
<lb/>superseded the use of the imaginary Deities
<lb/>of the Heathen Mythology, where love was
<lb/>called <persName>Cupid</persName>, you know; beauty was <persName>Venus</persName>;
<lb/>and wisdom <persName>Minerva</persName> or <persName>Pallas</persName>, and so on;
<lb/>but now a Poet <term>personifies</term> the virtue, vice, or
<pb n="132"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">132</mw>
<lb/>passion he would represent. <persName>Collins's</persName> poetry
<lb/>is full of those bold figures. Mercy is called
<quote><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l rend="align(center)">Gentlest of sky-born forms, and best ador'd.</l></lg></quote>
<lb/>And Fear is admirably pourtrayed, as well as
<lb/>many other human passions: and it is
<lb/>common to <term>apostrophise</term>, or for the Poet to
<lb/><term>address</term> himself to one of those imaginary
<lb/>passions or virtues, as in <persName>Smollett's</persName> <title>Ode to
<lb/>Independence</title>, and many others. Scenes of
<lb/>Nature are often personified. Thus <persName>Gray</persName>,
<lb/>you may remember, <persName>George</persName>, addresses him­
<lb/>self to <quote>Father <placeName>Thames</placeName>,</quote> in one of the verses
<lb/>of his beautiful <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Ode on a Distant Prospect
<lb/>of <orgName>Eton College</orgName>.</title> However, we will have
<lb/>a farther dissertation on this another day;
<lb/>I have at present said enough, I believe,
<lb/><persName>Emily</persName>, to make you comprehend what is
<lb/>meant by <term>personification</term>. And now attend to
<lb/>the pleadings of Nature and Art, on the im­
<lb/>provement bestowed by the latter on the
<lb/>darling production of the former.

                <p>You may call it both. It is
<lb/>the history of a bird. I told your aunt in one
<lb/>of my letters, that animals, and insects, and
<lb/>plants, had been celebrated in the verses of
<lb/>our book, but that it was not yet enriched
<lb/>with one bird. She has, therefore, sent you
<lb/>an account of a favourite Robin, and added
<lb/>a little Poem, which I am sure you will be
<lb/>pleased with. <persName>George</persName> shall read it. There
<lb/>have been so many verses written about this
<lb/>bird, which used to be held sacred to the
<lb/>household gods, that it was not very easy to
<lb/>give these any novelty. But the subject of
<lb/>them was highly interesting.—This is what

<lb/>month of <name>August</name>, a Robin frequented the
<lb/>drawing-room at <placeName>B.</placeName> and became in the
<lb/>course of the Winter so tame, that as soon
<lb/>as the windows were open in the morning he
<lb/>used to come in, and seemed to consider it as
<pb n="141"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">141</mw>
<lb/>his domicile, though he always roosted
<lb/>among the shrubs near the window. On
<lb/>being called, he readily made his appearance,
<lb/>and used to sit and sing at the back of a chair,
<lb/>or on the pianoforte. He was a constant
<lb/>attendant at the breakfast table, and expected
<lb/>to be fed like a domestic animal; for when
<lb/>we went out for a few days, he resorted to
<lb/>the offices, and followed the servants into the
<lb/>larder. My pretty Robin, however, was a
<lb/>very <name>Turk</name> in disposition, and would suffer
<lb/>no Brother near the Throne; for he drove
<lb/>away, with every mark of resentment, any
<lb/>of his compatriots, who during the hard
<lb/>weather shewed any inclination to share the
<lb/>advantages he had appropriated to himself;
<lb/>of which indeed he seemed to feel all the
<lb/>value, for as winter advanced, he became so
<lb/>familiar as to sit and sing on my daughter's
<lb/>shoulder, and appeared to have totally lost
<lb/>all the apprehensions of a wild bird. If he
<lb/>chose to go out, instead of beating himself
<lb/>against the window, he sat on the edge of
<lb/>the frame till it was opened for him; or
<lb/>taking an opportunity when the door was
<lb/>open, he flew through the green-house or
<pb n="142"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">142</mw>
<lb/>through the passages, till he found his way
<lb/>out. He was a great favourite as well in the
<lb/>kitchen, as in the parlour: and it was with
<lb/>general regret, that early in the Spring he
<lb/>was missed, and never returned. Had he
<lb/>retired to build, as Robins are said to do, in
<lb/>woods and copses, he would not have gone
<lb/>far from the house, around which there were
<lb/>so many thickets and shrubs, and where it
<lb/>is probable he was bred. It is therefore most
<lb/>likely, that being so tame and fearless, he
<lb/>was destroyed by a cat.</quote>

                <p>It is an old-fashioned ex­

<lb/>of the ornaments of her youth, and who used

<lb/>on a foliole, or part of the leaf armed with

<lb/>in its cup, or flower; partly by the construc­

<lb/>entangled, and partly by the viscid quality of
<lb/>the honey-like substance that attracts them.
<lb/>This curious Apocynum, which is not so com­

                <p>I allow that the beauty of the
<lb/>country is greatly injured, yet it is only in very
<lb/>hot summers that in <placeName>England</placeName> the verdure of
<lb/>the fields is so entirely gone as we now see it.
<lb/>Sometimes, as in the year <date when="1799">1799</date>, perpetual rain
<lb/>renders the country in <name>August</name> as green as it
<lb/>usually is in <name>May</name>. But the effect of this is far

<lb/>from desirable. I then saw from one of the
<lb/><placeName>Sussex</placeName> hills many hundred acres of wheat, and
<lb/>other grain, covered with water. The rivers
<lb/>overflowed, and swept away the produce of
<lb/>whole farms; and the sad consequence was,
<lb/>a scarcity of bread, amounting almost to
<lb/>famine; a deprivation most severely felt, par­
<lb/>ticularly among the poor, who, though assisted
<lb/>by subscriptions, were unable to purchase
<lb/>enough for the support of their families, so that
<lb/>sickness soon followed, and a long train of evils.
<lb/>Let us, therefore, learn to thank God for this
<lb/>fine weather, and let us see with pleasure and
<lb/>gratitude the last load of wheat carried by,
<lb/>dressed with boughs by the little peasant boys,
<lb/>who are mounted upon it, hallooing and
<lb/>rejoicing, while the men and women who have
<lb/>been employed in reaping, binding, and carry­
<lb/>ing it, are enjoying by anticipation the harvest
<lb/>supper; and look forward with still more
<lb/>satisfaction, to the certainty of having bread
<lb/>for their children during the ensuing winter.</p>

                <p>I admire your reason. But
<lb/>the fact is not exactly so. The corn in the
<lb/>northern provinces of <placeName>France</placeName>, la récolte, le
<lb/>moisson, is not gathered much, if at all, earlier
<lb/>than ours in <placeName>England</placeName>; and there are no olive
<lb/>trees in those provinces, and very few grapes;
<lb/>I mean comparatively. There are more, and
<lb/>better grapes than in <placeName>England</placeName>, but the wine
<lb/>is little worth, and very little of it is made.
<lb/>The peasantry of <placeName>Normandy</placeName> are content with
<lb/>le bon cidre; and it is indeed excellent.</p>

                <p>In some of those, as in the

                <p>Yes, they are fed by a bread,
<lb/>or paste, made of what we call <seg xml:id="a114" corresp="#n114">Spanish ches­
<lb/>nuts</seg>, which I am assured is no contemptible
<lb/>substitute. The wheat they have, however, is
<lb/>ripe much earlier than with us. The olives
<lb/>are a late harvest; and the grapes of which

<milestone unit="sig" n="P2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">160</mw>
<lb/>wine is made, are never gathered until after
<lb/>the first frosts. The colour of the wine depends
<lb/>on the simplest circumstances, as whether the
<lb/>dew is on or off the grapes when they are
<lb/>carried to the press. But I have not time now,
<lb/>my dear children, to tell you the little, that
<lb/>books have told me on these matters; one day
<lb/>or other, perhaps, if ever <placeName>France</placeName> should be

                <p>I believe it is neither beau­
<lb/>tiful individually as a tree, or when grouped;
<lb/>it is grey, and pale like the willow, but without
<lb/>the silver lined leaves or flexible branches of
<lb/>the aquatic. The most beautiful things are
<lb/>not always the most useful. The history of
<lb/>the olive tree is worthy, however, of further

<lb/>or wood-pigeon, which you hear make a plea­
<lb/>sant, but somewhat melancholy noise during
<lb/>the summer, and particularly towards its close;
<lb/>but in <name>September</name> they leave their woodland

<lb/>the rich, and those who follow the rich, either

<lb/>made the necessary articles of life so extrava­
<lb/>gantly dear, that persons of moderate fortune
<lb/>are obliged to give up frequenting them, even

<lb/>that in inferior places a great deal is extorted
<lb/>for bad things, and at a considerable one for
<lb/>good things. And those who cannot afford
<lb/>the expense must make up their minds to stay

<lb/>them many little enjoyments, that might a few
<lb/>years ago have been allowed to the children of
<lb/>persons in the middle rank of life without im­

<lb/>they are now. It is therefore very material,

                <p>Cottages and castles too,
<lb/><persName>George</persName>, are often built with great pleasure in
<lb/>the air; but when reason is called in, our
<lb/>beautiful fabrics tumble to the ground, and

                <p>And is it not the same thing,
<lb/>Mamma, in regard to people? You said,
<lb/>I remember, one day, that one evil of those
<lb/>books which <persName>Miss Levingstone</persName> is so fond of
<lb/>reading, was, that the authors represented
<lb/>such characters as did not exist in the world,
<lb/>and that made young people who read them,
<lb/>discontented with those that really live in the
<lb/>world.</p>

                <p>I believe I did say something
<lb/>like that, <persName>Emily</persName>; but those characters are
<lb/>often drawn to show us what we <emph>should</emph> be:
<lb/>and if, instead of expecting to find perfect
<lb/>characters in others, each person endeavoured
<lb/>to correct his or her own faults, the per­
<lb/>sonages of real life would oftener than they do
<lb/>approach those that novelists describe as per­
<lb/>fect. It is very rare that any one is called
<lb/>upon to exert all the heroism, which is often
<lb/>given in these books to the principal charac­
<lb/>ters; but it is in every one's power to think
<lb/>justly, and act with integrity and firmness,
<lb/>and at least to command themselves.</p>

<lb/>heroes and heroines in those books, but I hope
<lb/>there are none so wicked and so foolish as
<lb/>some of the other characters. I took up a

<lb/>at <persName>Ellis's</persName>, while he was looking out some paper,
<lb/>and there was a character in it of a Sir Some­

<lb/>some countries, while in others they are not

<lb/>time in <name>August</name>; and now they are almost out
<lb/>of season, and you see the traps are not set.
<lb/>Their nests are made under stones, or pieces
<lb/>of rock, among rough ground, but these nests
<lb/>are not often found; and therefore some
<lb/>people have supposed, as the greatest number
<lb/>of them are seen about these <placeName>Sussex</placeName> downs,
<lb/>which you know are, except some part of
<lb/><placeName>Kent</placeName>, the nearest of any part of <placeName>England</placeName> to the

<lb/>to breed, and go back again in winter, be­

<lb/>circular trenches, in the midst of which a pile

<lb/>are called slake. There are names to all the

are fa­

<lb/> of the chelcidonium, the horned sea-poppy,
<lb/>and here is a specimen of it, still in flower:
<lb/>you see on breaking a part of its stalk, there is
<lb/>a yellow juice exudes from it, just as it does
<lb/>from the celendine, of which it is a species.
<lb/>The convolvulus soldinella
is more rare, but
<lb/>extremely beautiful, and grows in some places
<lb/>almost close to the sea, among the sand. There
<lb/>also grows the 
eryngium maritimum, the sea

<lb/>shoot them with small pins. One attempt,
<lb/>however, to bring an humming bird living to
<lb/><placeName>England</placeName> was made some years ago by an
<lb/>Officer of the Artillery. He fed it with sugar,

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">40</mw>
<lb/>and actually succeeded in keeping it alive till
<lb/>he reached the residence of the late Duchess
<lb/>of <placeName>Richmond</placeName>, for whom he designed it: but
<lb/>though he had preserved its fragile life so far,
<lb/>it expired on the very instant he was present­
<lb/>ing it to the Duchess.</p>

                <p>It was very disappointing,
<lb/>though probably no care could long have
<lb/>preserved it in this climate. The reason, how­

<lb/>your aunt, in a packet I received from her
<lb/>this morning, has sent me a very elegant little
<lb/>poem on the plumed beauty, which was com­
<lb/>posed after reading an account of the various
<lb/>productions of some parts of the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>;
<lb/>and where, among the ornaments of its native
<lb/>inhabitants, the bright feathers, minute as
<lb/>they are, of this bird, sometimes make a part.
<lb/>Uncertain of the day of her arrival, she sent

<lb/>placed. You have considerable talents, other­
<lb/>wise I should not desire you to give up much
<lb/>time to the pursuit: but I know you have
<lb/>that disposition towards it, which is usually
<lb/>called genius; and therefore perseverance,
<lb/>and attention to rules, will very soon enable

<lb/>should still be desirous of your studying the

<lb/>student, and awakens him to a thousand
<lb/>beauties which common observers do not see,
<lb/>or see without pleasure. The gradations of
<lb/>light and shade; the colours that Nature so
<lb/>harmoniously employs; the beautiful forms
<lb/>of trees, and the various effects, sometimes
<lb/>magnificent, sometimes lovely, which are pro­
<lb/>duced by the simple materials she works with,
<lb/>Earth, Water, and Wood; the tender hues
<lb/>and evanescent forms of the clouds, all afford,
<lb/>to persons who know how to view them with
<lb/>a painter's eye, the enjoyment of what I may
<lb/>call a new sense, unknown to those who have
<lb/>not a natural or an acquired taste for such
<lb/>studies. A rude and uncultivated waste, such

<lb/>parent beauty in the eyes of commom ob­

<lb/>to be rejoiced in, if they conceal from persons

<lb/>stowed on him by the charitable, to purchase
<lb/>something like finery, a frill to his shirt, or a

                <p>Well! but that description
<lb/>does not of course enumerate the varieties of
<lb/>different species of birds. Of thrushes, for
<lb/>example, there are four or five sorts. I left
<lb/>you this morning with a promise to consider
<lb/>of some other subjects for our little Poems;
<lb/>and I began to recollect what was most likely
<lb/>to answer our purpose. The nightingale has
<lb/>been sung in every language of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, even
<lb/>to satiety; and you know there are innu­
<lb/>merable verses, and fables in <name>English</name> and
<lb/><name>French</name>, relating to the nightingale; and there

<pb n="53"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">53</mw>
<lb/>are also some wild and beautiful fictions of
<lb/>the Eastern poets. It would, therefore, be
<lb/>difficult to find any thing new to say of that
<lb/>most charming of our feathered musicians;
<lb/>but there is a bird, which, if it does not sing
<lb/>so exquisitely, is yet usually heard with great
<lb/>pleasure, since it announces the approach of
<lb/>spring, even before the earliest plants appear,
<lb/>and often in the first days of <name>January</name>. It is
<lb/>also a thrush, the largest of English singing
<lb/>birds, and feeds much on the berries of mis­
<lb/>sletoe; and because of its loud notes from the
<lb/>top of some high tree, in blowing, or showery
<lb/>weather, the country people in <placeName>Hampshire</placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName>Sussex</placeName> call it the storm-cock.
<lb/><persName>George</persName> will read what I have written upon it.</p>

<title>History of <placeName>Selbourn</placeName></title> to read an

<lb/>and drives away from its neighbourhood
<lb/>many larger birds, which would molest his
<lb/>young. An instance, however, is told, in
<lb/>which this bravery availed nothing. A missel
<lb/>thrush had built in a garden, where he was
<lb/>often assailed by the jay, magpye, and other
<lb/>birds larger than himself; against these he
<lb/>resolutely defended his family, but at length
<lb/>a great many jays came upon the unfortunate
<lb/>bird together, overpowered him and his mate
<lb/>by their numbers, tore the nest to pieces, and

                <p>Beauty is no apology for

<lb/>it is a great deal larger than those in this

                <p>Well, we shall see them all
<lb/>in a day or two, and they will serve to bring
<lb/>to our recollection those we saw at the <name>Leverian
<lb/>Museum</name>. I cannot, however, say, that I feel
<lb/>as much pleasure in the contemplation of these
<lb/>objects, however beautiful, as I do in looking
<lb/>at a collection of plants. The birds, or insects,
<lb/>or quadrupeds, though they may be very well
<lb/>preserved, lose that spirit and brilliancy, which
<pb n="57"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">57</mw>
<lb/>living objects only can possess. The attitudes
<lb/>of the birds are stiff and forced, and without
<lb/>their natural accompaniments. Their eyes
<lb/>are seldom so contrived as to resemble those of
<lb/>the living bird; and altogether, their formal or
<lb/>awkward appearances, when stuffed and set on
<lb/>wires, always convey to my mind ideas of the
<lb/>sufferings of the poor birds when they were
<lb/>caught and killed, and the disagreeable opera­
<lb/>tions of embowelling and drying them. Quad­
<lb/>rupeds, which are for the most part larger, are
<lb/>still more difficult subjects to preserve well;
<lb/>and insects, taken for the collections of the
<lb/>curious, must probably have resigned their
<lb/>short lives in some degree of suffering, which
<lb/>nature would not have inflicted. But a col­
<lb/>lection of plants offers only pleasing ideas:
<lb/>even the most common, that spring up under
<lb/>our feet, and are thrown from our gardens as
<lb/>weeds, are many of them very elegant, and
<lb/>others are of medical utility. I cannot say that
<lb/>I think the pleasure of botanizing destroyed, by
<lb/>considering plants as convertible into drugs;
<lb/>on the contrary, I reflect with satisfaction, that
<lb/>objects so beautiful in themselves, are also
<lb/>endowed with the power of alleviating pain, or
<pb n="58"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">58</mw>
<lb/>diminishing fever. And when I am sick, much
<lb/>of the disgust which the taste of medicine
<lb/>excites, is conquered, when I know, that what
<lb/>is proper for me to take is only the roots, bark,
<lb/>flowers, leaves, or seeds of a plant. To the
<lb/>vegetable kingdom we are indebted for most
<lb/>of the conveniences and comforts of life.
<lb/>Except carpets, and those articles which must
<lb/>bear the fire, our rooms are furnished with the
<lb/>produce of vegetables. Even silk, which in
<lb/>noblemen's houses, or those of persons of
<lb/>fortune, is used for furniture, is only a modi­
<lb/>fication of the vegetable juices of the mulberry,
<lb/>passing, by a wonderful contrivance of nature,
<lb/>through the manufacturing organs of a moth.
<lb/>There is, you perhaps remember, since I think
<lb/>we lately met with it in the course of our read­
<lb/>ing, an oriental proverb, or aphorism, that says:
<lb/><quote rend="pre(“)post(”)bestow((pre(“))(lb))">By patience and industry, the mulberry

                <p rend="first-indent(1)break(yes)">This may serve as a subject for a little poe­
<lb/>tical essay, hereafter; at present, I will read
<lb/>to you an ode, or address, to a plant, little
<lb/>known but by its product in this country. I
<lb/>mean the <seg xml:id="a141" corresp="#n141">Olive</seg>, which is, you know, cultivated
<lb/>in <placeName>Spain</placeName>, <placeName>Italy</placeName>, and the 
southern provinces of
<pb n="59"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">59</mw>
<lb/><placeName>France</placeName>, where it supplies to the cultivators,
<lb/>the want of butter, and other requisites for the
<lb/>table, which are, to a certain degree, denied
<lb/>them by the heat of the country, and forms
<lb/>also a valuable staple of commerce. Oil is, as
<lb/>you, <persName>George</persName>, remarked, one of the blessings of
<lb/>life enumerated in Scripture; and in stories
<lb/>like the <title>Arabian nights</title>, you often hear of it
<lb/>among valuable merchandise, and articles of
<lb/>luxury or use. You know, that the olive-
<lb/>branch is a symbol of peace; and that it is
<lb/>given in fabulous story to <persName>Minerva</persName>, who,
<lb/>notwithstanding she is called the Martial Maid,
<lb/>would hardly have deserved the superior
<lb/>appellation of the Goddess of <emph>Wisdom</emph>, if she
<lb/>was not supposed to prefer the <emph>Olive</emph> to the
<lb/>blood-stained <emph>Laurel</emph> of Victory. The tree,
<lb/>like some characters in human life, is rather to
<lb/>be admired for good than brilliant qualities:
<lb/>it is by no means handsome, the form neither
<lb/>majestic nor elegant, the leaves narrow, and
<lb/>of a dull colour, and the blossom small and
<lb/>white: even in groups, or small groves, as it is
<lb/>planted about the farms in the south of <placeName>France</placeName>,
<lb/>it adds no beauty to the landscape. Under all
<lb/>these disadvantages of figure, however, we will
<pb n="60"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">60</mw>
<lb/>give it a place among our plants; and we must
<lb/>suppose it the accompaniment of scenery in
<lb/>one of the most southern provinces of <placeName>France</placeName>,
<lb/>since I am better acquainted with that part of
<lb/>the world than with <placeName>Italy</placeName> or <placeName>Spain</placeName>;
though I
<lb/>have often thought much of the pleasure
<lb/>derived from reading Spanish stories arises from
<lb/>the description of the country. I like to
<lb/>imagine <persName>Don Quixote</persName> and <persName>Sancho</persName>, with
their
<lb/>borachio, or
goat-skin, filled with wine, care­
<lb/>fully provided by the latter, sitting under the
<lb/>shadow of spreading chesnut trees. Or <persName>Gil
<lb/>Blas</persName> and <persName>Fabrice</persName>, eating the remains of the
<lb/>hare they had dined upon under a tuft of cork
<lb/>trees, at the foot of a rock; for while the
<lb/>wearisome descriptions that we read in many
<lb/>works of imagination displease, because we
<lb/>feel that they are only tawdry copies; the
<lb/>simplest sketch which gives us an idea of truth
<lb/>and reality, makes the figures it presents appear
<lb/>with greater effect, and puts the scene and the
<lb/>persons immediately before us. But this is a
<lb/>digression: let us return to my Ode.

<lb/>get the time passed by, without any other re­

<lb/>(and professed gamesters are generally both)
<lb/>are actuated by the hope of winning, and all
<lb/>the wit they have, is collected to enable them

<lb/>an unhappy desolate young person, date the
<lb/>commencement of their indigence and depen­
<lb/>dence, from the time their parents became
<lb/>addicted to the ruinous passion for gaming.
<lb/>You enquire what pleasure pushing these balls
<lb/>about can afford; which probably struck you,
<lb/>as not being a very entertaining method of
<lb/>passing the time, because you never happened
<lb/>to have seen it till lately; while, perhaps,

                <p>Yes; yet cards, and every

<lb/>such and such people frequent these places;
<lb/>or than driving round <placeName>London</placeName> in search of

<lb/>none of them come under the description of

<lb/>every one of them would have given their
<lb/>winnings most readily to any indigent fellow
<lb/>creature; for I have known each do occasional
<lb/>acts of kindness of that sort; though, perhaps,

                <p>I assure you I did not; nor
<lb/>do I recollect having read these verses of
<lb/><persName>Burns</persName>, at least these five years. But nothing
<lb/>is more usual, than for the same train of
<lb/>thought to produce in poetry, lines greatly re­
<lb/>sembling each other, of which I could give
<lb/>you many instances of more importance than
<lb/>my little unintentional plagiarism.—I am very
<lb/>well pleased, however, to see this instance of
<lb/>observation. It encourages me to continue
<lb/>our poetical attempts. Last night, after our
<lb/>return from seeing <persName>Mr. Beechcroft's</persName> collec­
<lb/>tion of specimens in natural history, I was
<lb/>considering what a different figure the Fire-fly,
<lb/>the Fulgora, made in its <emph>then</emph> state, from
that
<lb/>it naturally bore in its own country; illumi­
<lb/>nating the magnificent woods of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, or
<lb/><placeName>Vera Cruz</placeName>.—It brought to my mind, the
<lb/>many light and shewy characters, that conti­
<lb/>nually arise, are wondered at, and forgotten.
<lb/>These ideas gave rise to a few stanzas, which I
<lb/>will read to you; but that you may understand
<lb/>them, I must give you a slight drawing of the
<lb/>country in which the insect is produced. The
<lb/>Mahogena, or Swietan, called so after a
cele­
<lb/>brated Swedish botanist, in honour of his
<pb n="80"/>

<lb/>native land; the Guazuma, or great Cedar;
<lb/>the Pimento, and other immense trees, form
<lb/>extensive woods, overshadowing the higher
<lb/>parts of the island of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>. Among these
<lb/>woods, are rocky eminences from whence flow
<lb/>rapid streams of water; and there are tracts
<lb/>where these waters, swelled by the equinoctial
<lb/>rains, have worn vast trenches in the earth;
<lb/>the sides of which, being full of trees and
<lb/>brushwood, these cavities, as well as rocky
<lb/>hollows and caves in the mountains, frequently
<lb/>become the hiding places of fugitive negroes;
<lb/>and there several sorts of monkies, the great
<lb/>bat, or vampyre, and other animals, find re­
<lb/>fuge. Round the houses, the scene is softened
<lb/>by avenues of cocoa trees, or Palmetos; and
<lb/>amidst plantations of the maize, or Guinea
<lb/>corn, which is an article of food for the black
<lb/>people, and extensive fields of canes, and
<lb/>groups of coffee and cotton trees, the odorous
<lb/>plumeria, the pomegranate, the orange, lime,
<lb/>and citron, are mingled, and perfume the air.
<lb/>The most elegant and splendid Cactus Grand­
<lb/>iflora, usually called the night blowing Cereus,
<lb/>a stove plant, in this country, grows naturally
<lb/>there on the rocks; and is said, though incor­

<lb/>rectly, to open exactly at midnight; the fact
<lb/>however is, that it slowly unfolds its large and
<lb/>and lovely white petals, and yellow calyx,
<lb/>during the night, but closes before the next
<lb/>day's sun, to open no more. As soon as the
<lb/>sun is below the horizon, it is dark in tropical
<lb/>countries; and then a land wind, and most
<lb/>copious dews, cool the air—but to these it is
<lb/>seldom safe for an <name>European</name> to be much ex­
<lb/>posed. We are to imagine the ugly insect,
<lb/>for ugly it is in the state we saw it, illumina­
<lb/>ting with its singular and volant light, scenes
<lb/>like these I have been describing.</p>

                <p>It has been observed, <persName>George</persName>,
<lb/>that almost all men of genius, have a disposition
<lb/>to indulge melancholy and gloomy ideas; and
<lb/>in reading our most celebrated poets, we have
<lb/>evidence that it was so. But these very men
<lb/>had also the keenest relish for the pleasures
<lb/>and enjoyments of life; the liveliest sense of
<lb/>the absurd and ridiculous, and were most of
<lb/>them severe satirists, as well as entertaining
<lb/>companions. But there are so many preju­
<lb/>dices entertained about those who are called
<lb/>Poets, that a parent, who thought as the greater
<lb/>part of the world think, would never act like
<lb/>the worthy father of <persName>Pope</persName>, who used to encou­
<lb/>rage his son to make verses; correct and
<lb/>recorrect them, and when they satisfied him,
<lb/>would exclaim with great appearance of satis­
<lb/>faction, <quote>these are good rhymes.</quote> To
this
<lb/>encouragement we are probably indebted, for
<lb/>the most correct and elegant, if not the most
<lb/>original of English Poets. But from the pre­
<lb/>valence of a received opinion, that a man of
<lb/>genius must want common sense, and be of
<lb/>course unfortunate, many young men of su­
<lb/>perior talent have been discouraged from the
<lb/>cultivation of them, and have directed to pur­
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">I</mw>
<pb n="86"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I1v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">86</mw>
<lb/>suits much less laudable, the powers that might
<lb/>have raised them to the greatest eminence in
<lb/>literature. The errors and misfortunes of men
<lb/>of genius, are evident, and recorded. The
<lb/>errors, and consequent misfortunes, of common
<lb/>characters, are so frequent, and the world is
<lb/>accustomed to despise and forget them, while
<lb/>it is also forgotten, that infinitely more mischief
<lb/>is done by folly than by wit, that innumerable
<lb/>men are every day ruining themselves and
<lb/>their families, who are as destitute of common
<lb/>sense, as the most enthusiastic victim of poetical
<lb/>pursuits can be imagined to be. Do not,
<lb/>therefore, my dear <persName>George</persName>, suffer the pleasure
<lb/>you derive from poetry, or the inclination you
<lb/>may one day feel to attempt it, to be checked
<lb/>by these common-place sayings about wit and
<lb/>abilities, such as that:
<quote rend="indent(1)pre()post()"><lb/>Great wit to madness nearly is allied,
<lb/>And thin partitions do their bounds divide.</quote>
<lb/>And many others of the same sort, confidently
<lb/>repeated by people, who seem to value them­
<lb/>selves on the want of that intellect, which is
<lb/>the distinguishing characteristic of man; for,
<lb/>if understanding and reason are the great
<pb n="87"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">87</mw>
<lb/>marks of the superiority of the human race, he
<lb/>who possesses that reason in a more eminent
<lb/>degree, and cultivates it for the benefit of his
<lb/>fellow creatures, approaches the nearest to an
<lb/>higher order of beings. Another prejudice is,
<lb/>that understanding is not so often accompanied
<lb/>by good and easy temper, as weakness; and,
<lb/>in consequence of this notion, it is not an un­
<lb/>common thing to hear people say, <quote>Such
a
<lb/>one is not very wise, but extremely good-
<lb/>natured.</quote> And, <quote>a good-natured
weak man,</quote>
<lb/>is a very usual expression. But I very much
<lb/>doubt whether goodness of heart, and weak­
<lb/>ness of understanding ever go together; that
<lb/>they are not frequently united I am convinced.
<lb/>A weak and ignorant man, is almost always
<lb/>conscious of his inferiority: but his self-love is
<lb/>alarmed at the involuntary discovery, and he
<lb/>at once hates and fears every one whom he
<lb/>feels to be his superior, and is always appre­
<lb/>hensive of imposition or ridicule. Such a man
<lb/>is happy, if, while he is enjoying, and perhaps
<lb/>wasting, the fortune which he never would
<lb/>himself have been able to acquire, he can drag
<lb/>at his chariot wheels, in the degrading situa­
<lb/>tion of a retainer, some unfortunate man of
<pb n="88"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">88</mw>
<lb/>talents, reduced either by circumstances or
<lb/>indiscretion, to the humiliation of dependence.
<lb/>But far less irksome to the man who feels the
<lb/>proud consciousness of abilities, must it be, to
<lb/>submit to the humblest labour that procures
<lb/>him bread, than to accept from one of these
<lb/><soCalled>good-natured men</soCalled>, the least favour that can
<lb/>give a base mind what he conceives to be a
<lb/>triumph over one whom he knows is his supe­
<lb/>rior. To be the butt of clumsy attempts at
<lb/>wit, or to degrade that which God has given
<lb/>him, by reducing it to the gross and depraved
<lb/>taste of such a patron, must surely be the most
<lb/>humiliating and mortifying situation to which
<lb/>a man of sense and spirit can be reduced. In
<lb/>the vocabulary of half the world, the want of
<lb/>money, implies the want of common sense;
<lb/>and thus, poetry and poverty have become
<lb/>associated in the minds of the vulgar. Ill
<lb/>fated genius perpetuates and immortalizes at
<lb/>once his failings and his sufferings, while those
<lb/>of the common herd are forgotten with them.
<lb/>I believe it to be far from true, that the
<lb/>powers and feelings which constitute a Poet,
<lb/>unfit a man for success in any other liberal
<lb/>walk of life. On the contrary, I am persuaded,

<pb n="89"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">89</mw>
<lb/>that the talents which have acquired great
<lb/>eminence and affluence in other pursuits,
<lb/>would not enable their possessor to become a
<lb/>Poet; yet, that the talents which make a Poet,
<lb/>(I speak not of the common rhymers of a
<lb/>magazine, or a newspaper,) would enable him,
<lb/>to whom they are given, to excel in any pur­

<lb/>independence and freedom. And he as justly
<lb/>remarks, that the great can do little for them,

<lb/>because I would lose no occasion to enforce

<lb/>that independence, without which, talents are

<lb/>lines, <persName>West</persName>, the friend of <persName>Gray</persName>, formed a very
<lb/>interesting poem, mingling that turn of thought
<lb/>with part of one of the elegies of <persName>Tibullus</persName>.
<lb/>In the last volume of the <title>Mirror</title>, there is also
<lb/>a poem on the same subject, written by <persName>Mi­
<lb/>chael Bruce</persName>, a young man of considerable
<lb/>genius, and in indigent circumstances, who in
<lb/>early youth, was conscious he was lingering
<lb/>in an incurable illness. As another instance
<lb/>of unintended plagiarism, and unconscious
<lb/>imitation, without thinking of, and certainly
<lb/>without having the power to refer to either
<lb/>of these compositions, I recollect that a young
<lb/>man, with whom I was once acquainted,
<lb/>wrote, some years ago, a few stanzas in the
<lb/>same desponding, yet resigned spirit. A pe­
<lb/>culiar and disastrous chain of events, seemed
<lb/>to pursue him through life; but after his
<lb/>fortune apparently changed for the better,
<lb/>other circumstances arose, which deprived him
<lb/>of the happiness, independance, and affluence
<lb/>promised him. I remember also, some lines
<lb/>he wrote, when after a long absence he re­
<lb/>turned to <placeName>England</placeName>, and looking at that moment
<lb/>with a more sanguine disposition of mind on
<lb/>the prospect then before him, he compared

                <p>And I dare say she takes
<lb/>great pride in them, and they afford her as
<lb/>much pleasure as one of the same race of plants
<lb/>did to me. Before I had possessed a green­
<lb/>house, and while it was my lot to pass a good
<lb/>deal of time alone, I had raised one of these
<lb/>plants from a cutting, given me in a nosegay.
<lb/>It became in a few months large and flourish­
<lb/>ing, and was one of the handomest, though
<lb/>not the most tender of the numerous race of
<lb/>exotic geraniums. I grew as fond of my plant
<lb/>as I should have been of a domestic animal,
<lb/>and took great pains to nourish it with fresh
<lb/>earth, by exchanging the pot for a larger,
<lb/>whenever there was occasion for such a trans­
<lb/>position; sheltering it from frost, and giving
<lb/>it light and air. In consequence of this un­
<lb/>remitting care, my geranium attained a luxu­
<lb/>riance of growth very unusual, and was always
<lb/>covered with flowers. At that time, for it is
<lb/>now near twenty years ago, the ever-blowing
<lb/>rose, and many other plants, now familiar to our
<lb/>parlours, were not so generally possessed; and
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">K2</mw>
<pb n="102"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">102</mw>
<lb/>my favourite geranium was an object of admi­
<lb/>ration to every one who saw it, and of pride to
<lb/>myself; and as it was a sort of habit I acquired
<lb/>to write little pieces of poetry on any subject
<lb/>that happened particularly to flatter my imagi­
<lb/>nation, I addressed an Ode to my geranium,
<lb/>which I will try to recollect and repeat to
<lb/>you; though I do not know that, till your
<lb/>mention of <persName>Mrs. Davidson's</persName> fine plants, I have
<lb/>ever thought of it since. As I had at that time
<lb/>no book of poesy, such as we now prudently use
<lb/>to secure our essays in, I had only my memory
<lb/>to trust to, or some fugitive paper, not now to
<lb/>be recovered. But I believe I can recall it
<lb/>pretty correctly, for it is remarkable, that I
<lb/>have an almost perfect remembrance of every
<lb/>thing I learned, and every thing I wrote, in the
<lb/>former part of my life. I believe I could even
<lb/>write out a speech from <persName>Racine</persName>, of near an
<lb/>hundred lines, which perhaps I have never read

<lb/>An almost endless variety of ixias, such, you

<lb/>at the nursery garden; geraniums of I know

<lb/>Cape jasmin; and so many others, that I

                <p>Mother, what is the reason that
<lb/>the people of <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, though they reside in

<lb/>never learn to speak as we do?</p>

                <speaker>Mrs. Talbot

                <p>The defect is by no means
<lb/>peculiar to the people of <placeName>Scotland</placeName>. The pro­
<lb/>vincial tone and manner of many English
<lb/>people is quite as remote from the language
<lb/>of those who speak good and pure <name>English</name>,
<lb/>though, perhaps, they have long conversed
<lb/>only with the well educated of their own
<lb/>country; and the reason, I believe is, that an
<lb/>habit acquired in early youth, is never eradi­
<lb/>cated without much observation, and taking a
<lb/>good deal of trouble. Now very few of those
<lb/>who have learned early to speak in a provin­
<lb/>cial accent, will either make the observations,
<lb/>or take the trouble. I cannot otherwise ima­
<lb/>gine, how it is possible for any one to talk of
<lb/><distinct>midnent</distinct> and <distinct>mought</distinct>, and say this is wery
<lb/>pretty, and the other wastly disagreeable.—Or
<lb/>how any custom can reconcile it to the ears of
<pb n="106"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">106</mw>
<lb/>persons that can spell, when they say, <quote>they
<lb/>saw a flower in the <distinct>edge</distinct>; and in trying to get
<lb/>at it, trod just at the <distinct>hedge</distinct> of the stream.
<lb/>That they have had their <distinct>air</distinct> cut by a fashion­
<lb/>able dresser, and have bought a beautiful <distinct>at</distinct>,
<lb/>which is a most becoming <distinct>ed-dress</distinct>, and they
<lb/>shall wear it the next time they go <distinct>hout</distinct> to
<lb/>dinner.</quote> Now, though I can easily imagine
<lb/>that a Scotch woman finds it very difficult to
<lb/>divest herself of the tone and manner of her
<lb/>country, I cannot conceive how English peo­
<lb/>ple can contrive so to disfigure and mutilate
<lb/>their own langauge.—Nothing is more de­
<lb/>sirable than a correct and pure style, whether
<lb/>in speaking or in writing, and nothing should
<lb/>more sedulously be avoided than any particu­
<lb/>lar words, or imitating the language of un­
<lb/>educated persons, or those who have acquired
<lb/>in early life a provincial dialect—such as I
<lb/>have just now given an example. How disa­
<lb/>greeable it is, to hear any one speak with a
<lb/>nasal tone, and indolently drawl out their
<lb/>words, as if it was too much trouble to speak
<lb/>at all. Nor is it less so, when a person speaks
<lb/>so fast, and inarticulately, that it requires the
<lb/>utmost attention in the hearer to comprehend
<pb n="107"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">107</mw>
<lb/>his or her meaning. Conversation is often
<lb/>rendered irksome by these faults, and by others
<lb/>still more common; such as the rage people
<lb/>have to talk altogether, no one being willing to
<lb/>hear, but every body expecting to be heard;
<lb/>or by rude inattention, crying <said rend="pre()post()slant(italic)">hum</said>,
and <said rend="pre()post()slant(italic)">haw</said>,
<lb/>and <said rend="pre()post()slant(italic)">indeed</said>, in a sort of way that tells you the

                <p>And I met with another unplea­

<lb/>I waited on the beech for <persName>Emily's</persName> return from
<lb/>bathing, a gentleman I never saw before, sat
<lb/>down by me, and entered into conversation—
<lb/>but it consisted entirely of questions. He
<lb/>asked me what my name was, where I lived,
<lb/>where I was educated, how old I was, what
<lb/>number we were in family, and to what family
<lb/>of the <persName>Talbots</persName> I belonged, and a great many
<lb/>other questions; till at last I was so weary of
<lb/>answering him, that I abruptly wished him
<lb/>a good morning, and hastened away to find
<lb/><persName>Emily</persName>, who joined me just as my questioning
<lb/>acquaintance again came in sight. I am sure,
<lb/>however, he would have followed us, and have
<lb/>attacked us anew, but <persName>Mrs. Davidson</persName> at that
<lb/>moment called to us, to beg we would step

                <p>This impertinence, disgusting
<lb/>and troublesome as it is, means nothing, but
<lb/>that this poor man is idle, and has no ideas but
<lb/>what he is forced to collect with all his pains,
<lb/>from any body who will give him their atten­
<lb/>tion. He will now have to tell some other
<lb/>sauntering man, or woman, the next time you
<lb/>happen to pass, who you are; and so gain
<lb/>another ten minutes from the lassitude of
<lb/>having nothing to think of and nothing to do.
<lb/>These sort of characters abound in all places
<lb/>of public resort like this, and here the idle can
<lb/>relieve each other; however, if their enquiries
<lb/>were limited to such as this honest gentleman
<lb/>made to you, there would be no great harm in
<lb/>indulging them; but unfortunately, they sel­
<lb/>dom can resist improving upon the narratives
<lb/>they are thus anxious to collect; and are very
<lb/>apt to embellish them, without much adherence
<lb/>to truth, or respect for the feelings of those of
<lb/>whose history they are pleased to inform
<lb/>themselves. How much more usefully employ­
<lb/>ed are the poor women that we hear singing so

<lb/>the fishing nets, with which their husbands,

<lb/>that is always gratifying; and though the
<lb/><name>English</name> have perhaps less natural taste and

<lb/><placeName>Europe</placeName>, it is to me very pleasant to hear the

<lb/>much more scientifically performed. In <placeName>France</placeName>,
<lb/>you see the <foreign xml:lang="fr">petillante</foreign>, lively

                <p>The fishermen's wives are not, to

<lb/>very musical, but I like to see them make their
<lb/>nets. I talked to a man the other day, as he
<lb/>was doing something to one of those large nets,
<lb/>which we see carried in great rolls that almost
<lb/>cover the men when they have them on their
<lb/>heads; and he told me, that though their wives
<lb/>make them, and they themselves pitch and
<lb/>prepare the nets afterwards, yet, that they
<lb/>cost a great deal of money; often as much as

<lb/>that their best nets are sometimes torn by a
<lb/>fish called the sea-dog, which pursue the
<lb/>mackarel, or herrings, and are so large and
<lb/>strong, that they burst through and break the
<lb/>tackle, and let the fish escape.</p>

<lb/>I been capable of executing this sort of poem,

                <p>Poetry is sometimes obscure
<lb/>at first, because it is often necessay to invert
<lb/>the sentences, in order to obtain the rhyme,
<lb/>or to accommodate the measure. And that is
<lb/>the best poetry, where these points are gained
<lb/>with the least appearance of force; and where
<lb/>the fewest words are admitted, evidently for
<lb/>the sake of the rhyme only. Words which no
<lb/>writer would use, if they could do without
<lb/>them; and which in prose would never enter
<lb/>into elegant composition. Sometimes a poor
<lb/>verse-maker is sadly tortured by the wish he
<lb/>feels to use some word of great force to close
<lb/>his couplet, to which there are not, perhaps,
<lb/>above two or three respondents, and those so
<lb/>awkward and unmanageable, that he must
<lb/>sometimes sacrifice sense to sound. Our friend
<lb/>and favourite, <persName>Cowper</persName>, gives an admirable

<lb/>ing. For my own part, I feel very differently
<lb/>from these philosophers. Perhaps I have seen
<lb/>too much of the fallacy of their studies,
<lb/>and the little benefit that has accrued from
<lb/>them, either to individual, or general happi­
<lb/>ness; and therefore turn, with more ardour
<lb/>than I did in early life, to contemplate the
<lb/>works of God only, wherever they are unspoiled
<lb/>by man. I wonder any being, who affects
<lb/>taste, would venture to assert that this immense
<lb/>body of water presents only sameness and
<lb/>monotony. To me it seems, that even the
<lb/>colours and sounds are little less varied, than
<lb/>those we see or hear, in the midst of the most
<lb/>luxuriant landscape. I remember having been
<lb/>becalmed some years ago in a packet boat

unfor­
<lb/>tunately for the master of the vessel, who was,

family,</quote>
<lb/>if he was there sooner than another packet,
<lb/>which could not leave the English coast till the
<lb/>next tide after his departure. When the wind
<lb/>failed so entirely as to leave the sails totally
<lb/>unfilled, the agonizing apprehensions of losing
<lb/>forty guineas began to operate on this poor

<lb/>man with great violence, and he walked back­
<lb/>wards and forwards on his small deck, wiping
<lb/>his forehead and deploring his ill fortune,
<lb/>sometimes varying his lamentations with sup­
<lb/>plications which he made in <name>French</name>, and
<lb/>which consisted, I believe, of all the <name>French</name> he
<lb/>could speak—
<quote xml:id="a166" rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr" corresp="#n166">Souffle, souffle, <persName>St. Antoine</persName>,</quote>
<lb/>cried he. His supplications were vain, yet
<lb/>they were by no means remitted; and hardly
<lb/>could he attend, though a very civil man, to
<lb/>the questions of his weary passengers, who
<lb/>were as eager as he was to get on shore, for the
<lb/>weather was very hot, and the confinement in
<lb/>so small a vessel very inconvenient. As a
<lb/>cabin was always intolerable to me, I remained
<lb/>upon deck, and found amusement in the variety
<lb/>I saw of colours and motions upon the sur­
<lb/>face of the water. Sometimes it was ruffled
<lb/>by a partial breeze, which however did not
<lb/>reach our flagging sails, notwithstanding the
<lb/>Captain, watching it with the greatest anxiety,
<lb/>repeated his energetic apostrophe of—
<quote xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">souffle,
<lb/>souffle, donc, <persName>St. Antoine</persName>,</quote> and as often as these
<lb/>light airs passed by without giving him the
<lb/>least assistance, he became more clamorous.
<lb/>At length as I steadily observed the surface of
<pb n="127"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">127</mw>
<lb/>the blue and almost transparent waves, in
<lb/>hopes of seeing some signs of wind, I remarked
<lb/>what I thought was one of these currents of
<lb/>air, which running in the direction of the
<lb/>packet from the north-west, would, I hoped,
<lb/>reach our motionless sails. The Captain was
<lb/>at that moment gone down to console himself
<lb/>with some of the passengers eatables and
<lb/>drinkables; but I remarked to the man on
<lb/>deck the alteration in the colour of the water,
<lb/>through which it seemed as if a river was
<lb/>poured that kept itself distinct from the salt
<lb/>waves, just as the <placeName>Rhone</placeName> is said to pass through
<lb/>the lake of <placeName>Geneva</placeName> without mingling with its
<lb/>water. <said xml:id="MR01">Oh, no, Ma'am,</said> said the mariner,
<lb/>in answer to my enquiry whether a fresh
<lb/>breeze was not approaching,
<said xml:id="MR02">that is not wind,
<lb/>it is a shoal of mackarel, that changes the colour
<lb/>of the water, and makes them there bubbles
<lb/>like as you see, and all of them crinkles in the
<lb/>water.</said> As the shoal approached a little
<lb/>nearer, I distinctly heard that sort of snapping
<lb/>noise, which you may sometimes remember
<lb/>in the river from fish just rising to the surface,
<lb/>and saw that a vast stream of life, if I may so
<lb/>express myself, produced the effect I had re­
<lb/>marked on the colour of the sea. Of this
<pb n="128"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">128</mw>
<lb/>stream or shoal of animated beings, many were
<lb/>devoured by gulls or other sea birds, others
<lb/>by the dog fish, which threw themselves above
<lb/>the water in the eagerness of pursuit; and
<lb/>great numbers were probably taken the same
<lb/>evening on our coast; and by the hour of
<lb/>dinner the next day contributed another dish
<lb/>to the tables of the rich, while the day after
<lb/>the refuse might be the sole sustenance of
<lb/>several families of the poor. These appear­
<lb/>ances, which may sometimes be observed from
<lb/>the shore, and the various hues reflected by the
<lb/>waves from the sky—the changes of the season,
<lb/>of tides, and of winds, surely give nearly as
<lb/>much variety to this element, as the difference
<lb/>of Winter and Summer does to the earth we

<lb/>stances of taste as well as memory. Not only
<lb/>the rush of the water when, heavily and with

<lb/>pleasing; but the low and half-heard murmur
<lb/>of the small waves, that just rock the sea-weed
<lb/>as it floats upon them, before it is deposited on
<lb/>the shingles, is a sound almost as soothing as
<lb/>that we listen to, when the low Summer wind
<lb/>sighs among woods and copses—a sound, for
<lb/>which I think the English language wants an
<lb/>expressive word. We say indeed the sighing
<lb/>or the murmuring of the air, but the wind

                <p>And it supports many beings
<lb/>either within its bosom, or on its produce. In
<lb/>some northern countries the natives are in­
<lb/>debted almost entirely to the sea for their food
<lb/>and clothing. The sea birds which migrate to
<lb/>their shores, as well as the fish that people their
<lb/>waves, supply to them the want of all, that
<lb/>nature has bestowed on more fortunate climates.
<lb/>But let me try if the images we have thus col­
<lb/>lected may not be fixed in our memories by
<lb/>putting them into verse. I made a sketch of
<lb/>them a day or two ago, and perhaps I may be
<lb/>able to read them. I mean to refute the idea
<lb/>that the sea has no variety, but that which
<lb/>arises from the flux and reflux of tides, or from
<lb/>calms and storms.

                <p>I am willing rather to be­

<lb/>purity of your natural taste, and your percep­
<lb/>tion of what is most beautiful, truth in its

<lb/>ciful, and by no means the most proper among
<lb/>the Roman poets, for the perusal of youth, is
<lb/>almost the first book put into their hands.
<lb/>Your elder brother, therefore, became ac­
<lb/>quainted with all these fabulous people; and
<lb/>as soon as <persName>Edward</persName> was in <persName>Virgil</persName>,
he used to
<lb/>give me, while we looked over his lessons to­
<lb/>gether, very clear accounts of their genealogy
<lb/>and exploits; but mingled with such remarks,
<lb/>as determined me to introduce these imaginary
<lb/>beings to <persName>George's</persName> acquaintance in another
<lb/>manner. You know, that the taste he has for
<lb/>poetry has induced me to give him many
<lb/>books, which boys at his age seldom desire to
<lb/>read, and if compelled to do it, seldom, and
<lb/>perhaps I may say never, understand. But he
<lb/>is delighted with the fictions of poetry; and
<lb/>has read with enthusiasm, and a very uncom­
<lb/>mon relish for their beauties, poems, of which
<lb/>the machinery constitute a considerable part.
<lb/>Now this could not have happened if he had

<lb/>heard, the greatest Epic Poet.—<title>The Iliad</title> is a
<lb/>poetical history of what happened in the last
<lb/>year of the <name>Trojan war</name>.—And the agents em­
<lb/>ployed by the Poet, in bringing about the
<lb/>events, are heathen deities, who became them­
<lb/>selves parties in the contest, which began, as
<lb/>the fable relates, from the gift of <persName>Paris</persName>, one of
<lb/>the sons of <persName>Priam</persName>, of a golden apple to
<persName>Venus</persName>,
<lb/>in preference to <persName>Juno</persName>, the Queen of Heaven,
<lb/>and <persName>Minerva</persName>, the Goddess of Wisdom and the
<lb/>Arts. The deities, thus interested, interfere
<lb/>in the war between the associated princes of
<lb/><placeName>Greece</placeName>, and the <name>Trojans</name>. Almost all of them
<lb/>are personally brought forward, and some are
<lb/>even described as being wounded. Now to
<lb/>understand <title>the Iliad</title> at all, it is necessary to
<lb/>learn all the fictions on which the story is
<lb/>founded, and from which these supernatural
<lb/>agents, or the machinery, are introduced.
<lb/><title>The Iliad</title> describes the effects of the anger of
<lb/><persName>Achilles</persName>, in retarding the success of the Gre­
<lb/>cian Princes against <placeName>Troy</placeName>. <persName>Achilles</persName> was
the
<lb/>son of a Sea Goddess, <persName>Thetis</persName>, who knowing
<lb/>that he was destined to fall in early youth, en­
<lb/>deavoured to conceal him, and prevent his
<lb/>joining the confederacy; but <persName>Ulysses, King of

<lb/><placeName>Ithaca</placeName></persName>, who is represented as the favourite of
<lb/><persName>Minerva</persName>, and a man of great wisdom and sa­
<lb/>gacity, discovered him by a stratagem, dis­
<lb/>guised in women's clothes; and in despite of
<lb/>his mother's apprehensions, induced him to
<lb/>assist in the siege, because destiny had decreed
<lb/>that <placeName>Troy</placeName> should not fall, unless he was among
<lb/>those who attacked it. I cannot, now, go
<lb/>into all the preceding circumstances, but you
<lb/>see that they must be known, before <title>the Iliad</title>
<lb/>can be understood. <title>The Odyssey</title> of <persName>Homer</persName>,
<lb/>another Epic Poem, relates the wanderings
<lb/>and sufferings of <persName>Ulysses</persName>, after the conquest
<lb/>of <placeName>Troy</placeName>.—Pursued by the hatred of the vin­
<lb/>dictive <persName>Juno</persName>, he was condemned to suffer in­
<lb/>numerable hardships before he returned, after
<lb/>an absence of twenty years, to <persName>Penelope</persName> and
<lb/>his son <persName>Telemachus</persName>; whose adventures in
<lb/>search of his father, are the subject of the ce­
<lb/>lebrated work of <persName>Fenelon</persName>; an Epic Poem, in
<lb/>measured <name>French</name> prose, which is usually, but
<lb/>improperly, one of the first books young peo­
<lb/>ple are directed to, after they begin to read

<lb/>evils entailed on their unhappy race in con­
<lb/>sequence of their disobedience. The machi­
<lb/>nery he uses is more elevated, and comes more
<lb/>within our comprehension; yet throughout
<lb/>the book, there are frequent allusions to
<lb/>Grecian fable.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(1)break(yes)">But there is another species of poem, called
<lb/>usually the mock heroic; in which satire is
<lb/>conveyed under allegoric or imaginary beings,
<lb/>who bring about ludicrous events. Some of
<lb/>these, which are not likely to interest you, I
<lb/>pass over. But there are two which are so
<lb/>elegant, and so much adapted to form the
<lb/>taste of young women, that as soon as you are
<lb/>a little better read in fable, I shall recommend
<lb/>them to your study. These are <persName>Pope's</persName> <title>Rape
<lb/>of the Lock</title>, and <persName>Hayley's</persName>
 <title>Triumphs of Temper</title>.
<lb/>The machinery used in the first of these is
<lb/>composed of ideal beings, called Sylphs and
<lb/>Gnomes. These are the invention of a philo­
<lb/>sopher named <persName>Rosicrusius</persName>, who imagined that
<lb/>Sylphs and Gnomes presided over the air and
<lb/>earth, and Nymphs and Salamanders over
<lb/>water and fire. <persName>Mr. Hayley</persName> has taken for the
<lb/>monitress and guardian of his sweet <persName>Serena</persName> a

<lb/>who is described with great delicacy and

<lb/>and most delicious visionary scenes and beings,
<lb/>arose in the same comprehensive mind, that
<lb/>read, as by intuition, the effects of all the

<lb/>names of those which were mentioned, but
<lb/>when they were changed, or as you bade me

                <p>Yes, because you know vege­
<lb/>tation, over which <persName>Flora</persName> may poetically be
<lb/>said to preside, is extended even to the rocks
<lb/>and caverns under the sea, where great num­
<lb/>bers of plants of the class cryptogamia grow,
<lb/>and are washed from thence in storms, which
<lb/>is the reason, that after rough weather, the
<lb/>shore often seems a bank of weeds. These
<lb/>sometimes adhere to shells, or small stones, or
<lb/>pieces of rock, and they have shapes and
<lb/>colours unlike the productions of the earth;
<lb/>but if you observe samphire, and other plants
<lb/>that grow near the sea, and are watered by its
<lb/>waves, or are within the immediate influence
<lb/>of sea vapours, you will see, that there is a
<lb/>gradual line of connection between them.

<lb/>were inferior in family and consequence to
<lb/>myself, and had only to boast of suddenly
<lb/>acquired riches: but as I went on in the
<lb/>world, this very common circumstance ceased
<lb/>to make me angry. I listened with equal
<lb/>indifference to some persons of very high
<lb/>blood, who contrived to let me know, that
<lb/>they waved their privilege of rank while con­
<lb/>descending to associate with me; and the
<lb/>good substantial monied folks, who took some
<lb/>trouble to convey obliquely to <emph>me</emph>, what was
<lb/>always present to <emph>them</emph>, a consciousness of the
<lb/>superiority money, of which they had a great

<lb/>dent of high birth or high affluence; that the
<lb/>want either of the one or the other would
<lb/>never make me less alive to the charms of
<lb/>nature, or detract one atom of delight from
<lb/>the enjoyments of reading and writing. I
<lb/>considered that I had learned to live to my
<lb/>own heart, and to find my amusement where
<lb/>my duties lay, and that it would be very
<lb/>foolish to lose one, and neglect the other, for
<lb/>the sake of vieing with people whose happiness
<lb/>seemed so wide of mine, that we need not
<lb/>at all interfere with each other. If they
<lb/>sought me, I met them with civility, and parted
<lb/>from them with as little regret as they pro­
<lb/>bably did with me; but I never sought them,

<lb/>They will go off from your finger if you will take them

<lb/>book as I was reading in the parlour; and running to
<lb/>the top of the page, and shooting out a web, took its
<lb/>departure from thence. But what I most wondered at
<lb/>was, that it went off with considerable velocity, in a
<lb/>place where no air was stirring; and I am sure I did
<lb/>not assist it with my breath; so that these little

<lb/>nounces it by a variety of loud notes. There is only
