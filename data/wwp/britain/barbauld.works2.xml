        <div type="letter">
          <head>To <persName>Dr. Aiken.</persName></head>
          <salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
          <p>To my sister and yourself, <persName>Mr. Barbauld</persName> and I
have
<lb/>a request to make, in which, though perhaps it may
<lb/>be rather singular, we are very seriously in earnest;
<lb/>and therefore, whether you grant or deny, we hope
<lb/>you will neither laugh at us nor take it amiss. With­
<lb/>out further preface, it is this. You enjoy a blessing
<lb/>Providence has hitherto denied to us,—that of child­
<lb/>ren: you have already several, and seem very likely 
<lb/>to have a numerous family. As to ourselves, having
<lb/>been thus long without prospect of any, it is, to say
<lb/>the least, very uncertain whether that hope, which
<lb/>most I believe form when they marry, will ever be
<lb/>fulfilled. Some, indeed, say to us, that considering
<lb/>how large a family we have of others children, 't is
<lb/>rather fortunate we have none of our own. And true
<lb/>it is, that employed as we are in the business of
<lb/>education, we have many of the cares and some of
<lb/>the pleasures of a parent; but the latter very imper­
<lb/>fectly. We have them not early enough to contract
<lb/>the fondness of affection which early care alone can
<lb/>give; we have them not long enough to see the fruit
<lb/> of our culture; and we have not enough the disposal

<pb n="4"/>
<milestone n="1(2)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">4</mw>

<lb/>of them to follow our own plans and schemes in their
<lb/>education. We wish for one who might be wholly
<lb/>ours: and we think that if a child was made ours by
<lb/>being given young into our hands, we could love it,
<lb/>and make it love us so well, as to supply in a great
<lb/>measure the want of the real relationship. We know
<lb/>there are many instances of people, who have taken
<lb/>the greatest satisfaction in, and felt the highest fond­
<lb/>ness for, children who by some accident have been
<lb/>thrown upon their arms. Why then should not we
<lb/>seek out and choose some object of such an affection?
<lb/>and where can we better seek it than in a brother's
<lb/>family?</p>
          <p>Our request then, in short, is this: that you will
<lb/>permit us to adopt one of your children; which of
<lb/>them, we leave to you;—that you will make it ours
<lb/>in every sense in which it is possible to make it,—
<lb/>that you will transfer to us all the care and all the
<lb/>authority of a parent; that we should provide for it,
<lb/>educate it, and have the entire direction of it, as far
<lb/>into life as the parental power itself extends. Now
<lb/>I know not what to say, to induce you to make us
<lb/>such a gift. Perhaps you will entirely deny it; and
<lb/>then we must acquiesce: for I am sensible it is not a
<lb/>small thing we ask; nor can it be easy for a parent
<lb/>to part with a child. This I would say, from a
<lb/>number, <emph>one</emph> may may more easily
be spared. Though
<lb/>it makes a very material difference in happiness
<lb/>whether a person has children or no children, it makes,
<lb/>I apprehend, little or none whether he has three,
<lb/>or four; five, or six; because four or five are enow
<lb/>to exercise all his whole stock of care and affection.
<lb/>We should gain, but you would not lose. I would
<lb/>likewise put you in mind that you would not part with
<lb/>it to strangers; the connexion between you and it
<lb/>would not be broken off: you would see it (I hope,)

<pb n="5"/>
<milestone n="1(3)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">5</mw>

<lb/>hear of it often; and it should be taught to love you,
<lb/>if it had not learnt that lesson before. Our child must
<lb/>love our brother and sister. Its relation to you is
<lb/>likewise a presumption that we shall not be wanting in
<lb/>that love for it, which will be necessary to make it
<lb/>happy.  believe both <persName>Mr. Barbauld</persName> and myself
<lb/>are much disposed to love children, and that we
<lb/>could soon grow fond of any one who was amiable
<lb/>and entirely under our care. How then can we
<lb/>fail to love a child, for whom at setting out we shall
<lb/>have such a stock of affection as we must have for
<lb/>yours? I hope, too, we should have too right a sense
<lb/>of things to spoil it; and we see too much of children,
<lb/>to indulge an over-anxious care. But you know us
<lb/>well enough to be able to judge in general how we
<lb/>should educate it, and whether to your satisfaction.
<lb/>Conscience and affection, I hope, would unite in in­
<lb/>citing us to fulfil an engagement we should thus
<lb/>voluntarily take upon ourselves, to the best of our
<lb/>abilities.</p>
          <p>Our situation is not a certain one, nor have we long
<lb/>tried it; but we have all the reason in the world to
<lb/>hope that if things go on as they have hitherto done,
<lb/>we should be able to provide for a child in a decent
<lb/>and comfortable manner.</p>
          <p>Now, my dear brother and sister, if you consent,
<lb/>give us which of your boys you please: if you had
<lb/>girls, perhaps we should ask a girl rather; and if we
<lb/>might choose amongst your boys, we could make
<lb/>perhaps a choice;—but that we do not expect you
<lb/>will let us. Give us, then, which you will; only let
<lb/>him be healthy, inoculated, and as young as you can
<lb/>possibly venture him to undertake the journey. This
<lb/>last circumstance is indispensable: for if he were not
<lb/>quite young, we should not gain over him the influence,
<lb/>we could not feel for him the affection, which would

<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">1*</mw>
<pb n="6"/>
<milestone n="1(3)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">6</mw>

<lb/>be necessary; besides, if at all able to play with our
<lb/>pupils, he would immediately mix with them, and
<lb/>would be little more to us than one of the school­
<lb/>boys. Do not, therefore, put us off by saying that
<lb/>one of yours, when he is old enough, shall pay us a
<lb/>visit. To see any of yours at any time, would no
<lb/>doubt give us the highest pleasure; but that does not by
<lb/>any means come up to what we now ask. We now
<lb/>leave the matter before you; consider maturely, and
<lb/>give us your answer.</p>
          <p>O no! I never promised to fill this second sheet. 
<lb/>Good bye to you.</p>

          <p>You have given us too much pleasure lately, not
<lb/>to deserve an earlier acknowledgement. I hope you
<lb/>will believe we were not so dilatory in reading your
<lb/>book,<anchor xml:id="na8" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n8"/> as we have been in thanking you for it. It is
<lb/>indeed a most elegant performance; your thought is
<lb/>very just, and has never, I believe, been pursued be­
<lb/>fore. Both the defects and beauties which you have
<lb/>noticed are very striking, and the result of the whole
<lb/>work, besides the truths it conveys, is a most pleasing
<lb/>impression left upon the mind from the various and
<lb/>picturesque images brought into view. I hope your
<lb/>Essay will bring down our poets from their garrets
<lb/>to wander about the fields and hunt squirrels. I am
<lb/>clearly of your opinion, that the only chance we have
<lb/>for novelty, is by a more accurate observation of the
<lb/>works of Nature, though I think I should not have

<pb n="7"/>
<milestone n="1(4)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">7</mw>

<lb/>confined the track quite so much as you have done
<lb/>to the animal creation, because sooner exhausted than
<lb/>the vegetable; and some of the lines you have quoted
<lb/>from <persName>Thomson</persName>, show with how much advantage the
<lb/>latter may be made the subject of rich description.
<lb/>I think too, since you put me on criticising, it would
<lb/>not have been amiss, if you had drawn the line be­
<lb/>tween the poet and natural historian; and shown how
<lb/>far, and in what cases, the one may avail himself of
<lb/>the knowledge of the other,—at what nice period that
<lb/>knowledge becomes so generally spread, as to author­
<lb/>ize the poetical describer to use it, without shocking
<lb/>the ear by the introduction of names and properties
<lb/>not sufficiently familiar, and when at the same time it
<lb/>retains novelty enough to strike. I have seen some
<lb/>rich descriptions of West Indian flowers and plants,—
<lb/>just, I dare say, but unpleasing merely because their
<lb/>names were uncouth, and forms not known generally
<lb/>enough to be put into verse. It is not, I own, much
<lb/>to the credit of poets,—but it is true,—that we do
<lb/>not seem disposed to take their word for any thing,
<lb/>and never willingly receive <emph rend="slant(italic)">information</emph> from them.</p>
          <p>We are wondrous busy in preparing our play, <title>The
<lb/>Tempest</title>; and four or five of our little ones are to
<lb/>come in as fairies; and I am piecing scraps from the
<lb/><title>Midsummer Night's Dream</title>, &amp;c., to make a
little
<lb/>scene, instead of the mask of <persName>Ceres</persName> and
<persName>Juno</persName>. We
<lb/>have read <persName>Gibbon</persName> lately, who is certainly a
very
<lb/>elegant and learned writer, and a very artful one.
<lb/>No other new books have we yet seen,—they come
<lb/>slow to <placeName>Norfolk</placeName>,—but the
<title>Diaboliad</title>, the author of
<lb/>which has a pretty sharp pen-knife, and cuts up very
<lb/>handsomely. Many are the literary matters I want
<lb/>to talk over with you when we meet, which I now
<lb/>look forward to as not a far-distant pleasure.</p>

<lb/>moment of leisure to write to my dear <persName>Miss
Dixon</persName>;
<lb/>but leisure is one of those things of which I enjoy
<lb/>the least, so I am at length determined to write with­
<lb/>out it. By the way, do you know the pedigree and
<lb/>adventures of Leisure?</p>
          <p>She was born somewhere amongst the Chaldean
<lb/>shepherds, where she became a favourite of
<persName>Urania</persName>;
<lb/>and having been instructed in her sublime philosophy,
<lb/>taught men to observe the course of the stars, and to
<lb/>mark the slow revolution of seasons. The next we
<lb/>hear of her, is in the rural mountains and valleys of
<lb/><placeName>Arcadia</placeName>. In this delightful abode her
charms made
<lb/>a conquest of the god <persName>Pan</persName>, who would often
sit whole
<lb/>days by her side, tuning his pipe of unequal reeds.
<lb/>By him she had two beautiful children, Love and
<lb/>Poetry, the darlings of the shepherds, who received
<lb/>them in their arms, and brought them up amidst the
<lb/>murmur of bees, the falls of water, the lowing of
<lb/>cattle, and the various rural and peaceful sounds with
<lb/>which that region abounded. When the <name>Romans</name>
<lb/>spread the din of arms over the globe, Leisure was
<lb/>frightened from her soft retreats, and from the cold
<lb/><name>Scythian</name> to the tawny <name>Numidian</name> could scarcely find
<lb/>a corner of the world to shelter her head in. When
<lb/>the fierce <name>Goth</name> and <name>Vandal</name> approached, matters were
<lb/>still worse, and Leisure took refuge in a convent on
<lb/>the winding banks of the <placeName>Seine</placeName>, where she
employed

<pb n="9"/>
<milestone n="1(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">9</mw>

<lb/>herself in making anagrams and cutting paper. Her
<lb/>retirement, however, did not pass without censure, for
<lb/>it is said she had an intrigue with the superior of the
<lb/>convent, and that the offspring of this amour was a
<lb/>daughter named Ennui.</p>
          <p>Mademoiselle Ennui was wafted over to
<placeName>England</placeName>
<lb/>in a north-east wind, and settled herself with some of
<lb/>the best families in the kingdom. Indeed the mother
<lb/>seldom makes any long residence in a place without
<lb/>being intruded on by the daughter, who steals in and
<lb/>seats herself silently by her side.</p>
          <p>I hope, however, my amiable friend is now enjoy­
<lb/>ing the company of the mother, without fear of a visit
<lb/>from the daughter, whom her taste and liveliness will,
<lb/>I am sure, ever exclude from her habitation.</p>

and one
<lb/>of our boys, got safe to <placeName>Palgrave</placeName> this
afternoon. And
<lb/>now for the first time, <persName>Mr. Barbauld</persName> and I
experienced
<lb/>the pleasure of having something to come home for,
<lb/>and of finding our dear <persName>Charles</persName> in perfect
health and
<lb/>glad to see us again; though wondering a little, and
<lb/>rather grave the first half-hour. Well, and what have
<lb/>you seen, you will say, in <placeName>London</placeName>? Why, in
the first
<lb/>place, <persName>Miss More's</persName> new play, which fills the
house
<lb/>very well, and is pretty generally liked. <persName>Miss
More</persName>
<lb/>is, I assure you, now very much the ton, and more­
<lb/>over has got six or seven hundred pounds by her play:
<lb/>I wish I could produce one every two winters; we
<lb/>would not keep school. I cannot say however, that
<lb/>I cried altogether so much at <title>Percy</title>, as I laughed at
<lb/><title>the School for Scandal</title>, which is one of the
wittiest
<lb/>plays I remember to have seen; and I am sorry to
<lb/>add, one of the most immoral and licentious;—in
<lb/>principle I mean, for in language it is very decent.
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Montague</persName>, not content with being the queen
of
<lb/>literature and elegant society, sets up for the queen of
<lb/>fashion and splendour. She is building a very fine
<lb/>house, has a very fine service of plate, dresses and
<lb/>visits more than ever; and I am afraid will be full as
<lb/>much the woman of the world as the philosopher.
<lb/>Pray, have you read a book to prove <persName>Falstaff</persName>
no
<lb/>coward? I want to know what you think of it: the
<lb/>present age deals in paradoxes. A new play of
<lb/><persName>Cumberland's</persName>, and another of

<lb/>was found that amidst the multitude of books profes­

<lb/>our turkey and drank our wine as if nothing had hap­
<lb/>pened. In the evening party there was nobody to be
<lb/>pitied but the poor king: and we criticised none but
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Siddons</persName>. It is impossible, however, not
to be
<lb/>kept awake by curiosity, at learning the extraordinary
<lb/>manœuvres and rapid changes that have happened
<lb/>lately. Do you know that at two o'clock on the day

<placeName>London</placeName> we had the good fortune to take part
of a
<lb/>chaise to <placeName>Dover</placeName> with
<persName>Dr. Osborn</persName>. He is a most en­
<lb/>tertaining, agreeable companion; and we never had
<lb/>a more agreeable journey, especially to-day, for yes­
<lb/>terday it was rainy, and we did not get into
<placeName>Rochester</placeName>
<lb/>till nine at night; consequently lost in a great meas­
<lb/>ure the windings of the silver <placeName>Medway</placeName>. But to-day
<lb/>was uniformly fine; and greatly delighted we were
<lb/>with the view of <placeName>Chatham</placeName>,
<placeName>Stroud</placeName>, and <placeName>Rochester</placeName>,
<lb/>from a hill just above the town, which we walked up.
	    <lb/>The <placeName>Medway</placeName> makes a fine bend here. The hop­
<lb/>pickers were at work as we went along, but not with
<lb/>their usual alacrity; for the late storm has blasted
<lb/>them to such a degree, that twenty thousand pounds
<lb/>worth of damage, they say, is done. The country is
<lb/>beautifully variegated all the way, and has many fine
<lb/>seats; among which <persName>Sir Horace Man's</persName> was
pointed
<lb/>out. From this rich inclosed country you come to
<lb/>the open downs, more grand and striking. The first
	    <lb/>view of <name>Dover castle</name> is noble; and still
more finished
<lb/>that of the town, which we saw from <persName>Dr. <choice><abbr>O.'s</abbr><expan>Osborn's</expan></choice></persName> house
<lb/>where we dined. It has the castle on one side, hills
<lb/>on the other, a valley between (in which is the town,)
<lb/>and the sea beyond. I think we shall hardly see more
<lb/>beautiful scenes in <placeName>France</placeName>. We here took
leave of
<lb/>our last English friends.—I forgot to say we took a
<lb/>hasty peep at the venerable cathedral of
<placeName>Canterbury</placeName>,
<lb/>to which I would at any time willingly go a pilgrim­
<lb/>age—though not barefoot.</p>

<lb/>to you. From <placeName>Troyes</placeName> we proceeded to
<placeName>Dijon</placeName> by a
<lb/>road so delightful, that I strongly wished my sister
<lb/>and you could have been with me,—a wish, which I
<lb/>cannot help forming, though a vain one, whenever
<lb/>any object particularly pleasant presents itself. During
<lb/>the greatest part of this road we had the full view of
<lb/>the <placeName>Seine</placeName>, which we traced upwards to
within half a
<lb/>league of its source, and saw it grow less and less,
<lb/>untwisting, as it were, to a single thread. The valley
<lb/>in which it ran was narrow, of a beautiful verdure,
<lb/>and bounded by hills of the most gentle ascent, cover­
<lb/>ed with trees or herbage: cattle of all sorts, among
<lb/>which were several flocks of goats, were feeding in
<lb/>sight. The road often ran upon the ascent; and we
<lb/>saw the river, sometimes bordered with trees and
<lb/>sometimes fringed with grass or rushes, winding be­
<lb/>neath in the most sportive meanders,—for we saw
<lb/>and lost it nine times from one spot. The scene was
<lb/>in general solitary; but if we came to a spot particu­
<lb/>larly pleasant, it was sure to be marked by a convent,
<lb/>the neatness of which, (generally white,) added to
<lb/>the beauty of the scene. After we had lost the
<lb/><placeName>Seine</placeName>, we came to the <placeName>Val de
Suson</placeName>, a still more ro­
<lb/>mantic place, and very like <placeName>Middleton Dale</placeName>,
only that
<lb/>the rocks were richly covered with trees. Through
<lb/>the first part of this valley runs the river
<placeName>Suson</placeName>; the
<lb/>rest is still narrower, and between high rocks.</p>
          <p>At <placeName>Dijon</placeName> we delivered our first letter of
recom­
<lb/>mendation, which introduced us to <persName>M. de
Morveau</persName>, a
<lb/>man of great merit, who was <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">avocat-général</foreign>, but has
<lb/>quitted his profession for the sake of applying himself
<lb/>to philosophical studies, and chiefly chemical. He
<lb/>writes all the chemical articles in the <title>New Encyclo­
<lb/>pedie</title>. He esteems <persName>Dr. Priestley</persName>,
<persName>Dr. Black</persName>, and
<lb/><persName>Mr. Kirwan</persName>, to be the chief men in
<placeName>England</placeName> in the
<lb/>philosophical way. <persName>M. de Morveau</persName> was one of

<lb/>first who ascended in a balloon. He showed us their
<lb/>Academy, which is one of the first provincial ones.
<lb/>The <placeName rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">Palais des
Etats</placeName> in <placeName>Dijon</placeName> is the finest
building
<lb/>in it; the front of it forms one side of a very hand­
<lb/>some square, and the wings extend much beyond it.
<lb/>It is adorned with statues and paintings by the pupils
<lb/>of the drawing-school. From the tower, on which is
<lb/>an observatory belonging to this building, is a charm­
<lb/>ing view of the country: the hills of
<placeName>Burgundy</placeName> cov­
<lb/>ered with vines; the rivers of <placeName>Ouche</placeName> and
<placeName>Suson</placeName>,
<lb/>which encircle the town; and the town itself, which
<lb/>is large though not very populous. In our way from
<lb/><placeName>Dijon</placeName> to <placeName>Dole</placeName> we saw
more of the vintage than we 
<lb/>had hitherto done,—and a gay scene it is, though I
<lb/>must confess my disappointment at the first sight of
<lb/>the vines,—which are very low, and nothing like so
<lb/>beautiful as our apple-trees. They say they have
<lb/>more wine this year than they can possibly find ves­
<lb/>sels to put it in; and yet the road was covered with
<lb/>teams of casks, empty or full, according as they were
<lb/>going out or returning, and drawn by oxen whose
<lb/> strong necks seemed to be bowed unwillingly under
<lb/>the yoke. Men, women, and children were abroad:
<lb/>some cutting with a short sickle the bunches of grapes;
<lb/>some breaking them with a wooden instrument; some
<lb/>carrying them on their backs from the gatherers to
<lb/>those who pressed the juice; and, as in our harvest,
<lb/>the gleaners followed. From <placeName>Dole</placeName> we should
have
<lb/>gone directly to <placeName>Besançon</placeName>, but were
induced to strike
<lb/>out of the road, to visit the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">grottes stalactites</foreign> of <placeName>Aux­
<lb/>celles</placeName>, to see which we crossed in a ferry the river
<lb/><placeName>Doux</placeName>, a fine stream with banks beautifully
wooded,
<lb/>and got into a place most wild and solitary, through
<lb/>such terrible bad roads, that what we thought would
<lb/>have been the affair of a few hours, detained us there
<lb/>the whole night: the grotto, however, repaid our

<lb/>trouble. Had you been there, you would have seen
<lb/>it with a more philosophical eye, and have told us
<lb/>how the continual dropping of waters through those
<lb/>rocks, forms those beautiful petrifications, which when
<lb/>polished, as they sometimes are, have the lustre and
<lb/>transparency of crystal. But it required only eyes,
<lb/>to be struck with the view of a vast subterranean
<lb/>running through a whole rock, which had the appear­
<lb/>ance of a most magnificent Gothic church;—tombs,
<lb/>images, drapery, pillars, shrines, all formed without
<lb/>much aid from fancy, by nature working alone for
<lb/>ages in these long and lofty caverns. We walked in
<lb/>it, I believe, about two furlongs, and it might be an­
<lb/>other to the end. <placeName>Besançon</placeName> is by far
the best town
<lb/>we have seen; the streets are long and regular, the
<lb/>hotels of the chief inhabitants, palaces for princes, and
<lb/>the public buildings noble. But you would have been
<lb/>most struck with the hospital, managed in all the in­
<lb/>ternal part by those good nuns <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">Les Hospitalieres</foreign>, with
<lb/>such perfect neatness, that in a long chamber contain­
<lb/>ing thirty-five beds, most of them full, there was not
<lb/>any closeness or smell to be perceived. The beds
<lb/>were of white cotton, and by each bed a table and
<lb/>chair. Some of the nuns were attending here; others
<lb/>in the dispensary making up medicines; others in
<lb/>the kitchen making broths, &amp;c.: and all this they do
<lb/>without salary, and many of them are of good fami­
<lb/>lies.</p>

<lb/>that with less injustice to my feelings, I may thank you
<lb/>for your charming letter. It is not necessary for <emph rend="slant(italic)">you</emph> to
<lb/>travel in order to write good verses; and indeed to say
<lb/>truth, in the actual journey many things occur not alto­
<lb/>gether so consonant with the fine ideas, one would wish
<lb/>to keep upon one's mind. The dirt and bustle of inns,
<lb/>and the various circumstances, odd or disgusting, of a
<lb/>French <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">diligence</foreign>, are not made to shine in poetry.
<lb/>I shall, however, keep your exhortation in mind; and
<lb/>when, to complete the inspiration, I have drunk of the
<lb/>fountain of <placeName>Vaucluse</placeName>, which we are going to
do, if the
<lb/>Muse is not favourable, you may fairly conclude I no

we
<lb/>took the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">diligence
d'eau</foreign> down the <placeName>Rhone</placeName> to this place,
<lb/>a voyage which in summer, and in a vehicle more
<lb/>neat and convenient, would have been delightful. But
<lb/>we had incessant rain for two of the days; and the
<lb/>third, though bright, was very cold, with a great deal
<lb/>of wind; so that we did not reach <placeName>Avignon</placeName>
till the

<pb n="21"/>

<lb/>morning of the fourth day. The <placeName>Rhone</placeName> is rapid
all
<lb/>the way; but at <placeName>Pont St. Esprit</placeName>
particularly so, in­
<lb/>somuch that many passengers get out there: we did
<lb/>not. The <placeName>Rhone</placeName> has high banks all the way,
or
<lb/>rather is inclosed between hills, covered in many
<lb/>places with vines and pasturage, in others pretty bar­
<lb/>ren. Near <placeName>St. Esprit</placeName> begins the olive
country. This
<lb/>was the first time we had been in a public voiture; it
<lb/>is a very reputable one, and yet you cannot conceive
<lb/>the shabbiness and <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">mal
propreté</foreign> of the boat.</p>
          <p>We are now in a land of vermicelli, soup, and ma­
<lb/>caroni,—a land of onions and garlic,—a land
flowing
<lb/>with oil and wine. <placeName>Avignon</placeName> is delightfully
situated;
<lb/>the <placeName>Rhone</placeName> forms two branches here, and
incloses a
<lb/>large fertile island. The <placeName>Durance</placeName> (another
fine river,
<lb/>at present so overflowed that it is not passable,) joins
<lb/>the <placeName>Rhone</placeName> some way below the town. The
churches
<lb/>here are numerous, highly adorned, and have several
<lb/>good paintings. The streets are darkened with cowls
<lb/>and filled with beggars; drawn here, they say, by the
<lb/>strangers,—for the people are no ways oppressed by
<lb/>the government, the revenue to the pope hardly
<lb/>paying the expenses. We are not yet, however, in
<lb/>the climate of perpetual spring;—like an enchanted
<lb/>island, it seems to fly from us. All along the course
<lb/>of the <placeName>Rhone</placeName> there are cold
winds. <placeName>Lyons</placeName> is disa­
<lb/>greeable in winter, both with fogs and cold. At <placeName>Ge­
<lb/>neva</placeName>, every body had fires and winter dresses before
<lb/>we left it; and <placeName>Avignon</placeName>, though much
warmer, is not
<lb/>enough so to invite us much abroad, or permit us to
<lb/>dispense with fires. To-morrow we set off for
<placeName>Orange</placeName>,
<lb/>and from thence shall go to <placeName>Lisle</placeName>, perhaps to <placeName>Mar­
<lb/>seilles</placeName>; but where we shall spend these next two
<lb/>months, we have not yet determined. May you and

          <p>I forgot to tell you that all the people speak <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">patois</foreign>
<lb/>to one another, though they speak <name>French</name> too; and

<lb/>ed by the <placeName>Arve</placeName>, which meanders through it
in the
<lb/>most sportive manner, making several islands, and
<lb/>beyond <placeName>Geneva</placeName> falls into the
<placeName>Rhone</placeName>. The vintage is
<lb/>not here got in, so that the vineyards are still in their
<lb/>beauty. On the other side <placeName>Saléve</placeName>,
the mountains
<lb/>open upon you in all their grandeur. <persName>Mr. <choice><abbr>B.</abbr><expan>Barbauld</expan></choice></persName> is gone
<lb/>to the Glaciers, to feast his eyes with a nearer view
<lb/>of these stupendous mountains; but I thought the ex­
<lb/>pedition beyond my strength, and I am during his
<lb/>absence in a family of <name>Genevois</name>, who are very good
<lb/>kind of people.</p>
          <p>Will you hear how they pass the <name>Sunday</name> at <placeName>Gene­
<lb/>va</placeName>? They have service at seven in the morning, at
<lb/>nine, and at two; after that they assemble in parties

<pb n="24"/>
<milestone n="2(6)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">24</mw>

<lb/>for conversation, cards, and dancing, and finish the
<lb/>day at the theatre. Did not you think they had been
<lb/>stricter at <placeName>Geneva</placeName>, than to have plays on
	    the <name>Sunday</name>,
<lb/>especially as it is but two or three years since they
<lb/>were allowed at all? The service at their churches
<lb/>is seldom much more than an hour, and I believe few
<lb/>people go more than once a day. As soon as the
<lb/>text is named, the minister puts on his hat, in which
<lb/>he is followed by all the congregation, except those
<lb/>whose hats and heads have never had any connexion;
<lb/>for you well know that to put his hat upon his head,
	    <lb/>is the last use a well-dressed <name>Frenchman</name> would think
<lb/>of putting it to. At proper periods of the discourse,
<lb/>the minister stops short, and turns his back to you, in
<lb/>order to blow his nose, which is a signal for all the
<lb/>congregation to do the same; and a glorious concert
<lb/>it is, for the weather is already severe, and people
<lb/>have got colds. I am told, too, that he takes this
<lb/>time to refresh his memory by peeping at his sermon,
<lb/>which lies behind him in the pulpit.</p>
          <p>Nobody ought to be too old to improve: I should
<lb/>be sorry if I was; and I flatter myself I have already
<lb/>improved considerably by my travels. First, I can
<lb/>swallow gruel soup, egg soup, and all manner of soups,
<lb/>without making faces much. Secondly, I can pretty
<lb/>well live without tea; they give it, however, at
<placeName>Ge­
<lb/>neva</placeName>. Thirdly, I am less and less shocked, and hope
<lb/>in time I shall be quite easy at seeing gentlemen, per­
<lb/>haps perfect strangers, enter my room without cere­
<lb/>mony when I am in my bedgown. I would not have
<lb/>you think, however, I am in danger of losing my
<lb/>modesty; for if I am no longer affected at some
<lb/>things, I have learned to blush at others; and I will
<lb/>tell you, as a friend, that I believe there is but one
<lb/>indecency in <placeName>France</placeName>, which is, for a man
and his wife
<lb/>to have the same sleeping-room. <said><foreign xml:lang="fr">Est ce votre cham­

<lb/>shooting up its graceful spire of a deeper and more
<lb/>lively green, far above the heads of its humbler but

<lb/>and for this last fortnight they have had prodigious
<lb/>rains, with the interruption of only a few days; so
<lb/>that the streets are very dirty and the roads broken up.
<lb/>But they say this is very extraordinary, and that if

<lb/>will not, however, boast too much over you from
<lb/>these advantages; for I am ready to confess the

          <p>From <placeName>Avignon</placeName> (whence I wrote to you last) we
<lb/>went to <placeName>Orange</placeName>, where we were gratified
with the
<lb/>sight of an arc of triumph entire, of rich architec­
<lb/>ture; and though the delicacy of the sculpture is
<lb/>much defaced by time, it is easy to see what it must
<lb/>have been when fresh. There is likewise a noble
<lb/>ruin of an amphitheatre built against a rock, of which
<lb/>you may trace the whole extent, though the area is
<lb/>filled with cottages. These were the first remains of
<lb/>antiquity of any consequence I had seen, and they
<lb/>impressed me with an idea of Roman grandeur.
<lb/><placeName>Orange</placeName> is a poor town, but the country is
green and
<lb/>pleasant, and they have all country houses. When
<lb/>the principality came under French government, it
<lb/>was promised that they should have no fresh taxes
<lb/>imposed; but <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">peu à
peu</foreign>, say they, taxes are come.
<lb/>They had salt springs which more than supplied them
<lb/>with that article;—they are forbidden to work them.
<lb/>They grew tobacco;—now, if any one has more than
<lb/>three plants in his garden, he is punished. From
<lb/><placeName>Orange</placeName> we went to
<placeName>Lisle</placeName>. In the way we stopped
<lb/>at <placeName>Carpentras</placeName>, where we were shown another
arc
<lb/>of triumph, over which a cardinal, the bishop of
<lb/><placeName>Carpentras</placeName>, built his kitchen; very wisely
judging
<lb/>that nothing was more worthy to enter through an
<lb/>arc of triumph, than a noble haunch of venison or
<lb/>an exquisite ragoo. <placeName>Lisle</placeName> is a small town,
very
<lb/>pleasant in summer, because it is surrounded with
<lb/>water; and still more noted for its neighbourhood
<lb/>to the source of that water, the celebrated fountain
<lb/>of <placeName>Vaucluse</placeName>.</p>
          <p>During the few fair days we have had, the warmth
<lb/>and power of the sun has been equal to our summer
<lb/>days: it is truly delightful to feel such a sun in
	    <lb/><name>December;</name> to be able to saunter by the shore of the
<lb/><placeName>Mediterranean</placeName>, or sit on the bank and enjoy
the pros­

<lb/>pect of an extensive open sea, smooth and calm as a
<lb/>large lake. It is likewise very pleasant to gain an
<lb/>hour more of daylight upon these short days. How­
<lb/>ever, though the middle of the day is so warm, in the
<lb/>mornings and evenings a fire is acceptable, I must
<lb/>confess.</p>
          <p>The <name>Marseillians</name> value themselves upon being a
<lb/>kind of republic, and their port is free: the lower
<lb/>rank are bold and rude; the upper, by what I hear,
<lb/>very corrupt in their manners. There are 30,000
	    <lb/><name>Protestants</name>: their place of worship is a country house,
<lb/>which they have hired of the commandant himself.
<lb/>They meet with no molestation, and hope from the
<lb/>temper of the times that they shall ere long have
<lb/>leave to build a church. The minister is an agree­
<lb/>able and literary man, and is very obliging towards us;
<lb/>his wife has been six years in <placeName>England</placeName>, and
speaks
	    <lb/><name>English</name> well. Her family fled there from persecu­
<lb/>tion; for her grandfather, (who was a minister) was
<lb/>seized as he came out from a church where he had
<lb/>been officiating, by the soldiers. His son, who had
<lb/>fled along with the crowd and gained an eminence at
<lb/>some distance, seeing they had laid hold on his father,
<lb/>came and offered himself in his stead; and in his
<lb/>stead was sent to the galleys, where he continued
<lb/>seven years. <title rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">L'honnête Criminal</title> is founded on this
<lb/>fact. Besides this family we have hardly any ac­
<lb/>quaintance here, nor are like to have. We have,
<lb/>however, been two or three times with the
<name>Chanoines
<lb/>de St. Victor</name>, who are all of the best families of
<lb/><placeName>France</placeName>, as they must prove their nobility
for 150
<lb/>years. They are very polite and hospitable, and far
<lb/>enough from bigots; for we were surprised to find
<lb/>how freely to us they censured auricular confession,
<lb/>the celibacy of the clergy, and laughed at some of
<lb/>their legendary miracles. I forgot to say that the

<pb n="29"/>
<milestone n="3(3)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">29</mw>

<lb/>country about <placeName>Marseilles</placeName> is covered with
country­
<lb/>houses; they reckon 10,000. They were first begun
<lb/>to be built on account of the plague: every body has
<lb/>one. There is a fine picture of the terrible plague
<lb/>here at the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">Consigne</foreign>, and another at the Town-house.
<lb/>They are very exact at present in their precautions. 
<lb/>I am sure the plague cannot be occasioned merely by
<lb/>want of cleanliness, for then <placeName>Marseilles</placeName>
could not
<lb/>escape.</p>
          <p>Remember that we are longing for letters, and that
<lb/>news from you will be more grateful to us, than groves

we stay­

<lb/>(the Play excepted), but what we could procure to
<lb/>ourselves by reading or walking. Some delightful
<lb/>walks we did take under a bright sun and a clear blue
<lb/>sky, which would have done honour to the fairest

<lb/>It is used as a prison for extravagant or disorderly

<placeName>France</placeName> the folly of the day. There is a
society at
<lb/><placeName>Marseilles</placeName> for that purpose composed of
gentlemen.
<lb/>They boast they can lay asleep, when they please,
<lb/>and for as long as they please; and that during this
<lb/>sleep or trance, the mind can see the operations going
<lb/>forward in the corporeal machine, and predict future
<lb/>events. One of them offered to try his skill on <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Barbauld</persName>; but after a long and unpleasant operation
<lb/>of rubbing the temples and forhead, he was obliged
<lb/>to desist without success. <persName>Mr. Howard</persName> will
tell you,
<lb/>however, they operate better at <placeName>Lyons</placeName>, as
he saw
<lb/>several women at the hospital put to sleep in a minute
<lb/>by only passing the hand over their forehead.</p>
          <p>At <placeName>Marseilles</placeName> we again bought a carriage (an
Eng­
<lb/>lish chaise), in which we hope to perform the rest of
<lb/>our journey, at least to <placeName>Paris</placeName>. The road
from <placeName>Mar­
<lb/>seilles</placeName> to <placeName>Toulon</placeName> is over
mountains which, though not
<lb/>very high, are the beginning of the
<placeName>Alps</placeName>. They are,
<lb/>in many parts, quite naked and craggy; in others,
covered with forests of pines! and in many, they have
<lb/>had the industry to make terraces one over another
<lb/>to the very top, on which they have planted vines,
<lb/>though the culture must demand prodigious labour,
<lb/>for they must bring all the earth. The almond trees,
<lb/>which are now in full flower, scattered here and there,
<lb/>embellish the scene. At <placeName>Toulon</placeName> we saw the
arsenal,
<lb/>which contains the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">corderie</foreign>, the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">salle d'armes</foreign>, the
<lb/>naval stores, &amp;c. There is something horrible in the
<lb/>clanking of the chains of the galley-slaves, who are
<lb/>chained two-and-two, and employed in various works
<lb/>within the place. Three or four galleys lie in the
<lb/>harbour, but they are not used except for lodging the
<lb/><foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">forçats</foreign>. From
<placeName>Toulon</placeName> we went to
<placeName>Hieres</placeName>;—and
<lb/>how, think you, did we go? On foot every step of the
<lb/>way, and it is nine miles at least. We went on foot
<lb/>because the roads are still so bad we dared not ven­

<lb/>ture in a carriage. <placeName>Hieres</placeName> is a specimen of the
Italian
<lb/>climate and Italian productions: to the south it is
<lb/>open to the sea; every other quarter is fenced with
<lb/>hills. The town lies on the descent of a hill, and is
<lb/>surrounded with groves of orange and lemon trees,
<lb/>glowing in the brightest beauty, and with all the
<lb/>variety of colour, from the palest lemon to the deep
<lb/>and almost blood-red species of orange. The leaves,
<lb/>of a vivid green, give a relief to the fruit, which is in
<lb/>so great an abundance that I have hardly seen apple-
<lb/>trees so full. It is a delicious spot, quite the gardens
	    <lb/>of the <name>Hesperides</name>, and enjoys a constant verdure.
<lb/>The hedges are composed of myrtle, holm-oak, and
<lb/>lentisk, of the ashes of which latter they make a lye,
<lb/>with which they preserve their raisins. They gather
<lb/>green peas soon after <name>Christmas</name>: every month brings
<lb/>its peculiar harvest. Besides the corn, wine, and oil,
<lb/>which they share in common with their neighbours,
<lb/>they have vast quantities of strawberries, peaches,
<lb/>kidney-beans, all kinds of fruit and garden stuff.
<lb/>Sweet waters and essences are distilled from the
<lb/>orange flowers, and the peel of the bergamot, the
<lb/>cedrat, and some other kinds valuable for their fra­
<lb/>grance. Some of the orange gardens are worth from
<lb/>twenty to twenty-six thousand livres a year. From
<lb/>an opposite hill there is a view of the town; above it,
	    <lb/>a convent of <name>Bernardines</name>, and higher still, the ruined
<lb/>walls and castle of the old town; the whole surround­
<lb/>ed with a bright circle of green and gold, and houses
<lb/>of a shining white in the midst of the orange gardens;
<lb/>further, the paler green of the olives; to the south,
<lb/>the sea, and the fishery salt-works; and opposite,
<lb/>the islands of <placeName>Hieres</placeName>, where is plenty of
game.
<lb/>Winter is seen peeping at this little paradise from
<lb/>the top of a distant mountain covered with snow; and
<lb/>sometimes, indeed, he sends a hoar frost—after which,
<lb/>the oranges drop by hundreds from the trees.</p>

<lb/>good deal to be seen; but we are confined to our
<lb/>room by a pretty heavy fall of snow, which has con­
<lb/>tinued the whole day. We are at present convinced
<lb/>that it is a vain expectation to escape from winter by
<lb/>going to the southern climates,—at
<placeName>Bengal</placeName> I suppose
<lb/>it may be done: but the southern provinces of
<placeName>France</placeName>
<lb/>differ more in the duration than in the degree of their
<lb/>winter; and beyond all doubt they have more sudden
<lb/>and violent <emph>changes</emph> of weather
than we have. In
<lb/>consequence they dress warmer than we do. The
<lb/>pelisse, the muff, the fur gloves and shoes, the hussar
<lb/>cloak and flannel linings, are all common here, and
<lb/>found necessary. Yet it is also true that through a
<lb/>great part of the winter they enjoy the most delicious
<lb/>weather; and that with regard to one or other of
<lb/>their productions, there is not any time of the year in
<lb/>which you do not meet with harvest or blossoms; for
<lb/>before the gathering of olives is over, the almond-tree
<lb/>is in flower. Till within these four days we have had
<lb/>fine weather for a long time; and <placeName>Lower
Languedoc</placeName>,
<lb/>through which our route has lain since we crossed the
<lb/><placeName>Rhone</placeName>, has worn all the lovely features of
spring.
<lb/>At <placeName>Pezenas</placeName> (the last place where we made
any stay)
<lb/>the peach, apricot, and bean were beginning to blos­
<lb/>som; the gardens were all green with various vege­
<lb/>tables, the fields with corn, and a few trees were even
<lb/>in leaf. But their springs are apt to be premature.
<lb/>Here (in <placeName>Upper Languedoc</placeName>) it is colder.</p>
            <p>Gratified as we have been by the spring of Nature,
<lb/>we have been no less so by the hoary ruins of Anti­
<lb/>quity. The vast cirque of the amphitheatre at <placeName>Nis­
<lb/>mes</placeName> fills the mind with an amazing idea of Roman
<lb/>greatness. It is defaced by a number of buildings in

<lb/>ruin, as we do in <placeName>England</placeName>. <placeName rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">La maison
Carrée</placeName> is a
<lb/><foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">bijou</foreign>; it has
all that the utmost delicacy and richness
<lb/>of architecture can give. But we prefer to them both,
	      <lb/>the <name>Pont du Gard</name>.</p>
            <p><placeName>Nismes</placeName> is the very centre of the
	      <name>Protestants</name>.
<lb/>They are computed to be 30,000, and the richest
	      <lb/>part of the inhabitants: for here, as the <name>Dissenters</name> in
<lb/><placeName>England</placeName>, they give themselves to
trade. They have
<lb/>no church, nor even barn; but assemble in the <emph rend="slant(italic)">desert</emph>,
<lb/>as they call it, in the open air, in a place surrounded
<lb/>by rocks which reverberate the voice. The pulpit is
<lb/>moveable, and there are a few seats of stone for the
<lb/>elders. On their great festivals, they say, the sight is
<lb/>very striking.</p>
            <p>I wish you, who have a quarrel to some of our
<lb/>English axioms of taste in gardening, could see the
<lb/>public walks of <placeName>Nismes</placeName> and
<placeName>Montpelier</placeName>; both, (espe­
<lb/>cially the latter) laid out with great magnificence,
<lb/>but quite in the old style of terraces, fountains, straight
<lb/>alleys, and exact symmetry: but the whole is great, and
<lb/>was to me very new. We intended to have taken
<lb/>the canal at <placeName>Beziers</placeName>, but the bad weather
prevented
<lb/>us. From <placeName>Narbonne</placeName> till near
<placeName>Thoulouse</placeName> we had on
<lb/>our left a long chain of mountains, the
<placeName>Pyrenees</placeName>. I
<lb/>love to see those everlasting boundaries of nations.
<lb/>We had not, however, any wish to cross them and try
<lb/>the Spanish accommodations—there are difficulties
<lb/>enow of that kind in <placeName>France</placeName>. This is the
height of
<lb/>the Carnival, and we have seen as we came along,
<lb/>the dance on the green, and the mask by torch­
<lb/>light; but in general I am afraid there is a good deal
<lb/>of coarseness in the mirth of the vulgar, and of licen­
<lb/>tiousness in the gaiety of the rich. From
<placeName>Narbonne</placeName>
<lb/>to <placeName>Thoulouse</placeName> there are a great many
<foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">chateaus</foreign>, pom­
<lb/>pous buildings with towers, but no ornamented grounds
<lb/>about them as in <placeName>England</placeName>, nor any thing in
the

<pb n="35"/>

<lb/>avenues, hedges, &amp;c. that has a look of neatness. I
<lb/>fancy the rats hold a glorious <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">sabat</foreign> in some of them.—
<lb/>I should tell you that at <placeName>Montpelier</placeName> we saw
the ana­
<lb/>tomical theatre, where they have two hundred students,
<lb/>who shave and dress hair, to pay their board and lodg­
<lb/>ing, and attend dissections and study surgery with
<lb/>great application the rest of their time: and they say
<lb/>they make a better progress than those that have
<lb/>money. I am sorry I cannot send you a slip of
<lb/><persName>Rabelais'</persName> scarlet gown, with which sacred
relique the
<lb/>students are invested when they take their degrees.
<lb/>The meaning of which I take to be this,—that laugh­
<lb/>ing may cure you when physic would miss.</p>
            <p>The situation of <placeName>Thoulouse</placeName> seems calculated
for
<lb/>trade, as the noble canal of <placeName>Languedoc</placeName>
meets there
<lb/>the still more noble river of the <placeName>Garonne</placeName>;
yet it is
<lb/>not commercial, as the great ambition of all the rich
<lb/>inhabitants is directed towards gaining a seat in par­
<lb/>liament, which ennobles them; and then they leave
<lb/>trade. You may guess with what feelings we saw
<lb/>the seat of that parliament which condemned
<persName>Calas</persName>.
<lb/>The spirit of the times, however, thank Heaven! is
<lb/>greatly altered.</p>

<lb/>The road from <placeName>Thoulouse</placeName> to this town is
remarkably
<lb/>pleasant. It lies mostly along the banks of the
<placeName>Garonne</placeName>,
<lb/>and several fine rivers which fall into it; the
<placeName>Tarne</placeName>,
<lb/>the <placeName>Aveyron</placeName>, &amp;c. On the other side is a
ridge of
<lb/>hilly ground quite sandy, covered with vines, which
<lb/>indeed have a most desolate appearance at this time
<lb/>of the year; but fancy can spread the foliage and
<lb/>change the purple clusters. On the river-side are fine
<lb/>rich valleys covered with corn, and here and there
<lb/>pasture ground:—no more olives, but groves of oak;
<lb/>no more almond-blossoms, but hedges of hawthorn.
	      <lb/>On <name>Shrove Tuesday</name> (which was a remarkably fine

<pb n="36"/>

<mw type="pageNum">36</mw>

<lb/>day) every town and every village was poured out
<lb/>upon the road, all dressed, and dancing each lad with
<lb/>his lass. What I should not have supposed, they
	      <lb/>dance too on <name>Ash Wednesday;</name> for though the church­
<lb/>es were pretty full in the morning, of dismal-looking
<lb/>figures in black hoods, who came to confess the sins
<lb/>of the Carnival, the greater part put the English in­
<lb/>terpretation upon a holy day, and considered it as a
<lb/>holiday. Though we have not yet seen much of
<lb/><placeName>Bourdeaux</placeName>, a walk this afternoon has
convinced us, it
<lb/>is a more magnificent town than any we have yet
<lb/>seen in <placeName>France</placeName>. It happens too to be the fair.</p>

          <div rend="pre(#ornament)" type="entry">
            <p>…The road from <placeName>Tours</placeName> to
<placeName>Orleans</placeName> on the
<lb/>winding banks of the <placeName>Loire</placeName>, is delightfully
pleasant;
<lb/>but we had not fine weather enough to enjoy all its
<lb/>beauty; for we have had the second winter you speak
<lb/>of, in all its severity of snow and frost. We were
<lb/>particularly pleased, however, with
<placeName>Tours</placeName>. It has
<lb/>one street of more complete beauty than any <emph rend="slant(italic)">street</emph> I
<lb/>have yet seen, terminated at one end, by a fine bridge
<lb/>over the <placeName>Loire</placeName>, at the other, by one of the
noblest
<lb/>malls in the kingdom. <placeName>Blois</placeName> is delightful
from its
<lb/>situation, and interesting from the events which have
<lb/>taken place within its now deserted
walls. <placeName>Orleans</placeName>
<lb/>is entirely a town of commerce; and it seems to
<lb/>flourish, for they live remarkably well there. Trade
<lb/>may have been despised formerly in <placeName>France</placeName>;
but I
<lb/>am sure it cannot, now there are such towns as
<placeName>Lyons</placeName>,
<lb/><placeName>Bourdeaux</placeName>, and
<placeName>Orleans</placeName>, where it displays its effects
<lb/>in all the pride of opulence. We have been now a
<lb/>month in <placeName>Paris</placeName>, and here the objects of
curiosity
<lb/>crowd upon us. In the provinces, they are scattered
<lb/>here and there; but in the capital,—palaces, pictures,

<pb n="37"/>
<milestone n="4(1)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">37</mw>

<lb/>statues, public gardens, meet you at every step, and
<lb/>all the powers of observation and organs of perception
<lb/>are agreeably filled. The societies of
<placeName>Paris</placeName> do not
<lb/>obtrude themselves in like manner on your notice; on
<lb/>the contrary, it is pretty difficult to get sufficiently
<lb/>into them to judge of their complexion and character.
<lb/>We shall have been, however, in a few of them, and
	      <lb/>shall have seen many agreeable individuals. <name>English</name>
<lb/>is very much studied here at present: there are a
<lb/>great many who read, and some who talk it. Every
<lb/>thing of English fabric and workmanship is preferred
<lb/>here, and not without reason. They have an idea
	      <lb/>here very contrary to ours; for they say, The <name>English</name>
	      <lb/>invent, and the <name>French</name> bring to perfection. They are
<lb/>going to inclose all <placeName>Paris</placeName> and its suburbs
by an im­
<lb/>mense wall: it puts one in mind of hedging in the 
<lb/>cuckoo; but it is to prevent smuggling. We have
<lb/>had the good fortune to get very clean lodgings: they
<lb/>are near the <placeName>Pont Royal</placeName> and the
<placeName>Tuilleries</placeName>, both
<lb/>which we often cross, and never without fresh admi­
<lb/>ration at the number of beautiful buildings and gay
<lb/>objects. I like the gardens of the
<placeName>Tuilleries</placeName> better
<lb/>than our <placeName>St. James's Park</placeName>; for though they
are some­
<lb/>what disgraced by the old-fashioned parterre, yet on
<lb/>the whole they are more gay, more lively: the view
<lb/>from the terrace commands a greater variety of ob­
<lb/>jects; the <placeName>Tuilleries</placeName> is more adorned; and
the various
<lb/>groups of all ranks,—some taking lemonade, some
<lb/>sitting on the grass, some even reading,—give an air
<lb/>of ease and enjoyment more than is to be seen in our
<lb/>Park. This is rather an unfortunate time for seeing
<lb/>paintings, as the king's pictures are all taken down in
<lb/>order to be arranged and put up in the gallery of the
<lb/><placeName>Louvre</placeName>, which is preparing for their
reception: and
<lb/>when that fine building is filled with so noble a collec­
<lb/>tion, it will have few things in <placeName>Europe</placeName>
superior.</p>

            <p>One great advantage which <placeName>Paris</placeName> has as a
town
<lb/>over <placeName>London</placeName> is its <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">quais</foreign>, by which means they
enjoy
<lb/>their river and the fine buildings upon it. As to the
<lb/>streets, most of them are certainly narrow, but not
<lb/>absolutely impracticable to the poor <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">piéton</foreign>, as I had
<lb/>been taught to believe; for when not dressed, I walk
<lb/>about a good deal. They say, however, a great
<lb/>many accidents happen, which their boasted police
<lb/>takes more care to stifle than to prevent: if a man is
<lb/>run over by a coach, they dare not put it in any pub­
<lb/>lic papers. The streets are full of little cabriolets,
<lb/>which drive very fast: they are forbidden, but people
<lb/>have them notwithstanding. We have been at two of
<lb/>their Academies, that of <name rend="slant(italic)">Sciences</name> and that of <name rend="slant(italic)">Belles-
<lb/>lettres</name>. Several <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">éloges</foreign> were read,
well drawn up;
<lb/>prizes proposed, &amp;c. They clap hands as at the
<lb/>play-house, when a sentiment or expression pleases
<lb/>them. The theatre sinks in <placeName>France</placeName> as well
as
<lb/><placeName>England</placeName>; for as
<persName>Mrs. Siddons</persName> stands alone, we may
<lb/>well say it sinks. They are building a very fine
<lb/>church, <name>St. Geneviève</name>; and in general there is
a
<lb/>good deal of new building, as well as in
<placeName>London</placeName>. We
<lb/>have yet a vast deal to see; but we shall see it as
<lb/>fast as we can, that we may return to those friends
<lb/>who will be only dearer to us from absence.</p>

cry out
<lb/>with <persName>Simkin</persName>,
<quote rend="align(center)break(yes)">Methinks we're a wonderful
distance from home.</quote>
<lb/>The scenes we have passed through, gratify curiosity
<lb/>and fill the imagination; but you, my dear friend, in
<lb/>the mean time have found yourself in situations which
<lb/>awaken feelings the most tender and interesting
<lb/>…May you experience, may you feel, all
<lb/>the sympathies, all the tender charities of every rela­
<lb/>tion, all of which you are so fitted to adorn!</p>
          <p>The ladies of this country, if I may trust what
<lb/> their own countrymen say of them, are not fond of
<lb/>these domestic ties; they wish not to be mothers of
<lb/>a numerous offspring: and their husbands, whose
<lb/>claim to the honour is somewhat more dubious, are
<lb/>still less flattered with being fathers to them. But
<lb/>let me give you some account of our route. From
<lb/><placeName>Calais</placeName> we coasted, as I may say, the rich
plains of
<lb/><placeName>Flanders</placeName> and <placeName>Artois</placeName>,
which however had lost their
<lb/>peculiar beauty, as the harvest was got in. We pass­
<lb/>ed through a part of <placeName rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">Haute
Picardie</placeName>, and leaving
<lb/><placeName>Paris</placeName> on our right, advanced into
<placeName>Champagne</placeName>, where
<lb/>we first saw the production that most distinguishes
<lb/>the climate of <placeName>France</placeName> from ours,—
the boasted vine­
<lb/>yards. Having visited the venerable cathedral of
<lb/><placeName>Rheims</placeName>, we crossed several pleasant streams,
and
<lb/>from <placeName>Troyes</placeName> traced the delightful windings
of the
<lb/><placeName>Seine</placeName> to its very source. We next visited
<placeName>Dijon</placeName> in
<lb/>the midst of the vine-clad hills of
<placeName>Burgundy</placeName>, and from
<lb/>thence, crossing the <placeName>Saone</placeName>, struck into
<placeName>Franchecomté</placeName>;
<lb/>and from <placeName>Dole</placeName> to
<placeName>Besançon</placeName> travelled along the banks

<pb n="40"/>
<milestone n="4(2)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">40</mw>

<lb/>of the <placeName>Doux</placeName>, a fine, full stream, through a
country
<lb/>more varied and rich with prospects than we had yet
<lb/>seen. From varied, the country became romantic,
<lb/>and from hilly, mountainous; Nature preparing, as it
<lb/>were, for her more majestic scenes, till at length she
<lb/>swells into full grandeur; and from the heights of
<lb/><placeName>Mount Jura</placeName> the <placeName>Alps</placeName>
are discovered to the astonished
<lb/>traveller.</p>
          <p>At <placeName>Geneva</placeName> we were greatly delighted with the
<lb/>society and the situation; but the winter advanced
<lb/>so fast upon us, that we were obliged to abandon our
<lb/>design of visiting <placeName>Switzerland</placeName>. From
<placeName>Geneva</placeName> to
<lb/><placeName>Lyons</placeName> we were still in the midst of <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">les belles horreurs</foreign>,
<lb/>steep mountains, cascades, and lakes. At
<placeName>Lyons</placeName> the
<lb/>winter was still at our heels, so down the rapid
<placeName>Rhone</placeName>
<lb/>we sailed in search of the climate of perpetual spring,
<lb/>but like some enchanted island it seemed to fly from
<lb/>our pursuit. At <placeName>Lyons</placeName> it was the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">vent du
<placeName>Rhone</placeName></foreign>, at
<lb/><placeName>Avignon</placeName> <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">la bise</foreign>, at
<placeName>Marseilles</placeName> the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">mistral</foreign>—which
<lb/>opposed our wishes; till at length, in the orange
<lb/>groves of <placeName>Hieres</placeName>, we found the most delicious tem­
<lb/>perature of air and a verdure perpetually flourishing.
<lb/>But long before we reached <placeName>Hieres</placeName>, between
<placeName>Lyons</placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName>Avignon</placeName>, we got amongst the
olive-grounds, the
<lb/>figs, the almonds, and pomegranates, which spread
<lb/>over all <placeName>Provence</placeName> and
<placeName>Languedoc</placeName>. But they have
<lb/>not here the green pasture, the lowing herd, the haw­
<lb/>thorn hedge, the haunt of birds, nor the various family
<lb/>of lofty trees which give us shade in summer and
<lb/>shelter in winter. As we have been chiefly at inns
<lb/>hitherto, I cannot say a great deal of the inhabitants
<lb/>in general: that they are more lively and eager in
<lb/>their gestures and manner than the <name>English</name> is evident;
<lb/>but as to that great air of gaiety you mention, and
<lb/>which one naturally expects to find in
<placeName>France</placeName>, it has
<lb/>not struck us; perhaps it might if we were more in­

<pb n="41"/>

<lb/>timately admitted into their families, and saw the
<lb/>young and the gay; but this I can assure you, they
<lb/>are not to be found, even in <placeName>Provence</placeName>,
singing and
<lb/>dancing under every green tree. We have lately
<lb/>visited <placeName>Nismes</placeName>, a place interesting by its
antiquities.
<lb/><name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">La Maison
Carrée</name> is the most delicate and finished
<lb/>piece of architecture that can be conceived; and the
<lb/><hi rend="slant(italic)">amphitheatre</hi> gives the most striking
idea of Roman
<lb/>greatness. It is calculated to hold 18,000 people;
<lb/>its vast cirque cannot be beheld from a distance
<lb/>without astonishment,—all the other buildings sink in­
<lb/>to nothing before it. An antiquity perhaps more
<lb/>beautiful still than either of them is the <name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">Pont du Gard</name>,
<lb/>some leagues from <placeName>Nismes</placeName>, constructed to
convey
<lb/>water to the town. It looks great as if made by the
<lb/>hands of the giants, and light as if wrought by fairies.
<lb/><placeName>Nismes</placeName> has likewise a more modern work, of
which
<lb/>they boast much,—the fountain and walks belonging
<lb/>to it. This, as well as the <placeName rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">Place de Perou</placeName> at <placeName>Mont­
<lb/>pelier</placeName>, is laid out in a style which a <persName>Brown</persName> or a <persName>Shen­
<lb/>stone</persName> would but little approve; long strait walks, trees
<lb/>cut into form, water stagnating in stone basons and
<lb/>exactly symmetrized. All this suits but ill with what
<lb/>we have been taught to call taste; yet there is an
<lb/>air of magnificence, and even of gaiety, that in its
<lb/>kind gives pleasure. The very exhibition of art and
<lb/>expense gives an air of grandeur. Its being a work
<lb/>made <emph>by</emph> men, suggests the
cheerful idea that it was
<lb/>made <emph>for</emph> men; whereas our more
rustic scenes seem
<lb/>made, if not for melancholy, at least for solitary mus­
<lb/>ing: and in the last place, the exact proportion con­
<lb/>trasts it with the surrounding country.</p>
          <p>You know, probably, that <placeName>Montpelier</placeName> is
famous
<lb/>for perfumes. One man, who has got a large fortune
<lb/>by them, has planted a garden with rosetrees, several

<lb/>thousands in number, which in summer perfume the
<lb/>air to a considerable distance.</p>
          <p>I hoped to have finished this letter where I began
<lb/>it, at <placeName>Montpelier</placeName>; but not having been able
to do it,
<lb/>gives me an opportunity to tell you, that we have
<lb/>seen at <placeName>Pesenas</placeName> an <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">echantillon</foreign> of the
diversions of the
<lb/>Carnival. The young men of the town, with the
<lb/>young ladies, masked, followed by the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">paysans</foreign> and
<lb/><foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">paysannes</foreign>,
danced by torch-light in the streets, upon
<lb/>the esplanade, and all round the town, to the music of
<lb/>the drum and fife, followed by a number of spectators
<lb/>of all ranks, all enjoying the cheerful
scene. <placeName>Pesenas</placeName>
<lb/>is a delightful place; the peach and apricot already
<lb/>are in blossom there, so is the bean; numbers of
<lb/>almond-trees are in full bloom; various shrubs are
<lb/>green with spring, and some trees begin to put out.
<lb/>To crown all, we found there a lovely <name>English­
<lb/>woman</name>, with whom and her husband we spent two
<lb/>pleasant days. We are now going to
<placeName>Bourdeaux</placeName>, and
<lb/>so to <placeName>Orleans</placeName> and
<placeName>Paris</placeName>; after which I am sure we
<lb/>shall long to return home.</p>

altered in

<lb/>whom we in like manner escaped from there the other
<lb/>day. By the way, I have found out the reason why
<lb/>the French have so little poetry: it is because every
<lb/>body makes verses.</p>
          <p>We have been at <placeName>Versailles</placeName> and
<placeName>St. Cloud</placeName>: the
<lb/>latter is now fitting up for the queen. The situation
<lb/>is far more delightful than <placeName>Versailles</placeName>; but
<emph>that</emph>, by
<lb/>force of expense, has a magnificence which no palace
<lb/>I have seen can compare with. We saw it on <name>Whit­
<lb/>sunday</name>, when the waters play. The environs of
<placeName>Paris</placeName>
<lb/>are now very pleasant; and they are very animated,
<lb/>without being, I think, quite so crowded as those of
<lb/><placeName>London</placeName>. They do not make hay here till
<persName>St. John's</persName>
	    <lb/>day, (<date when="--06-24">the 24th of <name>June</name></date>), which I think
is later than
<lb/>near <placeName>London</placeName>; yet the weather has been very
hot.</p>
          <p>I was recommended to an English nun; and after
<lb/>going to see her twice, she had the goodness to send
<lb/>a parcel of books to convert me: so you see there is
<lb/>some zeal left in the female convents at least: as to
<lb/>the priests and monks, I believe they have very little

<lb/>thoughts turn away from the scene, and delight to
<lb/>contemplate the charming union formed by deep
<lb/>affection and lasting esteem,—the mother endowed
<lb/>with talents and graces to draw the attention of polite
<lb/>circles, yet devoting her time and cares to her family
<lb/>and children—English delicacy, unspoiled beauty,
<lb/>and unaffected sentiment,—when I think of these,
<lb/>(and <emph>your</emph> friends will not be at
a loss to guess where
<lb/>I look for them,) it gives the same relief to my mind
<lb/>as it would to my eye when wearied and dazzled by
<lb/>their sand-walks and terraces, if it could repose upon
<lb/>the cheerful and soft green of our lawny turf. I would
<lb/>not, however, have you imagine that I am out of hu­
<lb/>mour with <placeName>Paris</placeName>, where we have enjoyed much
pleas­
<lb/>ure; only it is the result of our tour, that taking in all
<lb/>things, manners and government as well as climate,
<lb/>we like our own country best: and this is an opinion
<lb/>certainly favourable to our happiness, who shall pro­
<lb/>bably never leave <placeName>England</placeName> again. The
weather with
<lb/>us is, and has been, extremely hot. The trees are
<lb/>in their freshest green; but one sees that the grass
<lb/>will soon be burnt if we have not rain. Indeed they
<lb/>are obliged every day to water the turf in all their
<lb/>gardens where they are solicitous about verdure. The
<lb/>environs of <placeName>Paris</placeName> are charming, yet I think
evidently
<lb/>inferior to those of <placeName>London</placeName>. Yesterday
	    (<name>Whitsun­
<lb/>day</name>) we were gratified with a view of all the mag­
<lb/>nificence of <placeName>Versailles</placeName>. In compliment to
the day
<lb/>the water-works played, and there was the brilliant
<lb/>procession of the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">cordon
bleu</foreign>; in consequence of
<lb/>which all <placeName>Paris</placeName> in a manner was poured into
<placeName>Versailles</placeName>;
<lb/>and I was ready to forgive the enormous expense and
<lb/>ostentation of this palace, when I saw a numerous
<lb/>people of all sorts and degrees filling the rooms and
<lb/>wandering in the gardens, full of admiration, and
<lb/>deriving both pleasure and pride from their national

<pb n="46"/>
<milestone n="4(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">46</mw>

<lb/>magnificence; and many a one, I dare say, exulted
<lb/>in the thought that the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">grand monarque's</foreign> horses are
<lb/>better lodged than is the king of <placeName>England</placeName>
himself.
<lb/>The grand gallery filled with <persName>Le Brun's</persName>
paintings is
<lb/>of a striking beauty; the gardens are full of water
<lb/>thrown up in artificial fountains, and glittering through
<lb/>artificial <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">bosquets</foreign>; the walks are adorned with whole
<lb/>quarries of marble wrought into statues. In short,
<lb/>art and symmetry reign entirely; and I hope they
<lb/>will never attempt to modernize these gardens, be­
<lb/>cause they are a model of magnificence in their kind,
<lb/>and Art appears with so much imposing grandeur,
<lb/>that she seems to have a right to reign. The <name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">petit
<lb/>Trianon</name> belonging to the queen is in another style;
<lb/>with cottages and green lawns and winding walks of
<lb/>flowering shrubs in the English mode, which indeed
<lb/>prevails very much at present.</p>
          <p>There is a person here, the <persName>Abbé
d'Hauy</persName>, who
<lb/>teaches the blind to read by means of books printed
<lb/>expressly for them in a relief of white. The under­
<lb/>taking is curious; but they are at present somewhat
<lb/>in the state of the blind men brought up for painters
<lb/>in the island of <placeName>Laputa</placeName>, who were not so
perfect in
<lb/>the mixing of their colours but that they sometimes
<lb/>mistook blue for red.</p>
          <p>The French stage is not, I think, at present very
<lb/>brilliant; three of their best actors have lately left it.
<lb/>But at the Italian theatre they have a delightful little
<lb/>piece, which under the name of a comic opera draws
<lb/>tears from all the world. It is called <title>Nina</title>, or
<title rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">La
<lb/>Folle d'Amour</title>, and <persName>Mademoiselle du
Gazon</persName> acts
<lb/>the part of <persName>Nina</persName>; and does it with such enchanting
<lb/>grace, such sweet and delicate touches of sensibility
<lb/>and passion, as I never saw upon any theatre. It is the
<lb/><emph>sweet bells jangled out of tune</emph>,
but not <emph>harsh</emph>: no rav­
<lb/>ing, no disorder of dress; but every look and gesture
 
<pb n="47"/>

<lb/>showed an unsettled mind, and a tenderness inimitable.
<lb/>At the Opera they have likewise an actress full of
<lb/>grace, <persName>Mademoiselle St. Huberti</persName>; but there it
is a
<lb/>grace beyond mere nature. Everybody (that is every­
<lb/>body who follows the fashion) leaves <placeName>Paris</placeName>
in the
<lb/>summer, which was not the case some years ago.
<lb/>We stay now for a fine show,—the procession on
<lb/>the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">Fête Dieu</foreign>, in which all the tapestry of the
<name>Gobe­
<lb/>lins</name> is exposed in the streets. We shall return by
<lb/><placeName>Calais</placeName> and proceed immediately to
<placeName>London</placeName>, where
<lb/>we shall take lodgings for some time.</p>
          <p>Will you do me the favour to remember us with
<lb/>grateful affection to all our friends at
<placeName>Norwich</placeName>? There
<lb/>are so many that claim our esteem, I do not attempt

<lb/>As we were walking in these gardens we had the

with our

first; for

longer,

<lb/>My imagination pictures you with a lovely burden in

<lb/>determine, but a charming infant however, that exer­
<lb/>cises your sweet sprightliness in entertaining it, and
<lb/>delights your sensibility by its early notice. But of
<lb/>this delightful circumstance I want to be certain…
<lb/>In the mean time let me give you some account of our­
<lb/>selves. After having spent so much time at
<placeName>Paris</placeName>, that
<lb/>we were obliged to give up our original design of visit­
<lb/>ing <placeName>Flanders</placeName>, we returned by way of
<placeName>Chantilly</placeName>......</p>

acknow­

ease and
<lb/>grace than we do, yet it is certain that the lower or­
<lb/>der are much less respectful and more <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">grossier</foreign> than
<lb/>ours of the same class.</p>
          <p>I do not know how it is, I think verily
<placeName>London</placeName> is a
<lb/>finer town than <placeName>Paris</placeName>; and yet it does not
appear to
<lb/>me since my return so magnificent as it used to do:

<lb/>I believe the reason is, that <placeName>Paris</placeName> has so much

of the

<lb/>we met the American bishops at <persName>Mr. V.'s</persName>,
—if bishops
<lb/>they may be called, without title, without revenue,
<lb/>without diocess, and without lawn sleeves. I wonder
<lb/>our bishops will consecrate them, for they have made
<lb/>very free with the Common Prayer, and have left out
<lb/>two creeds out of three. Indeed, as to the Athana­
<lb/>sian creed, the king has forbidden it in his chapel, so
<lb/>that will soon fall.</p>
          <p>I have been much pleased with the poems of the
<lb/>Scottish ploughman, of which you have had speci­

<lb/>lieve you have had in the papers, I think are charm­
<lb/>ing. The endearing diminutives, and the Doric
<lb/>rusticity of the dialect, suit such subjects extremely.
<lb/>This is the age for self-taught genius: a subscription
<lb/>has been raised for a pipe-maker of
<placeName>Bristol</placeName>, who has

taken
<lb/>him a little shop, which probably will be frequented
<lb/>at first, and then deserted. A more extraordinary in­
<lb/>stance is that of a common carpenter at
<placeName>Aberdeen</placeName>,
<lb/>who applied to the professors to be received in the
<lb/>lowest mathematical class: they examined him, and
<lb/>found he was much beyond it; then for the next, and
<lb/>so on, till they found he had taught himself all they
<lb/>could teach him; and instead of receiving him as a

<lb/>peare's</persName> instructions to the players. It abounds with
<lb/>good sense,—which, and a desire to promote good
<lb/>manners, seem in what I have read to be his charac­
<lb/>teristics. I find by him that the prompter repeats the
<lb/>whole play before the actors.</p>
          <p>Our plot begins to thicken; as—says. We
<lb/>have taken into our family for six months, and per­
	    <lb/>haps longer, a young <name>Spaniard</name> who comes solely to
	    <lb/>learn <name>English</name>. We dined with the young man, his
	    <lb/>uncle, and another <name>Spaniard</name>, who is secretary to the
<lb/>ambassador, at <persName>Mr. W――'s</persName>, where there
was a
<lb/>great mixture of languages. The secretary, as well
	    <lb/>as <name>French</name> and <name>Spanish</name>, spoke <name>English</name> very well;
	    <lb/>the young man, <name>Spanish</name> and <name>French;</name> and the uncle,
<lb/>though he had been several years in
<placeName>England</placeName>, only
	    <lb/><name>Spanish</name>. As <persName>Mr. W.</persName> had told us they were
strict
	    <lb/><name>Catholics</name>, we expressed a fear lest we should not be
<lb/>able to provide for the youth agreeably on fast days:
<lb/>but he said, <said rend="pre(“)post(”)slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">Tout jour est jour gras pour moi:</said> to
<lb/>which the uncle learnedly added,—that it was not
<lb/>what went into the mouth, but what came out of it,
<lb/>that defileth. As far as we have yet seen, (but he
<lb/>has been with us only two days), we find him very
<lb/>well behaved and easy in the family; but the great
<lb/>difficulty is to entertain him: he is quite a man, of
	    <lb/>one or two-and-twenty, and rather looks like a <name>Dutch­
	      <lb/>man</name> than a <name>Spaniard</name>. Did you ever see <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="es">seguars</foreign>—
<lb/>leaf-tobacco rolled up of the length of one's finger,
<lb/>which they light and smoke without a pipe?—he uses
<lb/>them. <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">And how does
<persName>Mr. B.</persName> bear that?</said> say you:
<lb/>O, he keeps it snug in his room. I would not advise
	    <lb/>the boys to imitate his accent in <name>French</name>, for he pro­
<lb/>nounces it with a deep guttural: I fancy he would
	    <lb/>speak <name>Welsh</name> well.</p>

          <p>We are waiting with great impatience for two
<lb/>things, your book and my sister,—your child and your
<lb/>wife, that is to say…</p>
          <p>I have been reading an old book, which has given
<lb/>me a vast deal of entertainment,—Father
<persName>Herodotus</persName>,
<lb/>the father of history; and the father of lies too, his
<lb/>enemies might say. I take it for granted the original
<lb/>has many more beauties than <persName>Littlebury's</persName>
humble
<lb/>translation, which I have been perusing: but at any
<lb/>rate, a translation of an original author gives you an
<lb/>idea of the times totally different from what one gains
<lb/>by a modern compilation. I am much entertained in
<lb/>observing the traces of truth in many of his wildest
<lb/>fables; as where he says it was impossible to proceed
<lb/>far in <placeName>Scythia</placeName> on account of vast
quantities of feathers,
<lb/>which fell from <placeName>heaven</placeName> and covered all the <choice><sic>the</sic><corr/></choice> country.</p>
          <p>We are reading too <persName>Sir. T. More's</persName>
<title>Utopia</title>. He 
<lb/>says many good things; but it wants a certain salt,
<lb/>which <persName>Swift</persName> and others have put into their
works
<lb/>of the same nature. One is surprised to see how

<pb n="55"/>

<lb/>old certain complaints are. Of the frequent execu­
<lb/>tions, for instance: twenty men, he says, being hung
<lb/>upon one gibbet at a time: of arable land turned to
<lb/>pasture, and deserted villages in consequence.</p>
          <p>I hope the exertions which are now making for the
<lb/>abolition of the slave-trade will not prove all in vain.
<lb/>They will not, if the pleadings of eloquence or the
<lb/>cry of duty can be heard. Many of the most respect­
<lb/>able and truly distinguished characters are really busy
<lb/>about it, and the press and the pulpit are both employ­
<lb/>ed; so I hope something must be done. I expect to
<lb/>be highly gratified in hearing <persName>Mr. Hastings's</persName>
trial, for
<lb/>which we are to have tickets some day. This im­
<lb/>peachment has been the occasion of much pomp,
<lb/>much eloquence, and much expense; and there I
<lb/>suppose it will end. As somebody said, it must be

<lb/>with a rapid and smooth motion, like a bird that just

<lb/>have contemplated the effect such scenes must pro­
<lb/>duce on minds so turned to admire the beauties of
<lb/>nature as yours and your poetical companions; and I
<lb/>have watched till imagination has kindled, and beauty
<lb/>has swelled into sublimity. Indeed, independently
<lb/>of scenes so wildly picturesque, a journey is the most
<lb/>favourable thing in the world for the imagination;
<lb/>which, like a wheel, kindles with the motion: I shall

          <p>I suppose you are now returned to your course of

<lb/>much fancy and much sentiment in it,—much poetry
<lb/>too, and mythology: but these, though full of beauties,
<lb/>are often uncouth and harsh to the European ear.
<lb/>The language of nature and the passions is of all
<lb/>countries. The hero of the piece is as delicate and
<lb/>tender a lover as any that can be met with in the
<lb/>pages of a modern romance; for I hope you can
<lb/>pardon him a little circumstance relative to the <emph rend="slant(italic)">costume</emph>
<lb/>of the country, which is just hinted at in the poem: I

<lb/>of his heart.—So much for works of entertainment!

<lb/>possibly might have ebbed again, had he lived longer:
<lb/>the other enjoyed an esteem, the fruit of a course
<lb/>of labours uniformly directed through a long life
<lb/>to the advancement of knowledge and virtue, a repu­
<lb/>tation slowly raised, without and independent of pop­
<lb/>ular talents. The panegyrist of the one was obliged
<lb/>to sink his private life, and to cover with the splendid
<lb/>mantle of public merit, the crimes and failings of the
<lb/>man:—the private character of the other was able
<lb/>to bear the severest scrutiny; neither slander, nor
<lb/>envy, nor party prejudice, ever pretended to find a
<lb/>spot in it. The one was followed even by those who
<lb/>did not trust him: the other was confided in and
<lb/>trusted even by those who reprobated his principles.
<lb/>In pronouncing the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">eloge</foreign> on <persName><placeName>Mirabeau</placeName></persName>, the
author
<lb/>scarcely dares to insinuate a vague and uncertain
<lb/>hope that his spirit may hover somewhere in the void
<lb/>space of immensity, be rejoined to the first principles
<lb/>of nature; and attempts to soothe his shade with a
<lb/>cold and barren immortality in the remembrance of

<lb/>erable through fear of death; professing great dis­
<lb/>taste to the country, and neglecting the urbanity of

led the way

<lb/>while I have been rambling! I should have been
<lb/>more satisfied with being away, if he had accepted
<lb/>your offer; for I should have known then, that he
<lb/>would have no occasion to regret any of the beautiful
<lb/>scenes I have enjoyed without him. I have been
<lb/>much pleased with <placeName>Scotland</placeName>. I do not know
wheth­
<lb/>er you ever extended your tour so far: if you have
<lb/>not seen it, let me beg that you will; for I do not
<lb/>think that in any equal part of <placeName>England</placeName> so
many in­
<lb/>teresting objects are to be met with, as occur in
<lb/>what is called the little tour; from
<placeName>Edinburgh</placeName> to
<lb/><placeName>Stirling</placeName>, <placeName>Perth</placeName>, and
<placeName>Blair</placeName>, along the pleasant windings
<lb/>of the <placeName>Forth</placeName> and
<placeName>Tay</placeName>; then by the lakes, ending
<lb/>with <placeName>Loch Lomond</placeName>, the last and greatest,
and so
<lb/> to <placeName>Glasgow</placeName>; then to the Falls
of the <placeName>Clyde</placeName>, and back
<lb/>by <placeName>Dumfries</placeName>; which last, however, we did
not do;
<lb/>for we returned to
<placeName>Edinburgh</placeName>. <placeName>Scotland</placeName> is a
country
<lb/>strongly marked with character. Its rocks, its woods,
<lb/>its water, its castles, its towns, are all picturesque,
<lb/>generally grand. Some of the views are wild and
<lb/>savage, but none of them insipid, if you except the
<lb/>bleak, flat, extended moor. The entrance into the
<lb/><placeName>Highlands</placeName>, by
<placeName>Dunkeld</placeName> is striking; it is a kind of
<lb/>gate. I thought it would be a good place for hanging
<lb/>up an inscription similar to that of <persName>Dante</persName>,
<quote rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="it">Per me
<lb/>si va…</quote></p>
          <p><placeName>Edinburgh</placeName> is so commanding a situation for a
<lb/>capital, I almost regretted it was not one, and that
<lb/>the fine rooms at <placeName>Holyrood-house</placeName> are falling
into
<lb/>ruins. The Old and New town make the finest con­
<lb/>trast in the world: but beautiful as the New town is,
<lb/>I was convinced, after being some days in it, that its
<lb/>perfect regularity tends towards insipidity, and that a
<lb/>gentle waving line in a street, provided it is without
<lb/>affectation, and has the advantage of some inequality
<lb/>of ground, is more agreeable than streets that cut one
<lb/>another at right angles.</p>

          <p>We were much struck with the Falls of the
<placeName>Clyde</placeName>
<lb/>and its steep banks richly wooded. Indeed, wherever
<lb/>the country is wooded, it is beautiful, and it is every
<lb/>where improving in that respect: millions of trees are
<lb/>planted every year; but it is some time before plant­
<lb/>ed trees form a feature of the country. A belt of
<lb/>wood, dotted clumps, a circlet of firs on a hill, have
<lb/>not the easy and natural appearance of a wood that fills
<lb/>the hollow of a valley, and shapes itself to the bend­
<lb/>ings and risings of the ground. And now let me
<lb/>whisper in your ear that I long very much to be at
<lb/>home again: the limits which I had set myself not to
<lb/>exceed, are expired; and besides, I do not like this
<lb/>country, which has all the dreariness, without the
<lb/>grandeur of scenery, of that which we have left. The
<lb/>Crescent, however, has a beautiful appearance in a
<lb/>deep hollow surrounded by hills. It looks like a
<lb/>jewel at the bottom of an earthen cup.</p>

          <p>…I do not know the present course of your

<title>Lorenzo</title>,
<lb/>and <persName>Mrs. d'Arblay's</persName>

<lb/>persuasion, that no <emph>second</emph> work of
an author, who
<lb/>has written the first after being in full possession of his
<lb/>powers, can help falling off, and for this reason:
――
<lb/>every one has a manner of his own, a vein of thinking
<lb/>peculiar to himself; and on the second publication,
<lb/>though the incidents may be all new, the novelty re­

<lb/>nothing can renew the pleasure with which a favourite
<lb/>author and the public meet one another for the first

          <p>I am just now reduced to regret, my dear friend,
<lb/>that I have taken such small paper. It cuts short
<lb/>what I was going to tell you of <persName>General
Paoli</persName>, whom

which you

visited,
<lb/>and who came to <persName>Mr. Barbauld's</persName> meeting all
<lb/>the while with as innocent a face as if she had never

written, with great
<lb/>purity of sentiment, beauty of diction, strength and
<lb/>originality of character; but it is open to criticism,—
<lb/>I cannot believe such a hatred natural. The affection
<lb/>between the brother and sister is most beautifully
<lb/>touched, and, as far as I know, quite new. The play
<lb/>is somewhat too good for our present taste.</p>

you are in
<lb/>an island every moment. The great ocean becomes
<lb/>quite domestic; you see it from every point of view;
<lb/>you have it on the right hand, you look and you have
<lb/>it on the left also; you see both sides of the island at
<lb/>once,—you look into every creek and corner of it,
<lb/>which produces a new and singular feeling. We have
<lb/>taken three different rides upon and under high cliffs,
<lb/>corn-fields, and villages down to the water's edge, and
<lb/>a fine <placeName>West India</placeName> fleet in view, with the
sails all spread,
<lb/>and her convoy most majestically sailing by her. We
 <lb/>saw <persName>Lord <placeName>Dysart's</placeName></persName> seat, and <persName>Sir

<lb/>at the former, there is a seat in the rock which shuts

<lb/>towards <placeName>France</placeName>: at the latter, there is an
attempt at
<lb/>an English vineyard; the vines are planted on terraces
<lb/>one above another. Another day's excursion was to

looks like
<lb/>a wall of marble veined with different colours. The
<lb/>freshness of the sea air, and the beauty of the smooth
<lb/>turf of the downs on which we rode or walked, was
<lb/>inexpressibly pleasing. The next day we visited the
<lb/>north side of the island, richly wooded down to the
<lb/>water's edge, and rode home over a high down with
<lb/>the sea on both sides, and a rich country between;
<lb/>the corn beginning to acquire the tinge of harvest

<lb/>bad figure upon it, with a little boy or girl behind,
<lb/>who carries a switch, meant to admonish the animal
<lb/>from time to time that he is hired to walk on, and
<lb/>not to stand still. The ass is much better adapted
<lb/>than the horse to show off a lady; for this reason,
<lb/>which perhaps may not have occurred to you, that
<lb/>her beauty is not so likely to be eclipsed: for you
<lb/>must know that many philosophers, amongst whom is

<lb/>This is very much of a corn country, and we are

<lb/>tent with her red cloak to shelter it from the weather;
<lb/>and there she gives it suck, and there they take their

letter; still
<lb/>more for the very kind visit that preceded it—though
<lb/>short, too short, it has left indelible impressions on

<lb/>feel that there is no one <emph>now</emph> on
earth, to whom I
<lb/>could pour out that heart more readily, I may say so
<lb/>readily, as to yourself. Very good also has my dear
<lb/>amiable <persName>Mrs. Beecroft</persName> been to me, whose
lively sweet­
<lb/>ness and agreeable conversation has at times won me
<lb/>to forget that my heart is heavy.</p>
          <p>I am now alone again, and feel like a person who
<lb/>has been sitting by a cheerful fire, not sensible at the
<lb/>time of the temperature of the air, but the fire remov­
<lb/>ed, he finds the season is still <emph rend="slant(italic)">winter</emph>. Day after day
<lb/>passes, and I do not know what I do with my time;
<lb/>my mind has no energy, nor power of application.
<lb/>I can tell you, however, what I have done with some
<lb/>hours of it, which have been agreeably employed in
<lb/>reading <persName>Mrs. Montague's</persName> Letters. I think her
<lb/>nephew has made a very agreeable present to the
<lb/>public; and I was greatly edified to see them printed
<lb/>in modest octavo, with <persName>Mrs. Montague's</persName>
sweet face
<lb/>(for it is a very pretty face) at the head. They cer­
<lb/>tainly show a very extraordinary mind, full of wit,
<lb/>and also of deep thought and sound judgment. She
<lb/>seems to have liked not a little to divert herself with
<lb/>the odd and the ludicrous, and shows herself in the
<lb/>earlier letters passionately fond of balls and races and
<lb/><placeName>London</placeName> company; this was natural enough at
eighteen.
<lb/>Perhaps you may not so easily pardon her for having
<lb/>early settled her mind, as she evidently had, not to
<lb/>marry except for an establishment. This seems to
<lb/>show a want of some of those fine feelings that one
<lb/>expects in youth: but when it is considered that she
<lb/>was the daughter of a country gentleman with a large
<lb/>family and no fortune to expect, and her connexions
<lb/>all in high life, one is disposed to pardon her, espe­
<lb/>cially as I dare say she would never have married a
<lb/>fool or a profligate. I heard her say,—what I sup­
<lb/>pose very few can say,—that she never was in love

<pb n="78"/>
<milestone n="7(3)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">78</mw>

<lb/>in her life. Many of the letters are in fact essays;
<lb/>and I think had she turned her thoughts to write in
<lb/>that way, she would have excelled <persName>Johnson</persName>.</p>
          <p>I have also turned over <persName>Lamb's</persName>
<title>Specimens of Old
<lb/>Plays</title>, and am much pleased with them. I made a
<lb/>discovery there, that <persName>La Motte's</persName> fable of
Genius, Vir­
<lb/>tue, and Reputation, which has been so much praised
<lb/>for its ingenious turn, is borrowed from
<persName>Webster</persName>, an
<lb/>author of the age of <persName>Shakspeare</persName>; or they have
taken
<lb/>it from some common source, for a <name>Frenchman</name> was
<lb/>not very likely to light upon an English poet of that
<lb/>age; they knew about as much of us then, as we did
<lb/>fifty years ago of the <name>Germans</name>. It is surprising how
<lb/>little invention there is in the world; no <emph rend="slant(italic)">very</emph> good
<lb/>story was ever invented. It is perhaps originally some
<lb/>fact a little enlarged; then, by some other hand, em­
<lb/>bellished with circumstances; then by somebody else,
<lb/>a century after, refined, drawn to a point, and furnish­
<lb/>ed with a moral. When shall we see the moral of
<lb/>the world's great story, which astonishes by its events,
<lb/>interests by the numerous agents it puts in motion,
<lb/>but of which we cannot understand the bearings, or
<lb/>predict the catastrophe? It is a tangled web, of which
<lb/>we have not the clue. I do not know how to rejoice
<lb/>at this victory, splendid as it is, over
<persName>Buonaparte</persName>,
<lb/>when I consider the horrible waste of life, the mass of
<lb/>misery, which such gigantic combats must occasion.
<lb/>I will think no more of it; let me rather contemplate
<lb/>your family: there the different threads all wind even­
<lb/>ly, smoothly, and brightly.</p>

          <p>…I believe I am writing you an enormous

<lb/>I am wading through the letters of <persName>Madame du Def­
<lb/>fand</persName>, in four volumes. Have you read them?
<persName>Walpole</persName>
<lb/>and she wrote every week, and they were continually
<lb/>grumbling at one another, yet they went
on. <persName>Walpole</persName>,
<lb/>poor man, seems to have been terribly afraid that this
<lb/>old blind lady was in love with him; and he had
<lb/>much ado to reduce her expressions of friendship to
<lb/>something of an English standard. This lady appears
<lb/>to have been very unhappy. She was blind, indeed,
<lb/>but she had every thing else that could make age
<lb/>comfortable; fortune, friends, talents, consideration
<lb/>in the world, the society of all the wits and all the
<lb/>people of rank in <placeName>Paris</placeName>, or who visited
<placeName>Paris</placeName>, but she
<lb/>totally wanted the best support of all,—religious
feel­
<lb/>ings and hopes; and I do not know any thing that is
<lb/>likely to impress their importance more on the mind,
<lb/>than the perusal of these letters. You see her tired
<lb/>of life, almost blaspheming providence for having
<lb/>given her existence; yet dreading to die, because she
<lb/>had no hopes beyond death. A lady told me, she
<lb/>would not on any account let her daughter read the

<lb/>of <persName>Kant</persName> and the other German philosophers,
she has
<lb/>got, I fancy, a little out of her depth. She herself is,
<lb/>or affects to be, very devotional; but her religion
<lb/>seems to be almost wholly a matter of imagination,—
<lb/>the <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</foreign>
impressed upon us at our birth, along
<lb/>with a taste for beauty, for music, &amp;c. As far as I
<lb/>understand her account of the German school, there
<lb/>seems to be in many of them a design to reinstate the
<lb/>doctrine of innate ideas, which the cold philosophy,
<lb/>as they would call it, of <persName>Locke</persName>,
discarded. They
<lb/>would like <persName>Beattie</persName> and

          <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">In</hi> that season of the year when the 
serenity of the
<lb/>sky, the various fruits which cover the ground, the
<lb/>discoloured foliage of the trees, and all the sweet, but
<lb/>fading graces of inspiring autumn, open the mind to
<lb/>benevolence, and dispose it for contemplation; I was
<lb/>wandering in a beautiful and romantic country, till
<lb/>curiosity began to give way to weariness; and I sat
<lb/>me down on the fragment of a rock overgrown with
<lb/>moss, where the rustling of the falling leaves, the
<lb/>dashing of waters, and the hum of the distant city,
<lb/>soothed my mind into the most perfect tranquillity,
<lb/>and sleep insensibly stole upon me, as I was indulging
<lb/>the agreeable reveries which the objects around me
<lb/>naturally inspired.</p>
          <p>I immediately found myself in a vast extended
<lb/>plain, in the middle of which arose a mountain higher
<lb/>than I had before any conception of. It was covered
<lb/>with a multitude of people, chiefly youth; many of
<lb/>whom pressed forwards with the liveliest expression of
<lb/>ardour in their countenance, though the way was in

<lb/>many places steep and difficult. I observed, that
<lb/>those who had but just begun to climb the hill, thought
<lb/>themselves not far from the top; but as they proceed­
<lb/>ed, new hills were continually rising to their view;
<lb/>and the summit of the highest they could before dis­
<lb/>cern, seemed but the foot of another, till the mountain
<lb/>at length appeared to lose itself in the clouds. As I
<lb/>was gazing on these things with astonishment, my
<lb/>good <persName>Genius</persName> suddenly appeared. <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">The mountain
<lb/>before thee,</said> said he, <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">is the <name rend="case(allcaps)">Hill of Science</name>. On
<lb/>the top is the temple of <persName>Truth</persName>, whose head is above
<lb/>the clouds, and whose face is covered with a veil of
<lb/>pure light. Observe the progress of her votaries; be
<lb/>silent, and attentive.</said></p>
          <p>I saw that the only regular approach to the mountain
<lb/>was by a gate, called the gate of languages. It was
<lb/>kept by a woman of a pensive and thoughtful appear­
<lb/>ance, whose lips were continually moving, as though she
<lb/>repeated something to herself. Her name was <persName rend="case(allcaps)">Memory</persName>.
<lb/>On entering this first enclosure, I was stunned with a
<lb/>confused murmur of jarring voices, and dissonant
<lb/>sounds; which increased upon me to such a degree,
<lb/>that I was utterly confounded, and could compare the
<lb/>noise to nothing but the confusion of tongues at
<placeName>Babel</placeName>.
<lb/>The road was also rough and stony, and rendered
<lb/>more difficult by heaps of rubbish, continually tumbled
<lb/>down from the higher parts of the mountain; and by
<lb/>broken ruins of ancient buildings, which the travellers
<lb/>were obliged to climb over at every step; insomuch
<lb/>that many, disgusted with so rough a beginning, turned
<lb/>back, and attempted the mountain no more: while
<lb/>others having conquered this difficulty, had no spirits
<lb/>to ascend further, and sitting down on some fragment
<lb/>of the rubbish, harangued the multitude below with
<lb/>the greatest marks of importance and self-complacency.</p>
          <p>About half way up the hill, I observed on each side

<pb n="97"/>
<milestone n="9(1)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">97</mw>

<lb/>the path a thick forest covered with continual fogs,
<lb/>and cut out into labyrinths, cross alleys, and serpentine
<lb/>walks, entangled with thorns and briars. This was
<lb/>called the <emph>wood of error</emph>: and I heard the voices of
<lb/>many who were lost up and down in it, calling to one
<lb/>another, and endeavouring in vain to extricate them­
<lb/>selves. The trees in many places shot their boughs
<lb/>over the path, and a thick mist often rested on it; yet
<lb/>never so much, but that it was discernible by the light
<lb/>which beamed from the countenance of
<persName>Truth</persName>.</p>
          <p>In the pleasantest part of the mountain were placed
<lb/>the bowers of the Muses, whose office it was to cheer
<lb/>the spirits of the travellers, and encourage their faint­
<lb/>ing steps with songs from their divine harps. Not far
<lb/>from hence were the <emph>fields of fiction</emph>, filled with a
<lb/>variety of wild flowers springing up in the greatest
<lb/>luxuriance, of richer scents and brighter colours than
<lb/>I had observed in any other climate. And near them
<lb/>was the <emph>dark walk of allegory</emph>, so artificially
shaded,
<lb/>that the light at noon-day was never stronger than that
<lb/>of a bright moonshine. This gave it a pleasingly
<lb/>romantic air for those who delighted in contemplation.
<lb/>The paths and alleys were perplexed with intricate
<lb/>windings, and were all terminated with the statue of a
<lb/>Grace, a Virtue, or a Muse.</p>
          <p>After I had observed these things, I turned my
<lb/>eyes towards the multitudes who were climbing the
<lb/>steep ascent, and observed amongst them a youth of
<lb/>a lively look, a piercing eye, and something fiery and
<lb/>irregular in all his motions. His name was
<persName rend="case(allcaps)">Genius</persName>.
<lb/>He darted like an eagle up the mountain, and left his
<lb/>companions gazing after him with envy and admiration:
<lb/>but his progress was unequal, amd interrupted by a
<lb/>thousand caprices. When <persName>Pleasure</persName> warbled in
the
<lb/>valley, he mingled in her train. When <persName>Pride</persName>
beckon­
<lb/>ed towards the precipice, he ventured to the tottering

<lb/>edge. He delighted in devious and untried paths;
<lb/>and made so many excursions from the road, that his
<lb/>feebler companions often outstripped him. I observed
<lb/>that the Muses beheld him with partiality; but
<persName>Truth</persName>
<lb/>often frowned and turned aside her face. While
<lb/><persName>Genius</persName> was thus wasting his strength in
eccentric
<lb/>flights, I saw a person of a very different appearance,
<lb/>named <persName rend="case(allcaps)">Application</persName>. He
crept along with a slow
<lb/>and unremitting pace, his eyes fixed on the top of the
<lb/>mountain, patiently removing every stone that obstruct­
<lb/>ed his way, till he saw most of those below him who
<lb/>had at first derided his slow and toilsome progress.
<lb/>Indeed there were few who ascended the hill with
<lb/>equal and uninterrupted steadiness; for, beside the
<lb/>difficulties of the way, they were continually solicited
<lb/>to turn aside by a numerous crowd of Appetites, Pas­
<lb/>sions, and Pleasures, whose importunity, when they
<lb/>had once complied with, they became less and less
<lb/>able to resist; and, though they often returned to the
<lb/>path, the asperities of the road were more severely
<lb/>felt, the hill appeared more steep and rugged, the
<lb/>fruits which were wholesome and refreshing, seemed
<lb/>harsh and ill-tasted, their sight grew dim, and their
<lb/>feet tript at every little obstruction.</p>
          <p>I saw, with some surprize, that the Muses, whose
<lb/>business was to cheer and encourage those who were
<lb/>toiling up the ascent, would often sing in the bowers
<lb/>of <persName>Pleasure</persName>, and accompany those who were
enticed
<lb/>away at the call of the Passions. They accompanied
<lb/>them, however, but a little way, and always forsook
<lb/>them when they lost sight of the hill. Their tyrants
<lb/>then doubled their chains upon the unhappy captives,
<lb/>and led them away without resistance to the cells of
<lb/>Ignorance, or the mansions of Misery. Amongst the
<lb/>innumerable seducers, who were endeavouring to
<lb/>draw away the votaries of <persName>Truth</persName> from the path 
of

<pb n="99"/>

<mw type="pageNum">99</mw>

<lb/>Science, there was one so little formidable in her ap­
<lb/>pearance, and so gentle and languid in her attempts,
<lb/>that I should scarcely have taken notice of her, but
<lb/>for the numbers she had imperceptibly loaded with
<lb/>her chains. <mcr rend="case(smallcaps)">Indolence</mcr>
(for so she was called), far
<lb/>from proceeding to open hostilities, did not attempt
<lb/>to turn their feet out of the path, but contented her­
<lb/>self with retarding their progress; and the purpose
<lb/>she could not force them to abandon, she persuaded
<lb/>them to delay. Her touch had a power like that of
<lb/>the Torpedo, which withered the strength of those who
<lb/>came within its influence. Her unhappy captives still
<lb/>turned their faces towards the temple, and always
<lb/>hoped to arrive there; but the ground seemed to slide
<lb/>from beneath their feet, and they found themselves at
<lb/>the bottom before they suspected that they had chang­
<lb/>ed their place. The placid serenity which at first
<lb/>appeared in their countenance, changed by degrees
<lb/>into a melancholy languor, which was tinged with
<lb/>deeper and deeper gloom as they glided down the
<lb/><emph>stream of insignificance</emph>; a dark and sluggish water,
<lb/>which is curled by no breeze, and enlivened by no
<lb/>murmur, till it falls into a dead sea, where the startled
<lb/>passengers are awakened by the shock, and the next
<lb/>moment buried in the gulph of oblivion.</p>
          <p>Of all the unhappy deserters from the paths of
<lb/>Science, none seemed less able to return than the follow­
<lb/>ers of Indolence. The captives of Appetite
and Pas­
<lb/>sion could often seize the moment when their tyrants
<lb/>were languid or asleep, to escape from their enchant­
<lb/>ment; but the dominion of <persName>Indolence</persName> was
constant and
<lb/>unremitted, and seldom resisted till resistance was
<lb/>in vain.</p>
          <p>After contemplating these things, I turned my eyes
<lb/>towards the top of the mountain, where the air was
<lb/>always pure and exhilarating, the path shaded with

<pb n="100"/>
<milestone n="9(2)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">100</mw>

<lb/>laurels and other evergreens, and the effulgence which
<lb/>beamed from the face of the Goddess seemed to shed
<lb/>a glory round her votaries. <said rend="pre()post()">Happy,</said> said I, <said rend="pre()post()">are they
<lb/>who are permitted to ascend the mountain!</said>—but
<lb/>while I was pronouncing this exclamation with un­
<lb/>common ardour, I saw standing beside me a form of
<lb/>diviner features and a more benign radiance. <said rend="pre()post()">Hap­
<lb/>pier,</said> said she, <said rend="pre()post()">are those whom <persName rend="case(smallcaps)">virtue</persName> conducts to the
<lb/>mansions of Content!</said>—<said rend="pre()post()">What,</said> said I, <said rend="pre()post()">does
<persName>Virtue</persName> then
<lb/>reside in the vale?</said>—<said rend="pre()post()">I am found</said> said she, <said rend="pre()post()">in the vale,
<lb/>and I illuminate the mountain. I cheer the cottager
<lb/>at his toil, and inspire the sage at his meditation. I
<lb/>mingle in the crowd of cities, and bless the hermit in
<lb/>his cell. I have a temple in every heart that owns
<lb/>my influence; and to him that wishes for me I am al­
<lb/>ready present. Science may raise you to eminence,
<lb/>but I alone can guide you to felicity!</said> While the God­
<lb/>dess was thus speaking, I stretched out my arms to­
<lb/>wards her with a vehemence which broke my slum­
<lb/>bers. The chill dews were falling around me, and
<lb/>the shades of evening stretched over the landscape.
<lb/>I hastened homeward, and resigned the night to silence
<lb/>and meditation.</p>

<lb/>try, have crowded upon the world, none are perused
<lb/>with more insatiable avidity, or disseminated with more
<lb/>universal applause, than the narrations of feigned events,
<lb/>descriptions of imaginary scenes, and delineations of
<lb/>ideal characters. The celebrity of other authors is
<lb/>confined within very narrow limits. The Geometri­
<lb/>cian nd Divine, the Antiquary and the Critic how­
<lb/>ever distinguished by uncontested excellence, can
<lb/>only hope to please those whom a conformity of dis­
<lb/>position has engaged in similar pursuits; and must be
<lb/>content to be regarded by the rest of the world with
<lb/>the smile of frigid indifference, or the contemptuous
<lb/>sneer of self-sufficient folly. The collector of shells
<lb/>and the anatomist of insects is little inclined to enter
<lb/>into theological disputes: the Divine is not apt to
<lb/>regard with veneration the uncouth diagrams and
<lb/>tedious calculations of the Astronomer: the man
<lb/>whose life has been consumed in adjusting the disputes
<lb/>of lexicographers, or elucidating the learning of an­
<lb/>tiquity, cannot easily bend his thoughts to recent tran­
<lb/>sactions, or readily interest himself in the unimpor­
<lb/>tant history of his contemporaries: and the Cit, who
<lb/>knows no business but acquiring wealth, and no pleas­
<lb/>ure but displaying it, has a heart equally shut up to

<lb/>the arrows of wit. To the writer of fiction alone,
<lb/>every ear is open, and every tongue lavish of applause;
<lb/>curiosity sparkles in every eye, and every bosom is
<lb/>throbbing with concern.</p>
          <p>It is, however, easy to account for this enchant­
<lb/>ment. To follow the chain  of perplexed ratiocination,
<lb/>to view with critical skill the airy architecture of
<lb/>systems, to unravel the web of sophistry, or weigh the
<lb/>merits of opposite hypotheses, requires perspicacity,
<lb/>and presupposes learning. Works of this kind, there­
<lb/>fore, are not so well adapted to the generality of
<lb/>readers as familiar and colloquial composition; for
<lb/>few can reason, but all can feel; and many who can­
<lb/>not enter into an argument. may yet listen to a tale.
<lb/>The writer of Romance has even an advantage over
<lb/>those who endeavour to amuse by the play of fancy;
<lb/>who, from the fortuitous collision of dissimilar ideas
<lb/>produce the scintillations of wit; or by the vivid glow
<lb/>of poetical imagery delight the imagination with
<lb/>colours of ideal radiance.  The attraction of the mag­
<lb/>net is only exerted upon similar particles; and to
<lb/>taste the beauties of <persName>Homer</persName>, it is requisite
to partake
<lb/>his fire; but every one can relish the author who rep­
<lb/>resents common life, because every one can refer to
<lb/>the originals from whence his ideas were taken. He
<lb/>relates events to which all are liable, and applies to
<lb/>passions which all have felt. The gloom of solitude,
<lb/>the languor of inaction, the corrosions of disappoint­
<lb/>ment, and the toil of thought, induce men to step aside
<lb/>from the rugged road of life, and wander in the fairy
<lb/>land of fiction; where every bank is sprinkled with
<lb/>flowers, and every gale loaded with perfume; where
<lb/>every event introduces a hero, and every cottage is
<lb/>inhabited by a Grace. Invited by these flattering
<lb/>scenes, the student quits the investigation of truth, in
<lb/>which he perhaps meets with no less fallacy to ex<choice><sic/><corr>­</corr></choice>

<lb/>hilarate his mind with new ideas, more agreeable, and
<lb/>more easily attained: the busy relax their attention by
<lb/>desultory reading, and smooth the agitation of a ruffled
<lb/>mind with images of peace, tranquillity, and pleasure:
<lb/>the idle and the gay relieve the listlessness of leisure,
<lb/>and diversify the round of life by a rapid series of
<lb/>events pregnant with rapture and astonishment; and
<lb/>the pensive solitary fills up the vacuities of his heart
<lb/>by interesting himself in the fortunes of imaginary be­
<lb/>ings, and forming connexions with ideal excellence.</p>
          <p>It is, indeed, no ways extraordinary that the mind
<lb/>should be charmed by fancy, and attracted by pleas­
<lb/>ure; but that we should listen with complacence to
<lb/>the groans of misery, and delight to view the exacer­
<lb/>bations of complicated anguish, that we should choose
<lb/>to chill the bosom with imaginary fears, and dim the
<lb/>eyes with fictitious sorrow, seems a kind of paradox
<lb/>of the heart, and can only be credited because it is
<lb/>universally felt. Various are the hypotheses which
<lb/>have been formed to accou<choice><sic>u</sic><corr>n</corr></choice>t for the disposition of the
<lb/>mind to riot in this species of intellectual luxury.
<lb/>Some have imagined that we are induced to acquiesce
<lb/>with greater patience in our own lot, by beholding
<lb/>pictures of life, tinged with deeper horrors, and load­
<lb/>ed with more excruciating calamities; as, to a person
<lb/>suddenly emerging out of a dark room, the faintest
<lb/>glimmering of twilight assumes a lustre from the con­
<lb/>trasted gloom. Others, with yet deeper refinement,
<lb/>suppose that we take upon ourselves this burden of
<lb/>adscititious sorrows, in order to feast upon the con­
<lb/>sciousness of our own virtue. We commiserate others,
<lb/>say they, that we may applaud ourselves; and the
<lb/>sigh of compassionate sympathy is always followed
<lb/>by the gratulations of self-complacent esteem. But
<lb/>surely they who would thus reduce the sympathetic
<lb/>emotions of pity to a system of refined selfishness, have

<lb/>but ill attended to the genuine feelings of humanity.
<lb/>It would, however, exceed the limits of this paper,
<lb/>should I attempt an accurate investigation of these
<lb/>sentiments. But let it be remembered, that we are
<lb/>more attracted by those scenes which interest our
<lb/>passions or gratify our curiosity, than those which de­
<lb/>light our fancy: and, so far from being indifferent to
<lb/>the miseries of others, we are, at the time, totally
<lb/>regardless of our own. And let not those on whom
<lb/>the hand of Time has impressed the characters of
<lb/>oracular wisdom, censure with too much acrimony
<lb/>productions, which are thus calculated to please the
<lb/>imagination, and interest the heart. They teach us
<lb/>to think, by inuring us to feel; they ventilate the
<lb/>mind by sudden gusts of passion: and prevent the
<lb/>stagnation of thought, by a fresh infusion of dissimi­
<lb/>lar ideas.</p>

          <p>But <persName>Seláma</persName> has a friend, said the
kindling soul of
<lb/><persName>Reuthamir</persName>. I will fight thy battles,
lovely daughter
<lb/>of kings; and the sun of <placeName>Duvranno</placeName> shall set 
in blood.
<lb/>But when I return in peace, and the spirits of thy foes
<lb/>are on my sword, meet me with thy smiles of love,
<lb/>maid of <placeName>Clutha</placeName>! with thy slow-rolling
eyes. Let
<lb/>the soft sound of thy steps be heard in my halls, that
<lb/>the mother of <persName>Reuthamir</persName> may rejoice. Whence,
she
<lb/>will say, is this beam of the distant land? Thou shalt
<lb/>dwell in her bosom.</p>
          <p>My thoughts are with him who is low in the dust,
<lb/>son of <persName>Cormac</persName>! But lift the spear, thou
friend of the
<lb/>unhappy! the light of my soul may return.</p>
          <p>He strode in his rattling arms. Tall, in a gloomy
<lb/>forest, stood the surly strength of
<placeName>Duvranno</placeName>. Gleam­
<lb/>ing behind the dark trees was his broad shield; like

<pb n="108"/>
<milestone n="9(6)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">108</mw>

<lb/>the moon when it rises in blood, and the dusky clouds
<lb/>sail low, and heavy, athwart its path. Thoughts, like
<lb/>the troubled ocean, rushed over his soul, and he struck,
<lb/>with his spear, the sounding pine. Starting, he mixed
<lb/>in battle with the chief of woody
<placeName>Morna</placeName>. Long was
<lb/>the strife of arms; and the giant sons of the forest
<lb/>trembled at their strokes. At length
<persName>Tonthormo</persName> fell
<lb/>—The sword of <persName>Reuthamir</persName> waved, a blue
flame,
<lb/>around him. He bites the ground in rage. His
<lb/>blood is poured, a dark red stream, into
<persName>Oithona's</persName>
<lb/>trembling waves. Joy brightened in the soul of
<persName>Reuth­
<lb/>amir</persName>; when a young warrior came, with his forward
<lb/>spear. He moved in the light of beauty; but his
<lb/>words were haughty and fierce. Is <persName>Tonthormo</persName> 
fallen
<lb/>in blood, the friend of my early years? Die, thou
<lb/>dark-souled chief! for never shall
<persName>Seláma</persName> be thine,
<lb/>the maid of his love. Lovely shone her eyes, through
<lb/>tears, in the hall of her grief, when I stood by the
<lb/>chief of <placeName>Duvranno</placeName>, in the rising strife of
<placeName>Clutha</placeName>.</p>
          <p>Retire, thou swelling voice of pride! thy spear is
<lb/>light as the taper reed. Pierce the roes of the desert;
<lb/>and call the hunter to the feast of songs, but speak not
<lb/>of the daughter of <persName>Connal</persName>, son of the feeble
arm!
<lb/><persName>Seláma</persName> is the love of heroes.</p>
          <p>Try thy strength with the feeble arm, said the ris­
<lb/>ing pride of youth. Thou shalt vanish like a cloud of
<lb/>mist before the sun, when he looks abroad in the
<lb/>power of his brightness, and the storms are rolled
<lb/>away from before his face.</p>
          <p>But thou thyself didst fall before <persName>Reuthamir</persName>,
in all
<lb/>thy boasting words. As a tall ash of the mountain,
<lb/>when the tempest takes its green head and lays it
<lb/>level on the plain.</p>
          <p>Come from thy secret cave, <persName>Seláma</persName>! thy
foes are
<lb/>silent and dark. Thou dove that hidest in the clefts
<lb/>of the rocks! the storm is over and past. Come

<pb n="109"/>

<lb/>from thy rock, <persName>Seláma</persName>! and give thy white
hand to
<lb/>the chief who never fled from the face of glory, in all
<lb/>its terrible brightness.</p>
          <p>She gave her hand, but it was trembling and cold,
<lb/>for the spear was deep in her side. Red, beneath
<lb/>her mail, the current of crimson wandered down her
<lb/>white breast, as the track of blood on
<persName>Cromla's</persName> moun­
<lb/>tains of snow, when the wounded deer slowly crosses
<lb/>the heath, and the hunters cries are in the breeze.
<lb/>Blest be the spear of <persName>Reuthamir</persName>! said the
faint voice
<lb/>of the lovely, I feel it cold in my heart. Lay me by
<lb/>the son of <persName>Semo</persName>. Why should I know another
love? 
<lb/>Raise the tomb of the aged, his thin form shall rejoice,
<lb/>as he sails on a low-hung cloud, and guides the win­
<lb/>try storm. Open your airy halls, spirits of my love!</p>
          <p>And have I quenched the light which was pleasant
<lb/>to my soul? said the chief of <placeName>Morna</placeName>. My 
steps
<lb/>moved in darkness, why were the words of strife in
<lb/>thy tale? Sorrow, like a cloud, comes over my soul,
<lb/>and shades the joy of mighty deeds. Soft be your
<lb/>rest in the narrow house, children of grief! The
<lb/>breeze in the long whistling grass shall not awaken
<lb/>you. The tempest shall rush over you, and the bul­
<lb/>rush bow its head upon your tomb, but silence shall
<lb/>dwell in your habitation; long repose, and the peace
<lb/>of years to come. The voice of the bard shall raise
<lb/>your remembrance in the distant land, and mingle your
<lb/>tale of woe with the murmur of other streams. Often
<lb/>shall the harp send forth a mournful sound, and the
<lb/>tear dwell in the soft eyes of the daughters of
<placeName>Morna</placeName>.</p>
          <p>Such were the words of <persName>Reuthamir</persName>, while he
raised 
<lb/>the tombs of the fallen. Sad were his steps towards
<lb/>the towers of his fathers, as musing he crossed the
<lb/>dark heath of <placeName>Lena</placeName>, and struck, at times,
the thistle's
<lb/>beard.</p>

          <p>As most of the unhappiness in the world arises
<lb/>rather from disappointed desires, than from positive

<lb/>notions of the laws and order of the universe, that we

<lb/>laws of natural philosophy, indeed, are tolerably un­
<lb/>derstood and attended to; and though we may suffer
<lb/>inconveniences, we are seldom disappointed in conse­
<lb/>quence of them. No man expects to preserve orange-
<lb/>trees in the open air through an English winter; or
<lb/>when he has planted an acorn, to see it become a
<lb/>large oak in a few months. The mind of man naturally
<lb/>yields to necessity; and our wishes soon subside when
<lb/>we see the impossibility of their being gratified. Now,
<lb/>upon an accurate inspection, we shall find, in the moral
<lb/>government of the world, and the order of the intel­
<lb/>lectual system, laws as determinate, fixed, and invari­
<lb/>able as any in <persName>Newton's</persName>
<title>Principia</title>. The progress of
<lb/>vegetation is not more certain than the growth of habit;
<lb/>nor is the power of attraction more clearly proved,
<lb/>than the force of affection or the influence of example.
<lb/>The man therefore who has well studied the operations
<lb/>of nature in mind as well as matter, will acquire a
<lb/>certain moderation and equity in his claims upon
<lb/><name>Providence</name>. He will never be disappointed either in
<lb/>himself or others. He will act with precision; and
<lb/>expect that effect and that alone from his efforts, which
<lb/>they are naturally adapted to produce. For want of
<lb/>this, men of merit and integrity often censure the dis­
<lb/>positions of providence for suffering characters they
<lb/>despise, to run away with advantages which, they yet
<lb/>know, are purchased by such means as a high and
<lb/>noble spirit could never submit to. If you refuse to
<lb/>pay the price, why expect the purchase? We should
<lb/>consider this world as a great mart of commerce,
<lb/>where fortune exposes to our view various commod­
<lb/>ities, riches, ease, tranquillity, fame, integrity, knowl­
<lb/>edge. Every thing is marked at a settled price. Our
<lb/>time, our labour, our ingenuity, is so much ready
<lb/>money which we are to lay out to the best advantage.
<lb/>Examine, compare, choose, reject; but stand to your

<pb n="112"/>

<lb/>own judgment; and do not, like children, when you
<lb/>have purchased one thing, repine that you do not pos­
<lb/>sess another which you did not purchase. Such is
<lb/>the force of well-regulated industry, that a steady and
<lb/>vigorous exertion of our faculties, directed to one end,
<lb/>will generally insure success. Would you, for instance,
<lb/>be rich? Do you think that single point worth the
<lb/>sacrificing every thing else to? You may then be
<lb/>rich. Thousands have become so from the lowest
<lb/>beginnings by toil, and patient diligence, and attention
<lb/>to the minutest articles of expense and profit. But
<lb/>you must give up the pleasures of leisure, of a vacant
<lb/>mind, of a free, unsuspicious temper. If you preserve
<lb/>your integrity, it must be a coarse-spun and vulgar
<lb/>honesty. Those high and lofty notions of morals
<lb/>which you brought with you from the schools, must be
<lb/>considerably lowered, and mixed with the baser alloy
<lb/>of a jealous and wordly-minded prudence. You must
<lb/>learn to do hard, if not unjust things; and for the nice
<lb/>embarrassments of a delicate and ingenuous spirit, it
<lb/>is necessary for you to get rid of them as fast as pos­
<lb/>sible. You must shut your heart against the Muses,
<lb/>and be content to feed your understanding with plain,
<lb/>household truths. In short, you must not attempt to
<lb/>enlarge your ideas, or polish your taste, or refine your
<lb/>sentiments; but must keep on in one beaten track,
<lb/>without turning aside either to the right hand or to the
<lb/>left. <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">But I cannot submit to

<lb/>distinct as possible from a worldly life. They plainly
<lb/>told men what sacrifices were required, and what
<lb/>advantages they were which might be expected.

<lb/>If you would be a philosopher, these are the terms.
<lb/>You must do thus and thus; there is no other way.
<lb/>If not, go and be one of the vulgar.</p>
          <p>There is no one quality gives so much dignity to a
<lb/>character, as consistency of conduct. Even if a man's
<lb/>pursuits be wrong and unjustifiable, yet if they are
<lb/>prosecuted with steadiness and vigour, we cannot with­
<lb/>hold our admiration. The most characteristic mark
<lb/>of a great mind is to choose some one important object,
<lb/>and pursue it through life. It was this that made
<persName>Cæsar</persName>
<lb/>a great man. His object was ambition; he pursued
<lb/>it steadily, and was always ready to sacrifice to it,
<lb/>every interfering passion or inclination.</p>
          <p>There is a pretty passage in one of <persName>Lucian's</persName>
dia­
<lb/>logues, where <persName>Jupiter</persName> complains to
<persName>Cupid</persName> that though
<lb/>he has had so many intrigues, he was never sincerely
<lb/>beloved. In order to be loved, says <persName>Cupid</persName>,
you must
<lb/>lay aside your ægis and your thunder-bolts, and you
<lb/>must curl and perfume your hair, and place a garland
<lb/>on your head, and walk with a soft step, and assume a
<lb/>winning, obsequious deportment. But, replied
<persName>Jupiter</persName>,
<lb/>I am not willing to resign so much of my dignity.
<lb/>Then, returns <persName>Cupid</persName>, leave off desiring to be 
loved—
<lb/>He wanted to be <persName>Jupiter</persName> and
<persName>Adonis</persName> at the same time.</p>
          <p>It must be confessed, that men of genius are of all
<lb/>others most inclined to make to make these unreasonable claims.
<lb/>As their relish for enjoyment is strong, their views
<lb/>large and comprehensive, and they feel themselves
<lb/>lifted above the common bulk of mankind, they are
<lb/>apt to slight that natural reward of praise and admira­

<pb n="116"/>

<lb/>tion which is ever largely paid to distinguished abilities;
<lb/>and to expect to be called forth to public notice and
<lb/>favour: without considering that their talents are com­
<lb/>monly very unfit for active life; that their eccentricity
<lb/>and turn for speculation disqualifies them for the business
<lb/>of the world, which is best carried on by men of mod­
<lb/>erate genius; and that society is not obliged to reward
<lb/>any one who is not useful to it. The Poets have been
<lb/>a very unreasonable race, and have often complained
<lb/>loudly of the neglect of genius and the ingratitude of
<lb/>the age. The tender and pensive <persName>Cowley</persName>, and
the
<lb/>elegant <persName>Shenstone</persName>, had their minds tinctured
by this
<lb/>discontent; and even the sublime melancholy of
<lb/><persName>Young</persName> was too much owing to the stings of
disappoint­
<lb/>ed ambition.</p>
          <p>The moderation we have been endeavouring to in­
<lb/>culcate, will likewise prevent much mortification and
<lb/>disgust in our commerce with mankind. As we ought
<lb/>not to wish in ourselves, so neither should we expect
<lb/>in our friends contrary qualifications. Young and
<lb/>sanguine, when we enter the world, and feel our affec­
<lb/>tions drawn forth by any particular excellence in a
<lb/>character, we immediately give it credit for all others;
<lb/>and are beyond measure disgusted when we come to
<lb/>discover, as we soon must discover, the defects in the
<lb/>other side of the balance. But nature is much more
<lb/>frugal than to heap together all manner of shining
<lb/>qualities in one glaring mass. Like a judicious paint­
<lb/>er, she endeavours to preserve a certain unity of style
<lb/>and colouring in her pieces. Models of absolute per­
<lb/>fection are only to be met with in romance; where
<lb/>exquisite beauty, and brilliant wit, and profound judg­
<lb/>ment, and immaculate virtue, are all blended together
<lb/>to adorn some favourite character. As an anatomist
<lb/>knows that the racer cannot have the strength and
<lb/>muscles of the draught-horse; and that winged men,

<pb n="117"/>
<milestone n="10(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">117</mw>

<lb/>gryffons, and mermaids must be mere creatures of
<lb/>the imagination; so the philosopher is sensible that
<lb/>there are combinations of moral qualities, which never
<lb/>can take place but in idea. There is a different air
<lb/>and complexion in characters as well as in faces,
<lb/>though perhaps each equally beautiful; and the ex­
<lb/>cellencies of one cannot be transferred to the other.
<lb/>Thus, if one man possesses a stoical apathy of soul,
<lb/>acts independent of the opinion of the world, and ful­
<lb/>fils every duty with mathematical exactness, you must
<lb/>not expect that man to be greatly influenced by the
<lb/>weakness of pity, or the partialities of friendship: you
<lb/>must not be offended that he does not fly to meet you
<lb/>after a short absence; or require from him the con­
<lb/>vivial spirit and honest effusions of a warm, open, sus­
<lb/>ceptible heart. If another is remarkable for a lively,
<lb/>active zeal, inflexible integrity, a strong indignation
<lb/>against vice, and freedom in reproving it, he will pro­
<lb/>bably have some little bluntness in his address not al­
<lb/>together suitable to polished life; he will want the win­
<lb/>ning arts of conversation; he will disgust by a kind
<lb/>of haughtiness and negligence in his manner, and often
<lb/>hurt the delicacy of his acquaintance with harsh and
<lb/>disagreeable truths.</p>
          <p>We usually say—that man is a genius, <emph>but</emph> he
has
<lb/>some whims and oddities—such a one has a very
<lb/>general knowledge, <emph>but</emph> he is superficial; &amp;c. Now
<lb/>in all cases we should speak more rationally did
<lb/>we substitute <emph>therefore</emph> for <emph>but</emph>. He is a 
genius, <emph>there­
<lb/>fore</emph> he is whimsical; and the like.</p>
          <p>It is the fault of the present age, owing to the freer
<lb/>commerce that different ranks and professions now
<lb/>enjoy with each other, that characters are not marked
<lb/>with sufficient strength: the several classes run too
<lb/>much into one another. We have fewer pedants, it
<lb/>is true, but we have fewer striking originals. Every

<pb n="118"/>

<mw type="pageNum">118</mw>

<lb/>one is expected to have such a tincture of general
<lb/>knowledge as is incompatible with going deep into
<lb/>any science; and such a conformity to fashionable
<lb/>manners as checks the free workings of the ruling pas­
<lb/>sion, and gives an insipid sameness to the face of so­
<lb/>ciety, under the idea of polish and regularity.</p>
          <p>There is a cast of manners peculiar and becoming
<lb/>to each age, sex, and profession; one, therefore,
<lb/>should not throw out illiberal and common-place cen­
<lb/>sures against another. Each is perfect in its kind.
<lb/>A woman as a woman: a tradesman as a tradesman.
<lb/>We are often hurt by a brutality and sluggish concep­
<lb/>tions of the vulgar; not considering that some there
<lb/>must be, to be hewers of wood and drawers of water,
and that cultivated genius, or even any great refine­
<lb/>ment and delicacy in their moral feelings, would be a
<lb/>real misfortune to them.</p>
          <p>Let us then study the philosophy of the human
<lb/>mind. The man who is master of this science, will
<lb/>know what to expect from every one. From this man,
<lb/>wise advice; from that, cordial sympathy; from an­
<lb/>other, casual entertainment. The passions and in­
<lb/>clinations of others are his tools, which he can use
<lb/>with as much precision as he would the mechanical
<lb/>powers; and he can as readily make allowance for
<lb/>the workings of vanity, or the bias of self-interest in
<lb/>his friends, as for the power of friction, or the irregu­
<lb/>larities of the needle.</p>

<lb/>tive to the scene; when, like a good protestant, I be­
<lb/>gan to indulge a secret triumph in the ruin of so many
<lb/>structures which I had always considered as the haunts
<lb/>of ignorance and superstition.</p>
          <p>Ye are fallen, said I, ye dark and gloomy mansions
<lb/>of mistaken zeal, where the proud priest and lazy
<lb/>monk fattened upon the riches of the land, and crept
<lb/>like vermin from their cells to spread their poisonous
<lb/>doctrines through the nation, and disturb the peace of
<lb/>kings. Obscure in their origin, but daring and am­
<lb/>bitious in their guilt! See how the pure light of heaven
<lb/>is clouded by the dim glass of the arched window,
<lb/>stained with the gaudy colours of monkish tales and
<lb/>legendary fiction; fit emblem how reluctantly they
<lb/>admitted the fairer light of truth amidst these dark
<lb/>recesses, and how much they have debased its genuine
<lb/>lustre! The low cells, the long and narrow aisles, the
<lb/>gloomy arches, the damp and secret caverns which
<lb/>wind beneath the hollow ground, far from impressing
<lb/>on the mind the idea of the God of truth and love,
<lb/>seem only fit for those dark places of the earth, in
<lb/>which are the habitations of cruelty. These massy
<lb/>stones and scattered reliques of the vast edifice, like
<lb/>the large bones and gigantic armour of a once formi­
<lb/>dable ruffian, produce emotions of mingled dread and

<mw type="pageNum">120</mw>
<lb/>exultation. Farewell, ye once venerated seats!
<lb/>enough of you remains, and may it always remain, to
<lb/>remind us from what we have escaped, and make
<lb/>posterity for ever thankful for this fairer age of liberty
<lb/>and light.</p>
          <p>Such were for a while my meditations, but it is
<lb/>cruel to insult a fallen enemy, and I gradually fell in­
<lb/>to a different train of thought. I began to consider 
<lb/>whether something might not be advanced in favour
<lb/>of these institutions during the barbarous ages in which
<lb/>they flourished, and though they have been productive
<lb/>of much mischief and superstition, whether they might
<lb/>not have spread the glimmering of a feeble ray of
<lb/>knowledge, through that thick night which once in­
<lb/>volved the western hemisphere.</p>
          <p>And where, indeed, could the precious remains of
<lb/>classical learning, and the divine monuments of an­
<lb/>cient taste, have been safely lodged amidst the ravages
<lb/>of that age of ferocity and rapine which succeeded the
<lb/>desolation of the Roman empire, except in sanctuaries
<lb/>like these, consecrated by the superstition of the times
<lb/>beyond their intrinsic merit? The frequency of wars,
<lb/>and the licentious cruelty with which they were con­
<lb/>ducted, left neither the hamlet of the peasant nor the
<lb/>castle of the baron free from depredation; but the
<lb/>chuch and monastery generally remained inviolate.
<lb/>There <persName>Homer</persName> and
<persName>Aristotle</persName> were obliged to shroud
<lb/>their heads from the rage of gothic ignorance; and
<lb/>there the sacred records of divine truth were preserv­
<lb/>ed, like treasure hid in the earth in troublesome times,
<lb/>safe, but unenjoyed. Some of the barbarous nations
<lb/>were converted before their conquests, and most of
<lb/>them soon after their settlement in the countries they
<lb/>over-ran. Those buildings which their new faith
<lb/>taught them to venerate, afforded a shelter for those
<lb/>valuable manuscripts, which must otherwise have been

<pb n="121"/>
<milestone n="11(1)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">121</mw>

<lb/>destroyed in the common wreck. At the revival of
<lb/>learning, they were produced from their dormitories.
<lb/>A copy of the pandect of <persName>Justinian</persName>, that
valuable re­
<lb/>main of Roman law, which first gave to
<placeName>Europe</placeName> the
<lb/>idea of a more perfect jurisprudence, and gave men
<lb/>a relish for a new and important study, was discover­
<lb/>ed in a monastery of <placeName>Amalphi</placeName>. Most of the
classics
<lb/>were recovered by the same means; and to this it is
<lb/>owing, to the books and learning preserved in these
<lb/>repositories, that we were not obliged to begin anew,
<lb/>and trace every art by slow, uncertain steps from its
<lb/>first origin. Science, already full grown and vigorous,
<lb/>awaked as from a trance, shook her pinions, and soon
<lb/>soared to the heights of knowledge.</p>
          <p>Nor was she entirely idle during her recess; at
<lb/>least we cannot but confess that what little learning
<lb/>remained in the world, was amongst the priests and re­
<lb/>ligious orders. Books, before the invention of paper
<lb/>and the art of printing, were so dear, that few private
<lb/>persons possessed any. The only libraries were
<lb/>in convents; and the monks were often employed in
<lb/>transcribing manuscripts, which was a very tedious,
<lb/>and at that time a very necessary task. It was fre­
<lb/>quently enjoined as a penance for some slight offence,
<lb/>or given as an exercise to the younger part of the
<lb/>community. The monks were obliged by their rules
<lb/>to spend some stated hours every day in reading and
<lb/>study; nor was any one to be chosen abbot without
<lb/>a competent share of learning. They were the only
<lb/>historians; and though their accounts be interwoven
<lb/>with many a legendary tale, and darkened by much
<lb/>superstition, still they are better than no histories at all;
<lb/>and we cannot but think ourselves obliged to them for
<lb/>transmitting to us, in any dress, the annals of their
<lb/>country.</p>

          <p>They were likewise almost the sole instructers of
<lb/>youth. Towards the end of the tenth century, there
<lb/>were no schools in <placeName>Europe</placeName> but the
monasteries, and
<lb/>those which belonged to episcopal residences; nor
<lb/>any masters but the <orgName>Benedictines</orgName>. It is true, their
<lb/>course of education extended no further than what
<lb/>they called the seven liberal arts, and these were
<lb/>taught in a very dry and uninteresting manner. But
<lb/>this was the genius of the age, and it should not be
<lb/>imputed to them as a reproach that they did not
<lb/>teach well, when no one taught better. We are guilty
<lb/>of great unfairness when we compare the school-men
<lb/>with the philosophers of a more enlightened age: we
<lb/>should contrast them with those of their own times; 
<lb/>with a high-constable of <placeName>France</placeName> who could not read;
<lb/>with kings who made the sign of the cross in confirm­
<lb/>ation of their charters, because they could not write
<lb/>their names; with a whole people without the least
<lb/>glimmering of taste or literature. Whatever was their
<lb/>real knowledge, there was a much greater difference
<lb/>between men of learning, and the bulk of the nation,
<lb/>at that time, than there is at present; and certainly,
<lb/>some of the disciples of those schools, who, though
<lb/>now fallen into disrepute, were revered in their day
<lb/>by the names of the subtle, or the angelic doctors,
<lb/>showed an acuteness and strength of genius, which,
<lb/>if properly directed, would have gone far in philos­
<lb/>ophy; and they only failed because their inquiries
<lb/>were not the objects of human powers. Had they
<lb/>exercised half that acuteness on facts and experiments,
<lb/>they had been truly great men. However, there were
<lb/>not wanting some, even in the darkest ages, whose
<lb/>names will be always remembered with pleasure by
<lb/>the lovers of science. <persName>Alcuin</persName>, the preceptor
of <persName>Charle­
<lb/>magne</persName>, the first who introduced a taste for polite
<lb/>literature into <placeName>France</placeName>, and the chief
instrument that

<pb n="123"/>
<milestone n="11(2)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">123</mw>

<lb/>prince made use of in his noble endeavours for the
<lb/>encouragement of learning; to whom the universities
<lb/>of <placeName>Soissons</placeName>, <placeName>Tours</placeName>,
and <placeName>Paris</placeName> owe their origin: the
<lb/>historians, <persName>Matthew Paris</persName>, <persName>William
 of <placeName>Malmsbury</placeName></persName>; <persName>Savanarola</persName>; the elegant
and unfortunate <persName>Abelard</persName>;
<lb/>and, to crown the rest, the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> <name>Franciscan</name>,
<persName>Roger
<lb/>Bacon</persName>.</p>
          <p>It may be here observed, that forbidding the vulgar
<lb/>tongue in the offices of devotion, and in reading the
<lb/>scriptures, though undoubtedly a great corruption in
<lb/>the <name>Christian Church</name>, was of infinite service to the
<lb/>interests of learning. When the ecclesiastics had
<lb/>locked up their religion in a foreign tongue, they
<lb/>would take care not to lose the key. This gave an
<lb/>importance to the learned languages; and every
<lb/>scholar could not only read, but wrote and disputed
<lb/>in <name>Latin</name>, which without such a motive would probably
<lb/>have been no more studied than the <name>Chinese</name>. And
<lb/>at a time when the modern languages of
<placeName>Europe</placeName> were
<lb/>yet unformed and barbarous, <name>Latin</name> was of great use as
<lb/>a kind of universal tongue, by which learned men
<lb/>might converse and correspond with each other.</p>
          <p>Indeed the monks were almost the only set of men
<lb/>who had leisure or opportunity to pay the least atten­
<lb/>tion to literary subjects. A learned education (and
<lb/>a very little went to that title) was reckoned peculiar
<lb/>to the religious. It was almost esteemed a blemish
<lb/>on the savage and martial character of the gentry, to
<lb/>have any tincture of letters. A man, therefore, of a
<lb/>studious and retired turn, averse to quarrels, and not
<lb/>desirous of the fierce and sanguinary glory of those
<lb/>times, beheld in the cloister a peaceful and honour­
<lb/>able sanctuary; where, without the reproach of
<lb/>cowardice, or danger of invasion, he might devote
<lb/>himself to learning, associate with men of his own
<lb/>turn, and have free access to libraries and manuscripts.

<lb/>In this enlightened and polished age, where learning
<lb/>is diffused through every rank, and many a merchant's
<lb/>clerk possesses more real knowledge than half the
<lb/>literati of that æra, we can scarcely conceive how
<lb/>gross an ignorance overspread those times, and how
<lb/>totally all useful learning might have been lost amongst
<lb/>us, had it not been for an order of men, vested with
<lb/>peculiar privileges, and protected by even a supersti­
<lb/>tious degree of reverence.</p>
          <p>Thus the Muses, with their attendant arts, in strange
<lb/>disguise indeed, and uncouth trappings, took refuge
<lb/>in the peaceful gloom of the convent. Statuary carv­
<lb/>ed a madonna or a crucifix; painting illuminated a
<lb/>missal; eloquence made the panegyric of a saint;
<lb/>and history composed a legend. Yet still they breath­
<lb/>ed, and were ready, at any happier period, to emerge
<lb/>from obscurity with all their native charms and undi­
<lb/>minished lustre.</p>
          <p>But there were other views in which those who de­
<lb/>voted themselves to a monastic life, might be supposed
<lb/>useful to society. They were often employed either
<lb/>in cultivating their gardens, or in curious mechanical
<lb/>works; as indeed the nuns are still famous for many
<lb/>elegant and ingenious manufactures. By the constant
<lb/>communication they had with those of their own order,
<lb/>and with their common head at <placeName>Rome</placeName>, they
maintain­
<lb/>ed some intercourse between nations at a time when
<lb/>travelling was dangerous, and commerce had not, as
<lb/>now, made the most distant parts of the globe familiar
<lb/>to each other: and they kept up a more intimate bond
<lb/>of union amongst learned men of all countries, who
<lb/>would otherwise have been secluded from all knowl­
<lb/>edge of each other. A monk might travel with more
<lb/>convenience than any one else; his person was safer,
<lb/>and he was sure of meeting with proper accommoda­
<lb/>tions. The intercourse with <placeName>Rome</placeName> must have
been

<pb n="125"/>
<milestone n="11(3)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">125</mw>

<lb/>peculiarly favourable to these northern nations; as
<lb/><placeName>Italy</placeName> for a long time led the way in every
improve­
<lb/>ment of politeness or literature: and if we imported
<lb/>their superstition, we likewise imported their manufac­
<lb/>tures, their knowledge, and their taste. Thus
<persName>Alfred</persName>
<lb/>sent for Italian monks, when he wanted to civilize
<lb/>his people, and introduce amongst them some tincture
<lb/>of letters. It may likewise be presumed that they
<lb/>tempered the rigour of monarchy. Indeed they, as
<lb/>well as the sovereigns, endeavoured to enslave the
<lb/>people; but subjection was not likely to be so abject
<lb/>and unlimited where the object of it was divided, and
<lb/>each showed by turns that the other might be opposed.
<lb/>It must have been of service to the cause of liberty, to
<lb/>have a set of men, whose laws, privileges, and immu­
<lb/>nities the most daring kings were afraid to trample on;
<lb/>and this, before a more enlightened spirit of freedom
<lb/>had arisen, might have its effect in preventing the
<lb/>states of christendom from falling into such entire slave­
<lb/>ry as the <name>Asiatics</name>.</p>
          <p>Such an order would in some degree check the
<lb/>excessive regard paid to birth. A man of mean origin
<lb/>and obscure parentage saw himself excluded from al­
<lb/>most every path of secular preferment, and almost
<lb/>treated as a being of an inferior species by the high
<lb/>and haughty spirit of the gentry; but he was at liberty
<lb/>to aspire to the highest dignities of the church; and
<lb/>there have been many who, like <persName>Sextus V.</persName> and
cardi­
<lb/>nal <persName>Wolsey</persName>, have, by their industry and
personal merit
<lb/>alone, raised themselves to a level with kings.</p>
          <p>It should likewise be remembered that many of the
<lb/>orders were charitable institutions; as the <orgName rend="slant(italic)">knights of
<lb/>faith and charity</orgName> in the thirteenth century, who were
<lb/>associated for the purpose of suppressing those bands
<lb/>of robbers which infested the public roads in
<placeName>France</placeName>;
the <orgName rend="slant(italic)">brethren of the order of the redemption</orgName>, for redeem­

<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">11*</mw>

<lb/>ing slaves from the <name>Mahometans</name>; the <orgName rend="slant(italic)">order of St.
<lb/>Anthony</orgName>, first established for the relief of
the poor
<lb/>under certain disorders; and the <orgName rend="slant(italic)">brethren and sisters
<lb/>of the pious and christian schools</orgName>, for educating poor
<lb/>children. These supplied the place of hospitals and
<lb/>other such foundations, which are now established on
<lb/>the broader basis of public benevolence. To bind up
<lb/>the wounds of the stranger, was peculiarly the office
<lb/>of the inhabitants of the convent; and they often shar­
<lb/>ed the charities they received. The exercise of
<lb/>hospitality is still their characteristic, and must have
<lb/>been of particular use formerly, when there were not
<lb/>the conveniences and accomodations for travelling
<lb/>which we now enjoy. The learned stranger was al­
<lb/>ways sure of an agreeable residence amongst them;
<lb/>and as they all understood <name>Latin</name>, they served him for
<lb/>interpreters, and introduced him to a sight of whatever
<lb/>was curious or valuable in the countries which he vis­
<lb/>ited. They checked the spirit of savage fierceness,
<lb/>to which our warlike ancestors were so prone, with
<lb/>the mildness and sanctity of religious influences; they
<lb/>preserved some respect to law and order, and often
<lb/>decided controversies by means less bloody than the
<lb/>sword, though confessedly more superstitious.</p>
          <p>A proof that these institutions had a favourable
<lb/>aspect towards civilization, may be drawn from a late
<lb/>history of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">Soon after the introduction of
<lb/>christianity into that kingdom,</quote> says
<persName>Dr. Leland</persName>, <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">the
<lb/>monks fixed their habitations in deserts, which they
<lb/>cultivated with their own hands, and rendered the
<lb/>most delightful spots in the kingdom. These deserts
<lb/>became well policed cities, and it is remarkable enough,
<lb/>that to the monks we owe so useful an institution in
<lb/><placeName>Ireland</placeName>, as the bringing great numbers
together into
<lb/>one civil community. In these cities the monks set
<lb/>up schools, and taught, not only the youth of
<placeName>Ireland</placeName>,

<lb/>but the neighbouring nations; furnishing them also
<lb/>with books. They became umpires between contend­
<lb/>ing chiefs, and when they could not confine them
<lb/>within the bounds of reason and religion, at last ter­
<lb/>rified them by denouncing divine vengeance against
<lb/>their excesses.</quote></p>
          <p>Let it be considered too, that when the minds of men
<lb/>began to open, some of the most eminent reformers
<lb/>sprung from the bosom of the church, and even of the
<lb/>convent. It was not the laity who began to think.
<lb/>The ecclesiastics were the first to perceive the errors
<lb/>they had introduced. The church was reformed from
<lb/>within, not from without; and like the silk-worm,
<lb/>when ripened in their cells to maturer vigour and per­
<lb/>fection, they pierced the cloud themselves had spun,
<lb/>and within which they had so long been enveloped.</p>
          <p>And let not the good protestant be too much star­
<lb/>tled if I here venture to insinuate, that the monasteries
<lb/>were schools of some high and respectable virtues.
<lb/>Poverty, chastity, and a renunciation of the world,
<lb/>were certainly intended in the first plan of these in­
<lb/>stitutions; and though, from the unavoidable frailty of
<lb/>human nature, they were not always observed, certain
<lb/>it is, that many individuals amongst them have been
<lb/>striking examples of the self-denying virtues; and as
<lb/>the influence they acquired was only built upon the
<lb/>voluntary homage of the mind, it may be presumed
<lb/>such an ascendancy was not originally gained without
<lb/>some species of merit. The fondness for monkery is
<lb/>easily deduced from some of the best principles in
<lb/>the human heart. It was indeed necessity, that in the
<lb/>third century first drove the christians to shelter them­
<lb/>selves from Decian persecution in the solitary
<lb/>deserts of <placeName>Thebais</placeName>, but the humour soon
spread, and
<lb/>numbers under the name of hermits, or eremites,
<lb/>secluded themselves from the commerce of mankind,

<pb n="128"/>
<milestone n="11(4)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">128</mw>

<lb/>choosing the wildest solitudes, living in caves and hol­
<lb/>lows of the rocks, and subsisting on such roots and
<lb/>herbs as the ground afforded them. About the fourth
<lb/>century they were gathered into communities, and in­
<lb/>creased with surprising rapidity. It was then that,
<lb/>by a great and sudden revolution, the fury of perse­
<lb/>cution had ceased, and the governing powers were
<lb/>become friendly to christianity. But the agitation of
<lb/>men's minds did not immediately subside with the
<lb/>storm. The <name>christians</name> had so long experienced the
<lb/>necessity of resigning all the enjoyment of life, and
<lb/>were so detached from every tie which might interfere
<lb/>with the profession of their faith, that upon a more
<lb/>favourable turn of affairs they hardly dared open their
<lb/>minds to pleasurable emotions. They thought the life
<lb/>of a good man must be a continual warfare between
<lb/>mind and body; and having been long used to see
<lb/>ease and safety on the one side, and virtue on the
<lb/>other, no wonder if the association was so strong in
<lb/>their minds, as to suggest the necessity of voluntary
<lb/>mortification, and lead them to inflict those sufferings
<lb/>upon themselves, which they no longer apprehended
<lb/>from others. They had continually experienced the
<lb/>amazing effects of <name>christianity</name> in supporting its followers
<lb/>under hardship, tortures, and death; and they thought
<lb/>little of its influence in regulating the common be­
<lb/>haviour of life, if it produced none of those great
<lb/>exertions they had been used to contemplate. They
<lb/>were struck with the change from heathen licentious­
<lb/>ness to the purity of the gospel; and thought they
<lb/>could never be far enough removed from that bondage
<lb/>of the senses, which it had just cost them so violent a
<lb/>struggle to escape. The minds of men were working
<lb/>with newly-received opinions, not yet mellowed into a
<lb/>rational faith; and the young converts, astonished at
<lb/>the grandeur and sublimity of the doctrines which

<pb n="129"/>
<milestone n="11(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">129</mw>

<lb/>then first entered their hearts with irresistible force,
<lb/>thought them worthy to engross their whole attention.
<lb/>The mystic dreams of the <name>Platonist</name> mingled with the
<lb/>enthusiasm of the martyr; and it soon became the
<lb/>prevailing opinion, that silence, solitude, and contem­
<lb/>plation, were necessary for the reception of divine
<lb/>truth. Mistaken ideas prevailed of a purity and per­
<lb/>fection far superior to the rules of common life, which
<lb/>was only to be attained by those who denied them­
<lb/>selves all the indulgences of sense; and thus the
<lb/>ascetic severities of the cloister succeeded in some
<lb/>degree to the philosophic poverty of the <name>Cynic</name>
school,
<lb/>and the lofty virtues of the <name>Stoic</name> porch.</p>
          <p>Indeed, it is now the prevailing taste in morals to
<lb/>decry every observance which has the least appearance
<lb/>of rigour; and to insist only on the softer virtues.
<lb/>But let it be remembered, that self-command and
<lb/>self-denial are as necessary to the practice of benevo­
<lb/>lence, charity, and compassion, as to any other duty;
<lb/>that it is impossible to live to others without denying
<lb/>ourselves; and that the man who has not learned to
<lb/>curb his appetites and passions is ill qualified for those
<lb/>sacrifices which the friendly affections are continually
<lb/>requiring of him. The man who has that one quality
<lb/>of self-command will find little difficulty in the practice
<lb/>of any other duty; as, on the contrary, he who has it
<lb/>not, though possessed of the gentlest feelings, and most
<lb/>refined sensibilities, will soon find his benevolence sink
<lb/>into a mere companionable easiness of temper, neither
<lb/>useful to others nor happy for himself. A noble en­
<lb/>thusiasm is sometimes of use to show how far human
<lb/>nature can go. Though it may not be proper, or de­
<lb/>sirable, that numbers should seclude themselves from
<lb/>the common duties and ordinary avocations of life, for
<lb/>the austerer lessons of the cloister, yet it is not unuse­
<lb/>ful that some should push their virtues to even a

<pb n="130"/>
<milestone n="11(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">130</mw>

<lb/>romantic height; and it is encouraging to reflect in
<lb/>the hour of temptation, that the love of ease, the
<lb/>aversion to pain, every appetite and passion, and even
<lb/>the strongest propensities in our nature, have been
<lb/>controlled; that the empire of the mind over the
<lb/>body has been asserted in its fullest extent; and that
<lb/>there have been men in all ages capable of voluntarily
<lb/>renouncing all the world offers, voluntarily suffering
<lb/>all its dreads, and living independent, and unconnect­
<lb/>ed with it. Nor was it a small advantage, or ill
<lb/>calculated to support the dignity of science, that a
<lb/>learned man might be respectable in a coarse gown,
<lb/>a leathern girdle, and bare-footed. <persName>Cardinal
Ximenes</persName>
<lb/>preserved the severe simplicity of a convent amidst
<lb/>the pomp and luxury of palaces; and to those who
<lb/>thus thought it becoming in the highest stations to
<lb/>affect the appearance of poverty, the reality surely
<lb/>could not be very dreadful.</p>
          <p>There is yet another light in which these institutions
<lb/>may be considered. It is surely not improper to provide
<lb/>a retreat for those who, stained by some deep and
<lb/>enormous crime, wish to expiate by severe and un­
<lb/>common penitence those offenses which render them
<lb/>unworthy of freer commerce with the world. Re­
<lb/>pentance is never so secure from a relapse as when it
<lb/>breaks off at once from every former connexion, and
<lb/>entering upon a new course of life, bids adieu to every
<lb/>object that might revive the idea of temptations which
<lb/>have once prevailed. In these solemn retreats, the
<lb/>stillness and acknowledged sanctity of the place, with
<lb/>the striking novelty of every thing around them, might
<lb/>have great influence in calming the passions; might
<lb/>break the force of habit, and suddenly induce a new
<lb/>turn of thinking. There are likewise afflictions so
<lb/>overwhelming to humanity, that they leave no relish
<lb/>in the mind for any thing else than to enjoy its own

<lb/>melancholy in silence and solitude; and to a heart
<lb/>torn with remorse, or opprest with sorrow, the gloomy
<lb/>severities of <placeName>La Trappe</placeName> are really a
relief. Retire­
<lb/>ment is also the favourite wish of age. Many a
<lb/>statesman, and many a warrior, sick of the bustle of
<lb/>that world to which they had devoted the prime of
<lb/>their days, have longed for some quiet cell, where,
<lb/>like <persName>cardinal Wolsey</persName>, or <persName>Charles
the Fifth</persName>, they might
<lb/>shroud their grey hairs, and lose sight of the follies
<lb/>with which they had been too much tainted.</p>
          <p>Though there is, perhaps, less to plead for immur­
<lb/>ing beauty in a cloister, and confining that part of the
<lb/>species who are formed to shine in families and sweeten
<lb/>society, to the barren duties and austere discipline of
<lb/>a monastic life; yet circumstances might occur, in
<lb/>which they would, even to a woman, be a welcome
<lb/>refuge. A young female, whom accident or war had
<lb/>deprived of her natural protectors, must, in an age of
<lb/>barbarism, be peculiarly exposed and helpless. A
<lb/>convent offered her an asylum where she might be
<lb/>safe, at least, if not happy; and add to the conscious­
<lb/>ness of unviolated virtue the flattering dreams of angelic
<lb/>purity and perfection. There were orders, as well
<lb/>amongst the women as the men, instituted for charita­
<lb/>ble purposes, such as that of the <orgName rend="slant(italic)">Virgins of Love</orgName>, or
<lb/><orgName rend="slant(italic)">Daughters of Mercy</orgName>,
founded in <date when="1660">1660</date>, for the relief of
<lb/>the sick poor; with others for instructing their children.
<lb/>These must have been peculiarly suited to the softness
<lb/>and compassion of the sex, and to this it is no doubt
<lb/>owing, that still, in catholic countries, ladies of the
<lb/>highest rank often visit the hospitals and houses of the
<lb/>poor; waiting on them with the most tender assiduity,
<lb/>and performing such offices as our protestant ladies
<lb/>would be shocked at the thoughts of. We should also
<lb/>consider, that most of the females who now take the
<lb/>veil, are such as have no agreeable prospects in life.

<lb/>Why should not these be allowed to quit a world which
<lb/>will never miss them? It is easier to retire from the
<lb/>public, than to support its disregard. The convent is
<lb/>to them a shelter from poverty and neglect. Their
<lb/>little community grows dear to them. The equality
<lb/>which subsists among these sisters of obscurity, the
<lb/>similarity of their fate, the peace, the leisure they
<lb/>enjoy, give rise to the most endearing friendships.
<lb/>Their innocence is shielded by the simplicity of their
<lb/>life from even the idea of ill; and they are flattered
<lb/>by the notion of a voluntary renunciation of pleasures,
<lb/>which, probably, had they continued in the world,
<lb/>they would have had little share in.</p>
          <p>After all that can be said, we have reason enough
<lb/>to rejoice that the superstitions of former times are
<lb/>now fallen into disrepute. What might be a palliative
<lb/>at one time, soon became a crying evil in itself. When
<lb/>the fuller day of science began to dawn, the monkish
<lb/>orders were willing to exclude its brightness, that the
<lb/>dim lamp might still glimmer in their cell. Their
<lb/>growing vices have rendered them justly odious to
<lb/>society, and they seem in a fair way of being for ever
<lb/>abolished. But may we not still hope that the world
<lb/>was better than it would have been without them;
<lb/>and that He, who knows to bring good out of evil, has
<lb/>made them, in their day, subservient to some useful
<lb/>purposes. The corruptions of christianity, which have
<lb/>been accumulating for so many ages, seem to be now
<lb/>gradually clearing away, and some future period may
<lb/>perhaps exhibit our religion in all its native simplicity.</p>

          <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">It</hi> is undoubtedly true, though a
phenomenon of
<lb/>the human mind difficult to account for, that the rep­
<lb/>resentation of distress frequently gives pleasure; from
<lb/>which general observation many of our modern writers
<lb/>of tragedy and romance seem to have drawn this in­
<lb/>ference, that in order to please, they have nothing
<lb/>more to do than to paint distress in natural and strik­
<lb/>ing colours. With this view, they heap together all
<lb/>the afflicting events and dismal accidents their imagi­
<lb/>nation can furnish; and when they have half broke
<lb/>the reader's heart, they expect he should thank them
<lb/>for his agreeable entertainment. An author of this
<lb/>class sits down, pretty much like an inquisitor, to
<lb/>compute how much suffering he can inflict upon the
<lb/>hero of his tale before he makes an end of him; with
<lb/>this difference, indeed, that the inquisitor only tortures
<lb/>those who are at least reputed criminals; whereas the
<lb/>writer generally chooses the most excellent character
<lb/>in his piece for the subject of his persecution. The
<lb/>great criterion of excellence is placed in being able to
<lb/>draw tears plentifully; and concluding we shall weep
<lb/>the more, the more the picture is loaded with doleful
<lb/>events, they go on telling

          <p>A monarch once proposed a reward for the discov­
<lb/>ery of a new pleasure; but if any one could find out
<lb/>a new torture, or non-descript calamity, he would be
<lb/>more entitled to the applause of those who fabricated
<lb/>books of entertainment.</p>
          <p>But the springs of pity require to be touched with
<lb/>a more delicate hand; and it is far from being true
<lb/>that we are agreeably affected by every thing that
<lb/>excites our sympathy. It shall therefore be the busi­
<lb/>ness of this essay to distinguish those kinds of distress
<lb/>which are pleasing in the representation, from those
<lb/>which are really painful and disgusting.</p>
          <p>The view or relation of mere misery can never be
<lb/>pleasing. We have, indeed, a strong sympathy with
<lb/>all kinds of misery; but it is a feeling of pure unmix­
<lb/>ed pain, similar in kind, though not equal in degree,
<lb/>to what we feel for ourselves on the like occasions;
<lb/>and never produces that melting sorrow, that thrill of
<lb/>tenderness, to which we give the name of pity. They
<lb/>are two distinct sensations, marked by very different
<lb/>external expression. One causes the nerves to tingle,
<lb/>the flesh to shudder, and the whole countenance to be
<lb/>thrown into strong contractions; the other relaxes the
<lb/>frame, opens the features, and produces tears. When
<lb/>we crush a noxious or loathsome animal, we may
<lb/>sympathize strongly with the pain it suffers, but with
<lb/>far different emotions from the tender sentiment we
<lb/>feel for the dog of <persName>Ulysses</persName>, who crawled to
meet his
<lb/>long-lost master, looked up, and died at his feet.
<lb/>Extreme bodily pain is perhaps the most intense suf­
<lb/>fering we are capable of, and if the fellow-feeling with
<lb/>misery alone was grateful to the mind, the exhibition
<lb/>of a man in a fit of the tooth-ach, or under a chirurgi­
<lb/>cal operation, would have a fine effect in a tragedy.
<lb/>But there must be some other sentiment combined
<lb/>with this kind of instinctive sympathy, before it be­

<pb n="135"/>
<milestone n="12(2)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">135</mw>

<lb/>comes in any degree pleasing, or produces the sweet
<lb/>emotion of pity. This sentiment is love, esteem, the
<lb/>complacency we take in the contemplation of beauty,
<lb/>of mental or moral excellence, called forth and ren­
<lb/>dered more interesting, by circumstances of pain and
<lb/>danger. Tenderness is, much more properly than
<lb/>sorrow, the spring of tears; for it affects us in that
<lb/>manner, whether combined with joy or grief; perhaps
<lb/>more in the former case than the latter. And I be­
<lb/>lieve we may venture to assert, that no distress which
<lb/>produces tears is wholly without a mixture of pleasure.
<lb/>When <persName>Joseph's</persName> brethren were sent to buy corn, 
if they
<lb/>had perished in the desart by wild beasts, or been
<lb/>reduced (as in the horrid adventures of a <persName>Pierre de
<lb/>Vaud</persName>) to eat one another, we might have shuddered,
<lb/>but we should not have wept for them. The gush of
<lb/>tears breaks forth when <persName>Joseph</persName> made himself
known
<lb/>to his brethren, and fell on their neck, and kissed
<lb/>them. When <persName>Hubert</persName> prepares to burn out prince
<lb/><persName>Arthur's</persName> eyes, the shocking circumstance, of
itself,
<lb/>would only affect us with horror; it is the amiable
<lb/>simplicity of the young prince, and his innocent affec­
<lb/>tion to his intended murderer, that draws our tears,
<lb/>and excites that tender sorrow which we love to feel,
<lb/>and which refines the heart while we do feel it.</p>
          <p>We see, therefore, from this view of our internal
<lb/>feelings, that no scenes of misery ought to be exhibit­
<lb/>ed which are not connected with the display of some
<lb/>moral excellence, or agreeable quality. If fortitude,
<lb/>power, and strength of mind are called forth, they
<lb/>produce the sublime feelings of wonder and admiration:
<lb/>if the softer qualities of gentleness, grace, and beauty,
<lb/>they inspire love and pity. The management of these
<lb/>latter emotions is our present object.</p>
          <p>And let it be remembered, in the first place, that
<lb/>the misfortunes which excite pity must not be too

<pb n="136"/>

<lb/>horrid and over-whelming. The mind is rather stun­
<lb/>ned than softened by great calamities. They are
<lb/>little circumstances that work most sensibly upon the
<lb/>tender feelings. For this reason, a well-written novel
<lb/>generally draws more tears than a tragedy. The
<lb/>distresses of tragedy are more calculated to amaze
<lb/>and terrify, than to move compassion. Battles, tor­
<lb/>ture and death are in every page. The dignity of the
<lb/>characters, the importance of the events, the pomp
<lb/>of verse and imagery, interest the grander passions,
<lb/>and raise the mind to an enthusiasm little favourable
<lb/>to the weak and languid notes of pity. The tragedies
<lb/>of <persName>Young</persName> are in a fine strain of poetry, and
the situations
<lb/>are worked up with great energy; but the pictures are
<lb/>in too deep a shade; all his pieces are full of violent
<lb/>and gloomy passions, and so over-wrought with horror,
<lb/>that instead of awakening any pleasing sensibility,
<lb/>they leave on the mind an impression of sadness mix­
<lb/>ed with terror. <persName>Shakspeare</persName> is sometimes
guilty of
<lb/>presenting scenes too shocking. Such is the tramp­
<lb/>ling out of <persName>Gloster's</persName> eyes; and such is the
whole play
<lb/>of <title>Titus Andronicus</title>. But <persName>Lee</persName>,
beyond all others,
<lb/>abounds with this kind of images. He delighted in
<lb/>painting the most daring crimes, and cruel massacres;
<lb/>and though he has shewn himself extremely capable
<lb/>of raising tenderness, he continually checks its course
<lb/>by shocking and disagreeable expressions. His pieces
<lb/>are in the same taste with the pictures of
<persName>Spagnolet</persName>,
<lb/>and there are many scenes in his tragedies which no
<lb/>one can relish who would not look with pleasure on
<lb/>the flaying of <persName>St. Bartholomew</persName>. The following
<lb/>speech of <persName>Marguerite</persName>, in the massacre of
<placeName>Paris</placeName>, was,
<lb/>I suppose, intended to express the utmost tenderness
<lb/>of affection.
<lb/><quote><lg rend="indent(2)" type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l>Die for him! that's too little; I could burn</l><l>Piece-meal away, or bleed to death by drops,</l><pb n="137"/><milestone n="12(3)r" unit="sig"/><mw type="pageNum">137</mw><l>Be flay'd alive, then broke upon the wheel,</l><l>Yet with a smile endure it all for <persName>Guise</persName></l><l>And when let loose from torments, all one wound,</l><l>Run with my mangled arms and crush him dead.</l></lg></quote>
</p>
          <p>Images like these will never excite the softer pas­
<lb/>sions. We are less moved at the description of an
<lb/><name>Indian</name> tortured with all the dreadful ingenuity of
that
<lb/>savage people, than with the fatal mistake of the lover
<lb/>in the <title>Spectator</title>, who pierced an artery in the arm
of
<lb/>his mistress as he was letting her blood. Tragedy
<lb/>and romance-writers, are likewise apt to make too
<lb/>free with the more violent expressions of passion and
<lb/>distress, by which means they lose their effect. Thus
<lb/>an ordinary author does not know how to express any
<lb/>strong emotion otherwise than by swoonings or death;
<lb/>so that a person experienced in this kind of reading,
<lb/>when a girl faints away at parting with her lover, or a
<lb/>hero kills himself for the loss of his mistress, considers
<lb/>it as the established etiquette upon such occasions,
<lb/>and turns over the pages with the utmost coolness
<lb/>and unconcern; whereas real sensibility, and a more
<lb/>intimate knowledge of human nature, would have sug­
<lb/>gested a thousand little touches of grief, which though
<lb/>slight, are irresistible. We are too gloomy a people.
<lb/>Some of the French novels are remarkable for little
<lb/>affecting incidents, imagined with delicacy, and told
<lb/>with grace. Perhaps they have a better turn than
<lb/>we have for this kind of writing.</p>
          <p>A judicious author will never attempt to raise pity
<lb/>by any thing mean or disgusting. As we have al­
<lb/>ready observed, there must be a degree of compla­
<lb/>cence mixed with our sorrows to produce an agree­
<lb/>able sympathy; nothing, therefore, must be admitted
<lb/>which destroys the grace and dignity of suffering;
<lb/>the imagination must have an amiable figure to dwell
<lb/>upon; there are circumstances so ludicrous or disgust­

<lb/>ing, that no character can preserve a proper decorum
<lb/>under them, or appear in an agreeable light. Who
<lb/>can read the following description of
<persName>Polypheme</persName>, with­
<lb/>out finding his compassion entirely destroyed by aver­
<lb/>sion and loathing?
<quote rend="indent(2)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l>…His bloody hand</l><l>Snatch'd two unhappy of my martial band,</l><l>And dash'd like dogs against the stony floor;</l><l>The pavement swims with brains and mingled gore;</l><l>Torn limb from limb, he spreads his horrid feast,</l><l>And fierce devours it like a mountain beast;</l><l>He sucks the marrow, and the blood he drains,</l><l>Nor entrails, flesh, nor solid bone remains.</l></lg></quote>
<lb/>Or that of <name>Scylla</name>,

<lb/>Deformity is always disgusting, and the imagination
<lb/>cannot reconcile it with the idea of a favourite char­
<lb/>acter; therefore the poet and romance-writer are
<lb/>fully justified in giving a larger share of beauty to their
<lb/>principal figures than is usually met with in common
<lb/>life. A late genius, indeed, in a whimsical mood,
<lb/>gave us a lady with her nose crushed for the heroine
<lb/>of his story; but the circumstance spoils the picture;
<lb/>and though in the course of the story it is kept a good
<lb/>deal out of sight, whenever it does recur to the imag­
<lb/>ination, we are hurt and disgusted. It was an heroic
<lb/>instance of virtue in the nuns of a certain abbey, who
<lb/>cut off their noses and lips to avoid violation; yet this
<lb/>would make a very bad subject for a poem or a play.
<lb/>Something akin to this, is the representation of any
<lb/>thing unnatural; of which kind is the famous story of
<lb/>the Roman charity, and for this reason I cannot but
<lb/>think it an unpleasing subject for either the pen or the
<lb/>pencil.</p>

          <p>Poverty, if truly represented, shocks our nicer
<lb/>feelings; therefore, whenever it is made use of to
<lb/>awaken our compassion, the rags and dirt, the squalid
<lb/>appearance and mean employments incident to that
<lb/>state must be kept out of sight, and the distress must
<lb/>arise from the idea of depression, and the shock of
<lb/>falling from higher fortunes. We do not pity
<persName>Belisarius</persName>
<lb/>as a poor blind beggar; and a painter would succeed
<lb/>very ill who should sink him to the meanness of that
<lb/>condition. He must let us still discover the conquer­
<lb/>or of the <name>Vandals</name>, the general of the imperial
armies,
<lb/>or we shall be little interested. Let us look at the
<lb/>picture of the old woman in <persName>Otway</persName>:
<quote rend="indent(2)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l>… A wrinkled hag with age grown double,</l><l>Picking dry sticks, and muttering to herself;</l><l>Her eyes with scalding rheum were galled and red;</l><l>Cold palsy shook her head; her hands seem'd wither'd;</l><l>And on her crooked shoulder had she wrapt</l><l>The tatter'd remnant of an old strip'd hanging,</l><l>Which serv'd to keep her carcase from the cold;</l><l>So there was nothing of a piece about her.</l></lg></quote>
<lb/>Here is the extreme of wretchedness, and instead of
<lb/>melting into pity, we should turn away with digust, if
<lb/>we were not pleased with it, as we are with a Dutch
<lb/>painting, from its exact imitation of nature. Indeed
<lb/>the author only intended it to strike horror. But
<lb/>how different are the sentiments we feel for the lovely
<lb/><persName>Belvidera</persName>! We see none of those circumstances 
which
<lb/>render poverty an unamiable thing. When the goods
<lb/>are seized by an execution, our attention is turned to
<lb/><emph>the piles of massy plate, and all the ancient, most do­
<lb/>mestic ornaments</emph>, which imply grandeur and conse­
<lb/>quence; or to such instances of their hard fortune as
<lb/>will lead us to pity them as lovers: we are struck and
<lb/>affected with the general face of ruin; but we are not
<lb/>brought near enough to discern the ugliness of its

<pb n="140"/>
<milestone n="12(4)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">140</mw>

<lb/>features. <persName>Belvidera</persName> ruined,
<persName>Belvidera</persName> deprived of
<lb/>friends, without a home, abandoned to the wide world—
<lb/>we can contemplate with all the pleasing sympathy
<lb/>of pity; but had she been represented as really sunk
<lb/>into low life, had we seen her employed in the most
<lb/>servile offices of poverty, our compassion would have
<lb/>given way to contempt and disgust. Indeed, we may
<lb/>observe in real life, that poverty is only pitied so long
<lb/>as people can keep themselves from the effects of it.
<lb/>When in common language we say <emph>a miserable object</emph>,
<lb/>we mean an object of distress which, if we relieve,
<lb/>we turn away from at the same time. To make pity
<lb/>pleasing, the object of it must not in any view be dis­
<lb/>agreeable to the imagination. How admirably has the
<lb/>author of <title>Clarissa</title> managed this point! Amidst
scenes of
<lb/>suffering which rend the heart, in poverty, in a prison,
<lb/>under the most shocking outrages, the grace and deli­
<lb/>cacy of her character never suffers even for a moment:
<lb/>there seems to be a charm about her which prevents
<lb/>her receiving a stain from any thing which happens;
<lb/>and <persName>Clarissa</persName>, abandoned and undone, is the
object
<lb/>not only of complacence, but veneration.</p>
          <p>I would likewise observe, that if an author would
<lb/>have us feel a strong degree of compassion, his char­
<lb/>acters must not be too perfect. The stern fortitude
<lb/>and inflexible resolution of a <persName>Cato</persName> may
command
<lb/>esteem, but does not excite tenderness; and faultless
<lb/>rectitude of conduct, though no rigour be mixed with
<lb/>it, is of too sublime a nature to inspire compassion.
<lb/>Virtue has a kind of self-sufficiency; it stands upon
<lb/>its own basis, and cannot be injured by any violence.
<lb/>It must therefore be mixed with something of helpless­
<lb/>ness and imperfection, with an excessive sensibility,
<lb/>or a simplicity bordering upon weakness, before it
<lb/>raises, in any great degree, either tenderness or familiar
<lb/>love. If there be a fault in the masterly performance

<pb n="141"/>
<milestone n="12(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">141</mw>

<lb/>just now mentioned, it is that the character of
<persName>Clarissa</persName>
<lb/>is so inflexibly right, her passions are under such per­
<lb/>fect command, and her prudence is so equal to every
<lb/>occasion, that she seems not to need that sympathy
<lb/>we should bestow upon one of a less elevated charac­
<lb/>ter; and perhaps we should feel a livelier emotion of
<lb/>tenderness for the innocent girl whom
<persName>Lovelace</persName> calls
<lb/>his Rose-bud, but that the story of <persName>Clarissa</persName>
is so
<lb/>worked up by the strength of colouring, and the force
<lb/>of repeated impressions, as to command all our sorrow.</p>
          <p>Pity seems too degrading a sentiment to be offered
<lb/>at the shrine of faultless excellence. The sufferings
<lb/>of martyrs are rather beheld with admiration and sym­
<lb/>pathetic triumph than with tears; and we never feel
<lb/>much for those whom we consider as themselves rais­
<lb/>ed above common feelings.</p>
          <p>The last rule I shall insist upon is, that scenes of
<lb/>distress should not be too long continued. All our
<lb/>finer feelings are in a manner momentary, and no art
<lb/>can carry them beyond a certain point, either in in­
<lb/>tenseness or duration. Constant suffering deadens
<lb/>the heart to tender impressions; as we may observe
<lb/>in sailors and others, who are grown callous by a life
<lb/>of continual hardships. It is therefore highly necessary,
<lb/>in a long work, to relieve the mind by scenes of pleas­
<lb/>ure and gaiety; and I cannot think it so absurd a
<lb/>practice as our modern delicacy has represented it,
<lb/>to intermix wit and and fancy with the pathetic, provided
<lb/>care be taken not to check the passions while they
<lb/>are flowing. The transition from a pleasurable state
<lb/>of mind to tender sorrow is not so difficult as we
<lb/>imagine. When the mind is opened by gay and
<lb/>agreeable scenes, every impression is felt more sensibly.
<lb/>Persons of a lively temper are much more susceptible
<lb/>of that sudden swell of sensibility which occasions
<lb/>tears, than those of a grave and saturnine cast: for

<pb n="142"/>
<milestone n="12(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">142</mw>

<lb/>this reason women are more easily moved to weeping
<lb/>than men. Those who have touched the springs of
<lb/>pity with the finest hand, have mingled light strokes
<lb/>of pleasantry and mirth in their most pathetic passages.
<lb/>Very different is the conduct of many novel-writers,
<lb/>who, by plunging us into scenes of distress without
<lb/>end or limit, exhaust the powers, and, before the con­
<lb/>clusion, either render us insensible to every thing, or
<lb/>fix a real sadness upon the mind. The uniform style
<lb/>of tragedies is one reason why they affect so little.
<lb/>In our old plays, all the force of language is reserved
<lb/>for the more interesting parts; and in the scenes of
<lb/>common life there is no attempt to rise above common
<lb/>language: whereas we, by that pompous manner and
<lb/>affected solemnity which we think it necessary to pre­
<lb/>serve through the whole piece, lose the force of an
<lb/>elevated or passionate expression where the occasion
<lb/>really suggests it.</p>
          <p>Having thus considered the manner in which fictitious
<lb/>distress must be managed to render it pleasing, let us
<lb/>reflect a little upon the moral tendency of such repre­
<lb/>sentations. Much has been said in favour of them,
<lb/>and they are generally thought to improve the tender
<lb/>and humane feelings; but this, I own, appears to me
<lb/>very dubious. That they exercise sensibility, is true;
<lb/>but sensibility does not increase with exercise. By
<lb/>the constitution of our frame our habits increase, our
<lb/>emotions decrease, by repeated acts; and thus a wise
<lb/>provision is made, that as our compassion grows weak­
<lb/>er, its place should be supplied by habitual benevolence.
<lb/>But in these writings our sensibility is strongly called
<lb/>forth without any possibility of exerting itself in virtu­
<lb/>ous action, and those emotions, which we shall never
<lb/>feel again with equal force, are wasted without advan­
<lb/>tage. Nothing is more dangerous than to let virtuous
<lb/>impressions of any kind pass through the mind without

<pb n="143"/>
<milestone n="12(6)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">143</mw>

<lb/>producing their proper effect. The awakenings of
<lb/>remorse, virtuous shame and indignation, the glow of
<lb/>moral approbation—if they do not lead to action, grow
<lb/>less and less vivid every time they recur, till at length
<lb/>the mind grows absolutely callous. The being affect­
<lb/>ed with a pathetic story, is undoubtedly a sign of an
<lb/>amiable disposition, but perhaps no means of increas­
<lb/>ing it. On the contrary, young people, by a course
<lb/>of this kind of reading, often acquire something of
<lb/>that apathy and indifference which the experience of
<lb/>real life would have given them without its advantages.</p>
          <p>Another reason why plays and romances do not
<lb/>improve our humanity is, that they lead us to require
<lb/>a certain elegance of manners and delicacy of virtue
<lb/>which is not often found with poverty, ignorance and
<lb/>meanness. The objects of pity in romance are as
<lb/>different from those in real life as our husbandmen
<lb/>from the shepherds of <placeName>Arcadia</placeName>; and a girl
who will
<lb/>sit weeping the whole night at the delicate distresses of
<lb/>a lady <persName>Charlotte</persName>, or lady
<persName>Julia</persName>, shall be little moved at
<lb/>the complaint of her neighbour, who, in a homely phrase
<lb/>and vulgar accent, laments to her that she is not able
<lb/>to get bread for her family. Romance-writers likewise
<lb/>make great misfortunes so familiar to our ears, that we
<lb/>have hardly any pity to spare for the common accidents
<lb/>of life: but we ought to remember, that misery has a
<lb/>claim to relief, however we may be disgusted with
<lb/>its appearance; and that we must not fancy ourselves
<lb/>charitable, when we are only pleasing our imagination.</p>
          <p>It would perhaps be better, if our romances were
<lb/>more like those of the old stamp, which tended to
<lb/>raise human nature, and inspire a certain grace and
<lb/>dignity of manners of which we have hardly the idea.
<lb/>The high notions of honour, the wild and fanciful
<lb/>spirit of adventure and romantic love, elevated the
<lb/>mind; our novels tend to depress and enfeeble it.

<lb/>Yet there is a species of this kind of writing which
<lb/>must ever afford an exquisite pleasure to persons of
<lb/>taste and sensibility; where noble sentiments are mix­
<lb/>ed with well-fancied incidents, pathetic touches with
<lb/>dignity and grace, and invention with chaste correct­
<lb/>ness. Such will ever interest our sweetest passions.
<lb/>I shall conclude this paper with the following tale.</p>
          <div rend="pre(#ornament)" type="section">
            <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">In</hi> the happy period of the golden age, when all
<lb/>the celestial inhabitants descended to the earth, and
<lb/>conversed familiarly with mortals, among the most
<lb/>cherished of the heavenly powers were twins, the off­
<lb/>spring of <persName>Jupiter</persName>, <persName>Love</persName>
and <persName>Joy</persName>. Where they appear­
<lb/>ed, the flowers sprung up beneath their feet, the sun
<lb/>shone with a brighter radiance, and all nature seemed
<lb/>embellished by their presence. They were insepara­
<lb/>ble companions, and their growing attachment was
<lb/>favoured by <persName>Jupiter</persName>, who had decreed that a
lasting
<lb/>union should be solemnized between them as soon as
<lb/>they were arrived at maturer years. But in the mean
<lb/>time, the sons of men deviated from their native in­
<lb/>nocence; vice and ruin overran the earth with giant
<lb/>strides; and <persName>Astrea</persName>, with her train of
celestial visitants,
<lb/>forsook their polluted abodes. <persName>Love</persName> alone remained,
<lb/>having been stolen away by <persName>Hope</persName>, who was his
nurse,
<lb/>and conveyed her to the forests of <placeName>Arcadia</placeName>, 
where
<lb/>he was brought up among the shepherds. But
<persName>Jupiter</persName>
<lb/>assigned him a different partner, and commanded him to
<lb/>espouse <persName>Sorrow</persName>, the daughter of
<persName>Ate</persName>. He complied
<lb/>with reluctance; for her features were harsh and dis­
<lb/>agreeable, her eyes sunk, her forehead contracted into
<lb/>perpetual wrinkles, and her temples were covered with
<lb/>a wreath of cypress and wormwood. From this
<lb/>union sprung a virgin, in whom might be traced a
<lb/>strong resemblance to both her parents; but the sullen

<lb/>and unamiable features of her mother were so mixed
<lb/>and blended with the sweetness of her father, that her
<lb/>countenance, though mournful, was highly pleasing.
<lb/>The maids and shepherds of the neighbouring plains
<lb/>gathered round, and called her <persName>Pity</persName>. A
redbreast
<lb/>was observed to build in the cabin where she was
<lb/>born; and while she was yet an infant, a dove, pur­
<lb/>sued by a hawk, flew into her bosom. This nymph
<lb/>had a dejected appearance, but so soft and gentle a
<lb/>mien that she was beloved to a degree of enthusiasm.
<lb/>Her voice was low and plaintive, but inexpressibly
<lb/>sweet; and she loved to lie for hours together on the
<lb/>banks of some wild and melancholy stream, singing
<lb/>to her lute. She taught men to weep, for she took a
<lb/>strange delight in tears; and often, when the virgins
<lb/>of the hamlet were assembled at their evening sports,
<lb/>she would steal in among<choice><sic/><corr>s</corr></choice>t them, and captivate their
<lb/>hearts by her tales full of charming sadness. She
<lb/>wore on her head a garland, composed of her father's
<lb/>myrtles, twisted with her mother's cypress.</p>
            <p>One day, as she sat musing by the waters of
<placeName>Helicon</placeName>,
<lb/>her tears by chance fell into the fountain; and ever
<lb/>since, the muses' spring has retained a strong taste of
<lb/>the infusion. <persName>Pity</persName> was commanded by
<persName>Jupiter</persName> to
<lb/>follow the steps of her mother through the world,
<lb/>dropping balm into the wounds she made, and binding
<lb/>up the hearts she had broken. She follows with her
<lb/>hair loose, her bosom bare and throbbing, her garments
<lb/>torn by the briars, and her feet bleeding with the rough­
<lb/>ness of the path. The nymph is mortal, for her
<lb/>mother is so; and when she has fulfilled her destined
<lb/>course upon the earth, they shall both expire together,
<lb/>and <persName>Love</persName> be again united to
<persName>Joy</persName>, his immortal and
<lb/>long-betrothed bride.</p>

          <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">It</hi> is observed by a late most
amiable and elegant
<lb/>writer, that religion may be considered in three differ­
<lb/>ent views. As a system of opinions, its sole object
<lb/>is truth; and the only faculty that has any thing to do
<lb/>with it is reason, exerted in the freest and most dis­
<lb/>passionate inquiry. As a principle regulating our
<lb/>conduct, religion is a habit, and like all other habits,
<lb/>of slow growth, and gaining strength only by repeated
<lb/>exertions. But it may likewise be considered as a
<lb/>taste, an affair of sentiment and feeling, and in this
<lb/>sense it is properly called devotion. Its seat is in the
<lb/>imagination and the passions, and it has its source in
<lb/>that relish for the sublime, the vast, and the beautiful,
<lb/>by which we taste the charms of poetry and other
<lb/>compositions that address our finer feelings; rendered
<lb/>more lively and interesting by a sense of gratitude for
<lb/>personal benefits. It is in a great degree constitutional,
<lb/>and is by no means found in exact proportion to the
<lb/>virtue of a character.</p>
          <p>It is with relation to this last view of the subject
<lb/>that the observations in this essay are hazarded; for
<lb/>though, as a rule of life, the authority and salutary 
<lb/>effects of religion are pretty universally acknowledged,
<lb/>and though its tenets have been defended with suffi­

<pb n="147"/>
<milestone n="13(2)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">147</mw>

<lb/>cient zeal, its affections languish, the spirit of devotion
<lb/>is certainly at a very low ebb amongst us, and what is
<lb/>surprising, it has fallen, I know not how, into a certain
<lb/>contempt, and is treated with great indifference,
<lb/>amongst many of those who value themselves on the
<lb/>purity of their faith, and who are distinguished by the
<lb/>sweetness of their morals. As the religious affections
<lb/>in a great measure rise and fall with the pulse, and
<lb/>are affected by every thing which acts upon the im­
<lb/>agination, they are apt to run into strange excesses;
<lb/>and if directed by a melancholy or enthusiastic faith,
<lb/>their workings are often too strong for a weak head, or
<lb/>a delicate frame; and for this reason they have been
<lb/>almost excluded from religious worship by many per­
<lb/>sons of real piety. It is the character of the present
<lb/>age to allow little to sentiment, and all the warm and
<lb/>generous emotions are treated as romantic by the su­
<lb/>percilious brow of cold-hearted philosophy. The
<lb/>man of science, with an air of superiority, leaves them
<lb/>to some florid declaimer who professes to work upon
<lb/>the passions of the lower class, where they are so
<lb/>debased by noise and nonsense, that it is no wonder if
<lb/>they move disgust in those of elegant and better-
<lb/>informed minds.</p>
          <p>Yet there is a devotion, generous, liberal, and
<lb/>humane, the child of more exalted feelings than base
<lb/>minds can enter into, which assimilates man to higher
<lb/>natures, and lifts him <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">above this visible diurnal
<lb/>sphere.</quote> Its pleasures are ultimate, and, when early
<lb/>cultivated, continue vivid even in that uncomfortable
<lb/>season of life when some of the passions are extinct,
<lb/>when imagination is dead, and the heart begins to con­
<lb/>tract within itself. Those who want this taste, want a
<lb/>sense, a part of their nature, and should not presume
<lb/>to judge of feelings to which they must ever be stran­
<lb/>gers. No one pretends to be a judge in poetry or the

<pb n="148"/>
<milestone n="13(2)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">148</mw>

<lb/>fine arts, who has not both a natural and a cultivated
<lb/>relish for them; and shall the narrow-minded children
<lb/>of earth, absorbed in low pursuits, dare to treat as
<lb/>visionary, objects which they have never made them­
<lb/>selves acquainted with? Silence on such subjects
<lb/>will better become them. But to vindicate the plea­
<lb/>sures of devotion to those who have neither taste nor
<lb/>knowledge about them, is not the present object. It
<lb/>rather deserves our inquiry, what causes have contri­
<lb/>buted to check the operation of religious impressions
<lb/>amongst those who have steady principles, and are
<lb/>well disposed to virtue.</p>
          <p>And, in the first place, there is nothing more pre­
<lb/>judicial to the feelings of a devout heart, than a habit
<lb/>of disputing on religious subjects. Free inquiry is
<lb/>undoubtedly necessary to establish a rational belief;
<lb/>but a disputatious spirit, and fondness for controversy,
<lb/>give the mind a sceptical turn, with an aptness to call
<lb/>in question the most established truths. It is impossi­
<lb/>ble to preserve that deep reverence for the Deity
<lb/>with which we ought to regard him, when all his attri­
<lb/>butes, and even his very existence, become the sub­
<lb/>ject of familiar debate. Candor demands that a man
<lb/>should allow his opponent an unlimited freedom of
<lb/>speech, and it is not easy in the heat of discourse to
<lb/>avoid falling into an indecent or careless expression;
<lb/>hence, those who think seldomer of religious subjects,
<lb/>often treat them with more respect than those whose
<lb/>profession keeps them constantly in their view. A
<lb/>plain man of a serious turn would probably be shocked
<lb/>to hear questions of this nature treated with that ease
<lb/>and negligence with which they are generally discuss­
<lb/>ed by the practised theologian, or the young, lively
<lb/>academic, ready primed from the schools of logic and
<lb/>metaphysics. As the ear loses its delicacy by being
<lb/>obliged only to <emph>hear</emph> coarse and vulgar language, so

<pb n="149"/>
<milestone n="13(3)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">149</mw>

<lb/>the veneration for religion wears off by hearing it
<lb/>treated with disregard, though we ourselves are em­
<lb/>ployed in defending it; and to this it is owing that
<lb/>many who have confirmed themselves in the belief of
<lb/>religion, have never been able to recover that strong
<lb/>and affectionate sense of it which they had before
<lb/>they began to inquire, and have wondered to find their
<lb/>devotion grow weaker, when their faith was better
<lb/>grounded. Indeed, strong reasoning powers and
<lb/>quick feelings do not often unite in the same person.
<lb/>Men of a scientific turn seldom lay their hearts open
<lb/>to impression. Previously biassed by the love of sys­
<lb/>tem, they do indeed attend the offices of religion, but
<lb/>they dare not trust themselves with the preacher, and
<lb/>are continually upon the watch to observe whether
<lb/>every sentiment agrees with their own particular
<lb/>tenets.</p>
          <p>The spirit of inquiry is easily distinguished from
<lb/>the spirit of disputation. A state of doubt is not a
<lb/>pleasant state. It is painful, anxious, and distressing
<lb/>beyond most others; it disposes the mind to dejection
<lb/>and modesty. Whoever therefore is so unfortunate
<lb/>as not to have settled his opinions in important points,
<lb/>will proceed in the search of truth with deep humility,
<lb/>unaffected earnestness, and a serious attention to every
<lb/>argument that may be offered, which he will be much
<lb/>rather inclined to revolve in his own mind, than to
<lb/>use as materials for dispute. Even with these dispo­
<lb/>sitions, it is happy for a man when he does not find
<lb/>much to alter in the religious system he has embrac­
<lb/>ed; for if that undergoes a total revolution, his reli­
<lb/>gious feelings are too generally so weakened by the
<lb/>shock, that they hardly recover again their original
<lb/>tone and vigour.</p>
          <p>Shall we mention philosophy as an enemy to reli­
<lb/>gion? God forbid! Philosophy,

<lb/>Yet there is a view in which she exerts an influence
<lb/>perhaps rather unfavourable to the fervour of simple
<lb/>piety. Philosophy does indeed enlarge our concep­
<lb/>tions of the Deity, and gives us the sublimest ideas of
<lb/>his power and extent of dominion; but it raises him
<lb/>too high for our imaginations to take hold of, and in
<lb/>a great measure destroys that affectionate regard
<lb/>which is felt by the common class of pious christians.
<lb/>When, after contemplating the numerous productions
<lb/>of this earth, the various forms of being, the laws,
<lb/>the mode of their existence, we rise yet higher, and
<lb/>turn our eyes to that magnificent profusion of suns
<lb/>and systems which astronomy pours upon the mind;
<lb/>when we grow acquainted with the majestic order of
<lb/>nature, and those eternal laws which bind the material
<lb/>and intellectual worlds; when we trace the footsteps
<lb/>of creative energy through regions of unmeasured
<lb/>space, and still find new wonders disclosed and press­
<lb/>ing upon the view—we grow giddy with the prospect;
<lb/>the mind is astonished, confounded at its own insigni­
<lb/>ficance; we think it almost impiety for a worm to lift
<lb/>its head from the dust, and address the Lord of so
<lb/>stupendous a universe; the idea of communion with
<lb/>our Maker shocks us as presumption, and the only
<lb/>feeling the soul is capable of in such a moment, is a
<lb/>deep and painful sense of its own abasement. It is
<lb/>true, the same philosophy teaches that the Deity is
<lb/>intimately present through every part of this compli­
<lb/>cated system, and neglects not any of his works: but
<lb/>this is a truth which is believed without being felt; our
<lb/>imagination cannot here keep pace with our reason,
<lb/>and the sovereign of nature seems ever further removed
<lb/>from us, in proportion as we enlarge the bounds of his
<lb/>creation.

<lb/>Philosophy represents the Deity in too abstracted
<lb/>a manner to engage our affections. A Being without
<lb/>hatred and without fondness, going on in one steady
<lb/>course of even benevolence, neither delighted with
<lb/>praises, nor moved by importunity, does not interest
<lb/>us so much as a character open to the feelings of in­
<lb/>dignation, the soft relentings of mercy, and the par­
<lb/>tialities of particular affections. We require some
<lb/>common nature, or at least the appearance of it, on
<lb/>which to build our intercourse. It is also a fault of
<lb/>which philosophers are often guilty, that they dwell
<lb/>too much in generals. Accustomed to reduce every
<lb/>thing to the operation of general laws, they turn our
<lb/>attention to larger views, attempt to grasp the whole
<lb/>order of the universe, and in the zeal of a systematic
<lb/>spirit, seldom leave room for for those particular and per­
<lb/>sonal mercies which are the food of gratitude. They
<lb/>trace the great outline of nature, but neglect the col­
<lb/>ouring which gives warmth and beauty to the piece.
<lb/>As in poetry it is not vague and general description, but
<lb/>a few striking circumstances clearly related and strong­
<lb/>ly worked up—as in a landscape it is not such a vast
ex­
<lb/>tensive range of country as pains the eye to stretch to
<lb/>its limits, but a beautiful, well-defined prospect, which
<lb/>gives the most pleasure—so neither are those un­
<lb/>bounded views in which philosophy delights, so much
<lb/>calculated to touch the heart, as home views and near­
<lb/>er objects. The philosopher offers up general praises
<lb/>on the altar of universal nature; the devout man, on
<lb/>the altar of his heart, presents his own sighs, his own
<lb/>thanksgivings, his own earnest desires: the former
<lb/>worship is more sublime, the latter more personal and
<lb/>affecting.</p>
          <p>We are likewise too scrupulous in our public exer­
<lb/>cises, and too studious of accuracy. A prayer strictly
<lb/>philosophical must ever be a cold and dry composition.

<pb n="152"/>
<milestone n="13(4)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">152</mw>

<lb/>From an over-anxious fear of admitting any expres­
<lb/>sion that is not strictly proper, we are apt to reject all
<lb/>warm and pathetic imagery, and, in short, every thing
<lb/>that strikes upon the heart and the senses. But it
<lb/>may be said, <quote rend="pre(“)post()">If the Deity
be indeed so sublime a
<lb/>being, and if his designs and manner are so infinitely
<lb/>beyond our comprehension, how can a thinking mind
<lb/>join in the addresses of the vulgar, or avoid being over­
<lb/>whelmed with the indistinct vastness of such an
idea.</quote>
<lb/>Far be it from me to deny that awe and veneration
<lb/>must ever make a principal part of our regards to
<lb/>the Master of the universe, or to defend that style of
<lb/>indecent familiarity which is yet more shocking than
<lb/>indifference: but let it be considered that we cannot
<lb/>hope to avoid all improprieties in speaking of such a
<lb/>Being; that the most philosophical address we can
<lb/>frame, is probably no more free from them than the
<lb/>devotions of the vulgar; that the scriptures set us an
<lb/>example of accomodating the language of prayer
<lb/>to common conceptions, and making use of figures
<lb/>and modes of expression far from being strictly defen­
<lb/>sible; and that, upon the whole, it is safer to trust to
<lb/>our genuine feelings, feelings implanted in us by the
<lb/>God of nature, than to any metaphysical subtleties.
<lb/>He has impressed me with the idea of trust and con­
<lb/>fidence, and my heart flies to him in danger; of mer­
<lb/>cy to forgive, and I melt down before him in penitence; of
<lb/>bounty to bestow, and I ask of him all I want or wish
<lb/>for. I may make use of an inaccurate expression, I
<lb/>may paint him to my imagination too much in the
<lb/>fashion of humanity; but while my heart is pure,
<lb/>while I depart not from the line of moral duty, the
<lb/>error is not dangerous. Too critical a spirit is the
<lb/>bane of every thing great or pathetic. In our creeds
<lb/>let us be guarded; let us there weigh every syllable;
<lb/>but in compositions addressed to the heart, let us give

<pb n="153"/>
<milestone n="13(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">153</mw>

<lb/>freer scope to the language of the affections, and the
<lb/>overflowing of a warm and generous disposition.
</p>
          <p>Another cause which most effectually operates to
<lb/>check devotion, is ridicule. I speak not here of open
<lb/>derision of things sacred; but there is a certain ludi­
<lb/>crous style in talking of such subjects, which, without
<lb/>any ill design, does much harm; and perhaps those
<lb/>whose studies or profession lead them to be chiefly
<lb/>conversant with the offices of religion, are most apt to
<lb/>fall into this impropriety; for their ideas being chiefly
<lb/>taken from that source, their common conversation is
<lb/>apt to be tinctured with fanciful allusions to scripture
<lb/>expressions, to prayers, &amp;c. which have all the effect
<lb/>of a parody, and, like parodies, destroy the force of
<lb/>the finest passage, by associating it with something
<lb/>trivial and ridiculous. Of this nature is
<persName>Swift's</persName> well-
<lb/>known jest of <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">Dearly
beloved <persName>Roger</persName>,</quote> which who­
<lb/>ever has strong upon his memory, will find it impossi­
<lb/>ble to attend with proper seriousness to that part of
<lb/>the service. We should take great care to keep clear
<lb/>from all these trivial associations, in whatever we wish
<lb/>to be regarded as venerable.</p>
          <p>Another species of ridicule to be avoided, is that
<lb/>kind of sneer often thrown upon those whose hearts
<lb/>are giving way to honest emotion. There is an ex­
<lb/>treme delicacy in all the finer affections, which makes
<lb/>them shy of observation, and easily checked. Love,
<lb/>wonder, pity, the enthusiasm of poetry, shrink from
<lb/>the notice of even an indifferent eye, and never in­
<lb/>dulge themselves freely but in solitude, or when
<lb/>heightened by the powerful force of sympathy. Ob­
<lb/>serve an ingenuous youth at a well-wrought tragedy.
<lb/>If all around him are moved, he suffers his tears to
<lb/>flow freely; but if a single eye meets him with a
<lb/>glance of contemptuous indifference, he can no longer
<lb/>enjoy his sorrow; he blushes at having wept, and in

<pb n="154"/>
<milestone n="13(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">154</mw>

<lb/>a moment his heart is shut up to every impression of
<lb/>tenderness. It is sometimes mentioned as a reproach
<lb/>to <name>Protestants</name>, that they are susceptible of a false
<lb/>shame when observed in the exercises of their reli­
<lb/><choice><sic>li</sic><corr>␣</corr></choice>gion, from which Papists are free. But I take 
this
<lb/>to proceed from the purer nature of our religion; for
<lb/>the less it is made to consist in outward pomp and
<lb/>mechanical worship, and the more it has to do with
<lb/>the finer affections of the heart, the greater will be
<lb/>the reserve and delicacy which attend the expression
<lb/>of its sentiments. Indeed, ridicule ought to be very
<lb/>sparingly used; for it is an enemy to every thing sub­
<lb/>lime or tender: the least degree of it, whether well
<lb/>or ill founded, suddenly and instantaneously stops the
<lb/>workings of passion; and those who indulge a talent
<lb/>that way, would do well to consider, that they are
<lb/>rendering themselves for ever incapable of all the
<lb/>higher pleasures either of taste or morals. More es­
<lb/>pecially do these cold pleasantries hurt the minds of
<lb/>youth, by checking that generous expansion of heart
<lb/>to which their open tempers are naturally prone, and
<lb/>producing a vicious shame, through which they are
<lb/>deprived of the enjoyment of heroic sentiments or
<lb/>generous action.</p>
          <p>In the next place, let us not be superstitiously afraid
<lb/>of superstition. It shows great ignorance of the hu­
<lb/>man heart, and the springs by which its passions are
<lb/>moved, to neglect taking advantage of the impression
<lb/>which particular circumstances, times, and seasons,
<lb/>naturally make upon the mind. The root of all su­
<lb/>perstition is the principle of the association of ideas,
<lb/>by which objects, naturally indifferent, become dear
<lb/>and venerable, through their connexion with interest­
<lb/>ing ones. It is true, this principle has been much
<lb/>abused: it has given rise to pilgrimages innumerable,
<lb/>worship of relics, and priestly power. But let us not

<pb n="155"/>
<milestone n="13(6)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">155</mw>

<lb/>carry our ideas of purity and simplicity so far as to
<lb/>neglect it entirely. Superior natures, it is possible,
<lb/>may be equally affected with the same truths at all
<lb/>times, and in all places; but we are not so made.
<lb/>Half the pleasures of elegant minds are derived from
<lb/>this source. Even the enjoyments of sense, without
<lb/>it, would lose much of their attraction. Who does
<lb/>not enter into the sentiment of the poet, in that pas­
<lb/>sage so full of nature and truth:
<quote rend="indent(2)pre(“)post(”)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l>He that outlives this hour, and comes safe home,</l><l>Shall stand on tiptoe when this day is named,</l><l>And rouse him at the name of <persName>Crispian</persName>:</l><l>He that outlives this day and sees old age,</l><l>Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,</l><l>And say, To-morrow is <name>St. Crispian</name>.</l></lg></quote>
<lb/>But were not the benefits of the victory equally ap­
<lb/>parent on any other day of the year? Why com­
<lb/>memorate the anniversary with such distinguished
<lb/>regard? Those who can ask such a question, have
<lb/>never attended to some of the strongest instincts in
<lb/>our nature. Yet it has lately been the fashion,
<lb/>amongst those who call themselves rational <name>christians</name>,
<lb/>to treat as puerile, all attentions of this nature when
<lb/>relative to religion. They would
<quote rend="indent(2)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l>Kiss with pious lips the sacred earth</l><l>Which gave a <persName>Hampden</persName> or a <persName>Russel</persName> birth.</l></lg></quote>
<lb/>They will visit the banks of <placeName>Avon</placeName> with all the
devo­
<lb/>tion of enthusiastic zeal; celebrate the birth-day of
<lb/>the hero and the patriot; and yet pour contempt upon
<lb/>the <name>christian</name> who suffers himself to be warmed by
<lb/>similar circumstances relating to his Master, or the
<lb/>connexion of sentiments of peculiar reverence with
<lb/>times, places, and men, which have been appropriated
<lb/>to the service of religion. A wise preacher will not,
<lb/>from a fastidious refinement, disdain to affect his hear­
<lb/>ers from the season of the year, the anniversary of a

<lb/>national blessing, a remarkable escape from danger,
<lb/>or, in short, any incident that is sufficiently guarded,
<lb/>and far enough removed from what is trivial, to be
<lb/>out of danger of becoming ludicrous.</p>
          <p>It will not be amiss to mention here, a reproach
<lb/>which has been cast upon devotional writers, that they
<lb/>are apt to run into the language of love. Perhaps
<lb/>the charge would be full as just, had they said that
<lb/>Love borrows the language of Devotion; for the vo­
<lb/>taries of that passion are fond of using those exagger­
<lb/>ated expressions, which can suit nothing below Divin­
<lb/>ity; and you can hardly address the greatest of all
<lb/>Beings in a strain of more profound adoration, than
<lb/>the lover uses to the object of his attachment. But
<lb/>the truth is, devotion does in no small degree resem­
<lb/>ble that fanciful and elevated kind of love which de­
<lb/>pends not on the senses. Nor is the likeness to be
<lb/>wondered at, since both have their source in the love
<lb/>of beauty and excellence. Both are exceeding
<lb/>prone to superstition, and apt to run into romantic
<lb/>excesses. Both are nourished by poetry and music,
<lb/>and felt with the greatest fervour in the warmer cli­
<lb/>mates. Both carry the mind out of itself, and power­
<lb/>fully refine the affections from every thing gross, low,
<lb/>and selfish.</p>
          <p>But it is time to retire; we are treading upon en­
<lb/>chanted ground, and shall be suspected by many of
<lb/>travelling towards the regions of chivalry and old ro­
<lb/>mance. And were it so, many a fair majestic idea
<lb/>might be gathered from those forgotten walks, which
<lb/>would well answer the trouble of transplanting. It
<lb/>must, however, be owned, that very improper lan­
<lb/>guage has formerly been used on these subjects; but
<lb/>there cannot be any great danger of such excesses,
<lb/>where the mind is guarded by a rational faith, and
<lb/>the social affections have full scope in the free com­
<lb/>merce and legitimate connexions of society.</p>
          <pb n="157"/>
          <milestone n="14(1)r" unit="sig"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">157</mw>
          <p>Having thus considered the various causes which
<lb/>contribute to deaden the feelings of devotion, it may
<lb/>not be foreign to the subject to enquire in what man­
<lb/>ner they are affected by the different modes of religion.
<lb/>I speak not of opinions; for these have much less in­
<lb/>fluence upon the heart, than the circumstances which
<lb/>attend particular persuasions. A sect <emph>may</emph> only differ
<lb/>from an establishment, as one absurd opinion differs
<lb/>from another: but there is a character and cast of
<lb/>manners belonging to each, which will be perfectly
<lb/>distinct; and of a sect, the character will vary as it
<lb/>is a rising or a declining sect, persecuted or at ease.
<lb/>Yet while divines have wearied the world with can­
<lb/>vassing contrary doctrines and jarring articles of faith,
<lb/>the philosopher has not considered, as the subject de­
<lb/>served, what situation was most favourable to virtue,
<lb/>sentiment, and pure manners. To a philosophic eye,
<lb/>free from prejudice, and accustomed to large views of
<lb/>the great polity carried on in the moral world, perhaps
<lb/>varying and opposite forms may appear proper, and
<lb/>well calculated for their respective ends; and he will
<lb/>neither wish entirely to destroy the old, nor wholly to
<lb/>crush the new.</p>
          <p>The great line of division between different modes
<lb/>of religion, is formed by establishments and sects. In
<lb/>an infant sect, which is always in some degree a per­
<lb/>secuted one, the strong union and entire affection of
<lb/>its followers, the sacrifices they make to principle, the
<lb/>force of novelty, and the amazing power of sympa­
<lb/>thy, all contribute to cherish devotion. It rises even
<lb/>to passion, and absorbs every other sentiment. Sever­
<lb/>ity of manners imposes respect; and the earnestness
<lb/>of the new proselytes renders them insensible to inju­
<lb/>ry, or even to ridicule. A strain of eloquence, often
<lb/>coarse indeed, but strong and persuasive, works like
<lb/>leaven in the heart of the people. In this state, all

<mw type="pageNum">158</mw>

<lb/>outward helps are superfluous, the living spirit of de­
<lb/>votion is amongst them, the world sinks away to noth­
<lb/>ing before it, and every object but one is annihilated.
<lb/>The social principle mixes with the flame, and renders
<lb/>it more intense; strong parties are formed, and
<lb/>friends or lovers are not more closely connected than
<lb/>the members of these little communities.</p>
          <p>It is this kind of devotion, a devotion which those
<lb/>of more settled and peaceable times can only guess
<lb/>at, which made amends to the first <name>christians</name> for all
<lb/>they resigned, and all they suffered: this draws the
<lb/>martyr to a willing death, and enables the confessor
<lb/>to endure a voluntary poverty. But this stage cannot
<lb/>last long: the heat of persecution abates, and the fer­
<lb/>vour of zeal feels a proportional decay. Now comes
<lb/>on the period of reasoning and examination. The
<lb/>principles which have produced such mighty effects
<lb/>on the minds of men, acquire an importance, and be­
<lb/>come objects of the public attention. Opinions are
<lb/>canvassed. Those who before bore testimony to their
<lb/>religion only by patient suffering, now defend it with
<lb/>argument; and all the keenness of polemical disquisi­
<lb/>tion is awakened on either side. The fair and gene­
<lb/>rous idea of religious liberty, which never originates in
<lb/>the breast of a triumphant party, now begins to unfold
<lb/>itself. To vindicate these rights, and explain these
<lb/>principles, learning, which in the former state was
<lb/>despised, is assiduously cultivated  by the sectaries;
<lb/>their minds become enlightened, and a large portion
<lb/>of knowledge, especially religious knowledge, is dif­
<lb/>fused through their whole body. Their manners are
<lb/>less austere, without having as yet lost any thing of
<lb/>their original purity. Their ministers gain respect as
<lb/>writers, and their pulpit discourses are studied and
<lb/>judicious. The most unfavourable circumstances of this
<lb/>era is, that those who dissent, are very apt to acquire

<pb n="159"/>
<milestone n="14(2)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">159</mw>

<lb/>a critical and disputatious spirit; for being continually
<lb/>called upon to defend doctrines in which they differ
<lb/>from the generality, their attention is early turned to
<lb/>the argumentative part of religion; and hence we see
<lb/>that sermons which afford food for this taste, are with
<lb/>them thought of more importance than prayer and
<lb/>praise, though these latter are undoubtedly the more
<lb/>genuine and indispensible parts of public worship.</p>
          <p>This then is the second period; the third approaches
<lb/>fast; men grow tired of a controversy which becomes
<lb/>insipid from being exhausted; persecution has not
<lb/>only ceased, it begins to be forgotten; and from the
<lb/>absence of opposition in either kind, springs a fatal
<lb/>and spiritless indifference. That sobriety, industry,
<lb/>and abstinence from fashionable pleasures, which dis­
<lb/>tinguished the fathers, has made the sons wealthy; and,
<lb/>eager to enjoy their riches, they long to mix with
<lb/>that world, a separation from which was the best
<lb/>guard to their virtues. A secret shame creeps in
<lb/>upon them, when they acknowledge their relation
<lb/>to a disesteemed sect; they therefore endeavour to
<lb/>file off its peculiarities, but in so doing they destroy
<lb/>its very being. Connexions with the establishment,
<lb/>whether of intimacy, business, or relationship, which
<lb/>formerly, from their superior zeal, turned to the ad­
<lb/>vantage of the sect, now operate against it. Yet these
<lb/>connexions are formed more frequently than ever;
<lb/>and those who a little before, soured by the memory
<lb/>of recent suffering, betrayed perhaps an aversion from
<lb/>having anything in common with the church, now
<lb/>affect to come as near it as possible; and, like a little
<lb/>boat that takes a large vessel in tow, the sure conse­
<lb/>quence is, the being drawn into its vortex. They
<lb/>aim at elegance and show in their places of worship,
<lb/>the appearance of their preachers, &amp;c., and thus im­
<lb/>politicly awaken a taste it is impossible they should

<pb n="160"/>
<milestone n="14(2)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">160</mw>

<lb/>ever gratify. They have worn off many forbidding
<lb/>singularities, and are grown more amiable and pleasing.
<lb/>But those singularities were of use: they set a mark
<lb/>upon them, they pointed them out to the world, and
<lb/>thus obliged persons, so distinguished, to exemplary
<lb/>strickness. No longer obnoxious to the world, they
<lb/>are open to all the seductions of it. Their minister,
<lb/>that respectable character which once inspired reve­
<lb/>rence and affectionate esteem, their teacher and their
<lb/>guide, is now dwindled into the mere leader of the
<lb/>public devotions; or, lower yet, a person hired to
<lb/>entertain them every week with an elegant discourse.
<lb/>In proportion as his importance decreases, his salary
<lb/>sits heavy on the people; and he feels himself depress­
<lb/>ed by that most cruel of all mortifications to a generous
<lb/>mind, the consciousness of being a burden upon those
<lb/>from whom he derives his scanty support. Unhappily,
<lb/>amidst this change of manners, there are forms of
<lb/>strictness, and a set of phrases introduced in their first
<lb/>enthusiasm, which still subsist: these they are asham­
<lb/>ed to use, and know not how to decline; and their
<lb/>behaviour, in consequence of them, is awkward and
<lb/>irresolute. Those who have set out with the largest
<lb/>share of mysticism and flighty zeal, find themselves
<lb/>particularly embarrassed by this circumstance.</p>
          <p>When things are come to this crisis, their tendency
<lb/>is evident: and though the interest and name of a
<lb/>sect may be kept up for a time by the generosity of
<lb/>former ages, the abilities of particular men, or that
<lb/>reluctance which keeps a generous mind from break­
<lb/>ing old connexions; it must, in a short course of years,
<lb/>melt away into the establishment, the womb and the
<lb/>grave of all other modes of religion.</p>
          <p>An establishment affects the mind by splendid
<lb/>buildings, music, the mysterious pomp of ancient cere­
<lb/>monies; by the sacredness of peculiar orders, habits,

<pb n="161"/>
<milestone n="14(3)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">161</mw>

<lb/>and titles; by its secular importance; and by con­
<lb/>necting with religion, ideas of order, dignity, and an­
<lb/>tiquity. It speaks to the heart through the imagination
<lb/>and the senses; and though it never can raise devo­
<lb/>tion so high as we have described it in a beginning
<lb/>sect, it will preserve it from ever sinking into contempt.
<lb/>As, to a woman in the glow of health and beauty, the
<lb/>most careless dress is the most becoming, but when
<lb/>the freshness of youth is worn off, greater attention is
<lb/>necessary, and rich ornaments are required to throw
<lb/>an air of dignity round her person; so while a sect
<lb/>retains its first plainness, simplicity and affectionate
<lb/>zeal, it wants nothing an establishment could give;
<lb/>but that once declined, the latter becomes far more
<lb/>respectable. The faults of an establishment grow
<lb/>venerable from length of time; the improvements of
<lb/>a sect appear whimsical from their novelty. Ancient
<lb/>families, fond of rank, and of that order which secures
<lb/>it to them, are on the side of the former. Traders
<lb/>incline to the latter; and so do generally men of
<lb/>genius, as it favours their originality of thinking. An
<lb/>establishment leans to superstition, a sect to enthu­
<lb/>siasm; the one is a more dangerous and violent ex­
<lb/>cess, the other more fatally debilitates the powers of
<lb/>the mind; the one is a deeper colouring, the other a
<lb/>more lasting dye; but the coldness and languor of a
<lb/>declining sect produces scepticism. Indeed, a sect is
<lb/>never stationary, as it depends entirely on passions
<lb/>and opinions; though it often attains excellence, it
<lb/>never rests in it, but is always in danger of one extreme
<lb/>or the other; whereas an old establishment, whatever
<lb/>else it may want, possesses the grandeur arising from
<lb/>stability.</p>
          <p>We learn to respect whatever respects itself; and
<lb/>are easily led to think that system requires no alter­
<lb/>ation, which never admits of any. It is this circum­

<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">14*</mw>
<pb n="162"/>
<milestone n="14(3)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">162</mw>

<lb/>stance, more than any other, which gives a dignity to
<lb/>that accumulated mass of error, the church of
<placeName>Rome</placeName>.
<lb/>A fabric which has weathered many successive ages,
<lb/>though the architecture be rude, the parts dispropor­
<lb/>tionate, and overloaded with ornament, strikes us with
<lb/>a sort of admiration, merely from its having held so
<lb/>long together.</p>
          <p>The minister of a sect, and of an establishment, is
<lb/>upon a very different footing. The former is like the
<lb/>popular leader of an army; he is obeyed with en­
<lb/>thusiasm while he is obeyed at all; but his influence
<lb/>depends on opinion, and is entirely personal; the
<lb/>latter resembles a general appointed by the monarch;
<lb/>he has soldiers less warmly devoted to him, but more
<lb/>steady, and better disciplined. The dissenting teach­
<lb/>er is nothing, if he have not the spirit of a martyr; and
<lb/>is the scorn of the world, if he be not above the world.
<lb/>The clergyman, possessed of power and affluence, and
<lb/>for that reason chosen from among the better ranks of
<lb/>people, is respected as a gentleman, though not ven­
<lb/>erated as an apostle; and as his profession generally
<lb/>obliges him to decent manners, his order is consider­
<lb/>ed as a more regular and civilized class of men than
<lb/>their fellow-subjects of the same rank. The dissent­
<lb/>ing teacher, separated from the people, but not raised
<lb/>above them, invested with no power, entitled to no
<lb/>emoluments, if he cannot acquire for himself authority,
<lb/>must feel the bitterness of dependence. The min­
<lb/>isters of the former denomination cannot fall, but in
<lb/>some violent convulsion of the state: those of the lat­
<lb/>ter, when indifference and mutual neglect begin to
<lb/>succeed to that close union which once subsisted be­
<lb/>tween them and their followers, lose their former in­
<lb/>fluence without resource; the dignity and weight of
<lb/>their office is gone for ever; they feel the insignifi­
<lb/>cancy of their pretensions, their spirits sink, and, ex­

<pb n="163"/>
<milestone n="14(4)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">163</mw>

<lb/>cept they take refuge in some collateral pursuit, and
<lb/>stand candidates for literary fame, they slide into an
<lb/>ambiguous and undecided character; their time is too
<lb/>often sacrificed to frivolous compliances; their man­
<lb/>ners lose their austerity, without having proportionally
<lb/>gained in elegance; the world does not acknowledge
<lb/>them, for they are not of the world; it cannot esteem
<lb/>them, for they are not superior to the world.</p>
          <p>Upon the whole, then it should seem, that the strict­
<lb/>ness of a sect (and it can only be respectable by being
<lb/>strict) is calculated for a few finer spirits, who make
<lb/>religion their chief object. As to the much larger
<lb/>number, on whom she has only an imperfect influence,
<lb/>making them decent if not virtuous, and meliorating
<lb/>the heart without greatly changing it; for all these
<lb/>the genius of an establishment is more eligible, and
<lb/>better fitted to cherish that moderate devotion of which
<lb/>alone they are capable. All those who have not
<lb/>strength of mind to think for themselves, who would
<lb/>live to virtue without denying the world, who wish
<lb/>much to be religious, but more to be genteel, natural­
<lb/>ly flow into the establishment. If it offered no motives
<lb/>to their minds, but such as are perfectly pure and
<lb/>spiritual, their devotion would not for that be more
<lb/>exalted, it would die away to nothing; and it is better
<lb/>their minds should receive only a tincture of religion,
<lb/>than be wholly without it. Those too, whose passions
<lb/>are regular and equable, and who do not aim at ab­
<lb/>stracted virtues, are commonly placed to most advan­
<lb/>tage within the pale of the national faith.</p>
          <p>All the greater exertions of the mind,—spirit to
<lb/> reform, fortitude and constancy to suffer,—can be
<lb/>expected only from those who, forsaking the common
<lb/>road, are exercised in a peculiar course of moral dis­
<lb/>cipline: but it should be remembered, that these ex­
<lb/>ertions cannot be expected from every character, nor

<pb n="164"/>
<milestone n="14(4)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">164</mw>

<lb/>on every occasion. Indeed, religion is a sentiment
<lb/>which takes such strong hold on all the most power­
<lb/>ful principles of our nature, that it may easily be car­
<lb/>ried to excess. The Deity never meant our regards
<lb/>to him should engross the mind: that indifference to
<lb/>sensible objects, which many moralists preach, is not
<lb/>perhaps desirable, except where the mind is raised
<lb/>above its natural tone, and extraordinary situations
<lb/>call forth extraordinary virtues.</p>
          <p>If the peculiar advantages of a sect were well un­
<lb/>derstood, its followers would not be impatient of those
<lb/>moderate restraints which do not rise to persecution,
<lb/>nor affect any of their more material interests: for,
<lb/>do they not bind them closer to each other, cherish
<lb/>zeal, and keep up the love of liberty? What is the
<lb/>language of such restraints? Do they not say, with
<lb/>a prevailing voice, Let the timorous and the worldly
<lb/>depart; no one shall be of this persuasion, who is not
<lb/>sincere, disinterested, conscientious. It is notwith­
<lb/>standing proper, that men should be sensible of all
<lb/>their rights, assert them boldly, and protest against
<lb/>every infringement; for it may be of advantage to
<lb/>bear, what yet it is unjustifiable in others to inflict.</p>
          <p>Neither would dissenters, if they attended to their
<lb/>real interests, be so ambitious as they generally are,
<lb/>of rich converts. Such converts only accelerate their
<lb/>decline; they relax their discipline, and they acquire
<lb/>an influence very pernicious in societies which ought
<lb/>to breathe nothing but the spirit of equality.</p>
          <p>Sects are always strict in proportion to the corrup­
<lb/>tion of establishments and the licentiousness of the
<lb/>times, and they are useful in the same proportion.
<lb/>Thus the austere lives of the primitive <name>christians</name> coun­
<lb/>terbalanced the vices of that abandoned period; and
<lb/>thus the puritans in the reign of <persName>Charles the
Second</persName>
<lb/>seasoned with a wholesome severity, the profligacy of

<pb n="165"/>
<milestone n="14(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">165</mw>

<lb/>public manners. They were less amiable than their
<lb/>descendants of the present day; but to be amiable
<lb/>was not their object: they were of public utility; and
<lb/>their scrupulous sanctity (carried to excess, themselves
<lb/>only considered), like a powerful antiseptic, opposed
<lb/>the contagion breathed from a most dissolute court.
<lb/>In like manner, that sect, one of whose most striking
<lb/>characteristics is a beautiful simplicity of dialect, serv­
<lb/>ed to check that strain of servile flattery and Gothic
<lb/>compliment so prevalent in the same period, and to
<lb/>keep up some idea of that manly plainness with which
<lb/>one human being ought to address another.</p>
          <p>Thus have we seen that different modes of religion,
<lb/>though they bear little good-will to each other, are
<lb/>nevertheless mutually useful. Perhaps there is not
<lb/>an establishment so corrupt, as not to make the gross
<lb/>of mankind better than they would be without it.
<lb/>Perhaps there is not a sect so eccentric, but that it
<lb/>has set some one truth in the strongest light, or car­
<lb/>ried some one virtue, before neglected, to its utmost
<lb/>height, or loosened some obstinate and long-rooted
<lb/>prejudice. They answer their end; they die away;
<lb/>others spring up, and take their place. So the purer
<lb/>part of the element, continually drawn off from the
<lb/>mighty mass of waters, forms rivers, which, running
<lb/>in various directions, fertilize large countries; yet,
<lb/>always tending towards the ocean, every accession to
<lb/>their bulk or grandeur but precipitates their course,
<lb/>and hastens their re-union with the common reservoir
<lb/>from which they are separated.</p>
          <p>In the mean time, the devout heart always finds
<lb/>associates suitable to its disposition, and the particular
<lb/>cast of its virtues; while the continual flux and reflux
<lb/>of opinions prevents the active principles from stagnat­
<lb/>ing. There is an analogy between things material
<lb/>and immaterial. As, from some late experiments in

<pb n="166"/>
<milestone n="14(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">166</mw>

<lb/>philosophy, it has been found that the process of veg­
<lb/>etation restores and purifies vitiated air; so does that
<lb/>moral and political ferment which accompanies the
<lb/>growth of new sects, communicate a kind of spirit and
<lb/>elasticity necessary to the vigour and health of the
<lb/>soul, but soon lost amidst the corrupted breath of an
<lb/>indiscriminate multitude.</p>
          <p>There remains only to add, lest the preceding view
<lb/>of sects and establishments should in any degree be
<lb/>misapprehended, that it has nothing to do with the
<emph>truth</emph>
<lb/>of opinions, and relates only to the influence which
<lb/>the adventitious circumstances attending them, may
<lb/>have upon the manners and morals of their followers.
<lb/>It is therefore calculated to teach us candour, but not
<lb/>indifference. Large views of the moral polity of the
<lb/>world may serve to illustrate the providence of God in
<lb/>his different dispensations, but are not made to regulate
<lb/>our own individual conduct, which must conscientious­
<lb/>ly follow our own opinions and belief. We may see
<lb/>much good in an establishment, the doctrines of which
<lb/>we cannot give our assent to without violating our in­
<lb/>tegrity; we may respect the tendencies of a sect, the
<lb/>tenets of which we utterly disapprove. We may think
<lb/>practices useful, which we cannot adopt without hy­
<lb/>pocrisy. We may think all religions beneficial, and
<lb/>believe of one alone that it is true.</p>

<lb/>performing the offices of my religion as a trade; he is
<lb/>paid for telling the people such and such things; he
<lb/>is hired to keep up an useless piece of mummery.
<lb/>They cannot now say this, and therefore I feel my­
<lb/>self raised in my own esteem, and shall speak to them
<lb/>with a confidence and frankness which, before this, I
<lb/>never durst venture to assume. We resign without
<lb/>reluctance our gold and silver images and embroidered
<lb/>vestments, because we have never found that gold and
<pb n="169"/>
<milestone n="15(1)r" unit="sig"/><mw type="pageNum">169</mw>

<lb/>silver made the heart more pure, or the affections
<lb/>more heavenly: we can also spare our churches, for
<lb/>the heart that wishes to lift itself up to God, will never
<lb/>be at a loss for room to do it in: but we cannot spare
<lb/>our religion; because, to tell you the truth, we never
<lb/>had so much occasion for it. I understand that you
<lb/>accuse us priests of having told the people a great
<lb/>many falsehoods. I suspect this may have been the
<lb/>case; but till this day we have never been allowed to
<lb/>inquire, whether the things which we taught them were
<lb/>true or not. You required us formerly to receive
<lb/>them all without proof, and you would have us now
<lb/>reject them all without discrimination; neither of these
<lb/>modes of conduct becomes philosophers, such as you
<lb/>would be thought to be. I am going to employ my­
<lb/>self diligently along with my parishioners to sift the
<lb/>wheat from the chaff, the true from the false: if we
<lb/>are not successful, we shall be at least sincere. I do
<lb/>fear, indeed, that while I wore these vestments which
<lb/>we have brought you, and spoke in that gloomy
<lb/>building which we have given up to you, I told my
<lb/>flock a great many idle stories. I cannot but hope,
<lb/>however, that the errors we have fallen into have not
<lb/>been very material, since the village has been in gen­
<lb/>eral sober and good, the peasants are honest, docile,
<lb/>and laborious, the husbands love their wives, and the
<lb/>wives their husbands; they are fortunately not too
<lb/>rich to be compassionate, and they have constantly
<lb/>relieved the sick and fugitives of all parties, whenever
<lb/>it has lain in their way. I think therefore, what I
<lb/>have taught them cannot be so very much amiss.
<lb/>You want to extirpate priests; but will you hinder the
<lb/>ignorant from applying for instruction, the unhappy
<lb/>for comfort and hope, the unlearned from looking up
<lb/>to the learned? If you do not, you will have priests,
<lb/>by whatever name you may order them to be called;

<lb/>but it certainly is not necessary they should wear a
<lb/>particular dress, or be appointed by state-letters of
<lb/>ordination. My letters of ordination are my zeal, my
<lb/>charity, my ardent love for my dear children of the
<lb/>village; if I were more learned, I would add my
<lb/>knowledge, but alas! we all know very little; to man
<lb/>every error is pardonable, but want of humility. We
<lb/>have a public walk with a spreading elm at the end of
<lb/>it, and a circle of green around it, with a convenient
<lb/>bench. Here I shall draw together the children
<lb/>as they are playing around me. I shall point to the
<lb/>vines laden with fruit, to the orchards, to the herds of
<lb/>cattle lowing around us, to the distant hills, stretching
<lb/>one behind another; and they will ask me, How came
<lb/>all these things? I shall tell them all I know or have
<lb/>heard from wise men who have lived before me; they
<lb/>will be penetrated with love and veneration; they will
<lb/>kneel,—I shall kneel with them; they will not be at
<lb/>my feet, but all of us at the feet of that good Being,
<lb/>whom we shall worship together; and thus they will
<lb/>receive within their tender minds a religion.—The old
<lb/>men will come sometimes from having deposited under
<lb/>the green sod, one of their companions, and place
<lb/>themselves by my side; they will look wistfully at
<lb/>the turf, and anxiously inquire—Is he gone for ever?
<lb/>Shall we soon be like him? Will no morning break
<lb/>over the tomb? When the wicked cease from
<lb/>troubling, will the good cease from doing good? We
<lb/>will talk of these things: I will comfort them. I will
<lb/>tell them of the goodness of God; I will speak to
<lb/>them of a life to come; I will bid them hope for a
<lb/>state of retribution.—In a clear night, when the stars
<lb/>slide over our heads, they will ask what these bright
<lb/>bodies are, and by what rules they rise and set? and
<lb/>we will converse about different forms of beings, and
<lb/>distant worlds in the immensity of space, governed by
<pb n="171"/>
<milestone n="15(2)r" unit="sig"/><mw type="pageNum">171</mw>

<lb/>the same laws, till we find our minds raised from what
<lb/>is grovelling, and refined from what is sordid.—You
<lb/>talk of Nature,—this is Nature; and if you could at
<lb/>this moment extinguish religion in the minds of the world,
<lb/>it would thus be kindled again, and thus again excite
<lb/>the curiosity, and interest the feelings of mankind.
<lb/>You have changed our holidays; you have an un­
<lb/>doubted right, as our civil governors, so to do; it is
<lb/>very immaterial whether they are kept once in seven
<lb/>days, or once in ten; some, however, you <choice><sic>.</sic><corr/></choice>will
leave
<lb/>us, and when they occur, I shall tell those who choose
<lb/>to hear me, of the beauty and utility of virtue, of the
<lb/>dignity of right conduct. We shall talk of good men
<lb/>who have lived in the world, and of the doctrines they
<lb/>taught; and if any of them have been persecuted,
<lb/>and put to death for their virtue, we shall reverence
<lb/>their memories the more.—I hope in all this there is
<lb/>no harm. There is a book, out of which I have some­
<lb/>times taught my people; it says, we are to love those
<lb/>who do us hurt, and to pour oil and wine into the
<lb/>wounds of the stranger. It has enabled my children
<lb/>to bear patiently the spoiling of their goods, and to
<lb/>give up their own interest for the general welfare. I
<lb/>think it cannot be a very bad book. I wish more of
<lb/>it had been read in your town, perhaps you would not
<lb/>have had quite so many assassinations and massacres.
<lb/>In this book we hear of a person called
<persName>Jesus</persName>: some
<lb/>worship him as a God; others, as I am told, say it is
<lb/>wrong to do so;—some teach, that he existed from
<lb/>the beginning of ages; others, that he was born of
<lb/><persName>Joseph</persName> and <persName>Mary</persName>. I
cannot tell whether these con­
<lb/>troversies will ever be decided; but in the mean time
<lb/>I think we cannot do otherwise than well, in imitating
<lb/>him; for I learn that he loved the poor, and went
<lb/>about doing good.</said></p>

<lb/>to miserable poverty; fathers lamenting their children
<lb/>in the bloom and pride of youth: and I said to my­

<lb/>religion. But indeed you cannot take it away; if,
<lb/>contrary to your first declaration, you choose to try
<lb/>the experiment of persecuting it, you will only make
<lb/>us prize it more, and love it better. Religion, true
<lb/>or false, is so necessary to the mind of man, that even
<lb/>you have begun to make yourselves a new one. You
<lb/>are sowing the seeds of superstition; and in two or
<lb/>three generations your posterity will be worshipping
<lb/>some clumsy idol, with the rights, perhaps, of a bloody

the high esteem
<lb/>I bear yourself, as from the tender and solicitous
<lb/>affection I feel for your lovely daughter, to inform you
<lb/>of an affair between her and one who has lately been
<lb/>fluttering about her; and for whom, young as she is,
<lb/>she seems to have conceived an extraordinary in­
<lb/>clination. Of this you will be convinced, madam,
<lb/>when I assure you she often walks in the fields pur­
<lb/>posely to meet him; and that on her return I have
<lb/>seen her lips and cheeks improved in their colour by
<lb/>his kisses. It is but within these few weeks that this
<lb/>lover of hers has frequented the environs of
<placeName>Hampstead</placeName>,
<lb/>for he spent the winter between <placeName>Lisbon</placeName> and
the <placeName>Canary
<lb/>Islands</placeName>; and since his return, which by her has been
<lb/>passionately longed for, her fondness for walking has
<lb/>been much more apparent. Her excursions to the
<lb/><placeName>Heath</placeName>, and her parties to
<placeName>West-end</placeName>, particularly when
<lb/>she gave me the slip the other day, have been all
<lb/>planned with the hope of meeting him. Nor can I
<lb/>wonder, indeed, that she admires so pretty a fellow;
<lb/>for he is a light airy being like herself, as playful and
<lb/>as frolicksome. He dresses in a light garment of the
<lb/>thinnest blue silk, fluttering in a thousand different
<lb/>folds, and by way of epaulette two silver wings peep­
<lb/>ing above his shoulders. His breath is made up of
<lb/>sighs, and perfumed with violets; and his whispers,

<lb/>especially at this season of the year, have a certain
<lb/>prevailing languishment and softness in them, that few
<lb/>can resist. He is fond of caressing the opening roses;
<lb/>and no birthnight beau is more powerfully scented
<lb/>with <name>Mareschal</name> powder than he is with every blossom
<lb/>of the spring. But then he is a general lover, incon­
<lb/>stant as he is gay; noted for levity, here today and
<lb/>gone tomorrow, hovering about every beautiful object
<lb/>without attaching himself to one. To fix him, would
<lb/>be as difficult as to arrest a sunbeam or to hold a wave
<lb/>between your fingers. Yet I am sorry to say, madam,
<lb/>your daughter absolutely courts this <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">volage</foreign>, and allows
<lb/>him liberties which a prudent mother like yourself
<lb/>must tremble at. He delights to play with her fair
<lb/>hair; sometimes he throws it over her forehead, and
<lb/>almost covers her face with it. Sometimes he takes
<lb/>a single lock, and plays it about her temples; now he
<lb/>spreads her tresses all over her graceful shoulders;
<lb/>and then lifts them up, or gently parts them, to dis­
<lb/>cover the elegant turn and whiteness of her neck, giv­
<lb/>ing them all the while a thousand kisses. Why need
<lb/>I mention what passes before your eyes, under your
<lb/>own window? It is there that I have seen him busied
<lb/>in wafting her to and fro with an easy motion, when
<lb/>her light form dances through the air in the swing
<lb/>you have lately put up, while he catches her fluttering
<lb/>garment and throws it into every varying fold his
<lb/>fancy dictates. It may be, however, that you may
<lb/>not think these sportive liberties of great consequence
<lb/>to one so young as your daughter is: but I am not
<lb/>without apprehensions that he may some day or other
<lb/>absolutely run away with her. I the rather fear this,
<lb/>as a brother of his, a rough, blustering fellow, did once
<lb/>carry off a young lady whose parents had rejected
<lb/>his addresses, as is well known to all who are acquaint­
<lb/>ed with the anecdotes of the family. It is true, he

<lb/>that I speak of, has neither the strength nor the im­
<lb/>petuosity of his brother; but when I consider the
<lb/>peculiar lightness and airiness of the nymph in question,
<lb/>the enterprise appears to me very practicable.</p>
          <p>I have only to add, that his amour with <persName>Flora</persName><anchor xml:id="na2" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n2"/> is
<lb/>of long standing; and so little is it a secret in the
<lb/>world, that every schoolboy is acquainted with it. I
<lb/>doubt not, madam, but you will take the measures
<lb/>your prudence must suggest on this occasion. All
<lb/>my motive in this affair has been to prove with how

<lb/>ruin on his own head, and that of all his posterity?
<lb/>Was there no warning voice, no sheltering hand, to

          <p>What fair, what amiable creatures were our first
<lb/>parents when they came from the hands of their

<lb/>of Pain; nor Shame, the daughter of Sin. Innocent,

<lb/>that they had not even the knowledge of it. Their
<lb/>passions, nicely balanced, admitted no internal war.
<lb/>A milky innocence in their veins, their eyes beaming
<lb/>with smiles,—the smiles of candour and simplicity,—
<lb/>they were the head of the happy creation, till one
<lb/>fatal moment ruined all:—the <placeName>garden of paradise</placeName> is
<lb/>shut for ever; and man (unhappy outcast!)—expos­
<lb/>ed to the war elements without and passions within;
<lb/>his peace broken, his heart torn by the conflict of
<lb/>jarring emotions; his life worn away by perplexing

<lb/>doubts and heart-withering care,—moistens his daily
<lb/>bread with tears: and after struggling a few years in
<lb/>the hard, unequal warfare, he returns to the dust from
<lb/>whence he was taken.</p>
          <p>Such is the dark side of the picture.—But let us
<lb/>change the view, and see whether in reality the human
<lb/>race have such great reason to lament the fall of their
<lb/>first progenitor. Whether <emph>virtuous</emph> man now, is not a
<lb/>nobler creature than <emph>sinless</emph> man then?—the
pupil of
<lb/>reason, than the child of nature?—the follower of the
<lb/>second, than the offspring of the first <persName>Adam</persName>?
Man in
<lb/>his first state had a mind untainted with crimes; but
<lb/>unformed, uncultivated, void of moral ideas, he could
<lb/>not rise, but by his fall; he could not attain to more
<lb/>perfection, but by moral discipline; he could not know
<lb/>the joys of self-approbation, without being subject to
<lb/>remorse,—of sympathy, without feeling distress. Had
<lb/>he been always innocent, he had been nothing more
<lb/>than innocent;—had he never known his weakness,
<lb/>he had never acquired strength. Behold him now,
<lb/>fashioned by the hand of culture, and shining through
<lb/>the dark cloud of ruin, guilt and pain, that is spread
<lb/>over him. What a different creature from the former
<lb/>man! He now knows vice, but abhors it; temp­
<lb/>tation, but resists it; error, but he laments it. His
<lb/>passions were once balanced, they are now subdued;
<lb/>he has tasted good and evil, and he knows to choose
<lb/>the one and refuse the other. Intellectual ideas
<lb/>crowd upon him, and a new world opens within his
<lb/>breast. His nature is raised, refined, exalted: he
<lb/>lives by faith, by devotion, by spiritual communion,
<lb/>by repentance—he, weeping beneath the bitter cross,
<lb/>washes off the stain of sin. The world is beneath
<lb/>his feet; for behold he prayeth, and things unseen
<lb/>become present to his soul. Meek resignation blunts
<lb/>the edge of suffering; and triumphant hope looks be­

<pb n="178"/>
<milestone n="15(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">178</mw>

<lb/>yond all suffering, to glory and to joy. Thus advanc­
<lb/>ing through life, he learns some new lesson at every
<lb/>step,—till by receiving, but still more by conferring,
<lb/>benefits; by bearing, and still further by forgiving,
<lb/>injuries,—his mind is disciplined, his moral sense
<lb/>awakened, his taste for beauty, order and rectitude,
<lb/>unfolded. He becomes endeared to those he has
<lb/>wept and prayed and struggled with through this vale
<lb/>of sin and suffering; he learns to pity and to love his
<lb/>fellow-partners of mortality; till at length the divine
<lb/>flame of universal charity begins to kindle in his
<lb/>breast. Then is the æra of a new birth; then does
<lb/>he become partaker of a divine nature: sense is
<lb/>mortified, passion is subdued, self is annihilated. And
<lb/>is not this a noble creature? a being worth forming
<lb/>by so expensive and painful a process? a being God
<lb/>may delight in? a faithful, well-disciplined soldier, fit
<lb/>to cooperate in any plan, or mingle with any order of
<lb/>rational and moral beings throughout the wide creation?
<lb/>Place him where you will, he has learned to follow,
<lb/>to trust in, the Supreme Being; he has learned
<lb/>humility from his errors, steadiness and watchfulness
<lb/>from his weakness; his virtues depend not now on
<lb/>constitution, but on firm principles and established
<lb/>habits. Is this the feeble being whose infant mind
<lb/>was unable to resist the allurements of forbidden fruit?
<lb/>who so easily listened to the seduction of the tempter?
<lb/>See him now resisting unto blood, superior to principal­
<lb/>ities and powers, to wicked men and bad angels:—
<lb/>neither terrors nor pleasures can move him. He once
<lb/>believed not the living voice of his Maker; having not
<lb/>seen, he now believes. His gratitude once was faint
<lb/>and languid, though he was surrounded with pleasant
<lb/>things: he now loves God, though overwhelmed with
<lb/>sorrow and pain; trusts in him, though surrounded
<lb/>with difficulties; hopes even against hope, and prays

<lb/>without ceasing. His hopes now are superior to his
<lb/>joys then. Glorious exchange! from reposing on
<lb/>flowers, to tread upon stars,—from naked purity, to
a
<lb/>robe of glory,—from the food which cometh out of the
<lb/>earth, to the bread which cometh down from heaven.
<lb/>For ignorance of ill, he hath knowledge of good; for
<lb/>smiles of innocence, tears of rapture; for the bowers
<lb/>of paradise, the gates of heaven. Hadst thou,

<lb/>never fallen, shepherds and husbandmen only would

your exact age is not so material;—but
<lb/>there is one point which I confess I wish much to as­

<lb/>you are at this moment, more candid, more liberal, a
<lb/>better manager of your affairs, and, in short, more amia­
<lb/>ble in every respect, than ever you were in the whole
<lb/>course of your life; and others,—you will excuse me,
<lb/>madam,—pretend that you are almost in your dotage;
<lb/>that you grow more intolerable every year you live;
<lb/>and that whereas in your childhood you were a
<lb/>sprightly, innocent young creature, that rose with the
<lb/>lark, lay down with the lamb, and thought or said no
<lb/>harm of any one; you are become suspicious, selfish,
<lb/>interested, fond of nothing but indulging your appe­

          <p><label type="speaker" rend="slant(italic)"><persName>C.</persName></label> I have a very confused remembrance of living
<lb/>in a pleasant garden full of fruit, and of being turned

<lb/>naughty, that I got a severe ducking, and was in great
<lb/>danger of being drowned.</p>
          <p><label type="speaker" rend="slant(italic)">E.</label> A hopeful beginning, I must allow! Pray what
<lb/>was the first piece of work you recollect being engag­
<lb/>ed in?</p>
          <p><label type="speaker" rend="slant(italic)"><persName>C.</persName></label> I remember setting myself to build a prodigious
<lb/>high house of cards, which I childishly thought I could
<lb/>raise up to the very skies. I piled them up very high,
<lb/>and at last left off in the middle, and had my tongue
<lb/>slit for being so self-conceited. Afterwards I baked
<lb/>dirt in the sun, and resolved to make something very
<lb/>magnificent, I hardly knew what; so I built a great
<lb/>many mounds in the form of sugar-loaves, very broad
<lb/>at bottom and pointed at top:—they took me a great
<lb/>many years to make, and were fit for no earthly pur­
<lb/>pose when they were done. They are still to be seen,
<lb/>if you choose to take the trouble of going so far.
<lb/>Travellers call them my <emph>folly</emph>.</p>

<lb/>first began to learn?</p>
          <p><label type="speaker" rend="slant(italic)"><persName>C.</persName></label> At first I amused myself, as all children do, with
<lb/>pictures; and drew, or rather attempted to draw,
<lb/>figures of lions and serpents, and men with the heads
<lb/>of animals, and women with fishes' tails; to all which
<lb/>I affixed a meaning, often whimsical enough. Many
<lb/>of these my first scratches are still to be seen upon
<lb/>old walls and stones, and have greatly exercised the
<lb/>ingenuity of the curious to find out what I could possi­
<lb/>bly mean by them. Afterwards, when I had learned
<lb/>to read, I was wonderfully entertained with stories of
<lb/>giants, griffins, and mermaids; and men and women
<lb/>turned into trees, and horses that spoke, and of an old
<lb/>man that used to eat up his children, till his wife de­
<lb/>ceived him by giving him a stone to eat instead of
<lb/>one of them; and of a conjurer that tied up the wind

          <p><label type="speaker" rend="slant(italic)"><persName>C.</persName></label> On the contrary, I amused myself with putting

<lb/>or in dark corners about the house, in every possible
<lb/>way; so that, in short, on pretense of colds, tender
<lb/>noses, or want of pocket-handkerchiefs, or one plea
<lb/>or another, I have been obliged to tolerate the uncom­

          <p>My wife, sir, has been much admired in her time,

<lb/>though, Heaven knows! I never measured them 
to­
<lb/>gether: and that not only there never was a more

<lb/>that it was utterly impossible for the imagination of
<lb/>man to conceive a more beautiful. I confess I was a
<lb/>good deal ashamed to make such boasts; nevertheless,
<lb/>I complied, for the sake of peace. My wife, moreover,
<lb/>entertains an idea, that every man who sees her is
<lb/>in love with her: and, like <persName rend="slant(italic)">Belise</persName>  in the <title rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">Femmes

<lb/>though the best compliments she has met with of late

<lb/>well for a woman of her years; that she wears well,
<lb/>considering; that she has fine remains, and that one
<lb/>may easily see she has been a handsome woman in her
<lb/>time.</said> These are speeches, one would think, not
<lb/>very apt to feed her vanity; yet, whenever she hears
<lb/>of a match that is likely to take place, she cannot help
<lb/>fancying the lover was attracted by some remote
<lb/>resemblance to her admired person. <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">Yes,</said> she will

was a tint of my com­

<lb/>self, my poor wife, especially of late, has been distract­
<lb/>edly jealous of me. She is continually teasing me
<lb/>with embarrassing questions; as, <said rend="pre()post(”)">whether I love her

<lb/>as well as I did on my wedding-day; whether I will
<lb/>promise to love her if she should be blind, or de­
<lb/>crepid, or out of her wits,</said> &amp;c.—A circumstance has
<lb/>occurred lately, which has increased this jealousy
<lb/>tenfold. My next-door neighbour, you must know,
<lb/>is married again; and ever since that event she
<lb/>watches me as a cat watches a mouse. I cannot
<lb/>look out of the window, or enquire which way the
<lb/>wind sets, but it is in order to admire my neighbour's
<lb/>new wife. She pretends to have found love-letters
<lb/>which have passed between us; and is sure, she
<lb/>says, I design to part with her, <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">false hearted man as
<lb/>I am;</said> upon which, the other day, she threw herself
<lb/>into violent hysterics, and alarmed the whole family
<lb/>and neighbourhood.</p>
          <p>To be sure, the bride did send me a favour, which
<lb/>I wore in my hat, openly; and I do not deny but I
<lb/>may have paid her a few compliments, and written
<lb/>some verses upon her, for she is a showy, fine-spoken
<lb/>woman; but for all that, I would not marry her if I
<lb/>were free tomorrow; for, to tell you the truth, I
<lb/>suspect her to be too much of a termagant for me;
<lb/>and besides, <persName>John Bull</persName> is not given to
change.</p>
          <p>My wife has another failing, sir. She is fond of
<lb/>every thing that is old, because it <emph>is</emph> old; and she
<lb/>never will give any reason, except a woman's reason,
<lb/>which, you know, is no reason at all, for any one
<lb/>thing she does. If I presume to hint things might be
<lb/>better after a different fashion, I can get no other an­
<lb/>swer than <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">that <emph>it is her 
way</emph>—that her grandmother
<lb/>and great-grandmother did so before her; and that it
<lb/>is her maxim never to alter the family management.</said>
<lb/>I can scarcely stir about my house, it is so filled with
<lb/>heavy lumbering furniture, half of which is worm-eaten,
<lb/>and of no use but to harbour vermin; but my wife
<lb/>cannot persuade herself to part with any of it, she has

<lb/>ting and painted rout-chairs! I wish you would let it
<lb/>come down, it is fit for nothing but for the rats to play
<lb/>at hide-and-seek behind it.</said>—<said rend="pre(“)post(”)">I would not have it
<lb/>down my dear,</said> says she, <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">for the world; it is the
<lb/>story of the <name>Spanish Armada</name>, and was done in the
<lb/>glorious days of <persName>Queen Bess</persName>.</said> <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">Then give it a
<lb/>thorough cleaning, at least,</said> returned I.—<said rend="pre(“)post(”)">If you
<lb/>offer to draw a nail,</said> rejoined she, <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">there are so
<lb/>many private doors and secret passages made in the
<lb/>wall, you will be blinded with dust and mortar; and,
<lb/>for aught I know, pull an old house over your head.</said>
<lb/><said rend="pre(“)post(”)">Let me, at least, give a
brushing to the beards of the
<lb/>old Dons,</said> replied I.—<said rend="pre(“)post(”)">A stroke of the brush would
<lb/>shake them to pieces,</said> insisted my wife; <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">they are
<lb/>as tender as a cobweb, I tell you, and I positively will

when a thing
<lb/>was made; the question is, what is it good for? and
<lb/>know nothing so much useless lumber is good for,
<lb/>but to oblige us to keep a great many supernumerary
<lb/>servants, at high wages, to look after it.</p>
          <p>I have still another grievance, sir. If you are a
<lb/>married man, you may chance to know, that it is often
<lb/>as much as a man can do to manage his wife; but to
<lb/>manage one's wife and mother too, is a task too hard
<lb/>for any mortal. Now, my mother, sir, lives with us<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">,</unclear>

<lb/>and I am sure I have always behaved myself as a
<lb/>dutiful and obedient son; her arm-chair is always set
<lb/>in the best place by the fire; she eats of the best, and
<lb/>drinks of the best; neither do I grudge it her, though
<lb/>the poor children's bellies are often pinched, while she
<lb/>is feasting upon nice bits. But with all this, I have
<lb/>much ado to keep her in good humour. If I stir
<lb/>about a little more briskly than ordinary, my mother
<lb/>has weak nerves, and the noise I make over her head
<lb/>will throw her into fits. If I offer but to dust the books
<lb/>in my study, my mother is afraid some of them should
<lb/>fall upon her head:—indeed, the old lady did get an
<lb/>unlucky blow with one or two of them, which has
<lb/>shaken her not a little. Besides which, she insists,
<lb/>and my wife stands by her in it, that I should consult
<lb/>her in all matters of business; and if I do not, I am
<lb/>cried out against as a graceless, atheistical wretch; and
<lb/>a thousand idle reports are raised, that I am going to
<lb/>strip and turn my poor old mother out of doors.
<lb/>Then, my mother is rather particular in her dress;
<lb/>and the children sometimes will be tittering and mak­
<lb/>ing game, when she is displaying some of her old
<lb/>fallals; upon which my wife always insists I should
<lb/>whip them, which I used to do pretty severely, though
<lb/>of late, I confess, I have only hung the rod up over
<lb/>the chimney, <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="slant(italic)">in terrorem</foreign>;—on 
such occasions my
<lb/>wife never fails to observe, <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">how becoming it is in
<lb/>one of my mother's age to keep the same fashion in
<lb/>her dress.</said> This, by the way, is not true, for I
<lb/>remember my mother stuck all over with crosses and
<lb/>embroidery, to her very shoes, with strings of beads
<lb/>and such trumpery; yet she says, as well as my wife,
<lb/>that she never changes any thing.</p>
          <p>I am, myself, Mr. Editor, an easy, peaceable, plain-
<lb/>spoken man as any that exists; and am a man of little
<lb/>or no expense for my own gratification: yet so it is,

<lb/>that what with the large establishment of servants
<lb/>which we are obliged to keep, and the continual drains
<lb/>upon my purse to supply my extravagant neighbours,
<lb/>I run out every year, and cannot help having many
<lb/>serious thoughts and melancholy forebodings where all
<lb/>this may end. But I apprehend, the first step ought
<lb/>to be for my wife and I to consult together, and make
<lb/>a reform in the family management wherever there
<lb/>may be occasion. If therefore, you can persuade her
<lb/>to lay aside her groundless jealousies, and talk a little
<lb/>reason, I shall be highly obliged to you, and am your

          <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">I am</hi> a country gentleman, and enjoy 
an estate in
<lb/><placeName>Northamptonshire</placeName>, which formerly enabled
its posses­
<lb/>sors to assume some degree of consequence in the
<lb/>country; but which, for several generations, has been
<lb/>growing less, only because it has not grown bigger.
<lb/>I mean, that though I have not yet been obliged to
<lb/>mortgage my land, or fell my timber, its relative value
<lb/>is every day diminishing by the prodigious influx of
<lb/>wealth, real and artificial, which for some time past
<lb/>has been pouring into this kingdom. Hitherto, how­
<lb/>ever, I have found my income equal to my wants. It
<lb/>has enabled me to inhabit a good house in town for
<lb/>four months of the year, and to reside amongst my ten­
<lb/>ants and neighbours for the remaining eight with credit
<lb/>and hospitality. I am indeed myself so fond of the
<lb/>country, and so averse in my nature to every thing of
<lb/>hurry and bustle, that, if I consulted only my own
<lb/>taste, I should never feel a wish to leave the shelter
<lb/>of my own oaks in the dreariest season of the year;
<lb/>but I looked upon our annual visit to
<placeName>London</placeName> as a
<lb/>proper compliance with the gayer disposition of my
<lb/>wife, and the natural curiosity of the younger part of
<lb/>the family: besides, to say the truth, it had its advan­
<lb/>tages in avoiding a round of dinners and card-parties,
<lb/>which we must otherwise have engaged in for the win­
<lb/>ter season, or have been branded with the appellation
<lb/>of unsociable. Our journey gave me an opportunity
<lb/>of furnishing my study with some new books and prints;

<pb n="196"/>
<milestone n="17(2)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">196</mw>

<lb/>and my wife of gratifying her neighbours with some
<lb/>ornamental trifles, before their value was sunk by be­
<lb/>coming common, or of producing at her table or in
<lb/>her furniture some new-invented refinement of fashion­
<lb/>able elegance. Our hall was the first that was lighted
<lb/>by an <name>Argand</name> lamp; and I still remember how we
<lb/>were gratified by the astonishment of our guests, when
<lb/>my wife, with an audible voice, called to the footman
<lb/>for the tongs to help to the asparagus with. We found
<lb/>it pleasant too to be enabled to talk of capital artists
<lb/>and favourite actors; and I made the better figure in
<lb/>my political debates from having heard the most pop­
<lb/>ular speakers in the House.</p>
          <p>Once too, to recruit my wife's spirits after a tedious
<lb/>confinement from a lying-in, we passed a season at
<lb/><placeName>Bath</placeName>. In this manner, therefore, things
went on very
<lb/>well in the main, till of late my family have discovered
<lb/>that we lead a very dull kind of life; and that it is
<lb/>impossible to exist with comfort, or indeed to enjoy a
<lb/>tolerable share of health, without spending good part of
<lb/>every summer at a Watering-place. I held out as
<lb/>long as I could. One may be allowed to resist the
<lb/>plans of dissipation, but the plea of health cannot
<lb/>decently be withstood.</p>
          <p>It was soon discovered that my eldest daughter
<lb/>wanted bracing, and my wife had a bilious complaint,
<lb/>against which our family physician declared that sea­
<lb/>bathing would be particularly serviceable. Therefore,
<lb/>though it was my own private opinion that my daugh­
<lb/>ter's nerves might have been as well braced by morn­
<lb/>ing rides upon the <placeName>Northamptonshire</placeName> hills
as by even­
<lb/>ing dances in the public rooms, and that my wife's
<lb/>bile would have been greatly lessened by compliance
<lb/>with her husband, I acquiesced; and preparations were
<lb/>made for our journey. These indeed were but slight,
<lb/>for the chief gratification proposed in this scheme was,

<pb n="197"/>
<milestone n="17(3)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">197</mw>

<lb/>an entire freedom from care and form. We should
<lb/>find every thing requisite in our lodgings; it was of no
<lb/>consequence whether the rooms we should occupy
<lb/>for a few months in the summer were elegant or not;
<lb/>the simplicity of a country life would be the more
<lb/>enjoyed by the little shifts we should be put to; and
<lb/>all necessaries would be provided in our lodgings. It
<lb/>was not therefore till after we had taken them, that
<lb/>we discovered how far ready-furnished lodgings were
<lb/>from affording every article in the catalogue of neces­
<lb/>saries. We did not indeed give them a very scrupu­
<lb/>lous examination; for the place was so full, that when
<lb/>we arrived, late at night, and tired with our journey,
<lb/>all the beds at the inn were taken up, and an easy­
<lb/>chair and a carpet were all the accommodations we
<lb/>could obtain for our repose. The next morning, there­
<lb/>fore, we eagerly engaged the first lodgings we found
<lb/>vacant, and have ever since been disputing about the
<lb/>terms, which from the hurry were not sufficiently as­
<lb/>certained; and it is not even yet settled whether the
<lb/>little blue garret, which serves us as a powdering room,
<lb/>is ours of right or by favour. The want of all sorts
<lb/>of conveniences is a constant excuse for the want of
<lb/>all order and neatness, which is so visible in our apart­
<lb/>ment; and we are continually lamenting that we are
<lb/>obliged to buy things of which we have such plenty
<lb/>at home.</p>
          <p>It is my misfortune that I can do nothing without
<lb/>all my little conveniences about me; and in order to
<lb/>write a common letter I must have my study-table to
<lb/>lean my elbows on in sedentary luxury; you will
<lb/>judge therefore how little I am able to employ my
<lb/>leisure, when I tell you, that the only room they have
<lb/>been able to allot for my use is so filled and crowded
<lb/>with my daughters' hat boxes, bandboxes, wig-boxes,
<lb/>&amp;c., that I can scarcely move about in it, and am at

<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">17*</mw>

<mw type="pageNum">198</mw>

<lb/>this moment writing upon a spare trunk for want of a
<lb/>table. I am therefore driven to saunter about with
<lb/>the rest of the party: but instead of the fine clumps
<lb/>of trees and waving fields of corn I have been accus­
<lb/>tomed to have before my eyes, I see nothing but a
<lb/>naked beach, almost without a tree, exposed by turns
<lb/>to the cutting eastern blast and the glare of a July sun,
<lb/>and covered with a sand equally painful to the eyes
<lb/>and to the feet. The ocean is indeed an object of
<lb/>unspeakable grandeur; but when it has been contem­
<lb/>plated in a storm and in a calm, when we have seen
<lb/>the sun rise out of its bosom and the moon silver its
<lb/>extended surface, its variety is exhausted, and the
<lb/>eye begins to require the softer and more interesting
<lb/>scenes of cultivated nature. My family have indeed
<lb/>been persuaded several times to enjoy the sea still
<lb/>more, by engaging in a little sailing-party; but as,
<lb/>unfortunately, <placeName>Northamptonshire</placeName> has not
afforded them
<lb/>any opportunity of becoming seasoned sailors, these
<lb/>parties of pleasure are always attended with the most
<lb/>dreadful sickness. This likewise I am told is very
<lb/>good for the constitution: it may be so for aught I
<lb/>know; but I confess I am apt to imagine that taking
<lb/>an emetic at home would be equally salutary, and I
<lb/>am sure it would be more decent. Nor can I help
<lb/>imagining that my youngest daughter's lover has been
<lb/>less assiduous since he has contemplated her in the
<lb/>indelicate situation of a ship-cabin. I have endeav­
<lb/>oured to amuse myself with the company, but without
<lb/>much success; it consists of a very few great people,
<lb/>who make a set by themselves, and think they are
<lb/>entitled, by the freedom of a watering-place, to in­
<lb/>dulge themselves in all manner of
<foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">polissonneries</foreign>; and
<lb/>the rest is a motley group of sharpers, merchants'
<lb/>clerks, kept-mistresses, idle men, and nervous women.
<lb/>I have been accustomed to be nice in my choice of

<pb n="199"/>
<milestone n="17(4)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">199</mw>

<lb/>acquaintance, especially for my family; but the great­
<lb/>er part of our connexions here are such as we should
<lb/>be ashamed to acknowledge anywhere else; and the
<lb/>few we have seen above ourselves will equally disclaim
<lb/>us when we meet in town next winter. As to the
<lb/>settled inhabitants of the place, all who do not get by
<lb/>us view us with dislike, because we raise the price of
<lb/>provisions; and those who do,—which, in one way or
<lb/>other, comprehends all the lower class,—have lost
<lb/>every trace of rural simplicity, and are versed in all
<lb/>arts of low cunning and chicane. The spirit of
<lb/>greediness and rapacity is nowhere so conspicuous as
<lb/>in lodging-houses. At our seat in the country, our
<lb/>domestic concerns went on as by clock-work; a
<lb/>quarter of an hour in a week settled the bills, and few
<lb/>tradesmen wished, and none dared, to practise any
<lb/>imposition where all were known, and the consequence
<lb/>of their different behaviour must have been their being
<lb/>marked, for life, for encouragement or for distrust.
<lb/>But here the continual fluctuation of company takes
<lb/>away all regard to character, the most respectable
<lb/>and ancient families have no influence any further than
<lb/>as they scatter their ready cash; and neither gratitude
<lb/>nor respect are felt where there is no bond of mutual
<lb/>attachment besides the necessities of the present day.
<lb/>I should be happy if we had only to contend with this
<lb/>spirit during our present excursion, but the effect it
<lb/>has upon servants is most pernicious. Our family
<lb/>used to be remarkable for having its domestics grow
<lb/>grey in its service, but this expedition has already cor­
<lb/>rupted them; two we have this evening parted with,
<lb/>and the rest have learned so much of the tricks of their
<lb/>station, that we shall be obliged to discharge them as
<lb/>soon as we return home. In the country I had been
<lb/>accustomed to do good to the poor: there are char­
<lb/>ities here too;—we have joined in a subscription for

<pb n="200"/>
<milestone n="17(4)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">200</mw>

<lb/>a crazy poetess, a raffle for the support of a sharper,
<lb/>who passes under the title of a German count, and a
<lb/>benefit-play for a <emph>gentleman</emph> on board the hulks.
<lb/>Unfortunately, to balance these various expenses, this
<lb/>place, which happens to be a great resort of smugglers,
<lb/>affords daily opportunities of making <emph>bargains</emph>. We
<lb/>drink spoiled teas, under the idea of their being cheap;
<lb/>and the little room we have is made less by the re­
<lb/>ception of cargoes of <placeName>India</placeName> taffetas,
shawl-muslins, and
<lb/>real chintzes. All my authority here would be exert­
<lb/>ed in vain; for (I do not know whether you know it
<lb/>or no) the buying of a bargain is a temptation which
<lb/>it is not in the nature of any woman to resist. I am
<lb/>in hopes, however, the business may receive some little
<lb/>check from an incident which happened a little time
<lb/>since; an acquaintance of ours, returning from <placeName>Mar­
<lb/>gate</placeName>, had his carriage seized by the Custom-house
<lb/>officers, on account of a piece of silk which one of his
<lb/>female cousins, without his knowledge, had stowed in
<lb/>it; and it was only released by its being proved that
<lb/>what she had bought with so much satisfaction as con­
<lb/>traband, was in reality the home-bred manufacture of
<lb/><placeName>Spitalfields</placeName>.</p>
          <p>My family used to to be remarkable for regularity in
<lb/>their attendance on public worship; but that too here
<lb/>is numbered amongst the amusements of the place.
<lb/><persName>Lady <placeName>Huntingdon</placeName></persName> has a chapel, which sometimes 
at­
<lb/>tracts us; and when nothing promises us any particular
<lb/>entertainment, a tea-drinking at the Rooms, or a con­
<lb/>cert of what is called sacred music, is sufficient to
<lb/>draw us from a church where no one will remark either
<lb/>our absence or our presence. Thus we daily become
<lb/>more lax in our conduct, for want of the salutary
<lb/>restraint imposed upon us by the consciousness of
<lb/>being looked up to as an example by others.</p>
          <p>In this manner, sir, has the season passed away.

<lb/>I spend a great deal of money, and make no figure;
<lb/>I am in the country, and see nothing of country
<lb/>simplicity or country occupations; I am in an obscure
<lb/>village, and yet cannot stir out without more observers
<lb/>than if I were walking in <placeName>St. James's Park</placeName>;
I am
<lb/>cooped up in less room than my own dog-kennel,
<lb/>while my spacious halls are injured by standing empty;
<lb/>and I am paying for tasteless unripe fruit, while my
<lb/>own choice wall-fruit is rotting by bushels under the
<lb/>trees.—In recompense for all this, we have the sat­
<lb/>isfaction of knowing that we occupy the very rooms
<lb/>which my Lord ―― had just quitted; of picking up
<lb/>anecdotes, true or false, of people in high life; and of
<lb/>seizing the ridicule of every character as they pass
<lb/>by us in the moving show-glass of the place,—a pas­
<lb/>time which often affords us a good deal of mirth, but
<lb/>which, I confess, I can never join in without reflecting
<lb/>that what is our amusement is theirs likewise. As to
<lb/>the great ostensible object of our excursion,— health;
<lb/>I am afraid we cannot boast of much improvement.
<lb/>We have had a wet and cold summer; and these
<lb/>houses, which are either old tenements vamped up,
<lb/>or new ones slightly run up for the accommodation
<lb/>of bathers during the season, have more contrivances
<lb/>for letting in the cooling breezes than for keeping them
<lb/>out, a circumstance which I should presume sagacious 
<lb/>physicians do not always attend to, when they order
<lb/>patients from their own warm, compact, substantial
<lb/>houses, to take the air in country lodgings; of which
<lb/>the best apartments, during the winter, have only been
<lb/>inhabited by the rats, and where the poverty of the
<lb/>landlord prevents him from laying out more in repairs
<lb/>than will serve to give them a showy and attractive
<lb/>appearance. Be that as it may; the rooms we at
<lb/>present inhabit are so pervious to the breeze, that in
<lb/>spite of all the ingenious expedients of listing doors,

<pb n="202"/>

<lb/>pasting papers on the inside of cup-boards, laying sand-
<lb/>bags, puttying crevices, and condemning closet-doors;
<lb/>it has given me a severe touch of my old rheumatism;
<lb/>and all my family are in one way or other affected
<lb/>with it: my eldest daughter has got cold with her
<lb/>bathing, though the sea-water never gives any body
<lb/>cold!</p>
          <p>In answer to these complaints, I am told by the
<lb/>good company here that I have stayed too long in the
<lb/>same air, and that now I ought to take a trip to the
<lb/>continent, and spend the winter at <placeName>Nice</placeName>,
which would
<lb/>complete the business. I am entirely of their opinion,
<lb/>that it <emph>would</emph> complete the business, and have

          <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> other day I paid a visit to a
gentleman with
<lb/>whom, though greatly my superior in fortune, I have
<lb/>long been in habits of an easy intimacy. He rose in
<lb/>the world by honourable industry; and married,
<lb/>rather late in life, a lady to whom he had been long
<lb/>attached, and in whom centered the wealth of several
<lb/>expiring families. Their earnest wish for children
<lb/>was not immediately gratified. At length they were
<lb/>made happy by a son, who, from the moment he was
<lb/>born, engrossed all their care and attention.—My
<lb/>friend received me in his library, where I found him
<lb/>busied in turning over books of education, of which
<lb/>he had collected all that were worthy notice, from
<lb/><persName>Xenophon</persName> to <persName>Locke</persName>, and from <persName>Locke</persName> to
<persName>Catherine
<lb/>Macauley</persName>. As he knows I have been engaged in the
<lb/>business of instruction, he did me the honour to con­
<lb/>sult me on the subject of his researches, hoping, he
<lb/>said, that, out of all the systems before him, we should
<lb/>be able to form a plan equally complete and compre­
<lb/>hensive; it being the determination of both himself
<lb/>and his lady to choose the best that could be had, and
<lb/>to spare neither pains nor expense in making their
<lb/>child all that was great and good. I gave him my
<lb/>thoughts with the utmost freedom, and after I return­
<lb/>ed home, threw upon paper the observations which
<lb/>had occurred to me.</p>
          <p>The first thing to be considered, with respect to
<lb/>education, is the object of it. This appears to me to
<lb/>have been generally misunderstood. Education, in

<pb n="204"/>
<milestone n="17(6)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">204</mw>

<lb/>its largest sense, is a thing of great scope and extent.
<lb/>It includes the whole process by which a human being
<lb/>is formed to be what he is, in habits, principles, and
<lb/>cultivation of every kind. But of this, a very small
<lb/>part is in the power even of the parent himself; a
<lb/>smaller still can be directed by purchased tuition of
<lb/>any kind. You engage for your child masters and
<lb/>tutors at large salaries; and you do well, for they are
<lb/>competent to instruct him: they will give him the
<lb/>means, at least, of acquiring science and accomplish­
<lb/>ments; but in the business of education, properly so
<lb/>called, they can do little for you. Do you ask, then,
<lb/>what will educate your son? Your example will edu­
<lb/>cate him; your conversation with your friends; the
<lb/>business he sees you transact; the likings and dislik­
<lb/>ings you express; these will educate him; the so­
<lb/>ciety you live in will educate him;—your domestics
<lb/>will educate him; above all, your rank and situation
<lb/>in life, your house, your table, your pleasure-grounds,
<lb/>your hounds and your stables will educate him. It is
<lb/>not in your power to withdraw him from the continual
<lb/>influence of these things, except you were to with­
<lb/>draw yourself from them also. You speak of <emph>begin­
<lb/>ning</emph> the education of your son. The moment he
<lb/>was able to form an idea his education was already
<lb/>begun; the education of circumstances—insensible
<lb/>education—which, like insensible perspiration, is of
<lb/>more constant and powerful effect, and of infinitely
<lb/>more consequence to the habit, than that which is di­
<lb/>rect and apparent. This education goes on at every
<lb/>instant of time; it goes on like time; you can neither
<lb/>stop it nor turn its course. What these have a ten­
<lb/>dency to make your child, that he will be. Maxims
<lb/>and documents are good precisely till they are tried,
<lb/>and no longer; they will teach him to talk, and noth­
<lb/>ing more. The <emph>circumstances</emph> in which your son is

<pb n="205"/>
<milestone n="18(1)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">205</mw>

<lb/>placed will be even more prevalent than your exam­
<lb/>ple; and you have no right to expect him to become
<lb/>what you yourself are, but by the same means. You,
<lb/>that have toiled during youth to set your son upon
<lb/>higher ground, and to enable him to begin where you
<lb/>left off, do not expect that son to be what you were,
<lb/>—diligent, modest, active, simple in his tastes, fertile
<lb/>in resources. You have put him under quite a dif­
<lb/>ferent master. Poverty educated you; wealth will
<lb/>educate him. You cannot suppose the result will be
<lb/>the same. You must not even expect that he will be
<lb/>what you now are; for though relaxed perhaps from
<lb/>the severity of your frugal habits, you still derive ad­
<lb/>vantage from having formed them; and, in your
<lb/>heart, you like plain dinners, and early hours, and old
<lb/>friends, whenever your fortune will permit you to en­
<lb/>joy them. But it will not be so with your son: his
<lb/>tastes will be formed by your present situation, and in
<lb/>no dgree by your former one. But I take great
<lb/>care, you will say, to counteract these tendencies, and
<lb/>to bring him up in hardy and simple manners; I
<lb/>know their value, and am resolved that he shall ac­
<lb/>quire no other. Yes, you make him hardy; that is
<lb/>to say, you take a country-house in a good air, and
<lb/>make him run, well clothed and carefully attended,
<lb/>for, it may be, an hour in a clear frosty winter's day
<lb/>upon your gravelled terrace; or perhaps you take the 
<lb/>puny shivering infant from his warm bed, and dip him
<lb/>in an icy cold bath,—and you think you have done
<lb/>great matters. And so you have; you have done all
<lb/>you can. But you were suffered to run abroad half
<lb/>the day on a bleak heath, in weather fit and unfit,
<lb/>wading barefoot through dirty ponds, sometimes losing
<lb/>your way benighted, scrambling over hedges, climb­
<lb/>ing trees, in perils every hour both of life and limb.
<lb/>Your life was of very little consequence to any one;

<lb/>even your parents, encumbered with a numerous
<lb/>family, had little time to indulge the softnesses of af­
<lb/>fection, or the solicitude of anxiety; and to every one
<lb/>else it was of no consequence at all. It is not possi­
<lb/>ble for you, it would not even be right for you, in
<lb/>your present situation, to pay no more attention to
<lb/>your child than was paid you. In these mimic ex­
<lb/>periments of education, there is always something
<lb/>which distinguishes them from reality; some weak
<lb/>part left unfortified, for the arrows of misfortune to
<lb/>find their way into. <persName>Achilles</persName> was a young
nobleman,
<lb/><foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="la">dios
<persName>Achilleus</persName></foreign>, and therefore, though he had 
<persName>Chiron</persName>
<lb/>for his tutor, there was one foot left undipped. You
<lb/>may throw by <persName>Rousseau</persName>; your parents practised
<lb/>without having read it; you may read, but imperious
<lb/>circumstances forbid you the practice of it.</p>
          <p>You are sensible of the advantages of simplicity of
<lb/>diet; and you make a point of restricting that of your
<lb/>child to the plainest food, for you are resolved that
<lb/>he shall not be nice. But this plain food is of the
<lb/>choicest quality, prepared by your own cook; his
<lb/>fruit is ripened from your walls; his cloth, his glasses,
<lb/>all the accompaniments of the table, are such as are
<lb/>only met with in families of opulence: the very ser­
<lb/>vants who attend him are neat, well dressed, and have
<lb/>a certain air of fashion. You may call this simplici­
<lb/>ty; but I say he will be nice,—for it is a kind of
sim­
<lb/>plicity which only wealth can attain to, and which
<lb/>will subject him to be disgusted at all common tables.
<lb/>Besides, he will from time to time partake of those
<lb/>delicacies which your table abounds with; you your­
<lb/>self will give him of them occasionally; you would be
<lb/>unkind if you did not: your servants, if good-natured,
<lb/>will do the same. Do you think you can keep the
<lb/>full stream of luxury running by his lips, and he not
<lb/>taste of it? Vain imagination!</p>

          <p>I would not be understood to inveigh against wealth,
<lb/>or against the enjoyments of it; they are real enjoy­
<lb/>ments, and allied to many elegancies in manners and
<lb/>in taste;—I only wish to prevent unprofitable pains
<lb/>and inconsistent expectations.</p>
          <p>You are sensible of the benefit of early rising; and
<lb/>you may, if you please, make it a point that your
<lb/>daughter shall retire with her governess, and your son
<lb/>with his tutor, at the hour when you are preparing to
<lb/>see company. But their sleep, in the first place, will
<lb/>not be so sweet and undisturbed amidst the rattle of
<lb/>carriages, and the glare of tapers glancing through the
<lb/>rooms, as that of the village child in his quiet cottage,
<lb/>protected by silence and darkness; and moreover,
<lb/>you may depend upon it, that, as the coercive power
<lb/>of education is laid aside, they will in a few months
<lb/>slide into the habitudes of the rest of the family,
<lb/>whose hours are determined by their company and
<lb/>situation in life. You have, however, done good, as
<lb/>far as it goes; it is something gained, to defer perni­
<lb/>cious habits, if we cannot prevent them.</p>
          <p>There is nothing which has so little share in educa­
<lb/>tion as direct precept. To be convinced of this, we
<lb/>need only reflect that there is no one point we labour
<lb/>more to establish with children, than that of their
<lb/>speaking truth; and there is not any in which we
<lb/>succeed worse. And why? Because children readi­
<lb/>ly see we have an interest in it. Their speaking
<lb/>truth is used by us as an engine of government—
<lb/><said rend="pre(“)post(”)">Tell me, my dear child, when you
have broken any
<lb/>thing, and I will not be angry with you.</said> <said xml:id="ED1" rend="pre(“)post(”)">Thank
<lb/>you for nothing,</said> says the child;
<said xml:id="ED2" rend="pre(“)post(”)">if I prevent you
<lb/>from finding it out, I am sure you will not be angry:</said>
<lb/>and nine times out of ten he can prevent it. He
<lb/>knows that, in the common intercourses of life, you
<lb/>tell a thousand falsehoods. But these are necessary
<lb/>lies on important occasions.</p>
          <pb n="208"/>
          <milestone n="18(2)v" unit="sig"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">208</mw>
          <p>Your child is the best judge how much occasion he
<lb/>has to tell a lie: he may have as great occasion for it,
<lb/>as you have to conceal a bad piece of news from a
<lb/>sick friend, or to hide your vexation from an unwel­
<lb/>come visitor. That authority which extends its claims
<lb/>over every action, and even every thought, which in­
<lb/>sists upon an answer to every interrogation, however
<lb/>indiscreet or oppressive to the feelings, will, in young
<lb/>or old, produce fal<choice><sic/><corr>s</corr></choice>ehood; or, if in some few instances
<lb/>the deeply imbibed fear of future and unknown
<lb/>punishment should restrain from direct falsehood, it
<lb/>will produce a habit of dissimulation, which is still
<lb/>worse. The child, the slave, or the subject, who, on
<lb/>proper occasions, may not say, <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">I do not choose to
<lb/>tell,</said> will certainly, by the circumstances in which you
<lb/>place him, be driven to have recourse to deceit, even
<lb/>should he not be countenanced by your example.</p>
          <p>I do not mean to assert, that sentiments inculcated
<lb/>in education have no influence;—they have much,
<lb/>though not the most: but it is the sentiments we let
<lb/>drop occasionally, the conversation they overhear when
<lb/>playing unnoticed in a corner of the room, which has
<lb/>an effect upon children; and not what is addressed
<lb/>directly to them in the tone of exhortation. If you
<lb/>would know precisely the effect these set discourses
<lb/>have upon your child, be pleased to reflect upon that
<lb/>which a discourse from the pulpit, which you have
<lb/>reason to think merely professional, has upon you.
<lb/>Children have almost an intuitive discernment between
<lb/>the maxims you bring forward for their use, and those
<lb/>by which you direct your own conduct. Be as cun­
<lb/>ning as you will, they are always more cunning than
<lb/>you. Every child knows whom his father and mother
<lb/>love and see with pleasure, and whom they dislike;
<lb/>for whom they think themselves obliged to set out
<lb/>their best plate and china; whom they think it an

<pb n="209"/>
<milestone n="18(3)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">209</mw>

<lb/>honour to visit, and upon whom they confer honour
<lb/>by admitting them to their company. <said xml:id="EF1" rend="pre(“)post(”)">Respect
<lb/>nothing so much as virtue,</said> says <persName>Eugenio</persName>
to his son;
<lb/><said xml:id="EF2" rend="pre(“)post(”)">virtue and 
talents are the only grounds of distinction.</said>
<lb/>The child presently has occasion to inquire why his
<lb/>father pulls off his hat to some people and not to
<lb/>others; he is told, that outward respect must be
<lb/>proportioned to different stations in life. This is a
<lb/>little difficult of comprehension: however, by dint of
<lb/>explanation, he gets over it tolerably well. But he
<lb/>sees his father's house in the bustle and hurry of pre­
<lb/>paration; common business laid aside, every body in
<lb/>movement, an unusual anxiety to please and to shine.
<lb/>Nobody is at leisure to receive his caresses or attend
<lb/>to his questions; his lessons are interrupted, his hours
<lb/>deranged. At length a guest arrives: it is my <persName>Lord
<lb/>――</persName>, whom he has heard you speak of twenty times
<lb/>as one of the most worthless characters upon earth.
<lb/>Your child, <persName>Eugenio</persName>, has received a lesson of 
educa­
<lb/>tion. Resume, if you will, your systems of morality
<lb/>on the morrow, you will in vain attempt to eradicate
<lb/>it. <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">You expect company, mamma, 
must I be dress­
<lb/>ed today?</said> <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">No, it is only
good Mrs. Such-a-one.</said>
<lb/>Your child has received a lesson of education, one
<lb/>which he well understands, and will long remember.
<lb/>You have sent your child to a public school; but to
<lb/>secure his morals against the vice which you too justly
<lb/>apprehend abounds there, you have given him a private
<lb/>tutor, a man of strict morals and religion. He may
<lb/>help him to prepare his tasks; but do you imagine it
<lb/>will be in his power to form his mind? His school­
<lb/>fellows, the allowance you give him, the manners of
<lb/>the age and of the place, will do that; and not the
<lb/>lectures which he is obliged to hear. If these are dif­
<lb/>ferent from what you yourself experienced, you must
<lb/> not be surprised to see him gradually recede from the

<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">18*</mw>
<pb n="210"/>
<milestone n="18(3)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">210</mw>

<lb/>principles, civil and religious, which you hold, and
<lb/>break off from your connexions, and adopt manners
<lb/>different from your own. This is remarkably ex­
<lb/>emplified amongst those of the <name>Dissenters</name> who have
<lb/>risen to wealth and consequence. I believe it would
<lb/>be difficult to find an instance of families, who for
<lb/>three generations have kept their carriage and con­
<lb/>tinued <name>Dissenters</name>.</p>
          <p>Education, it is often observed, is an expensive
<lb/>thing. It is so; but the paying for lessons is the 
<lb/>smallest part of the cost. If you would go to the
<lb/>price of having your son a worthy man, you must be
<lb/>so yourself; your friends, your servants, your company
<lb/>must be all of that stamp. Suppose this to be the
<lb/>case, much is done: but there will remain circumstances,
<lb/>which perhaps you cannot alter, that will still have
<lb/>their effect. Do you wish him to love simplicity?
<lb/>Would you be content to lay down your coach, to
<lb/>drop your title? Where is the parent who would do
<lb/>this to educate his son? You carry him to the work­
<lb/>shops of artisans, and show him different machines
<lb/>and fabrics, to awaken his ingenuity. The necessity
<lb/>of getting his bread would awaken it much more
<lb/>effectually. The single circumstance of having a
<lb/>fortune to get, or a fortune to spend, will probably
<lb/>operate more strongly upon his mind, not only than
<lb/>your precepts, but even than your example. You
<lb/>wish your child to be modest and unassuming; you
<lb/>are so, perhaps, yourself,—and you pay liberally a
<lb/>preceptor for giving him lessons of humility. You do
<lb/>not perceive, that the very circumstance of having a
<lb/>man of letters and accomplishments retained about
<lb/>his person, for his sole advantage, tends more forcibly
<lb/>to inspire him with an idea of self-consequence, than
<lb/>all the lessons he can give him to repress it. <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">Why
<lb/>do not you look sad, you rascal?</said> says the under­

<pb n="211"/>
<milestone n="18(4)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">211</mw>

<lb/>taker to his man in the play of <title>The Funeral</title>; <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">I
<lb/>give you I know not how much money for looking sad,
<lb/>and the more I give you, the gladder I think you are.</said>
<lb/>So will it be with the wealthy heir. The lectures
<lb/>that are given him on condescension and affability,
<lb/>only prove to him upon how much higher ground he
<lb/>stands than those about him; and the very pains that
<lb/>are taken with his moral character will make him
<lb/>proud, by showing him how much he is the object of
<lb/>attention. You cannot help these things. Your ser­
<lb/>vants, out of respect to you, will bear with his pet­
<lb/>ulance; your company, out of respect to you, will
<lb/>forbear to check his impatience; and you yourself, if
<lb/>he is clever, will repeat his observations.</p>
          <p>In the exploded doctrine of sympathies, you are
<lb/>directed, if you have cut your finger, to let that alone,
<lb/>and put your plaster upon the knife. This is very
<lb/>bad doctrine, I must confess, in philosophy; but very
<lb/>good in morals. Is a man luxurious, self-indulgent?
<lb/>do not apply your <emph>physic of the soul</emph> to him, but cure
<lb/>his fortune. Is he haughty? cure his rank, his title.
<lb/>Is he vulgar? cure his company. Is he diffident or
<lb/>mean-spirited? cure his poverty, give him conse­
<lb/>quence—but these prescriptions go far beyond the
<lb/>family recipes of education.</p>
          <p>What then is the result? In the first place, that we
<lb/>should contract our ideas of education, and expect no
<lb/>more from it than it is able to perform. It can give in­
<lb/>struction. There will always be an essential difference
<lb/> between a human being cultivated and uncultivated.
<lb/>Education can provide proper instructors in the va­
<lb/>rious arts and sciences, and portion out to the best ad­
<lb/>vantage those precious hours of youth which never will
<lb/>return. It can likewise give, in a great degree, per­
<lb/>sonal habits; and even if these should afterwards give
<lb/>way under the influence of contrary circumstances,

<pb n="212"/>

<mw type="pageNum">212</mw>

<lb/>your child will feel the good effects of them; for the
<lb/>later and the less will he go into what is wrong. Let
<lb/>us also be assured, that the business of education,
<lb/>properly so called, is not transferable. You may en­
<lb/>gage masters to instruct your child in this or the other
<lb/>accomplishment, but you must educate him yourself.
<lb/>You not only ought to do it, but you must do it,
<lb/>whether you intend it or no. As education is a thing
<lb/>necessary for all; for the poor and for the rich, for
<lb/>the illiterate as well as for the learned; Providence
<lb/>has not made it dependent upon systems uncertain,
<lb/>operose, and difficult of investigation. It is not neces­
<lb/>sary, with <persName>Rousseau</persName> or <persName>Madame de
 <placeName>Genlis</placeName></persName>, to devote
<lb/>to the education of one child the talents and the time
<lb/>of a number of grown men; to surround him with an
<lb/>artificial world; and to counteract, by maxims, the 
<lb/>natural tendencies of the situation he is placed in in
<lb/>society. Every one has time to educate his child:
<lb/>the poor man educates him while working in his
<lb/>cottage—the man of business while employed in his
<lb/>counting-house.</p>
          <p>Do we see a father who is diligent in his profession,
<lb/>domestic in his habits, whose house is the resort of
<lb/>well-informed, intelligent people—a mother whose
<lb/>time is usefully filled, whose attention to her duties
<lb/>secures esteem, and whose amiable manners attract
<lb/>affection? Do not be solicitous, respectable couple,
<lb/>about the moral education of your offspring! do not
<lb/>be uneasy because you cannot surround them with the
<lb/>apparatus of books and systems; or fancy you<choice><sic>r</sic><corr/></choice>
must
<lb/>retire from the world to devote yourselves to their
<lb/>improvement. In your world they are brought up
<lb/>much better than they would be under any plan of
<lb/>factitious education which you could provide for them:
<lb/>they will imbibe affection from your caresses; taste
<lb/>from your conversation; urbanity from the commerce

<pb n="213"/>
<milestone n="18(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">213</mw>

<lb/>of your society; and mututal love from your example.
<lb/>Do not regret that you are not rich enough to provide
<lb/>tutors and governors, to watch his steps with sedulous
<lb/>and servile anxiety, and furnish him with maxims it is
<lb/>morally impossible he should act upon when grown up.
<lb/>Do not you see how seldom this over culture produces
<lb/>its effect, and how many shining and excellent char­
<lb/>acters start up every day, from the bosom of obscurity,
<lb/>with scarcely any care at all?</p>
          <p>Are children then to be neglected? Surely not:
<lb/>but having given them the instruction and accomplish­
<lb/>ments which their situation in life requires, let us reject
<lb/>superfluous solicitude, and trust that their characters
<lb/>will form themselves from the spontaneous influence
<lb/>of good examples, and circumstances which impel
<lb/>them to useful action.</p>
          <p>But the education of your house, important as it is,
<lb/>is only a part of a more comprehensive system.
<lb/>Providence takes your child where you leave him.
<lb/>Providence continues his education upon a larger
<lb/>scale, and by a process which includes means far
<lb/>more efficacious. Has your son entered the world at
<lb/>eighteen, opinionated, haughty, rash, inclined to dissi­
<lb/>pation? Do not despair; he may yet be cured of
<lb/>these faults, if it pleases Heaven. There
are reme­
<lb/>dies which you could not persuade yourself to use, if
<lb/>they were in your power, and which are specific in
<lb/>cases of this kind. How often do we see the pre­
<lb/>sumptuous, giddy youth, changed into the wise coun­
<lb/>sellor, the considerate, steady friend! How often the
<lb/>thoughtless, gay girl, into the sober wife, the affec­
<lb/>tionate mother! Faded beauty, humbled self-conse­
<lb/>quence, disappointed ambition, loss of fortune,—this
<lb/>is the rough physic provided by Providence to melio­
<lb/>rate the temper, to correct the offensive petulancies of
<lb/>youth, and bring out all the energies of the finished

<pb n="214"/>
<milestone n="18(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">214</mw>

<lb/>character. Afflictions soften the proud; difficulties
<lb/>push forward the ingenious; successful industry gives
<lb/>consequence and credit, and developes a thousand
<lb/>latent good qualities. There is no malady of the
<lb/>mind so inveterate, which this education of events is
<lb/>not calculated to cure, if life were long enough; and
<lb/>shall we not hope, that He, in whose hand are all the
<lb/>remedial processes of nature, will renew the discipline
<lb/>in another state, and finish the imperfect man?</p>
          <p>States are educated as individuals—by circumstan­
<lb/>ces: the prophet may cry aloud, and spare not; the
<lb/>philosopher may descant on morals; eloquence may
<lb/>exhaust itself in invective against the vices of the age:
<lb/>these vices will certainly follow certain states of pov­
<lb/>erty or riches, ignorance or high civilization. But
<lb/>what these gentle alter<choice><sic/><corr>n</corr></choice>atives fail of doing, may be ac­
<lb/>complished by an unsuccessful war, a loss of trade, or
<lb/>any of those great calamities by which it pleases
<lb/>Providence to speak to a nation in such language as
<lb/><emph>will</emph> be heard. If, as a nation, we would be cured of
<lb/>pride, it must be by mortification; if of luxury, by a
<lb/>national bankruptcy, perhaps; if of injustice, or the
<lb/>spirit of domination, by a loss of national consequence.
<lb/>In comparison of these strong remedies, a fast, or a
<lb/>sermon, are prescriptions of very little efficacy.</p>

<lb/>which, under the appearance of following a closer

<lb/>or genuine feelings of mankind. No subject has been

<pb n="216"/>
<milestone n="18(6)v" unit="sig"/>

<mw rend="align(center)" type="pageNum">216</mw>
<lb/>more canvassed than education. With regard to that
<lb/>important object there is a maxim avowed by many
<lb/>sensible people, which seems to me to deserve par­
<lb/>ticular investigation. <said xml:id="in01" rend="pre(“)post(”)">Give your child,</said> it is said,
<lb/><said xml:id="in02" rend="pre(“)post(”)">no
<emph>prejudices:</emph> let reason be the only foundation of
<lb/>his opinions; where he cannot reason, let him sus­
<lb/>pend his belief. Let your great care be, that as he
<lb/>grows up he has nothing to unlearn; and never make
<lb/>use of authority in matters of opinion, for authority is
<lb/>no test of truth.</said> The maxim sounds well, and flat­
<lb/>ters perhaps the secret pride of man, in supposing him
<lb/>more the creature of reason than he really is; but, I
<lb/>suspect, on examination we shall find it exceeedingly
<lb/>fallacious. We must first consider what a <emph>prejudice</emph>
<lb/>is. A prejudice is a sentiment in favour or disfavour
<lb/>of any person, practice, or opinion, previous to and
<lb/>independent of examining their merits by reason and
<lb/>investigation. Prejudice is prejudging; that is, judg­
<lb/>ing previously to evidence. It is therefore sufficient­
<lb/>ly apparent, that no <emph>philosophical belief</emph> can be
found­
<lb/>ed on mere prejudice; because it is the business of
<lb/>philosophy to go deep into the nature and properties
<lb/>of things: nor can it be allowable for those to indulge
<lb/>prejudice who aspire to lead the public opinion; those
<lb/>to whom the high office is appointed of sifting truth
<lb/>from error, of canvassing the claims of different sys­
<lb/>tems, of exploding old and introducing new tenets.
<lb/>These must investigate, with a kind of audacious bold­
<lb/>ness, every subject that comes before them; these,
<lb/>neither impressed with awe for all that mankind have
<lb/>been taught to reverence, nor swayed by affection for
<lb/>whatever the sympathies of our nature incline us to
<lb/>love, must hold the balance with a severe and steady
<lb/>hand, while they are weighing the doubtful scale of
<lb/>probabilities; and with a stoical apathy of mind, yield
<lb/>their assent to nothing but a preponderancy of evi­

<pb n="217"/>

<lb/>dence. But is this an office for a child? Is it an
<lb/>office for more than one or two men in a century?
<lb/>And is it desirable that a child should grow up with­
<lb/>out opinions to regulate his conduct, till he is able to
<lb/>form them fairly by the exercise of his own abilities?
<lb/>Such an exercise requires at least the sober period of
<lb/>matured reason: reason not only sharpened by argu­
<lb/>mentative discussion, but informed by experience.
<lb/>The most sprightly child can only possess the former;
<lb/>for let it be remembered, that though the reasoning
<lb/>powers put forth pretty early in life, the faculty of
<lb/>using them to effect does not come till much later.
<lb/>The first efforts of a child in reasoning resemble those
<lb/>quick and desultory motions by which he gains the
<lb/>play of his limbs; they show agility and grace, they
<lb/>are pleasing to look at, and necessary for the gradual
<lb/>acquirement of his bodily powers; but his joints must
<lb/>be knit into more firmness, and his movements reg­
<lb/>ulated with more precision, before he is capable of
<lb/>useful labour and manly exertion. A reasoning child
<lb/>is not yet a reasonable being. There is great pro­
<lb/>priety in the legal phraseology which expresses matu­
<lb/>rity, not by having arrived at the possession of reason,
<lb/>but of that power, the late result of information, thought,
<lb/>and experience—discretion, which alone teaches, with
<lb/>regard to reason, its powers, its limits, and its use.
<lb/>This the child of the most sprightly parts cannot have;
<lb/>and therefore his attempts at reasoning, whatever
<lb/>acuteness they may show, and how much soever they
<lb/>may please a parent with the early promise of future
<lb/>excellence, are of no account whatever in the sober
<lb/>search after truth. Besides, taking it for granted
<lb/>which however is utterly impossible) that a youth
<lb/>could be brought up to the age of fiteen or sixteen
<lb/>without prejudice in favour of any opinions whatever,
<lb/>and that he is then set to examining for himself some

<lb/>important proposition,—how is he to set about it?
<lb/>Who is to recommend books to him? Who is to
<lb/>give him the previous information necessary to com­
<lb/>prehend the question? Who is to tell him whether
<lb/>or no it is important? Whoever does these, will in­
<lb/>fallibly lay a bias upon his mind according to the ideas
<lb/>he himself has received upon the subject. Let us
<lb/>suppose the point in debate was the preference be­
<lb/>tween the Roman catholic and protestant modes of
<lb/>religion. Can a youth in a protestant country, born
<lb/>of protestant parents, with access, probably, to hardly
<lb/>a single controversial book on the Roman catholic
<lb/>side of the question,—can such a one study the subject
<lb/>without prejudice? His knowledge of history, if he
<lb/>has such knowledge, must, according to the books he
<lb/>has read, have already given him a prejudice on the
<lb/>one side or the other; so must the occasional con­
<lb/>versation he has been witness to, the appellations he
<lb/>has heard used, the tone of voice with which he has
<lb/>heard the words monk or priest pronounced, and a
<lb/>thousand other evanescent circumstances. It is like­
<lb/>wise to be observed, that every question of any weight
<lb/>and importance has numerous dependencies and points
<lb/>of connexion with other subjects, which make it im­
<lb/>possible to enter upon the consideration of it without
<lb/>a great variety of previous knowledge. There is no
<lb/>object of investigation perfectly insulated;—we must
<lb/>not conceive therefore of a man's sitting down to it
<lb/>with a mind perfectly new and untutored: he must
<lb/>have passed more or less through a course of studies;
<lb/>and, according to the colour of those studies, his mind
<lb/>will have received a tincture,—that is, a
prejudice.—
<lb/>But it is, in truth, the most absurd of all suppositions,
<lb/>that a human being can be educated, or even nourish­
<lb/>ed and brought up, without imbibing numberless pre­
<lb/>judices from every thing which passes around him.

<lb/>A child cannot learn the signification of words without
<lb/>receiving ideas along with them; he cannot be impres­
<lb/>sed with affection to his parents and those about him,
<lb/>without conceiving a predilection for their tastes,
<lb/>opinions, and practices. He forms numberless as­
<lb/>sociations of pain or pleasure, and every association
<lb/>begets a prejudice; he sees objects from a particular
<lb/>spot, and his views of things are contracted or extend­
<lb/>ed according to his position in society: as no two in­
<lb/>dividuals can have the same horizon, so neither can
<lb/>any two have the same associations; and different
<lb/>associations will produce different opinions, as neces­
<lb/>sarily as, by the laws of perspective, different distances 
<lb/>will produce different appearances of visible objects.
<lb/>Let us confess a truth, humiliating perhaps to human
<lb/>pride;—a very small part only of the opinions of the
<lb/>coolest philosopher are the result of fair reasoning;
<lb/>the rest are formed by his education, his temperament,
<lb/>by the age in which he lives, by trains of thought
<lb/>directed to a particular track through some accidental
<lb/>association—in short, by <emph>prejudice</emph>. But why,
after
<lb/>all, should we wish to bring up children without pre­
<lb/>judices? A child has occasion to act, long before he
<lb/>can reason. Shall we leave him destitute of all the
<lb/>principles that should regulate his conduct, till he can
<lb/>discover them by the strength of own genius? If it
<lb/>were possible that one whole generation could be
<lb/>brought up without prejudices, the world must return
<lb/>to the infancy of knowledge, and all the beautiful fabric
<lb/>which has been built up by successive generations,
<lb/>must be begun again from the very foundation. Your
<lb/>child has a claim to the advantage of your experience,
<lb/>which it would be cruel and unjust to deprive him of.
<lb/>Will any father say to his son, <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">My dear child, you
<lb/>are entering upon a world full of intricate and perplexed
<lb/>paths, in which many miss their way, to their final

<pb n="220"/>
<milestone n="19(2)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">220</mw>

<lb/>misery and ruin. Amidst many false systems, and
<lb/>much vain science, there is also some true knowledge;
<lb/>there is a right path: I believe I know it, for I have
<lb/>the advantage of years and experience, but I will in­
<lb/>still no prejudices in your mind; I shall therefore
<lb/>leave you to find it out as you can; whether your
<lb/>abilities are great or small, you must take the chance
<lb/>of them. There are various systems in morals; I
<lb/>have examined and found some of a good, others
<lb/>of a bad tendency. There is such a thing as religion;
<lb/>many people think it the most important concern of
<lb/>life: perhaps I am one of them: perhaps I have
<lb/>chosen from amidst the various systems of belief,—
<lb/>many of which are extremely absurd, and some even
<lb/>pernicious, that which I cherish as the guide of my
<lb/>life, my comfort in all my sorrows, and the foundation
<lb/>of my dearest hopes: but far be it from me to in­
<lb/>fluence you in any manner to receive it; when you
<lb/>are grown up, you must read all the books upon these
<lb/>subjects which you can lay your hands on, for neither
<lb/>in the choice of these would I presume to prejudice
<lb/>your mind: converse with all who pretend to any
<lb/>opinions upon the subject; and whatever happens to
<lb/>be the result, you must abide by it. In the mean
<lb/>time, concerning these important objects you must
<lb/>keep your mind in a perfect equilibrium. It is true
<lb/>you want these principles now more than you can do
<lb/>at any other period of your life; but I had rather you
<lb/>never had them at all, than that you should not come
<lb/>fairly by them.</said> Should we commend the wisdom
<lb/>or the kindness of such a parent? The parent will
<lb/>perhaps plead in his behalf, that it is by no means his
<lb/>intention to leave the mind of his child in the uncul­
<lb/>tivated state I have supposed. As soon as his under­
<lb/>standing begins to open, he means to discuss with him
<lb/>those propositions on which he wishes him to form an

<pb n="221"/>
<milestone n="19(3)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">221</mw>

<lb/>opinion. He will make him read the best books on
<lb/>the subject, and by free conversation and explaining
<lb/>the arguments on both sides, he does not doubt but
<lb/>the youth will soon be enabled to judge satisfactorily
<lb/>for himself. I have no objection to make against this
<lb/>mode of proceding: as a mode of <emph>instruction</emph>, it is
<lb/>certainly a very good one: but he must know little of
<lb/>human nature, who thinks that after this process the
<lb/>youth will be really in a capacity of judging for him­
<lb/>self, or that he is less under the dominion of prejudice
<lb/>than if he had received the same truths from the mere
<lb/>authority of his parent; for most assuredly the argu­
<lb/>ments on either side will not have been set before
<lb/>him with equal strength or with equal warmth. The
<lb/>persuasive tone, the glowing language, the triumphant
<lb/>retort, will all be reserved for the side on which the
<lb/>parent has formed his own conclusions. It cannot be
<lb/>otherwise; he cannot be convinced himself of what
<lb/>he thinks a truth, without wishing to convey that con­
<lb/>viction, nor without thinking all that can be urged on
<lb/>the other side, weak and futile. He cannot in a mat­
<lb/>ter of importance neutralize his feelings: perfect
<lb/>impartiality can be the result only of indifference.
<lb/>He does not perhaps seem to dictate, but he wishes
<lb/>gently to guide his pupil; and that wish is seldom
<lb/>disappointed. The child adopts the opinion of his
<lb/>parent, and seems to himself to have adopted it from
<lb/>the decisions of his own judgment; but all these
<lb/>reasonings must be gone over again, and these opinions
<lb/>undergo a fiery ordeal, if ever he comes really to think
<lb/>and determine for himself.</p>
          <p>The fact is, that no man, whatever his system may
<lb/>be, refrains from instilling prejudices into his child in
<lb/>any matter he has much at heart. Take a disciple
<lb/>of <persName>Rousseau</persName>, who contends that it would be
very per­
<lb/>nicious to give his son any ideas of a Deity till he is

<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">19*</mw>
<pb n="222"/>
<milestone n="19(3)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">222</mw>

<lb/>of an age to read <persName>Clarke</persName> or
<persName>Leibnitz</persName>, and ask him if
<lb/>he waits so long to impress on his mind the sentiments
<lb/>of patriotism—the civic affection. O no! you will
<lb/>find his little heart is early taught to beat at the very
<lb/>name of liberty, and that, long before he is capable of
<lb/>forming a single political idea, he has entered with
<lb/>warmth into all the party sentiments and connexions
<lb/>of his parent. He learns to love and hate, to venerate
<lb/>or despise, by rote; and he soon acquires decided
<lb/>opinions, of the real ground of which he can know
<lb/>absolutely nothing. Are not ideas of female honour
<lb/>and decorum imprest first as prejudices; and would
<lb/>any parent wish they should be so much as canvassed
<lb/>till the most settled habits of propriety have rendered 
<lb/>it safe to do it? In teaching first by prejudice that
<lb/>which is afterwards to be proved, we do but follow
<lb/>Nature. Instincts are prejudices she gives us: we
<lb/>follow them implicitly, and they lead us right; but it
<lb/>is not till long afterwards that reason comes and justi­
<lb/>fies them. Why should we scruple to lead a child to
<lb/>right opinions in the same way by which Nature leads
<lb/>him to right practices!</p>
          <p>Still it will be urged that man is a rational being,
<lb/>and therefore reason is the only true ground of belief,
<lb/>and authority is not reason. This point requires a
<lb/>little discussion. That he who receives a truth upon
<lb/>authority has not a reasonable belief, is in one sense
<lb/>true, since he has not drawn it from the result of his own
<lb/>inquiries; but in another it is certainly false, since the
<lb/>authority itself may be to him the best of all reasons
<lb/>for believing it. There are few men who, from the
<lb/>exercise of the best powers of their minds, could derive
<lb/>so good a reason for believing a mathematical truth,
<lb/>as the authority of <persName>Sir Isaac Newton</persName>. There
are two
<lb/>principles deeply implanted in the mind of man, with­
<lb/>out which he could never attain knowledge,—curiosity,

<pb n="223"/>
<milestone n="19(4)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">223</mw>

<lb/>and credulity; the former to lead him to make dis­
<lb/>coveries himself, the latter to dispose him to receive
<lb/>knowledge from others. The credulity of a child to
<lb/>those who cherish him, is in early life unbounded.
<lb/>This is one of the most useful instincts he has, and is
<lb/>in fact a precious advantage put into the hands of the
<lb/>parent for storing his mind with ideas of all kinds.
<lb/>Without this principle of assent he could never gain
<lb/>even the rudiments of knowledge. He receives it, it
<lb/>is true, in the shape of prejudice; but the prejudice
<lb/>itself is founded upon sound reasoning, and conclusive
<lb/>though imperfect experiment. He finds himself weak,
<lb/>helpless, and ignorant; he sees in his parent a being
<lb/>of knowledge and powers more than his utmost capac­
<lb/>ity can fathom; almost a god to him. He has often
<lb/>done him good, therefore he believes he loves him;
<lb/>he finds him capable of giving him information upon all
<lb/>the subjects he has applied to him about; his knowl­
<lb/>edge seems unbounded, and his information has led him
<lb/>right whenever he has had occasion to try it by actual
<lb/>experiment: the child does not draw out his little
<lb/>reasonings into a logical form, but this is to him a
<lb/>ground of belief, that his parent knows every thing,
<lb/>and is infallible. Though the proposition is not exact­
<lb/>ly true, it is sufficiently so for him to act upon: and
<lb/>when he believes in his parent with implicit faith, he
<lb/>believes upon grounds as truly rational as when, in
<lb/>after life, he follows the deductions of his own reason.</p>
          <p>But you will say, I wish my son may have nothing
<lb/>to unlearn, and therefore I would have him wait to
<lb/>form an opinion till he is able to do it on solid grounds.
<lb/>And why do you suppose he will have less to unlearn
<lb/>if he follows his own reason, than if he followed yours?
<lb/>If he thinks, if he inquires, he will no doubt have a
<lb/>great deal to unlearn, whichever course you take with
<lb/>him; but it is better to have some things to unlearn,
<lb/>than to having nothing learnt. Do you hold your own

<pb n="224"/>
<milestone n="19(4)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">224</mw>

<lb/>opinions so loosely, so hesitatingly, as not to think
<lb/>them safer to abide by, than the first results of his
<lb/>stammering reason? Are there no truths to learn so
<lb/>indubitable as to be without fear of their not approving
<lb/>themselves to his mature and well-directed judgment?
<lb/>Are there none you esteem so useful, as to feel anxious
<lb/>that he be put in possession of them? We are so­
<lb/>licitous not only to put our children in a capacity of
<lb/>acquiring their daily bread, but to bequeath to them
<lb/>riches which they may receive as an inheritance.
<lb/>Have you no mental wealth you wish to transmit, no
<lb/>stock of ideas he may begin with, instead of drawing
<lb/>them all from the labour of his own brain? If, more­
<lb/>over, your son should not adopt your prejudices, he
<lb/>will certainly adopt those of other people; or, if on
<lb/>subjects of high interest he <emph>could</emph> be kept totally
in­
<lb/>different, the consequence would be, that he would
<lb/>conceive either that such matters were not worth the
<lb/>trouble of inquiry, or that nothing satisfactory was to
<lb/>be learnt about them: for there are negative prejudices
<lb/>as well as positive.</p>
          <p>Let parents, therefore, not scruple to use the power
<lb/>God and Nature have put into their hands for the
<lb/>advantage of their offspring. Let them not fear to
<lb/>impress them with prejudices for whatever is fair and
<lb/>honourable in action—whatever is useful and impor­
<lb/>tant in systematic truth. Let such prejudices be
<lb/>wrought into the very texture of the soul. Such truths
<lb/>let them appear to know by intuition. Let the child
<lb/>never remember the period when he did not know them.
<lb/>Instead of sending him to that cold and hesitating be­
<lb/>lief which is founded on the painful and uncertain
<lb/>consequences of late investigation, let his conviction
<lb/>of all the truths you deem important, be mixed up with
<lb/>every warm affection of his nature, and identified with
<lb/>his most cherished recollections—the time will come
<lb/>soon enough when his confidence in you will have re­

<pb n="225"/>
<milestone n="19(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">225</mw>

<lb/>ceived a check. The growth of his own reason and
<lb/>the developement of his powers will lead him with a
<lb/>sudden impetus to examine every thing, to canvass
<lb/>every thing,  to suspect every thing. If he finds, as
<lb/>he certainly will find, the results of his reasoning dif­
<lb/>ferent in some respects from those you have given
<lb/>him, far from being now disposed to receive your as­
<lb/>sertions as proofs, he will rather feel disinclined to
<lb/>any opinion you profess, and struggle to free himself
<lb/>from the net you have woven about him.</p>
          <p>The calm repose of his mind is broken, the placid
<lb/>lake is become turbid, and reflects distorted and
<lb/>broken images of things; but be not you alarmed at
<lb/>the new workings of his thoughts,—it is the angel of
<lb/>reason which descends and troubles the waters. To
<lb/>endeavour to influence by authority, would be as use­
<lb/>less now as it was salutary before. Lie by in silence,
<lb/>and wait the result. Do not expect the mind of your
<lb/>son is to resemble yours, as your figure is reflected
<lb/>by the image in the glass; he was formed, like you,
<lb/>to use his own judgement, and he claims the high
<lb/>privilege of his nature. His reason is mature, his
<lb/>mind must now form itself. Happy must you esteem
<lb/>yourself, if amidst all lesser differences of opinion, and
<lb/>the wreck of many of your favourite ideas, he still
<lb/>preserves those radical and primary truths which are
<lb/>essential to his happiness, and which different trains of
<lb/>thought and opposite modes of investigation will very
<lb/>often equally lead to.</p>
          <p>Let it be well remembered that we have only been
<lb/>recommending those prejudices which go before rea­
<lb/>son, not those which are contrary to it. To endea­
<lb/>vour to make children, or others over whom we have
<lb/>influence, receive systems which we do not believe,
<lb/>merely because it is convenient to ourselves that they
<lb/>should believe them, though a very fashionable prac­
<lb/>tice, makes no part of the discipline we plead for.

<pb n="226"/>
<milestone n="19(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">226</mw>

<lb/>These are not prejudices, but impositions. We may
<lb/>also grant that nothing should be received as a preju­
<lb/>dice which can be easily made the subject of experi­
<lb/>ment. A child may be allowed to find out for him­
<lb/>self that boiling water will scald his fingers, and mus­
<lb/>tard bite his tongue; but he must be <emph>prejudiced</emph>
<lb/>against ratsbane, because the experiment would be
<lb/>too costly. In like manner it may do him good to
<lb/>have experienced that little instances of inattention or
<lb/>perverseness draw upon him the displeasure of his
<lb/>parent; but that profligacy is attended with loss of
<lb/>character, is a truth one would rather wish him to
<lb/>take upon trust.</p>
          <p>There is no occasion to inculcate by prejudices
<lb/>those truths which it is of no importance for us to
<lb/>know, till our powers are able to investigate them.
<lb/>Thus the metaphysical questions of space and time,
<lb/>necessity and free-will, and a thousand others, may
<lb/>safely be left for that age which delights in such dis­
<lb/>cussions. They have no connexion with conduct;
<lb/>and none have any business with them at all, but those
<lb/>who are able by such studies to exercise and sharpen
<lb/>their mental powers: but it is not so with those truths
<lb/>on which our well-being depends; these must be
<lb/>taught to all, not only before they can reason upon
<lb/>them, but independently of the consideration whether
<lb/>they will ever be able to reason upon them as long as
<lb/>they live. What has hitherto been said, relates only
<lb/>to instilling prejudices into <emph>others</emph>; how far a man
is
<lb/>to allow them in himself, or, as a celebrated writer
<lb/>expresses it, to <emph>cherish</emph> them, is a different
question, on
<lb/>which perhaps I may some time offer my thoughts.<anchor xml:id="na4" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n4"/>
<lb/>In the mean time I cannot help concluding, that to
<lb/>reject the influence of prejudice in education is itself
<lb/>one of the most unreasonable of prejudices.</p>

<lb/>I will tell you the truth. When I was young, my
<lb/>mother (as arrant a gossip as ever breathed) related
<lb/>to me a great number of stories: and as in those days
<lb/>people could not read or write, I had no better au­
<lb/>thority for what I recorded: but after letters were
<lb/>found out, and now since the noble invention of print­
<lb/>ing,—why do you think, <persName>Mercury</persName>, any
one would
<lb/>dare to tell lies in print?</p>
          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Mercury.</persName></label> Sometimes perhaps. I have seen a
<lb/>splendid victory in the gazette of one country dwindle
<lb/>into an honourable retreat in that of another.</p>
          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Clio.</persName></label> In newspapers, very possibly: but with re­
<lb/>gard to myself, when I have time to consider and lay
<lb/>things together, I assure you, you may depend upon
<lb/>me.—Whom have we in that group which I see in­
<lb/>distinctly in a sort of twilight?</p>
          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Mercury.</persName></label> Very renowned personages; <persName>Ninus</persName>,

          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Clio.</persName></label> Most assuredly not. Yet I must inform
<lb/>you that a name higher than either of yours, and a

<lb/>least suspicion.</p>
          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Mercury.</persName></label> I see approaching a person of a noble

<persName>Mercury</persName>,
<lb/>I cannot stand the fatigue I undergo, much longer. I
<lb/>am not provided, as you very well know, with either
<lb/>chariot or wings, and I am expected to be in all parts
<lb/>of the globe at once. In the good old times my busi­
<lb/>ness lay almost entirely between the
<placeName>Hellespont</placeName> and
<lb/>the <placeName>Pillars of Hercules</placeName>, with sometimes an excursion
<lb/>to the mouths (then seven) of the <placeName>Nile</placeName>, or
the banks
<lb/>of the <placeName>Euphrates</placeName>. But now I am required to
be in a
<lb/>hundred places at once; I am called from
<placeName>Jena</placeName> to
<lb/><placeName>Austerlitz</placeName>, from <placeName>Cape
Trafalgar</placeName> to <placeName>Aboukir</placeName>, and from
<lb/>the <placeName>Thames</placeName> to the

          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Mercury.</persName></label> Truly I believe so; I am afraid the old

          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Clio.</persName></label> I am puzzled at this moment how to give

          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Mercury.</persName></label> How so?</p>
          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Clio.</persName></label> I do not know where to find them; they

<lb/>through the last half-century, except when now and
<lb/>then she dictated to a certain favourite nymph. <persName>Ura­
<lb/>nia</persName>, indeed, has employed herself with
<persName>Herschel</persName> in
<lb/>counting the stars; but her task is less than mine.
<lb/>Here am I expected to calculate how many hundred
<lb/>thousands of rational beings cut one another's throats
<lb/>at <placeName>Austerlitz</placeName>, and to take the tale of two
hundred and
<lb/>thirteen thousand human bodies and ninety-five thou­
<lb/>sand horses, that lie stiff, frozen and unburied on the

<lb/>this can be a pleasant employment?</p>
          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Mercury.</persName></label> I have had a great increase of employ­
<lb/>ment myself lately, on account of the multitude of

<lb/>used to have a holiday comparatively during the win­

<lb/>Son of <persName>Maia</persName>, I declare to you I am sick of
the hor­
<lb/>rors I record; I am sick of mankind. For above
<lb/>these three thousand years have I been warning them
<lb/>and reading lessons to them, and they will not mend:
<lb/><persName>Robespiere</persName> was as cruel as
<persName>Sylla</persName>, and <persName>Napoleon</persName> has
<lb/>no more moderation than <persName>Pyrrhus</persName>. The human
<lb/>frame, of curious texture, delicately formed, feeling,
<lb/>and irritable by the least annoyance, with face erect
<lb/>and animated with Promethean fire, they wound, they
<lb/>lacerate, they mutilate with most perverted ingenuity.
<lb/>I will go and record the actions of the tigers of <placeName>Afri­
<lb/>ca</placeName>; in them such fierceness is natural—Nay,
the hu­
<lb/>man race will be exterminated, if this work of destruc­
<lb/>tion goes on much longer.</p>

<lb/>set your heart at rest. A great philosopher has late­
<lb/>ly discovered that the world is in imminent danger of
<lb/>being over-peopled, and that if twenty or forty thou­
<lb/>sand men could not be persuaded every now and then
<lb/>to stand and be shot at, we should be forced to eat one
<lb/>another. This discovery has had a wonderful effect
<lb/>in quieting tender consciences. The calculation is
<lb/>very simple, any schoolboy will explain it to you.</p>
          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Clio.</persName></label> O what a number of fertile plains and green
<lb/>savannahs, and tracts covered with trees of beautiful

<lb/>steps! My friend <persName>Swift's</persName> project of eating children
<lb/>was not so cruel as these bloody and lavish sacrifices
<lb/>to <persName>Mars</persName>, the most savage of all the gods.</p>
          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Mercury.</persName></label> You forget yourself, <persName>Clio</persName>;
<persName>Mars</persName> is not

<lb/>bloody and torn banners, with martial music and mili­
<lb/>tary procession, brought into the temple,—and whose
<lb/>temple, thinkest thou? and to whom have thanks
<lb/>been given on both sides, amidst smoking towns and
<lb/>wasted fields, after the destruction of man and devas­
<lb/>tation of the fair face of nature!—And
<persName>Mercury</persName>, god

          <p><label type="speaker" rend="post(—)slant(italic)"><persName>Mercury.</persName></label> I am afraid men will always love

<persName>Jupiter</persName>, descended
<lb/>from the skies to visit man. She found him naked
<lb/>and helpless, living on the spontaneous fruits of the
<lb/>earth, and little superior to the ox that grazed beside
<lb/>him. She clothed and fed him; she built him pala­
<lb/>ces; she showed him the hidden riches of the earth,
<lb/>and pointed with her finger the course of the stars as
<lb/>they rose and set in the horizon. Man became rich
<lb/>with her gifts and accomplished from her conversa­
<lb/>tion. In process of time Knowledge became acquaint­
<lb/>ed with the schools of the philosophers; and being
<lb/>much taken with their theories and their conversation,
<lb/>she married one of them. They had many beautiful
<lb/>and healthy children; but among the rest was a
<lb/>daughter of a different complexion from all the rest,
<lb/>whose name was Doubt. She grew up under many
<lb/>disadvantages; she had a great hesitation in her
<lb/>speech; a cast in her eye, which, however, was keen
<lb/>and piercing; and was subject to nervous tremblings.
<lb/>Her mother saw her with dislike: but her father,
<lb/>who was of the sect of the <name>Pyrrhonists</name>, cherished and
<lb/>taught her logic, in which she made a great progress.
<lb/><name>The Muse of History</name> was much troubled with her in­
<lb/>trusions: she would tear out whole leaves, and blot
<lb/>over many pages of her favourite works. With the
<lb/>divines her depredations were still worse: she was
<lb/>forbidden to enter a church; notwithstanding which,

<pb n="237"/>
<milestone n="20(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">237</mw>
<lb/>she would slip in under the surplice, and spend her
<lb/>time in making mouths at the priest. If she got at a
<lb/>library, she destroyed or blotted over the most valua­
<lb/>ble manuscripts. A most undutiful child; she was
<lb/>never better pleased than when she could unexpect­
<lb/>edly trip up her mother's heels, or expose a rent or
<lb/>an unseemly patch in her flowing and ample garment.
<lb/>With mathematicians she never meddled; but in all
<lb/>other systems of knowledge she intruded herself, and
<lb/>her breath diffused a mist over the page which often
<lb/>left it scarcely legible. Her mother at length said to
<lb/>her, <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">Thou art my child, and I
know it is decreed
<lb/>that while I tread this earth thou must accompany my
<lb/>footsteps; but thou art mortal, I am immortal; and
<lb/>there will come a time when I shall be freed from
<lb/>thy intrusion, and shall pursue my glorious track from
<lb/>star to star, and from system to system, without im­
<lb/>pediment and without check.</said></p>

          <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
          <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Had</hi> the question of yesterday been
decided in a
<lb/>manner more favourable to our wishes, which how­
<lb/>ever the previous intimations of your temper in the
<lb/>business left us little room to expect, we should have
<lb/>addressed our thanks to you on the occasion. As it
<lb/>is, we address to you our thanks for much casual 
<lb/>light thrown upon the subject, and for many incidental
<lb/>testimonies of your esteem (whether voluntary or in­
<lb/>voluntary we will not stop to examine) which in the
<lb/>course of this discussion you have favoured us with.
<lb/>We thank you for the compliment paid the dissenters,
<lb/>when you suppose that the moment they are eligible
<lb/>to places of power and profit, all such places will at
<lb/>once be filled with them. Not content with confound­
<lb/>ing, by an artful sophism, the right of eligibility with
<lb/>the right to offices, you again confound that right with
<lb/>the probable fact, and then argue accordingly. Is
<lb/>the <name>Test Act</name>, your boasted bulwark, of equal neces­
<lb/>sity with the dykes in <placeName>Holland</placeName>; and do we
wait, like
<lb/>an impetuous sea, to rush in and overwhelm the land?

<lb/>Our pretensions, gentlemen, are far humbler. We
<lb/>had not the presumption to imagine that, inconsidera­
<lb/>ble as we are in numbers, compared to the established
<lb/>church; inferior too in fortune and influence; labour­
<lb/>ing, as we do, under the frown of the court, and the
<lb/>anathema of the orthodox; we should make our way
<lb/>so readily into the secret recesses of royal favour;
<lb/>and of a sudden, like the frogs of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, swarm
<lb/>about your barns, and under your canopies, and in
<lb/>your kneeding troughs, and in the chamber of the
<lb/>king. We rather wished this act as the removal of a
<lb/>stigma than the possession of a certain advantage, and
<lb/>we might have been cheaply pleased with the ac­
<lb/>knowledgement of the right, though we had never
<lb/>been fortunate enough to enjoy the emolument.</p>
          <p>Another compliment for which we offer our ac­
<lb/>knowledgments, may be extracted from the great fer­
<lb/>ment which has been raised by this business all over
<lb/>the country. What stir and movement it has occa­
<lb/>sioned among the different orders of men! How
<lb/>quick the alarm has been taken, and sounded from
<lb/>the church to the senate, and from the press to the
<lb/>people; while fears and forebodings were communi­
<lb/>cated like an electric shock! The old cry of <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">The
<lb/>church is in danger</quote> has again been made to vibrate
<lb/>in our ears. Here too, if we gave way to impressions
<lb/>of vanity, we might suppose ourselves of much greater
<lb/>importance in the political scale than our numbers and
<lb/>situation seem to indicate. It shows, at least, we are
<lb/>feared, which to some minds would be the next grate­
<lb/>ful thing to being beloved. We, indeed, should only
<lb/>wish for the latter; nor should we have ventured to
<lb/>suppose, but from the information you have given us,
<lb/>that your Church <emph>was</emph> so weak. What! fenced and
<lb/>guarded as she is with her exclusive privileges and
<lb/>rich emoluments, stately with her learned halls and

<pb n="243"/>
<milestone n="21(2)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">243</mw>

<lb/>endowed colleges, with  all the attraction of her wealth,
<lb/>and the thunder of her censures; all that the orator
<lb/>calls <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">the majesty of the
church</quote> about her,—and
<lb/>does she, resting in security under the broad buckler
<lb/>of the state, does she tremble at the naked and un­
<lb/>armed sectary? him, whose early connexions and
<lb/>phrase uncouth, and unpopular opinions, set him at dis­
<lb/>tance from the means of advancement; him, who in
<lb/>the intercourses of neighbourhood and common life,
<lb/>like new settlers, finds it necessary to clear the ground
<lb/>before him, and is ever obliged to root up a prejudice
<lb/>before he can plant affection? He is not of the
<lb/>world, gentlemen; and the world loveth her own. All
<lb/>that distinguishes him from other men to common ob­
<lb/>servation, operates in his disfavour. His very advo­
<lb/>cates, while they plead his cause, are ready to blush
<lb/>for their client; and in justice to their own character,
<lb/>think it necessary to disclaim all knowledge of his
<lb/>obscure tenets. And is it from his hand you expect
<lb/>the demolition of so massy an edifice? Does the
<lb/>simple removal of the <name>Test Act</name> involve its destruc­
<lb/>tion? These were not our thoughts. We had too
<lb/>much reverence for your establishment to imagine
<lb/>that the structure was so loosely put together, or so
<lb/>much shaken by years, as that the removal of so slight
<lb/>a pin should endanger the whole fabrick—or is the
<lb/><name>Test Act</name> the talisman which holds it together, that,
<lb/>when it is broken, the whole must fall to pieces like
<lb/>the magic palace of an enchanter? Surely no spe­
<lb/>cies of regular architecture can depend upon so slight
<lb/>a support.—After all what is it we have asked?—to
<lb/>share in the rich benefices of the established church?
<lb/>to have the gates of her schools and universities
<lb/>thrown open to us? No: let her keep her golden
<lb/>prebends, her scarfs, her lawn, her mitres. Let
<lb/>her dignitaries be still associated to the honours of

<pb n="244"/>
<milestone n="21(2)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">244</mw>

<lb/>legislation; and in our courts of executive justice, let
<lb/>her inquisitorial tribunals continue to thwart the spirit
<lb/>of a free constitution by a heterogeneous mixture of
<lb/>priestly jurisdiction. Let her still gather into barns,
<lb/>though she neither sows nor reaps. We desire not to
<lb/>share in her good things. We know it is the child­
<lb/>ren's bread, which must not be given to dogs. But
<lb/>having these good things, we could wish to hear her
<lb/>say with the generous spirit of <persName>Esau</persName>, <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">I have
<lb/>enough, my brother.</quote> We could wish to be consid­
<lb/>ered as children of the state, though we are not so
<lb/>of the church. She must excuse us if we look upon
<lb/>the alliance between her and the state as an ill-assorted
<lb/>union, and herself as a mother-in-law, who with the
<lb/>too frequent arts of that relation, is ever endeavouring
<lb/>to prejudice the state, the common father of us all,
<lb/>against a part of his offspring, for the sake of appro­
<lb/>priating a larger portion to her own children. We
<lb/>claim no share in the dowry of her who is not our
<lb/>mother, but we may be pardoned for thinking it hard
<lb/>to be deprived of the inheritance of our father.</p>
          <p>But it is objected to us that we have sinned in the
<lb/>manner of making our request, we have brought it
<lb/>forward as a claim instead of asking it as a favour.
<lb/>We should have sued, and crept, and humbled our­
<lb/>selves. Our preachers and our writers should not
<lb/>have dared to express the warm glow of honest senti­
<lb/>ment, or even in a foreign country glance at the
<lb/>downfall of a haughty aristocracy. As we were sup­
<lb/>pliants, we should have behaved like suppliants, and
<lb/>then perhaps—No, gentlemen, we wish to have it
<lb/>understood that we <emph>do</emph> claim it as a right. It loses
<lb/>otherwise half its value. We claim it as men, we
<lb/>claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects. We
<lb/>are not conscious of having brought the disqualifica­
<lb/>tion upon ourselves by a failure in any of these char­
<lb/>acters.</p>

          <mw type="pageNum">245</mw>
          <p>But we already enjoy a complete toleration—It is
<lb/>time, so near the end of the eighteenth century, it is
<lb/>surely time to speak with precision, and to call things
<lb/>by their proper names. What you call toleration,
<lb/>we call the exercise of a natural and inalienable
<lb/>right. We do not conceive it to be toleration, first
<lb/>to strip a man of all his dearest rights, and then to
<lb/>give him back a part; or even if it were the whole.
<lb/>You tolerate us in worshipping God according to
<lb/>our consciences—and why not tolerate a man in the
<lb/>use of his limbs, in the disposal of his private pro­
<lb/>perty, the contracting his domestic engagements, or
<lb/>any other the most acknowledged privileges of hu­
<lb/>manity? It is not to these things that the word tolera­
<lb/><choice><sic>a</sic><corr/></choice>tion is applied with propriety. It is applied, 
where
<lb/>from lenity or prudence we forbear doing all which in
<lb/>justice we might do. It is the bearing with what is
<lb/>confessedly an evil, for the sake of some good with
<lb/>which it is connected. It is the christian virtue of
<lb/>long-suffering; it is the political virtue of adapting
<lb/>measures to times and seasons and situations. Abuses
<lb/>are tolerated, when they are so interwoven with
<lb/>the texture of the piece, that the operation of remov­
<lb/>ing them becomes too delicate and hazardous. Un­
<lb/>just claims are tolerated, when they are complied with
<lb/>for the sake of peace and conscience. The failings
<lb/>and imperfections of those characters in which there
<lb/>appears an evident preponderancy of virtue, are toler­
<lb/>ated. These are the proper objects of toleration,
<lb/>these exercise the patience of the <name>christian</name> and the pru­
<lb/>dence of the statesman; but if there be a power that
<lb/>advances pretensions which we think unfounded in
<lb/>reason or scripture, that exercises an empire within
<lb/>an empire, and claims submission from those naturally
<lb/>her equals; and if we, from a spirit of brotherly
<lb/>charity, and just deference to public opinion, and a

<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">21*</mw>
<pb n="246"/>
<milestone n="21(3)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">246</mw>

<lb/>salutary dread of innovation, acquiesce in these pre­
<lb/>tensions; let her at least be told that the virtue of for­
<lb/>bearance should be transferred, and that it is we who
<lb/>tolerate her, and not she who tolerates us.</p>
          <p>But this, it is again imputed to us, is no contest for
<lb/>religious liberty, but a contest for power, and place,
<lb/>and influence. We want civil offices—And why
<lb/>should citizens <emph>not</emph> aspire to civil offices? Why
<lb/>should not the fair field of generous competition be
<lb/>freely opened to every one? A contention for power
<lb/>—It is not a contention for power  between churchmen
<lb/>and dissenters, nor is it as dissenters we wish to enter
<lb/>the lists; we wish to bury every name of distinction
<lb/>in the common appellation of citizen. We wish not
<lb/>the name of dissenter to be pronounced, except in our
<lb/>theological researches  and religious assemblies. It is
<lb/>you, who by considering us as aliens, make us so. It
<lb/>is you who force us to make our dissent a prominent
<lb/>feature in our character. It is you who give relief,
<lb/>and cause to come out upon the canvass, what we
<lb/>modestly wished to have shaded over, and thrown into
<lb/>the back-ground. If we are a party, remember it is
<lb/>you who force us to be so. We should have sought
<lb/>places of trust—by no unfair, unconstitutional meth­
<lb/>ods should we have sought them, but in the open
<lb/>and honourable rivalship of virtuous emulation; by
<lb/>trying to deserve well of our king and our country.
<lb/>Our attachment to both is well known.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, however, we have all this while mistaken
<lb/>the matter, and what we have taken for bigotry and a
<lb/>narrow-minded spirit is after all only an affair of cal­
<lb/>culation and arithmetic. Our fellow subjects remem­
<lb/>ber the homely proverb, <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">the fewer the better cheer,</quote>
<lb/>and, very naturally, are glad to see the number of
<lb/>candidates lessened for the advantages they are them­
<lb/>selves striving after. If so, we ask their excuse, their

<pb n="247"/>
<milestone n="21(4)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">247</mw>

<lb/>conduct is quite simple; and if, from the number of
<lb/>concurrents, government were to strike out all above
<lb/>or under five feet high, or all whose birthdays happen­
<lb/>ed before the summer solstice, or, by any other mode
<lb/>of distinction equally arbitrary and whimsical, were
<lb/>to reduce the number of their rivals, they would be
<lb/>equally pleased, and equally unwilling to admit an al­
<lb/>teration. We are a mercantile people, accustomed to 
<lb/>consider chances, and we can easily perceive that in
<lb/>the lottery of life, if a certain proportion are by some
<lb/>means or other excluded from a prize, the adventure
<lb/>is exactly so much the better for the remainder. If
<lb/>this indeed be the case, as I suspect it may, we have
<lb/>been accusing you wrongfully. Your conduct is
<lb/>founded upon principles as sure and unvarying as
<lb/>mathematical truths; and all further discussion is need­
<lb/>less. We drop the argument at once. Men have now
<lb/>and then been reasoned out of their prejudices, but it
<lb/>were a hopeless attempt to reason them out of their
<lb/>interest.</p>
          <p>We likewise beg leave to apologize to those of the
<lb/>clergy whom we have unwillingly offended by endeav­
<lb/>ouring to include them as parties in our cause.
<lb/><quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">Pricked to it by foolish
honesty and love,</quote> we
<lb/>thought that what appeared so grievous to us, could
<lb/>not be very pleasant to them: but we are convinced
<lb/>of our mistake, and sorry for our officiousness. We 
<lb/>own it, sirs, it was a fond imagination that because we
<lb/>should have felt uneasy under the obligation imposed
<lb/>upon you, it should have the same effect upon your­
<lb/>selves. It was weak to impute to you an idle delicacy
<lb/>of conscience, which perhaps can only be preserved
<lb/>at a distance from the splendid scenes which you
<lb/>have continually in prospect. But you will pardon
<lb/>us. We did not consider the force of early discipline
<lb/>over the mind. We are not accustomed to those sal­

<pb n="248"/>
<milestone n="21(4)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">248</mw>

<lb/>vos, and glosses, and accomodating modes of rea­
<lb/>soning with which you have long been familiarized.
<lb/>You have the happy art of making easy to yourselves
<lb/>greater things than this. You are regularly disciplin­
<lb/>ed troops, and understand every nice manœuvre and
<lb/>dexterous evolution which the nature of the ground
<lb/>may require. We are like an unbroken horse; hard-
<lb/>mouthed, and apt to start at shadows, Our conduct
<lb/>towards you in this particular, we acknowledge may
<lb/>fairly provoke a smile at our simplicity. Besides,
<lb/>upon reflection, what should you startle at? The
<lb/>mixture of secular and religious concerns cannot to
<lb/>you appear extraordinary; and in truth nothing is
<lb/>more reasonable than that, as the state has been
<lb/>drawn in to the aggrandizement of your church, your
<lb/>church should in return make itself subservient to the
<lb/>convenience of the state. If we are wise, we shall
<lb/>never again make ourselves uneasy about your share
<lb/>of the grievance.</p>
          <p>But we were enumerating our obligations to you,
<lb/>gentlemen, who have thwarted our request; and we
<lb/>must take the liberty to inform you that if it be any
<lb/>object of our ambition to exist and attract notice as a
<lb/>separate body, you have done us the greatest service
<lb/>in the world. What we desired, by blending us with
<lb/>the common mass of citizens, would have sunk our
<lb/>relative importance, and consigned our discussions to
<lb/>oblivion. You have refused us; and by so doing,
<lb/>you keep us under the eye of the public, in the in­
<lb/>teresting point of view, of men who suffer under a
<lb/>deprivation of their rights. You have set a mark of
<lb/>separation upon us, and it is not in our power to take
<lb/>it off; but it is in our power to determine whether it
<lb/>shall be a disgraceful stigma or an honourable distinc­
<lb/>tion. If, by the continued peaceableness of our de­
<lb/>meanour, and by the superior sobriety of our conversa­

<pb n="249"/>
<milestone n="21(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">249</mw>

<lb/>tion,—a sobriety for which we have not yet quite
<lb/>ceased to be distinguished; if, by our attention to
<lb/>literature, and that ardent love of liberty which you
<lb/>are pretty ready to allow us, we deserve esteem, we
<lb/>shall enjoy it. If our rising seminaries should excel
<lb/>in wholesome discipline and regularity, if they should
<lb/>be schools of morality, and yours, unhappily should 
<lb/>be corrupted into schools of immorality, you will en­
<lb/>trust us with the education of your youth, when the
<lb/>parent, trembling at the profligacy of the times, wishes
<lb/>to preserve the blooming and ingenuous child from
<lb/>the degrading taint of early licentiousness. If our
<lb/>writers are solid, elegant, or nervous, you will read
<lb/>our books and imbibe our sentiments, and even
<lb/>your preachers will not disdain, occasionally, to <emph>illlus­
<lb/>trate</emph> our morality. If we enlighten the world by
<lb/>philosophical discoveries, you will pay the involuntary
<lb/>homage due to genius, and boast of our names when,
<lb/>amongst foreign societies, you are inclined to do cre­
<lb/>dit to your country. If your restraints operate to­
<lb/>wards keeping us in that middle rank of life where
<lb/>industry and virtue most abound, we shall have the
<lb/>honour to count ourselves among that class of the
<lb/>community which has ever been the source of manners,
<lb/>of population, and of wealth. If we seek for fortune
<lb/>in that track which you have left most open to us, we
<lb/>shall increase your commercial importance. If, in
<lb/>short, we render ourselves worthy of respect, you cannot
<lb/>hinder us from being respected—you cannot help re­
<lb/>specting us—and in spite of all names of opprobrious
<lb/>separation, we shall be bound together by mutual es­
<lb/>teem and the mutual reciprocation of good offices.</p>
          <p>One good office we shall most probably do you is
<lb/>rather an invidious one, and seldom meets with
<lb/>thanks. By laying us under such a marked disquali­
<lb/>fication, you have rendered us—we hope not uncan­

<pb n="250"/>
<milestone n="21(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">250</mw>

<lb/>did—we hope not disaffected—May the God of love
<lb/>and charity preserve us from all such acrimonious
<lb/>dispositions! But you certainly have, as far as in you
<lb/>lies, rendered us quick-sighted to encroachment and
<lb/>abuses of all kinds. We have the feelings of men;
<lb/>and though we should be very blameable to suffer
<lb/>ourselves to be biassed by any private hardships, and
<lb/>hope that, as a body, we never shall, yet this you will
<lb/>consider, that we have at least no bias on the other
<lb/>side. We have no favours to blind us, no golden
<lb/>padlock on our tongues, and therefore it is probable
<lb/>enough, that, if cause is given, we shall cry aloud
<lb/>and spare not. But in this you have done yourselves
<lb/>no disservice. It is perfectly agreeable to the jealous
<lb/>spirit of a free constitution, that there should be some
<lb/>who will season the mass with the wholesome spirit of
<lb/>opposition. Without a little of that bitter leaven, there
<lb/>is great danger of its being corrupted</p>
          <p>With regard to ourselves, you have by your late
<lb/>determination given perhaps a salutary, perhaps a
<lb/>seasonable check to that spirit of worldliness, which of
<lb/>late has gained but too much ground amongst us.
<lb/>Before you—before the world—we have a right to
<lb/>bear the brow erect, to talk of rights and services;
<lb/>but there is a place and a presence where it will be­
<lb/>come us to make no boast. We, as well as you, are
<lb/>infected. We, as well as you, have breathed in the
<lb/>universal contagion: a contagion more noxious, and
<lb/>more difficult to escape, than that which on the plains
<lb/>of <placeName>Cherson</placeName> has just swept from the world
the martyr
<lb/>of humanity. The contagion of selfish indifference
<lb/>and fashionable manners has seized us; and our lan­
<lb/>guishing virtue feels the debilitating influence. If you
<lb/>were more conversant in our assemblies than your
<lb/>prejudices will permit you to be, you would see in­
<lb/>difference, where you fancy there is an over propor­

<pb n="251"/>
<milestone n="21(6)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">251</mw>

<lb/>tion of zeal: you would see principles giving way,
<lb/>and families melting into the bosom of the church
<lb/>under the warm influence of prosperity. You would
<lb/>see that establishments, without calling coercive meas­
<lb/>ures to their aid, possess attraction enough severely
<lb/>to try the virtue and steadiness of those who separate
<lb/>from them. You need not strew thorns, or put bars
<lb/>across our path; your golden apples are sufficient to
<lb/>make us turn out of the way. Believe me, gentle­
<lb/>men, you do not know us sufficiently to aim your
<lb/>censure where we should be most vulnerable.</p>
          <p>Nor need you apprehend from us the slightest dan­
<lb/>ger to your own establishment. If you will needs
<lb/>have it that it is in danger, we wish you to be aware
<lb/>that the danger arises from among yourselves. If
<lb/>ever your creeds and formularies become as grievous
<lb/>to the generality of your clergy as they already are to
<lb/>many delicate and thinking minds amongst them; if
<lb/>ever any material articles of your professed belief
<lb/>should be generally disbelieved, or that order which
<lb/>has been accustomed to supply faithful pastors and
<lb/>learned inquirers after truth, should become a burden
<lb/>upon a generous public, the cry for reformation would
<lb/>then be loud and prevailing. It would be heard.
<lb/>Doctrines which will not stand the test of argument
<lb/>and reason, will not always be believed; and when
<lb/>they have ceased to be generally believed, they will
<lb/>not long be articles of belief. If, therefore, there is
<lb/>any weak place in your system, any thing which you
<lb/>are obliged to gloss over and touch with a tender hand,
<lb/>any thing which shrinks at investigation—look ye to it,
<lb/>its extinction is not far off. Doubts and difficulties,
<lb/>that arise first amongst the learned, will not stop there;
<lb/>they inevitably spread downwards from class to class:
<lb/>and if the people should ever find that your articles
<lb/>are generally subscribed as articles of peace, they will

<pb n="252"/>
<milestone n="21(6)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">252</mw>

<lb/>be apt to remember that they are articles of expense
<lb/>too. If all the dissenters in the kingdom, still believ­
<lb/>ing, as dissenters do, were this moment, in order to
<lb/>avoid the reproach of schism, to enter the pale of your
<lb/>church, they would do you mischief; they would
<lb/>hasten its decline: and if all who in their hearts
<lb/>dissent from your professions of faith, were to cease
<lb/>making them, and throw themselves amongst the dis­
<lb/>senters, you would stand the firmer for it. Your
<lb/>church is in no danger because we are of a different
<lb/>church; they might stand together to the end of time
<lb/>without interference: but it will be in great danger
<lb/>whenever it has within itself many who have thrown 
<lb/>aside its doctrines, or even, who do not embrace them
<lb/>in the simple and obvious sense. All the power and
<lb/>policy of man cannot continue a system long after its
<lb/>truth has ceased to be acknowledged, or an establish­
<lb/>ment long after it has ceased to contribute to utility.
<lb/>It is equally vain as to expect to preserve a tree whose
<lb/>roots are cut away. It may look as green and flour­
<lb/>ishing as before for a short time; but its sentence is
<lb/>passed its principle of life is gone, and death is already
<lb/>within it. If then you think the church in danger, be
<lb/>not backward to preserve the sound part by sacrificing
<lb/>the decayed.</p>
          <p>To return to ourselves and our feelings on the
<lb/>business lately in agitation—You will excuse us if we
<lb/>do not appear with the air of men baffled and disap­
<lb/>pointed. Neither do we blush at our defeat;—we 
<lb/>may blush, indeed, but it is for our country: but we
<lb/>lay hold on the consoling persuasion, that reason, truth
<lb/>and liberality must finally prevail. We appeal from
<lb/><persName>Philip</persName> intoxicated to <persName>Philip</persName> sober. We
know you
<lb/>will refuse us while you are narrow-minded, but you
<lb/>will not always be narrow-minded. You have too
<lb/>much light and candour not to have more. We will

<pb n="253"/>
<milestone n="22(1)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">253</mw>

<lb/>no more attempt to pluck the green unripe fruit. We
<lb/>see in you our future friends and brethren, eager to
<lb/>confound and blend with ours your interests and your
<lb/>affections. You will grant us all we ask. The only
<lb/>question between us is, whether you will do it today;
<lb/>tomorrow you certainly will. You will even entreat
<lb/>us, if need were, to allow you to remove from your
<lb/>country the stigma of illiberality. We appeal to the
<lb/>certain, sure operation of increasing light and knowl­
<lb/>edge, which it is no more in your power to stop, than
<lb/>to repel the tide with your naked hand, or to wither
<lb/>with your breath the genial influence of vegetation.
<lb/>The spread of that light is, in general, gradual and
<lb/>imperceptible; but there are periods when its progress

<lb/>they swell and heave beneath oppression, as the seas

<lb/>what, but an instant before, seemed so firm,—spread
<lb/>for many a dreary league like a floor of solid marble,
<lb/>at once with a tremendous noise gives way, long fis­
<lb/>sures spread in every direction, and the air resounds
<lb/>with the clash of floating fragments, which every hour
<lb/>are broken from the mass. The genius of Philosophy

<lb/>gather, and swell into a tempest; the spirit of Inquiry,
<lb/>like a severe and searching wind, penetrates every
<lb/>part of the great body politic; and whatever is un­
<lb/>sound, whatever is infirm, shrinks at the visitation.
<lb/>Liberty, here with the lifted crosier in her hand, and
<lb/>the crucifix conspicuous on her breast; there, led by
<lb/>Philosophy, and crowned with the civic wreath, an­
<lb/>imates men to assert their long-forgotten rights. With
<lb/>a policy, far more liberal and comprehensive than the

<placeName>Rome</placeName>, she
<lb/>diffuses her blessings to every class of men; and even
<lb/>extends a smile of hope and promise to the poor
<lb/><name>African</name>, the victim of hard, impenetrable avarice.
<lb/>Man, as man, becomes an object of respect. Tenets
<lb/>are transferred from theory to practice. The glowing
<lb/>sentiment and the lofty speculation no longer serve
<lb/><quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">but to adorn the pages of
a book;</quote> they are brought
<lb/>home to men's business and bosoms; and, what some
<lb/>centuries ago it was daring but to think, and danger­
<lb/>ous to express, is now realized and carried into effect.
<lb/>Systems are analyzed into their first principles, and
<lb/>principles are fairly pursued to their legitimate con­
<lb/>sequences. The enemies of reformation, who palliate
<lb/>what they cannot defend, and defer what they dare
<lb/>not refuse; who, with <persName>Festus</persName>, put off to a

<lb/>venient season what, only because it is the present
<lb/>season, is inconvenient, stand aghast, and find they have
<lb/>no power to put back the important hour, when nature
<lb/>is labouring with the birth of great events. Can ye
<lb/>not discern—But you do discern these signs; you
<lb/>discern them well and your alarm is apparent. You
<lb/>see a mighty empire breaking from bondage, and
<lb/>exerting the energies of recovered freedom: and

being the as
<lb/>sertor of liberty and refuge of the oppressed—<placeName>England</placeName>,

<lb/>who with generous and respectful sympathy, in times
<lb/>not far remote from our own memory, afforded an
<lb/>asylum to so many of the subjects of that very empire,
<lb/>when crushed beneath the iron rod of persecution;
<lb/>and, by so doing, circulated a livelier abhorrence of
<lb/>tyranny within her own veins—
<placeName>England</placeName>, who has
<lb/>long reproached her with being a slave, now censures 
<lb/>her for daring to be free. <placeName>England</placeName>, who has
held the
<lb/>torch to her, is mortified to see it blaze brighter in her
<lb/>hands. <placeName>England</placeName>, for whom, and for whose manners
<lb/>and habits of thinking, that empire has, for some time
<lb/>past, felt even an enthusiastic predilection; and to
<lb/>whom, as a model of laws and government, she looks
<lb/>up with affectionate reverence—
<placeName>England</placeName>, nursed at
<lb/>the breast of liberty, and breathing the purest spirit of
<lb/>enlightened philosophy, views a sister nation with
<lb/>affected scorn and real jealousy, and presumes to ask
<lb/>whether she yet exists:—Yes, all of her exists that is
<lb/>worthy to do so. Her dungeons indeed exist no longer,
<lb/>the iron doors are forced, the massy walls are thrown
<lb/>down; and the liberated spectres, trembling between
<lb/>joy and horror, may now blazon the infernal secrets
<lb/>of their prison-house. Her cloistered monks no long­
<lb/>er exist, nor does the soft heart of sensibility beat be­
<lb/>hind the grate of a convent; but the best affections of
<lb/>the human mind, permitted to flow in their natural
<lb/>channel, diffuse their friendly influence over the
<lb/>brightening prospect of domestic happiness. Nobles,
<lb/>the creatures of kings, exist there no longer: but man,
<lb/>the creature of God, exists there. Millions of men
<lb/>exist there, who only now truly begin to exist, and
<lb/>hail with shouts of grateful acclamation the better
<lb/>birthday of their country. Go on, generous nation,
<lb/>set the world an example of virtues as you have of
<lb/>talents. Be our model, as we have been yours.
<lb/>May the spirit of wisdom, the spirit of moderation, the

<lb/>Overcome our wayward perverseness by your stead­
<lb/>iness and temper. Silence the scoffs of your enemies,
<lb/>and the misgiving fears of your timorous well-wishers.
<lb/>Go on to destroy the empire of prejudices, that empire
<lb/>of gigantic shadows, which are only formidable while
<lb/>they are not attacked. Cause to succeed to the mad
<lb/>ambition of conquest the peaceful industry of commerce,
<lb/>and the simple, useful toils of agriculture. Instructed
<lb/>by the experience of past centuries, and by many a
<lb/>sad and sanguine page in your own histories, may you
<lb/>no more attempt to blend what God has made separate;
<lb/>but may religion and civil polity, like the two necessary
<lb/>but opposite elements of fire and water, each in its
<lb/>province do service to mankind, but never again be forc­
<lb/>ed into discordant union. Let the wandering pilgrims
<lb/>of every tribe and complexion, who in other lands find
<lb/>only an asylum, find with you a country; and may you
<lb/>never seek other proof of the purity of your faith than
<lb/>the largeness of your charity. In your manners, your
<lb/>language, and habits of life, let a manly simplicity, be­
<lb/>coming the intercourse of equals with equals, take the
<lb/>place of overstrained refinement and adulation. Let
<lb/>public reformation prepare the way for private. May
<lb/>the abolition of domestic tyranny introduce the modest
<lb/>train of household virtues, and purer incense be burn­
<lb/>ed upon the hallowed altar of conjugal fidelity. Ex­
<lb/>hibit to the world the rare phenomenon of a patriot
<lb/>minister, of a philosophic senate. May a pure and
<lb/>perfect system of legislation proceed from their form­
<lb/>ing hands, free from those irregularities and abuses,
<lb/>the wear and tear of a constitution, which in a course
<lb/>of years are necessarily accumulated in the best-formed
<lb/>states; and like the new creation in its first gloss and

<lb/>its Maker blessed and called it good. May you never

<lb/>lose sight of the great principle you have held forth,—
<lb/>the natural equality of men. May you never forget
<lb/>that without public spirit there can be no liberty; that
<lb/>without virtue there may be a confederacy, but cannot
<lb/>be a community. May you, and may we, consigning

authority to separate,
<lb/>for religious purposes, this portion of our common
<lb/>time. The shops are shut: the artisan is summoned
<lb/>from his loom, and the husbandman from his plough;
<lb/>the whole nation, in the midst of its business, its pleas­
<lb/>ures, and its pursuits, makes a sudden stop, and wears
<lb/>the semblance, at least, of seriousness and concern. It
<lb/>is natural for you to inquire, What is the purport of
<lb/>all this?—the answer is in the words of my text:
<lb/><quote rend="pre(“)post(”)slant(italic)">Ye stand this 
day, all of you, before the face of the
<lb/>Lord.</quote>—<bibl><regMe><title>Deuteronomy</title>,
xxix. 10.</regMe></bibl> You stand all of
<lb/>you, that is, you stand here as a nation, and you stand
<lb/>for the declared purpose of confessing your sins, and
<lb/>humbling yourselves before the Supreme Being.</p>
          <p>Every individual, my brethren, who has a sense
<lb/>of religion, and a desire of conforming his conduct
<lb/>to its precepts, will frequently retire into himself to
<lb/>discover his faults; and having discovered, to repent
<lb/>of,—and having repented of, to amend them. Na­
<lb/>tions have likewise their faults to repent of, their con­
<lb/>duct to examine; and it is therefore no less becoming

<pb n="259"/>
<milestone n="22(4)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">259</mw>

<lb/>and salutary, that they, from time to time, should
<lb/>engage in the same duty. Those sins which we have
<lb/>to repent of as individuals, belong to such transactions
<lb/>as relate to our private concerns, and are executed
<lb/>by us in our private capacity; such as buying, selling,
<lb/>the management of our family economy, differences
<lb/>arising from jarring interests and interfering claims be­
<lb/>tween us and our neighbours, &amp;c. Those sins which,
<lb/>as a nation, we have to repent of, belong to national
<lb/>acts.</p>
          <p>We act as a nation, when, through the organ of the
<lb/>legislative power, which speaks the will of the nation,
<lb/>and by means of the executive power which does the
<lb/>will of the nation, we enact laws, form alliances, make
<lb/>war or peace, dispose of the public money, or do any
<lb/>of those things which belong to us in our collective
<lb/>capacity. As, comparatively, few individuals have
<lb/>any immediate share in these public acts, we might be
<lb/>tempted to forget the responsibility which attaches to
<lb/>the nation at large with regard to them, did not the
<lb/>wisdom and piety of the governing powers, by thus
<lb/>calling us together on every public emergency, remind
<lb/>us that they are all our own acts; and that, for every
<lb/>violation of integrity, justice, or humanity in public
<lb/>affairs, it is incumbent upon every one of us to humble
<lb/>himself personally before the tribunal of Almighty
<lb/>God.</p>
          <p>That this is the true and only rational interpretation
<lb/>of the solemnities of this day, is evident from hence,
<lb/>that we are never enjoined to confess the sins of other
<lb/>people; but our own sins. To take upon ourselves
<lb/>the faults of others, savours of presumption rather than
<lb/>humility. There would be an absurd mockery in
<lb/>pretending to humble ourselves before God for mis­
<lb/>deeds which we have neither committed, nor have any
<lb/>power to amend. Those evils which we could not help,

<pb n="260"/>
<milestone n="22(4)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">260</mw>

<lb/>and in which we have had no share, are subjects of
<lb/>grief indeed, but not of remorse. If an oppressive
<lb/>law, or a destructive war, were of the nature of a vol­
<lb/>cano or a hurricane, proceeding from causes totally
<lb/>independent of our operations,—all we should have
<lb/>to do would be to bow our heads in silent submission,
<lb/>and to bear their ravages with a manly patience. We
<lb/>do not repent of a dangerous disorder or a sickly con­
<lb/>stitution, because these are things which do not depend
<lb/>upon our own efforts. If, therefore, the nation at
<lb/>large had nothing to do in the affairs of the nation,
<lb/>the piety of our rulers would have led them to fast
<lb/>and pray by themselves alone, without inviting us to
<lb/>concur in this salutary work. But we are called upon
<lb/>to repent of national sins, because we can help them,
<lb/>and because we ought to help them. We are not
<lb/>fondly to imagine we can make of kings, or of law­
<lb/>givers, the scapegoats to answer for our follies and
<lb/>our crimes: by the services of this day they call upon
<lb/>us to answer for them; they throw the blame where
<lb/>it ought ultimately to rest; that is, where the power
<lb/>ultimately rests. It were trifling with our consciences
<lb/>to endeavour to separate the acts of governors sanction­
<lb/>ed by the nation, from the acts of the nation; for, in
<lb/>every transaction the principal is answerable for the
<lb/>conduct of the agents he employs to transact it. If
<lb/>the maxim that the king can do no wrong throws upon
<lb/>ministers the responsibility, because without ministers
<lb/>no wrong could be done, the same reason throws it
<lb/>from them upon the people, without whom ministers
<lb/>could do no wrong.</p>
          <p>The language of the Proclamation then may be
<lb/>thus interpreted:—People! who in your individual
<lb/>capacities are rich and poor, high and low, governors
<lb/>and governed, assemble yourselves in the unity of
<lb/>your public existence; rest from your ordinary occu­

<pb n="261"/>

<mw type="pageNum">261</mw>

<lb/>pations, give a different direction to the exercises of
<lb/>your public worship, confess—not every man his own
<lb/>sins, but all the sins of all. We, your appointed
<lb/>rulers, before we allow ourselves to go on in executing
<lb/>your will in a conjuncture so important, force you to
<lb/>make a pause, that you may be constrained to reflect,
<lb/>that you may bring this will, paramount to every thing
<lb/>else, into the sacred presence of God; that you may
<lb/>there examine it, and see whether it be agreeable to
<lb/>his will, and to the eternal obligations of virtue and
<lb/>good morals. If not, the guilt be upon your own
<lb/>heads; we disclaim the awful responsibility.</p>
          <p>Supposing that you are now prepared by proper
<lb/>views of the subject, I shall go on to investigate those
<lb/>sins which a nation is most apt to be betrayed into,
<lb/>leaving it to each of you to determine whether, and
<lb/>how far, any one of them ought to make a part of
<lb/>our humilation on this day.</p>
          <p>Societies being composed of individuals, the faults
<lb/>of societies proceed from the same bad passions, the
<lb/>same pride, selfishness, and thirst of gain, by which
<lb/>individuals are led to transgress the rules of duty;
<lb/>they require therefore the same curb to restrain them,
<lb/>and hence the necessity of a national religion. You
<lb/>will probably assert, that most nations have one: but,
<lb/>by a national religion, I do not mean the burning a
<lb/>few wretches twice or thrice a year in honour of
<lb/>God, nor yet the exacting subscription to some ob­
<lb/>scure tenets believed by few, and understood by
<lb/>none; nor yet the investing a certain order of men
<lb/>dressed in a particular habit, with civil privileges and
<lb/>secular emolument;—by national religion I under­
<lb/>stand, the extending to those affairs in which we act
<lb/>in common, and as a body, that regard to religion, by
<lb/>which, when we act singly, we all profess to be guid­
<lb/>ed. Nothing seems more obvious; and yet there are

<pb n="262"/>
<milestone n="22(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">262</mw>

<lb/>men who appear not insensible to the rules of morali­
<lb/>ty as they respect individuals, and who unaccountably
<lb/>disclaim them with respect to nations. They will not
<lb/>cheat their opposite neighbour, but they will take a
<lb/>pride in overreaching a neighbouring state; they
<lb/>would scorn to foment dissensions in the family of an
<lb/>acquaintance, but they will do so by a community
<lb/>without scruple; they would not join with a gang of
<lb/>housebreakers to plunder a private dwelling, but they
<lb/>have no principle which prevents them from joining
<lb/>with a confederacy of princes to plunder a province.
<lb/>As private individuals, they think it right to pass by
<lb/>little injuries, but as a people they think they cannot
<lb/>carry too high a principle of proud defiance and san­
<lb/>guinary revenge. This sufficiently shows, that what­
<lb/>ever rule they may acknowledge for their private con­
<lb/>duct, they have nothing that can properly be called
<lb/>national religion; and indeed, it is very much to be
<lb/>suspected, that their religion in the former case is very
<lb/>much assisted by the contemplation of those pains
<lb/>and penalties which society has provided against the
<lb/>crimes of individuals. But the united will of a whole
<lb/>people cannot make wrong  right, or sanction one act
<lb/>of rapacity, injustice, or breach of faith. The first
<lb/>principle, therefore, we must lay down is, that we are
<lb/>to submit our public conduct to the same rules by
<lb/>which we are to regulate our private actions: a nation
<lb/>that does this is, as a nation, religious; a nation that
<lb/>does it not, though it should fast, and pray, and wear
<lb/>sackcloth, and pay tithes, and build churches, is, as a
<lb/>nation, profligate and unprincipled.</p>
          <p>The vices of nations may be divided into those
<lb/>which relate to their own internal proceedings, or to
<lb/>their relations with other states. With regard to the
<lb/>first, the causes for humiliation are various. Many
<lb/>nations are guilty of the crime of permitting oppres­

<pb n="263"/>
<milestone n="22(6)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">263</mw>

<lb/>sive laws and bad governments to remain amongst
<lb/>them, by which the poor are crushed, and the lives of
<lb/>the innocent are laid at the mercy of wicked and
<lb/>arbitrary men. This is a national sin of the deepest
<lb/>dye, as it involves in it most others. It is painful to
<lb/>reflect how many atrocious governments there are in
<lb/>the world; and how little even they who enjoy good
<lb/>ones, seem to understand their true nature. We are
<lb/>apt to speak of the happiness of living under a mild
<lb/>government, as if it were like the the happiness of living
<lb/>under an indulgent climate; and when we thank God
<lb/>for it, we rank it with the blessings of the air and of
<lb/>the soil; whereas we ought to thank God for the
<lb/>wisdom and virtue of living under a good government;
<lb/>for a good government is the first of national duties.
<lb/>It is indeed a happiness, and one which demands our
<lb/>most grateful thanks, to be born under one which
<lb/>spares us the trouble and hazard of changing it; but
<lb/>a people born under a good government will probably
<lb/>not die under one, if they conceive of it as of an in­
<lb/>dolent and passive happiness, to be left for its preser­
<lb/>vation to fortunate conjunctures, and the floating and
<lb/>variable chances of incalculable events;—our second
<lb/>duty is to keep it good.</p>
          <p>We shall not be able to fulfil either of these duties,
<lb/>except we cultivate in our hearts the requisite dispo­
<lb/>sitions. One of the most fruitful sources of evil in
<lb/>the transaction of national affairs, is a spirit of insub­
<lb/>ordination. Without a quiet subordination to lawful
<lb/>authority, peace, order, and the ends of good govern­
<lb/>ment, can never be attained. To fix this subordina­
<lb/>tion on its proper basis, it is only necessary to establish
<lb/>in our minds this plain principle,—that the will of the
<lb/>minority should ever yield to that of the majority. By
<lb/>this simple axiom, founded on those common princi­
<lb/>ples of justice which all men understand, the largest

<pb n="264"/>
<milestone n="22(6)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum"><choice><sic>1</sic><corr>2</corr></choice>64</mw>

<lb/>society may be held together with equal ease as the
<lb/>smallest, provided only some well-contrived and or­
<lb/>derly method be established for ascertaining that will.
<lb/>It is the immediate extinction of all faction, sedition,
<lb/>and tyranny, It supersedes the necessity of govern­
<lb/>ing by systems of blinding or terrifying the people.
<lb/>It puts an end equally to the cabinet cabal, and the
<lb/>muffled conspiracy, and occasions every thing to go
<lb/>on smoothly, openly, and fairly; whereas, if the mi­
<lb/>nority attempt to impose their will upon the majority,
<lb/>so unnatural a state of things will not be submitted to
<lb/>without constant struggles on the one side, and constant
<lb/>jealousies on the other. There are two descriptions
<lb/>of men who are in danger of forgetting this excellent 
<lb/>rule; public functionaries and reformers. Public
<lb/>functionaries, being intrusted with large powers for
<lb/>managing the affairs of their fellow-citizens,—which
<lb/>management, from the nature of things, must neces­
<lb/>sarily be in the hands of a few,—are very apt to
<lb/>confound the executive power with the governing
<lb/>will; they require, therefore, to be observed with a
<lb/>wholesome suspicion, and to be frequently reminded
<lb/>of the nature and limits of their office. Reformers,
<lb/>conceiving of themselves as of a more enlightened class
<lb/>than the bulk of mankind, are likewsie apt to forget
<lb/>the deference due to them. Stimulated by newly
<lb/>discovered truths, of which they feel the full force,
<lb/>they are not willing to wait for the gradual spread of
<lb/>knowledge, the subsiding of passion, and the under­
<lb/>mining of prejudices. They too contemn a <emph>swinish
<lb/>multitude</emph>, and aim at an aristocracy of talents. It is
<lb/>indeed their business to attack the prejudices, and to
<lb/>rectify, if they can, the systems of their countrymen,
<lb/>but, in the mean time to acquiesce in them. It is
<lb/>their business to sow the seed, and let it lie patiently
<lb/>in the bosom of the ground,—perhaps for ages,—to

<pb n="265"/>
<milestone n="23(1)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">265</mw>

<lb/>prepare, not to bring about revolutions. The public
<lb/>is not always in the wrong for not giving in to their
<lb/>views, even where they have the appearance of rea­
<lb/>son; for their plans are often crude and premature,
<lb/>their ideas too refined for real life, and influenced by
<lb/>their own particular cast of thinking: they want peo­
<lb/>ple to be happy their way; whereas every one must
<lb/>be happy his own way. Freedom is a good thing;
<lb/>but if a nation is not disposed to accept of it, it is not
<lb/>to be presented to them on the point of a bayonet.
<lb/>Freedom is a valuable blessing; but if even a nation
<lb/>that has enjoyed that blessing evidently chooses to
<lb/>give it up, the voice of the people ought to prevail:
<lb/>men of more liberal minds should warn them indeed
<lb/>what they are about; but having done that, they should
<lb/>acquiesce. If the established religion, in any country,
<lb/>is absurd and superstitious in the eyes of thinking men,
<lb/>so long as it is the religion of the generality, it ought
<lb/>to prevail, and the minority should not even wish to
<lb/>supplant it. The endeavouring to overthrow any sys­
<lb/>tem, before it is given up by the majority, is faction;
<lb/>the endeavouring to keep it, after it is given up by them,
<lb/>is tyranny; both are equally wrong, and both proceed
<lb/>from the same cause,—the want of a principle of due
<lb/>subordination.</p>
          <p>If we find reason to be satisfied with the general
<lb/>sketch and outline of government, and with that basis
<lb/>of subordination on which we have placed it, it becomes
<lb/>us next to examine, whether the filling up of the plan
<lb/>be equally unexceptionable. Our laws, are they mild,
<lb/>equal, and perspicuous; free from burdensome forms
<lb/>and unnecessary delays; not a succession of expedi­
<lb/>ents growing out of temporary exigencies, but a com­
<lb/>pact whole; not adapted to local prejudices, but

<lb/>blood, calculated rather to check and set bounds to
<lb/>the inequality of fortunes than to increase them, rather
<lb/>to prevent and reform crimes than to punish them?—
<lb/>If good, are they well administered?—Is the lenity of
<lb/>the laws shown in moderation of the penalties, or in
<lb/>the facility of evasion and the frequency of escape?—
<lb/>Do we profit from greater degrees of instruction and
<lb/>longer experience, and from time to time clear away
<lb/>the trash and refuse of past ages? What all are bound
<lb/>to observe, are they so framed as that all may under­
<lb/>stand?—Is there any provision for instructing the
<lb/>people in the various arbitrary obligations that are laid
<lb/>upon them, or are they supposed to understand them
<lb/>by intuition, because they are too intricate to be ex­
<lb/>plained methodically?—Are punishments proportioned
<lb/>to crimes, and rewards to services; or have we two
<lb/>sets of officers, the one to do the work, the other to
<lb/>be paid without doing it?—Have we any locusts in
<lb/>the land, any who devour the labours of the husband­
<lb/>man, without contributing any thing to the good of
<lb/>society by their labours of body or of mind?—Is the
<lb/>name of God, and the awfulness of religious sanctions,
<lb/>profaned among us by frequent, unnecessary, and
<lb/>ensnaring oaths, which lie like stumbling blocks in
<lb/>every path of business and preferment, tending to
<lb/>corrupt the singleness of truth, and wear away the
<lb/>delicacy of conscience; entangling even the innocence
<lb/>and inexperience of children?—Have we calculated
<lb/>the false oaths which, in the space of one sun, the
<lb/>accusing angel has to carry up from our custom-houses,
<lb/>our various courts, our hustings, our offices of taxation,
<lb/>and—from our altars?—Are they such as a tear, if
<lb/>we do shed tears on a day such as this, will blot out?
<lb/>Have we calculated the mischief which is done to the
<lb/>ingenuous mind, when the virgin dignity of his soul is
<lb/>first violated by a falsehood?—Have we calculated

<pb n="267"/>

<mw type="pageNum">267</mw>

<lb/>the wound which is given to the peace of a good man,
<lb/>the thorns that are strewed upon his pillow, when,
<lb/>through hard necessity, he complies with what his soul
<lb/>abhors? Have we calculated the harm done to the
<lb/>morals of a nation by the established necessity of per­
<lb/>jury? We shall do well, being now, by the command
<lb/>of our rulers, before the Lord, to reflect on these things;
<lb/>and if we want food for our national penitence, per­
<lb/>haps we may here find it.</p>
          <p>Extravagance is a fault, to which nations, as well
<lb/>as private persons, are very prone, and the consequen­
<lb/>ces to both are exactly similar. If a private man
<lb/>lives beyond his income, the consequence will be loss
<lb/>of independence, disgraceful perplexity, and in the
<lb/>end certain ruin. The catastrophes of states are slow­
<lb/>er in ripening, but like causes must in the end produce
<lb/>like effects. If you are acquainted with any individual,
<lb/>who, from inattention to his affairs, misplaced confi­
<lb/>dence, foolish law-suits, anticipation of his rents, and
<lb/>profusion in his family expenses, has involved himself 
<lb/>in debts that eat away his income,—what would you
<lb/>say to such a one? Would you not tell him, Con­
<lb/>tract your expenses; look yourself into your affairs;
<lb/>insist upon exact accounts from your steward and
<lb/>bailiffs; keep no servants for mere show and parade;
<lb/>mind only your own affairs, and keep at peace with
<lb/>your neighbours; set religiously apart an annual sum
<lb/>for discharging the mortgages on your estate.—If this
<lb/>be good advice for one man, it is good advice for nine
<lb/>millions of men. If this individual should persist in
<lb/>his course of unthrifty profusion, saying to himself,
<lb/>The ruin will not come in my time; the misery will
<lb/>not fall upon me; let posterity take care of itself!
<lb/>would you not pronounce him at once very weak and
<lb/>very selfish? My friends, a nation that should pursue
<lb/>the same conduct, would be equally reprehensible.</p>

          <p>Pride is a vice in individuals; it cannot, therefore,
<lb/>be a virtue in that number of individuals called a nation.
<lb/>A disposition to prefer to every other our own habits of
<lb/>life, our own management, our own systems, to suppose
<lb/>that we are admired and looked up to by others—
<lb/>something of this perhaps is natural, and may be par­
<lb/>doned as a weakness, but it can never be exalted into
<lb/>a duty; it is a disposition we ought to check, and not
<lb/>to cultivate: there is neither patriotism nor good sense
<lb/>in fostering an extravagant opinion of ourselves and
<lb/>our own institutions, in being attached even to our
<lb/>faults, because they are ours, and because they have 
<lb/>been ours from generation to generation. An exclu­
<lb/>sive admiration of ourselves is generally founded on
<lb/>extreme ignorance, and it is not likely to produce any
<lb/>thing of a more liberal or better stamp.</p>
          <p>Amongst our national faults, have we any instances
<lb/>of cruelty or oppression to repent of? Can we look
<lb/>around from sea to sea, and from east to west, and
<lb/>say, that our brother hath not aught against us? If
<lb/>such instances do not exist under our immediate eye,
<lb/>do they exist any where under our influence and
<lb/>jurisdiction? There are some, whose nerves, rather
<lb/>than whose principles, cannot bear cruelty—like other
<lb/>nuisances, they would not choose it in sight, but they
<lb/>can be well content to know it exists, and that they are
<lb/>indebted to it for the increase of their income, and the
<lb/>luxuries of their table. Are there not some darker­
<lb/>coloured children of the same family over whom we as­
<lb/>sume a hard and unjust control? And have not these
<lb/>brethren aught against us? If we suspect they have,
<lb/><choice><sic>our</sic><corr/></choice> would it not become us anxiously to inquire into the
<lb/>truth, that we may deliver our souls; but if we know
<lb/>it, and cannot help knowing it, if such enormities have
<lb/>been pressed and forced upon our notice, till they are
<lb/>become flat and stale in the public ear, from fulness

<lb/>and repetition, and satiety of proof; and if they are
<lb/>still sanctioned by our legislature, defended by our
<lb/>princes—deep indeed is the colour of our guilt. And
<lb/>do we appoint fasts, and make pretences to religion?
<lb/>Do we pretend to be shocked at the principles or the
<lb/>practices of neighbouring nations, and start with af­
<lb/>fected horror at the name of <name>Atheist</name>? Are our con­
<lb/>sciences so tender, and our hearts so hard? Is it pos­
<lb/>sible we should meet as a nation, and knowing our­
<lb/>selves to be guilty of these things, have the confidence
<lb/>to implore the blessing of God upon our commerce
<lb/>and our colonies: preface with prayer our legislative
<lb/>meetings, and then deliberate how long we shall con­
<lb/>tinue human sacrifices? Rather let us <quote rend="align(center)break(yes)">Never pray more, abandon all remorse.</quote>
<lb/>Let us lay aside the grimace of hypocrisy, stand up
<lb/>for what we are, and boldly profess, like the emperor
<lb/>of old, that every thing is sweet from which money is
<lb/>extracted, and that we know better than to deprive
<lb/>ourselves of a gain for the sake of a fellow-creature.</p>
          <p>I next invite you, my friends, to consider your con­
<lb/>duct with regard to other states. Different commu­
<lb/>nities are neighbours, living together in a state of na­
<lb/>ture; that is, without any common tribunal to which
<lb/>they may carry their differences; but they are not
<lb/>the less bound to all the duties of neighbours,—to
<lb/>mutual sincerity, justice, and kind offices.</p>
          <p>First, to sincerity. It is imagined, I know not why,
<lb/>that transactions between states cannot be carried on
<lb/>without a great deal of intrigue and dissimulation.
<lb/>But I am apt to think the nation that should venture
<lb/>to disclaim this narrow and crooked policy, and
<lb/>should act and speak with a noble frankness, would
<lb/>lose nothing by the proceeding; honest intentions
<lb/>will bear to be told in plain language: if our views

<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">23*</mw>
<pb n="270"/>
<milestone n="23(3)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">270</mw>

<lb/>upon each other are for our mutual advantage, the
<lb/>whole mystery of them may be unfolded without dan­
<lb/>ger; and if they are not, they will soon be detected
<lb/>by practitioners as cunning and dexterous as ourselves.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are bound to justice—not only in ex­
<lb/>ecuting our engagements, but in cultivating a spirit of
<lb/>moderation in our very wishes. Most contrary to
<lb/>this is a species of patriotism, which consists in invert­
<lb/>ing the natural course of our feelings, in being afraid
<lb/>of our neighbour's prosperity, and rejoicing at his mis­
<lb/>fortunes. We should be ashamed to say, My neigh­
<lb/>bour's house was burnt down last night, I am glad of
<lb/>it, I shall have more custom to my shop. My neigh­
<lb/>bour, thank God, has broken his arm, I shall be sent
<lb/>for to attend the families in which he was employed;
<lb/>—but we are not ashamed to say, Our neighbours
<lb/>are weakening themselves by a cruel war, we shall
<lb/>rise upon their ruins. We must act in opposition to
<lb/>the peacemakers; we must hinder them from being
<lb/>reconciled, and blow the coals of discord, otherwise
<lb/>their commerce will revive, and goods may remain in
<lb/>our crammed warehouses. Our neighbours have bad
<lb/>laws and a weak government: Heaven forbid they
<lb/>should change them! for then they might be more
<lb/>flourishing than ourselves. We have tracts of territo­
<lb/>ry which we cannot people for ages, but we must take
<lb/>great care that our neighbour does not get any footing
<lb/>there, for he would soon make them very useful to
<lb/>him.—Thus do we extend our grasping hands from
<lb/>east to west, from pole to pole; and in our selfish
<lb/>monopolizing spirit are almost angry that the sun
<lb/>should ripen any productions but for our markets, or
<lb/>the ocean bear any vessels but our own upon its
<lb/>broad bosom. We are not ashamed to use that sole­
<lb/>cism in terms <term rend="slant(italic)">natural enemies</term>;
as if nature, and not
<lb/>our own bad passions, made us enemies; as if that

<pb n="271"/>
<milestone n="23(4)r" unit="sig"/>

<lb/>relation, from which, in private life, flows confidence,
<lb/>affection, endearing intercourse, were in nations only
<lb/>a signal for mutual slaughter; and we were like ani­
<lb/>mals of prey, solitarily ferocious, who look with a
<lb/>jealous eye on every rival that intrudes within their
<lb/>range of devastation—and yet this language is heard
<lb/>in a christian country, and these detestable maxims
<lb/>veil themselves under the semblance of virtue and
<lb/>public spirit. We have a golden rule, if we will but
<lb/>apply it: it will measure great things as well as small;
<lb/>it will measure as true at the <name>Antipodes</name>, or on the
<lb/>coast of <placeName>Guinea</placeName>, as in our native
fields. It is that
<lb/>universal standard of weights and measures which
<lb/>alone will simplify all business: Do to others, as ye
<lb/>would that others should do unto you.</p>
          <p>There is a notion which has a direct tendency to
<lb/>make us unjust, because it tends to make us think
<lb/>God so; I mean the idea which most nations have
<lb/>entertained, that they are the peculiar favourites of
<lb/>Heaven. We nourish our pride by fondly fancying
<lb/>that we are the only nation for whom the providence
<lb/>of God exerts itself; the only nation whose form of
<lb/>worship is agreeable to him; the only nation whom
<lb/>he has endowed with a competent share of wisdom to
<lb/>frame wise laws and rational governments. Each
<lb/>nation is to itself the fleece of <persName>Gideon</persName>, and 
drinks ex­
<lb/>clusively the dew of science: but as God is no re­
<lb/>specter of person, so neither is he of nations: he has
<lb/>not, like earthly monarchs, his favourites. There is
<lb/>a great deal even in our thanksgivings which is ex­
<lb/>ceptionable on this account; <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">God, we thank thee,
<lb/>that we are not like other nations;</quote> yet we freely
<lb/>load ourselves with every degree of guilt; but then
<lb/>we like to consider ourselves as a child that is chid­
<lb/>den, and others as outcasts.</p>
          <p>When the workings of these bad passions are swell­

<pb n="272"/>
<milestone n="23(4)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">272</mw>

<lb/>ed to their height by mutual animosity and opposition,
<lb/>war ensues. War is a state in which all our feelings
<lb/>and our duties suffer a total and strange inversion; a
<lb/>state in which <quote rend="indent(2)break(yes)"><lg type="indeterminate"><l>Life dies, Death lives, and Nature breeds</l><l>Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things.</l></lg></quote>
<lb/>A state in which it becomes our business to hurt and
<lb/>annoy our neighbour by every possible means; instead
<lb/>of cultivating, to destroy; instead of building, to pull
<lb/>down; instead of peopling, to depopulate: a state in
<lb/>which we drink the tears, and feed upon the misery of
<lb/>our fellow-creatures. Such a state, therefore, requires
<lb/>the extremest necessity to justify it; it ought not to be
<lb/>the common and usual state of society. As both parties
<lb/>cannot be in the right, there is always an equal chance
<lb/>at least, to either of them, of being in the wrong; but
<lb/>as both parties may be to blame, and most commonly
<lb/>are, the chance is very great indeed against its being
<lb/>entered into from any adequate cause; yet war may be
<lb/>said to be, with regard to nations, the sin which most
<lb/>easily besets them. We, my friends, in common with
<lb/>other nations, have much guilt to repent of from this
<lb/>cause, and it ought to make a large part of our hu­
<lb/>miliations on this day. When we carry our eyes
<lb/>back through the long records of our history, we see
<lb/>wars of plunder, wars of conquest, wars of religion,
<lb/>wars of pride, wars of succession, wars of idle specu­
<lb/>lation, wars of unjust interference; and hardly among
<lb/>them one war of necessary self-defence in any of our
<lb/>essential or very important interests. Of late years,
<lb/>indeed, we have known none of the calamities of war
<lb/>in our own country but the wasteful expense of it;
<lb/>and sitting aloof from those circumstances of personal
<lb/>provocation, which in some measure might excuse its
<lb/>fury, we have calmly voted slaughter and merchan­

<pb n="273"/>
<milestone n="23(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">273</mw>

<lb/>dized destruction—so much blood and tears for so
<lb/>many rupees, or dollars, or ingots. Our wars have
<lb/>been wars of cool, calculating interest, as free from
<lb/>hatred as from love of mankind; the passions which
<lb/>stir the blood have had no share in them. We de­
<lb/>vote a certain number of men to perish on land and
<lb/>sea, and the rest of us sleep sound, and, protected in
<lb/>our usual occupations, talk of the events of war as
<lb/>what diversifies the flat uniformity of life.</p>
          <p>We should, therefore, do well to translate this word
<lb/>war into language more intelligible to us. When we
<lb/>pay our army and our navy estimates, let us set down
<lb/>—so much for killing, so much for maiming, so much
<lb/>for making widows and orphans, so much for bringing
<lb/>famine upon a district, so much for corrupting citizens
<lb/>and subjects into spies and traitors, so much for ruining
<lb/>industrious tradesmen and making bankrupts (of that
<lb/>species of distress at least we can form an idea,) so
<lb/>much for letting loose the dæmons of fury, rapine, and
<lb/>lust, within the fold of cultivated society, and giving to
<lb/>the brutal ferocity of the most ferocious, its full scope
<lb/>and range of invention. We shall by this means know
<lb/>what we have paid our money for, whether we have
<lb/>made a good bargain, and whether the account is
<lb/>likely to pass—elsewhere. We must take in too, all
<lb/>those concomitant circumstances which make war,
<lb/>considered as battle, the least part of itself, <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="slant(italic)">pars mini­
<lb/>ma sui</foreign>. We must fix our eyes, not on the hero re­
<lb/>turning with conquest, nor yet on the gallant officer
<lb/>dying in the bed of honour,—the subject of picture
<lb/>and of song,—but on the private soldier, forced into
<lb/>the service, exhausted by camp-sickness and fatigue;
<lb/>pale, emaciated, crawling to an hospital with the pros­
<lb/>pect of life, perhaps a long life, blasted, useless, and
<lb/>suffering. We must think of the uncounted tears of
<lb/>her who weeps alone, because the only being who

<pb n="274"/>
<milestone n="23(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">274</mw>

<lb/>shared her sentiments is taken from her; no martial
<lb/>music sounds in unison with her feelings; the long
<lb/>day passes, and he returns not. She does not shed
<lb/>her sorrows over his grave, for she has never learnt
<lb/>whether he ever had one. If he had returned, his
<lb/>exertions would not have been remembered individ­
<lb/>ually, for he only made a small imperceptible part of
<lb/>a human machine, called a regiment. We must take
<lb/>in the long sickness, which no glory soothes, occa­
<lb/>sioned by distress of mind, anxiety and ruined for­
<lb/>tunes. These are not fancy-pictures; and if you
<lb/>please to heighten them, you can every one of you
<lb/>do it for yourselves. We must take in the conse­
<lb/>quences, felt perhaps for ages, before a country which
<lb/>has been completely desolated, lifts its head again;
<lb/>like a torrent of lava, its worst mischief is not the
<lb/>first overwhelming ruin of towns and palaces, but the
<lb/>long sterility to which it condemns the tract it has
<lb/>covered with its stream. Add the danger to regular
<lb/>governments which are changed by war, sometimes to
<lb/>anarchy, and sometimes to despotism. Add all these,
<lb/>and then let us think when a general performing these
<lb/>exploits, is saluted with, <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">Well done, good and faith­
<lb/>ful servant,</said> whether the plaudit is likely to be echoed
<lb/>in another place.</p>
          <p>In this guilty business there is a circumstance which
<lb/>greatly aggravates its guilt, and that is the impiety of
<lb/>calling upon the Divine Being to assist us in it. Al­
<lb/>most all nations have been in the habit of mixing with
<lb/>their bad passions a show of religion, and of prefacing
<lb/>these their murders with prayers and the solemnities
<lb/>of worship. When they send out their armies to
<lb/>desolate a country and destroy the fair face of nature,
<lb/>they have the presumption to hope that the Sovereign
<lb/>of the Universe will condescend to be their auxiliary,
<lb/>and to enter into their petty and despicable contests.

<lb/>Their prayer, if put into plain language, would run
<lb/>thus: God of love, father of all the families of the
<lb/>earth, we are going to tear in pieces our brethren of
<lb/>mankind, but our strength is not equal to our fury, we
<lb/>beseech thee to assist us in the work of slaughter.
<lb/>Go out, we pray thee, with our fleets and armies; we
<lb/>call them christian, and we have interwoven in our
<lb/>banners and the decorations of our arms the symbols
<lb/>of a suffering religion, tht we may fight under the
<lb/>cross upon which our Saviour died. Whatever mis­
<lb/>chief we do, we shall do it in thy name; we hope,
<lb/>therefore, thou wilt protect us in it. Thou, who hast
<lb/>made of one blood all the dwellers upon the earth,
<lb/>we trust thou wilt view us alone with partial favour,
<lb/>and enable us to bring misery upon every other quar­
<lb/>ter of the globe.—Now if we really expect such
<lb/>prayers to be answered, we are the weakest, if not,
<lb/>we are the most hypocritical of beings.</p>
          <p>Formerly, this business was managed better, and
<lb/>had in it more show of reason and probability. When
<lb/>mankind conceived of their gods as partaking of like
<lb/>passions with themselves, they made a fair bargain
<lb/>with them on these occasions. Their chieftains, they
<lb/>knew, were influenced by such motives, and they
<lb/>thought their gods might well be so too. Go out with
<lb/>us, and you shall have a share of the spoil. Your altars
<lb/>shall stream with the blood of so many noble captives;
<lb/>or you shall have a hecatomb of fat oxen, or a golden
<lb/>tripod. Have we any thing of this kind to propose?
<lb/>Can we make any thing like a handsome offer to the
<lb/>Almighty, to tempt him to enlist himself on our side?
<lb/>Such things have been done before now in the chris­
<lb/>tian world. Churches have been promised, and
<lb/>church lands,—aye, and honestly paid too; at other
<lb/>times silver shrines, incense, vestments, tapers, ac­
<lb/>cording to the occasion. Oh how justly may the

<lb/>ness of my heart I may have sinned, in suffering such
<lb/>impious propositions to escape my lips. In short,
<lb/>while we must be perfectly conscious in our own
<lb/>minds, that the generality of our wars are the offspring
<lb/>of mere worldly ambition and interest, let us, if we
<lb/>must have wars, carry them on as other such things
<lb/>are carried on; and not think of making a prayer to
<lb/>be used before murder, any more than of composing
<lb/>prayers to be used before we enter a gambling-house,
<lb/>or a place of licentious entertainment. Bad actions
<lb/>are made worse by hypocrisy: an unjust war is in it­
<lb/>self so bad a thing, that there is only one way of mak­
<lb/>ing it worse,—and that is, by mixing religion with it.</p>
          <p>These, my friends, are some of the topics on which,
<lb/>standing as a nation this day before the Lord, it will
<lb/>be proper that we should examine ourselves. There
<lb/>yet remains a serious question: How far, as individ­
<lb/>uals, are we really answerable for the guilt of national
<lb/>sins? For his own sins, it is evident, every man is
<lb/>wholly answerable; for those of an aggregate body, it
<lb/>is as evident he can be only answerable in part; and
<lb/>that portion and measure of iniquity, which falls to
<lb/>his share, will be more or less, according as he has
<lb/>been more or less deeply engaged in those transac­
<lb/>tions which are polluted with it. There is an active
<lb/>and a passive concurrence. We give our active con­
<lb/>currence to any measure, when we support it by any
<lb/>voluntary exertion, or bestow on it any mark of ap­
<lb/>probation; when, especially, we are the persons for
<lb/>whose sake, and for whose emolument, systems of in­
<lb/>justice or cruelty are carried on. The man of wealth
<lb/>and influence, who feeds and fattens upon the mise­
<lb/>ries of his fellow-creatures; the man in power, who

<pb n="277"/>
<milestone n="24(1)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">277</mw>

<lb/>plans abuses, or prevents their being swept away, is
<lb/>the very <persName>Jonas</persName> of the ship, and ought this
day to stand
<lb/>foremost in the rank of national penitents. But there
<lb/>is also a passive concurrence; and this, in common
<lb/>cases, the community appears to have a right to ex­
<lb/>pect from us. Society could not exist, if every indi­
<lb/>vidual took it upon himself not only to judge, but to
<lb/>act from his own judgement in those things in which
<lb/>a nation acts collectively. The law, therefore, which
<lb/>is the expression of the general will, seems to be a
<lb/>sufficient sanction for us, when, in obedience to its
<lb/>authority, we pay taxes, and comply with injunctions,
<lb/>in support of measures which we believe to be hurt­
<lb/>ful, and even iniquitous; and this, not because the 
<lb/>guilt of a bad action, as some fondly imagine, is di­
<lb/>luted and washed away in the guilt of multitudes; but
<lb/>because it is a necessary condition of political union,
<lb/>that private will should be yielded up to the will of
<lb/>the public. We shall do well, however, to bear in
<lb/>mind the principle on which we comply, that we may
<lb/>not go a step beyond it.</p>
          <p>There are, indeed, cases of such atrocity, that even
<lb/>this concurrence would be criminal. What these are,
<lb/>it is impossible to specify; every man must draw the
<lb/>line for himself.—I suppose no one will pretend, that
<lb/>any maxims of military subordination could justify the
<lb/>officers of <persName>Herod</persName> in the slaughter of the
children of
<lb/><placeName>Bethlehem</placeName>; and certainly the orders of
 <persName><placeName>Louvois</placeName></persName>, in
<lb/>the <placeName>Palatinate</placeName>, and of <persName>Catherine de' <name>Medici</name></persName>,
on the
<lb/>day of <persName>St. Bartholomew</persName>, were not less
cruel. In our
<lb/>own country, it has been the official duty of magis­
<lb/>trates to burn alive quiet and innocent subjects, who
<lb/>differed from them in opinion. Rather than fulfil
<lb/>such duties, a man of integrity will prepare himself to
<lb/>suffer, and a <name>christian</name> knows where such sufferings

<lb/>ought, in general cases, to give our passive concur­
<lb/>rence to measures which we may think wrong, peace
<lb/>and order do not require us to give them the sanction
<lb/>of our approbation. On the contrary, the more strict­
<lb/>ly we are bound to acquiesce, the more it is incum­
<lb/>bent on us to remonstrate. Every good man owes it
<lb/>to his country and to his own character, to lift his
<lb/>voice against a ruinous war, an unequal tax, or an
<lb/>edict of persecution; and to oppose them, temperate­
<lb/>ly, but firmly, by all means in his power: and
<lb/>indeed this is the only way reformations can ever be
<lb/>brought about, or that governments can enjoy the ad­
<lb/>vantage of general opinion.</p>
          <p>This general opinion has, on a recent occasion,
<lb/>been sedulously called for, and most of you have com­
<lb/>plied with the requisition. You, who have on this
<lb/>occasion given warm and unqualified declarations of
<lb/>attachment to the existing systems, you have done
<lb/>well—You, who have denounced abuses, and declar­
<lb/>ed your wishes for reform, you have done well like­
<lb/>wise, provided each of you has acted from the sincere,
<lb/>unbiassed conviction of his own mind. But if you
<lb/>have done it lightly, and without judgement, you have
<lb/>done ill; if against judgement, worse: if, by any im­
<lb/>proper influence, you have interfered with the liberty
<lb/>of your neighbour, or your dependent, and caused
<lb/>him to act against his judgement and his conscience,
<lb/>—worse still. If the ferment of party has stirred up
<lb/>a spirit of rancour and animosity among friends and
<lb/>townsmen, or introduced the poison of distrust amidst
<lb/>the freedom and security of social life, we stand this
<lb/>day before the Lord; and if our brother hath aught

<lb/>against us, <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">let us go first, and be 
reconciled to our
<lb/>brother, and then come and offer our gift.</quote></p>
          <p>If any of us have disturbed or misled weaker minds
<lb/>by exaggerated danger and affected alarm, and, prac­
<lb/>tising on their credulity or their ignorance, have rais­
<lb/>ed passions which it would have better become us to
<lb/>have moderated—or if, on the other hand, we have
<lb/>cried, <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">Peace, peace, where
there is no peace</said>—
<lb/>we are this day before the Lord, let shame and re­
<lb/>morse for these practices make a distinguished part of
<lb/>our national humiliation.</p>
          <p>Repend this day, not only of the actual evil you
<lb/>have done, but of the evil of which your actions have
<lb/>been the cause.—If you slander a good man, you are
<lb/>answerable for all the violence of which that slander
<lb/>may be the remote cause; if you raise undue preju­
<lb/>dices against any particular class or description of
<lb/>citizens, and they suffer through the bad passions your
<lb/>misrepresentations have worked up against them, you
<lb/>are answerable for the injury, though you have not
<lb/>wielded the bludgeon, or applied the firebrand; if you
<lb/>place power in improper hands, you are answerable
<lb/>for the abuse of that power; if you oppose concilia­
<lb/>tory measures, you are answerable for the distress
<lb/>which more violent ones may produce. If you use
<lb/>intemperate invectives and inflammatory declamation,
<lb/>you are answerable if others shed blood. It is not
<lb/>sufficient, even if our intentions are pure; we must
<lb/>weigh the tendencies of our actions, for we are an­
<lb/>swerable, in a degree at least, for those remote con­
<lb/>sequences which, though we did not intend, we might
<lb/>have foreseen. If we inculcate the plausible doctrine
<lb/>of unlimited confidence, we draw upon ourselves the
<lb/>responsibility of all the future measures which that
<lb/>confidence may sanction. If we introduce tenets
<lb/>leaning towards arbitrary power, the generations to

<lb/>come will have a right to curse the folly of their fore­
<lb/>fathers, when they are reaping the bitter fruits of them
<lb/>in future star-chambers, and courts of inquisitorial ju­
<lb/>risdiction. If the precious sands of our liberty are,
<lb/>perhaps, of themselves running out, how shall we be
<lb/>justified to ourselves or to posterity, if, with a rash
<lb/>hand, we shake the glass.</p>
          <p>If, on the other hand, through vanity, a childish
<lb/>love of novelty, a spirit of perverse opposition, or any
<lb/>motive still more sordidly selfish, we are precipitated
<lb/>into measures which ought to be the result of the
<lb/>most serious consideration—if by <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">foolish talking or
<lb/>jestings, which are not convenient,</quote> we have lessened
<lb/>the reverence due to constituted authorities, or slack­
<lb/>ened the bonds which hold society together; ours is
<lb/>the blame, when the hurricane is abroad in the world,
<lb/>and doing its work of mischief.</p>
          <p>The course of events in this country has now, for
<lb/>a number of generations, for a long reach, as it were,
<lb/>of the stream of time, run smooth, and our political
<lb/>duties have been proportionally easy; but it may not
<lb/>always be so. A sudden bend may change the di­
<lb/>rection of the current, and open scenes less calm. It
<lb/>becomes every man, therefore, to examine his princi­
<lb/>ples, whether they are of that firmness and texture as
<lb/>suits the occasion he may have for them. If we want
<lb/>a light gondola to float upon a summer lake, we look
<lb/>at the form and gilding; but if a vessel to steer through
<lb/>storms, we examine the strength of the timbers, and
<lb/>the soundness of the bottom. We want principles,
<lb/>not to figure in a book of ethics, or to delight us with
<lb/><quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">grand and swelling
sentiments;</quote> but principles by
<lb/>which we may act and by which we may suffer.

<lb/>fices; political principles, of practical utility; princi­
<lb/>ples of religion, to comfort and support us under all

<lb/>the trying vicissitudes we see around us, and which
<lb/>we have no security that we shall be long exempt
<lb/>from. How many are there now suffering under such
<lb/>overwhelming distresses, as, a short time ago, we
<lb/>should have thought it was hardly within the verge of
<lb/>possibility that they should experience! Above all, let
<lb/>us keep our hearts pure, and our hands clean. What­
<lb/>ever part we take in public affairs, much will undoubt­
<lb/>edly happen which we could by no means foresee,
<lb/>and much which we shall not be able to justify; the
<lb/>only way, therefore, by which we can avoid deep re­
<lb/>morse, is to act with simplicity and singleness of in­
<lb/>tention, and not to suffer ourselves to be warped,
<lb/>though by ever so little, from the path which honour
<lb/>and conscience approve.</p>
          <p>Principles, such as I have been recommending, are
<lb/>not the work of a day; they are not to be acquired
<lb/>by any formal act of worship, or manual of devotion
<lb/>adapted to the exigency; and it will little avail us,
<lb/>that we have stood here, as a nation, before the Lord,
<lb/>if, individually, we do not remember that we are al­
<lb/>ways so.</p>

not been
<lb/>defended because they have never been attacked.
<lb/>Of this number is public or social worship. It has
<lb/>been recommended, urged, enforced, but never vindi­
<lb/>cated. Through worldliness, scepticism, indolence,
<lb/>dissatisfaction with the manner of conducting it, it has
<lb/>been often neglected; but it is a new thing to hear it
<lb/>condemned. The pious and the good have lament­
<lb/>ed its insufficiency to the reformation of the world,
<lb/>but they were yet to learn that it was unfriendly to it.
<lb/>Satisfied with silent and solitary desertion, those who
<lb/>did not concur in the homage paid by their fellow­
<lb/>citizens were content to acquiesce in its propriety, and

<pb n="283"/>
<milestone n="24(4)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">283</mw>

<lb/>had not hitherto assumed the dignity of a sect. A
<lb/>late pamphlet of <persName>Mr. Wakefield's</persName> has
therefore excited
<lb/>the attention of the public, partly, no doubt, from the
<lb/>known abilities of the author, but still more from the
<lb/>novelty and strangeness of the doctrine. If intended
<lb/>as an apology, no publication can be more seasonable;
<lb/>but if meant as an exhortation, or rather a dehorta­
<lb/>tion, it is a labour which many will think, from the
<lb/>complexion of the times and the tendencies of increas­
<lb/>ing habits, might well have been spared. It is an
<lb/>awkward circumstance for the apostle of such a per­
<lb/>suasion, that he will have many practical disciples
<lb/>whom he will hardly care to own; and that if he suc­
<lb/>ceeds in making proselytes, he must take them from
<lb/>the more sober and orderly part of the community;
<lb/>and class them, as far as this circumstance affords a
<lb/>distinction, along with the uneducated, the profligate,
<lb/>and the unprincipled. The negative tenet he incul­
<lb/>cates does not mark his converts with sufficient preci­
<lb/>sion: their scrupulosity will be in danger of being
<lb/>confounded with the carelessness of their neighbours;
<lb/>and it will be always necessary to ask, Do you abstain
<lb/>because you are of this religion, or because you are
<lb/>of no religion at all?</p>
          <p>It would be unfair, however, to endeavour to ren­
<lb/>der <persName>Mr. Wakefield's</persName> opinions invidious; they, 
as well
<lb/>as every other opinion, must be submitted to the test
<lb/>of argument; and public worship, as well as every 
<lb/>other practice, must stand on the basis of utility and
<lb/>good sense, or it must not stand at all: and in the 
<lb/>latter case, it is immaterial whether it is left to moul­
<lb/>der like the neglected ruin, or battered down like the
<lb/>formidable tower.</p>
          <p>It will stand upon this basis, if it can be shown to
<lb/>be agreeable to our nature, sanctioned by universal
<lb/>practice, countenanced by revealed religion, and that

<pb n="284"/>
<milestone n="24(4)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">284</mw>

<lb/>its tendencies are favourable to the morals and man­
<lb/>ners of mankind.</p>
          <p>What is public worship? Kneeling down together
<lb/>while prayers are said of a certain length and con­
<lb/>struction, and hearing discourses made to a sentence
<lb/>of Scripture called a text!—Such might be the defi­
<lb/>nition of an unenlightened person, but such would
<lb/>certainly not be <persName>Mr. Wakefield's</persName>. The question
<lb/>ought to be agitated on much larger ground. If these
<lb/>practices are shown to be novel, it does not follow
<lb/>that public worship is so, in that extensive sense which
<lb/>includes all modes and varieties of expression. To
<lb/>establish its antiquity, we must therefore investigate its
<lb/>nature.</p>
          <p>Public worship is the public expression of homage
<lb/>to the Sovereign of the Universe. It is that tribute
<lb/>from men united in families, in towns, in communities,
<lb/>which individually men owe to their Maker. Every
<lb/>nation has therefore found some organ by which to
<lb/>express this homage, some language, rite, or symbol,
<lb/>by which to make known their religious feelings; but
<lb/>this organ has not always, nor chiefly, been words.
<lb/>The killing an animal, the throwing a few grains of
<lb/>incense into the fire, the eating bread and drinking
<lb/>wine, are all in themselves indifferent actions, and
<lb/>have apparently little connexion with devotion; yet
<lb/>all of these have been used as worship, and are wor­
<lb/>ship when used with that intention. The solemn
<lb/>sacrifices and anniversary festivals of the <name>Jews</name>, at
<lb/>which their capital and their temple were thronged
<lb/>with votaries from every distant part of the kingdom,
<lb/>were splendid expressions of their religious homage.
<lb/>Their worship, indeed, was interwoven with their
<lb/>whole civil constitution; and so, though in a subordi­
<lb/>nate degree, was that of the <name>Greeks</name> and <name>Romans</name>,
<lb/>and most of the states of antiquity. There has never

<pb n="285"/>
<milestone n="24(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">285</mw>

<lb/>existed a nation, at all civilized, which has not had
<lb/>some appointed form of supplication, some stated
<lb/>mode of signifying the dependence we are under to
<lb/>the Supreme Being, and as a nation imploring his
<lb/>protection. It is not pretended that these modes
<lb/>were all equally rational, equally edifying, equally
<lb/>proper for imitation, equally suitable for every state of
<lb/>society; they have varied according as a nation was
<lb/>more or less advanced in refinement and decorum,
<lb/>more or less addicted to symbolical expression—to
<lb/>violent gesticulation—and more or less conversant
<lb/>with abstract ideas and metaphysical speculation.
<lb/>But whether the Deity is worshipped by strewing 
<lb/>flowers and building tabernacles of verdure; by
<lb/>dances round the altar, and the shouts of a cheerful
<lb/>people; by offering the first-fruits of harvest, and par­
<lb/>taking in the social feast; by tones of music, inter­
<lb/>preted only by the heart; or by verbal expressions of
<lb/>gratitude and adoration—whether the hallelujahs of
<lb/>assembled multitudes rise together in solemn chorus;
<lb/>or whether they listen with composed and reverential
<lb/>attention to the voice of one man, appointed by them
<lb/>to be the organ of their feelings—whether a number
<lb/>of people meet together like the <name>Quakers</name>, and each
<lb/>in silence prefers his mental petition—wherever men
<lb/>together perform a stated act as an expression of
<lb/>homage to their Maker, there is the essence of public
<lb/>worship; and public worship has therefore this mark
<lb/>of being agreeable to the nature of man,—that it has
<lb/>been found agreeable to the sense of mankind in all
<lb/>ages and nations.</p>
          <p>It is, indeed, difficult to imagine that beings, sensi­
<lb/>ble of common wants and a common nature, should
<lb/>not join together in imploring common blessings; that,
<lb/>prone as men are in every other circumstance to as­
<lb/>sociate together, and communicate the electric fire of

<pb n="286"/>
<milestone n="24(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">286</mw>

<lb/>correspondent feelings, they should act with unsocial
<lb/>reserve only where those interests are concerned
<lb/>which are confessedly the most important. Such is
<lb/>the temperament of man, that in every act and every
<lb/>event he anxiously looks around him to claim the
<lb/>gratulation or sympathy of his fellows. Religion,
<lb/>says <persName>Mr. Wakefield</persName>, is a personal thing: so
is mar­
<lb/>riage, so is the birth of a child, so is the loss of a be­
<lb/>loved relative; yet on all these occasions we are
<lb/>strongly impelled to public solemnization. We neither
<lb/>laugh alone, nor weep alone,—why then should we
<lb/>pray alone? None of our feelings are of a more com­
<lb/>municable nature than our religious ones. If devo­
<lb/>tion really exists in the heart of each individual, it is
<lb/>morally impossible it should exist there apart and sin­
<lb/>gle. So many separate tapers, burning so near each
<lb/>other, in the very nature of things must catch, and
<lb/>spread into one common flame. The reciprocal ad­
<lb/>vantages, which public and private worship possess
<lb/>over each other, are sufficiently obvious to make both
<lb/>desirable. While the former is more animated, the
<lb/>latter comes more intimately home to our own cir­
<lb/>cumstances and feelings, and allows our devotion to
<lb/>be more particular and appropriated. To most of
<lb/>the objections made against the one, the other is
<lb/>equally liable. Superstition can drop her solitary
<lb/>beads, as well as vociferate the repetition of a public
<lb/>collect: if symptoms of weariness and inattention may
<lb/>be observed in our churches, we have only to look in­
<lb/>to the diaries of the most pious <name>christians</name>, and we
<lb/>shall find still heavier complaints of the dullness and
<lb/>deadness of their spiritual frame: the thoughts may
<lb/>wander in the closet when the door is shut: folly and
<lb/>selfishness will send up improper petitions from the
<lb/>cell as well as from the congregation. Nay, public
<lb/>worship has this great advantage,—that it teaches

<pb n="287"/>
<milestone n="24(6)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">287</mw>

<lb/>those to pray, who, not being accustomed to think,
<lb/>cannot of themselves pray with judgement. To all, it
<lb/>teaches that we are not to pray for exclusive advan­
<lb/>tages, but to consider ourselves as members of a com­
<lb/>munity. Our inmost wishes learn restraint while our
<lb/>petitions are thus directed, and our desires by degrees
<lb/>conform themselves to that spirit of moderation and
<lb/>justice, without which we cannot join in the compre­
<lb/>hensive prayer, that must include the joint supplica­
<lb/>tions of a numerous assembly. Public worship has
<lb/>this further advantage over private, that it is better
<lb/>secured against languor on one side, and enthusiasm 
<lb/>on the other. If the devotional sentiment has not
<lb/>taken deep root in his mind, a man will scarcely keep
<lb/>up, in silence and in solitude, an intercourse to which
<lb/>he is prompted by no external appearance, and of
<lb/>which he is reminded by no circumstance of time or
<lb/>place. And if his sense of invisible things is strong
<lb/>enough to engage his mind in spite of these disadvan­
<lb/>tages, there is room to fear, lest, by brooding in si­
<lb/>lence over objects of such indistinct vastness, his be­
<lb/>wildered ideas and exalted imagination should lead
<lb/>him to the reveries of mysticism; an extreme no less
<lb/>to be dreaded than that of indifference. When <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Wakefield</persName>, to strengthen his argument for seclusion in
<lb/>our religious exercises, directs our attention to the
<lb/><name>mount of Olives</name> and the garden of
<placeName>Gethsemane</placeName>, he
<lb/>should recollect that our Saviour sustained a charac­
<lb/>ter to which we cannot presume to aspire; and that,
<lb/>however favourable the desert and the wilderness
<lb/>have been to prophets visited by extraordinary illumi­
<lb/>nations, they cannot be equally suitable to the regular
<lb/>devotion of ordinary <name>christians</name>. From the gloom of
<lb/>the cloister and the loneliness of the cell have pro­
<lb/>ceeded the most extravagant deviations fom nature
<lb/>and from reason. Enthusiasm is indeed most dan­

<pb n="288"/>
<milestone n="24(6)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">288</mw>

<lb/>gerous in a crowd, but it seldom originates there.
<lb/>The mind, heated with intense thinking, adopts illu­
<lb/>sions to which it is not exposed when its devotion is
<lb/>guided and bounded by addresses which are intended
<lb/>to meet the common sentiments of a numerous assem­
<lb/>bly. Religion then appears with the most benignant
<lb/>aspect, is then least likely to be mistaken, when the
<lb/>presence of our fellow-creatures points out its connex­
<lb/>ion with the businesses of life and the duties of socie­
<lb/>ty. Solitary devotion, for wordly minds, is insuffi­
<lb/>cient, for weak minds it is not profitable, for ardent
<lb/>minds it is not safe.</p>
          <p>We must however do that justice to the author of
<lb/>the <title>Enquiry</title>, as to confess that he betrays no disposi­
<lb/>tion to carry these exercises to any extreme. On
<lb/>the contrary, some of his expressions seem to strike
<lb/>at the root of all prayer, properly so called, as being
<lb/>the weak effort of an infirm and unphilosophical mind
<lb/>to alter the order of nature and the decrees of <name>Provi­
<lb/>dence</name>, in which it rather becomes the wise man to
<lb/>acquiesce with a manly resignation. Without enter­
<lb/>ing into a discussion, in which, perhaps, we might
<lb/>misrepresent his sentiments; as, in the greater part
<lb/>of his pamphlet, he has taken the ground of Scrip­
<lb/>ture, which undoubtedly countenances the earnestness,
<lb/>and almost the importunity of petition; it may be
<lb/>sufficient for the present purpose to observe, that if
<lb/>there exists a man who, believing himself to be in the
<lb/>continual presence of Infinite Power, directed by in­
<lb/>finite love and tender compassion to all his creatures
<lb/>—thinking often of this Being, and habitually refer­
<lb/>ring every disposition of events to his providence—
<lb/>feeling himself more constantly and intimately con­
<lb/>nected with him than with all creation besides—can,
<lb/>in every vicissitude of his life, in sickness and in sor­
<lb/>row, in imminent danger, anxious uncertainty, desertion

<lb/>or loss of friends, and all the trying circumstances of
<lb/>humanity that flesh is heir to; forbear, for himself or
<lb/>for those dearer to him than himself, to put up one
<lb/>petition to the throne of God,—such a one may be
<lb/>allowed to strike out every petition in the Lord's
<lb/>Prayer, but that comprehensive one, <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">thy will be
<lb/>done.</quote> If his faith be equally lively, his devotional
<lb/>feelings equally fervent, his sense of dependence upon
<lb/>God equally felt in his inmost soul, we dare not pre­
<lb/>sume to censure the temperance of his religious ad­
<lb/>dresses. We respect the subdued sobriety of his
<lb/>wishes; and we do not, we cannot suppose him de­
<lb/>serted by the Supreme Being for that modest forbear­
<lb/>ance which proceeds from a resignation so absolute
<lb/>and complete. Others, however, whose philosophy is
<lb/>not of so firm a texture, may plead the example of
<lb/>him who prayed, though with meek submission, that
<lb/>the cup of bitterness might pass from him; and who,
<lb/>as the moment of separation approached, interceded
<lb/>for his friends and followers with all the anxiety of
<lb/>affectionate tenderness. But we will venture to say
<lb/>that practically there is no such philosopher. If
<lb/>prayer were not enjoined for the perfection, it would
<lb/>be permitted to the weakness of our nature. We 
<lb/>should be betrayed into it, if we thought it sin; and
<lb/>pious ejaculations would escape our lips, though we
<lb/>were obliged to preface them with, God forgive me
<lb/>for praying!</p>
          <p>To those who press the objection, that we cannot
<lb/>see in what manner our prayers can be answered,
<lb/>consistently with the government of the world accord­
<lb/>ing to those general laws by which we find, in fact,
<lb/>that it is governed; it may be sufficient to say, that
<lb/>prayer, being made almost an instinct of our nature,
<lb/>it cannot be supposed but that, like all other instincts,
<lb/>it has its use; that no idea can be less philosophical

<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)break(yes)case(allcaps)indent(1)">Vol. II.</mw>

<lb/>than one which implies, that the existence of a God
<lb/>who governs the world, should make no difference in
<lb/>our conduct; and few things less probable, than that
<lb/>the child-like submission which bows to the will of a
<lb/>father, should be exactly similar in feature to the
<lb/>stubborn patience which bends under the yoke of ne­
<lb/>cessity.</p>
          <p>It may be further observed, that petitions for tem­
<lb/>poral advantages,—such, I mean, as a spirit of mode­
<lb/>ration will allow us to wish with sufficient ardour to
<lb/>make them the subject of our prayers,—are not liable
<lb/>to more objections than petitions for spiritual blessings.
<lb/>In either case the weak man does, and the wise man
<lb/>does not expect a miracle. That the arrogant, the
<lb/>worldly, and the licentious, should on a sudden, and
<lb/>without their own strenuous endeavours, be rendered
<lb/>humble, simple-minded, and pure of heart, would be
<lb/>as great a violation of the order of nature in the moral
<lb/>world, as it would be in the natural world that the
<lb/>harvest should ripen without the co-operation of the
<lb/>husbandman, and the slow influence of the seasons.
<lb/>Indeed, as temporal blessings are less in our power
<lb/>than dispositions, and are sometimes entirely out of it,
<lb/>it seems more reasonable of the two to pray for the
<lb/>former than for the latter; and it is remarkable that,
<lb/>in the model given us in the Lord's Prayer, there is
<lb/>not a single petition for any virtue or good disposition,
<lb/>but there is one for daily bread. Good dispositions,
<lb/>particularly a spirit of resignation, are declared and
<lb/>implied in the petitions, but they are not prayed for:
<lb/>events are prayed for, and circumstances out of our
<lb/>own power, relative to our spiritual concerns, are
<lb/>prayed for,—as, the not being led into temptation;
<lb/>but there is no prayer that we may be made holy,
<lb/>meek, or merciful. Nor is it an objection to praying
<lb/>for health, that sickness may possibly turn out a bless­

<pb n="291"/>

<lb/>ing, since it is no objection to the using all the means
<lb/>in our power to get rid of of sickness, which we do as
<lb/>eagerly and as unreservedly as if we had not the least
<lb/>idea that it ever could be salutary. And we do right;
<lb/>for the advantages of sickness are casual and adven­
<lb/>titious; but health is in itself, and in its natural ten­
<lb/>dencies, a blessing devoutly to be wished for. That
<lb/>no advantage of this nature ought to be prayed or
<lb/>wished for, unqualified with the deepest submission to
<lb/>the will of God, is an undoubted truth; and it is a
<lb/>truth likewise universally acknowledged by all rational
<lb/><name>christians</name>.</p>
          <p>It cannot be denied, however, that great reserve is
<lb/>necessary in putting up specific petitions, especially of
<lb/>a public nature; but generally the fault lies in our
<lb/>engaging in wrong pursuits, rather than in imploring
<lb/>upon our pursuits the favour of Heaven. Humanity
<lb/>is shocked to hear prayers for the success of an un­
<lb/>just war; but humanity and Heaven were then 
of­
<lb/>fended when the war was engaged in; for war is of a
<lb/>nature sufficiently serious to warrant our prayers to be
<lb/>preserved from the calamities of it, if we have not
<lb/>voluntarily exposed ourselves to them. The frivolous
<lb/>nature of most national contests appears strongly in
<lb/>this very circumstance, that petitions from either side
<lb/>have the air of a profanation; but if, in some serious
<lb/>conjuncture, our country was ready to be overwhelmed
<lb/>by an ambitious neighbour,—as that of the <name>Dutch</name>
<lb/>was in the time of <persName>Louis the
Fourteenth</persName>,—in such a
<lb/>season of calamity, the sternest philosopher would
<lb/>give way to the instinctive dictates of nature, and im­
<lb/>plore the help which cometh from on high. The
<lb/>reason why both sides cannot pray with propriety, is
<lb/>because both sides cannot act with justice.</p>
          <p>But supposing we were to discard all petition as
<lb/>the weak effort of infirm minds to alter the unbroken

<pb n="292"/>
<milestone n="25(2)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">292</mw>

<lb/>chain of events; as the impatient breathings of crav­
<lb/>ing and restless spirits, not broken into patient acqui­
<lb/>escence with the eternal order of <name>Providence</name>—the
<lb/>noblest office of worship still remains:
<quote rend="indent(2)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l>Praise is devotion fit for mighty minds,</l><l>The jarring world's agreeing sacrifice.</l></lg></quote></p>
          <p>And this is surely of a social nature. One class of
<lb/>religious duties separately considered, tends to de­
<lb/>press the mind, filling it with ingenuous shame and
<lb/>wholesome sorrow; and to these humiliating feelings,
<lb/>solitude might perhaps be found congenial: but the sen­
<lb/>timents of admiration, love, and joy, swell the bosom
<lb/>with emotions which seek for fellowship and commu­
<lb/>nication. The flame indeed may be kindled by silent
<lb/>musing; but when kindled it must infallibly spread.
<lb/>The devout heart, penetrated with large and affecting
<lb/>views of the immensity of the works of God, the har­
<lb/>mony of his laws, and the extent of his beneficence,
<lb/>bursts into loud and vocal expresions of praise and
<lb/>adoration; and, from a full and overflowing sensibili­
<lb/>ty, seeks to expand itself to the utmost limits of crea­
<lb/>tion. The mind is forcibly carried out of itself; and,
<lb/>embracing the whole circle of animated existence,
<lb/>calls on all above, around, below, to help to bear the
<lb/>burden of its gratitude. Joy is too brilliant a thing to
<lb/>be confined within our own bosoms; it burnishes all
<lb/>nature, and with its vivid colouring gives a kind of
<lb/>factitious life to objects without sense or motion.
<lb/>There cannot be a more striking proof of the social
<lb/>tendency of these feelings, than the strong propensity
<lb/>we have to suppose auditors where there are none.
<lb/>When men are wanting, we address the animal crea­
<lb/>tion; and, rather than have none to partake our sen­
<lb/>timents, we find sentiment in the music of the birds,
<lb/>the hum of insects, and the low of kine: nay, we call

<pb n="293"/>
<milestone n="25(3)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">293</mw>

<lb/>on rocks and streams and forests to witness and share
<lb/>our emotions. Hence the Royal Shepherd, sojourn­
<lb/>ing in caves and solitary wastes, calls on the hills to
<lb/>rejoice and the floods to clap their hands; and the
<lb/>lonely poet, wandering in the deep recesses of uncul­
<lb/>tivated nature, finds a temple in every solemn grove,
<lb/>and swells his chorus of praise with the winds that
<lb/>bow the lofty cedars. And can he who, not satisfied
<lb/>with the wide range of existence, calls for the sympa­
<lb/>thy of the inanimate creation, refuse to worship with
<lb/>his fellow-men? Can he who bids <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">Nature attend,</quote>
<lb/>forget to <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">join every living soul</quote> in the 
universal
<lb/>hymn? Shall we suppose companions in the stillness
<lb/>of deserts, and shall we overlook them amongst friends
<lb/>and townsmen? It cannot be! Social worship, for the
<lb/>devout heart, is not more a duty than it is a real
<lb/>want.</p>
          <p>If Public Worship is thus found to be agreeable to
<lb/>the best impulses of our nature, the pious mind will
<lb/>rejoice to find it, at least not discountenanced by re­
<lb/>vealed religion. But its friends, in endeavouring to
<lb/>prove this, must carry on the argument under some
<lb/>disadvantage, as <persName>Mr. Wakefield</persName>, though he
lays great
<lb/>stress on the presumptive arguments which seem to
<lb/>favour the negative side of the question, will not allow
<lb/>the same force to those which may be urged on the
<lb/>other side. The practice of Christ, he tells
us, is an
<lb/>authority to which all believers will bow the knee, a
<lb/>tribunal by which all our controversies must be award­
<lb/>ed: yet he gives us notice at the same time, that to
<lb/>this authority, if brought against him, he will not bow
<lb/>the knee; and from this tribunal, if unfriendly to his
<lb/>cause, he will appeal; for that prayers and all exter­
<lb/>nal observances are beggarly elements, to be laid
<lb/>aside in the present maturity of the christian church;
<lb/>and that, even if social worship were an original ap­

<lb/>pendage of the Gospel, the idea of a <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">progressive
<lb/>christianity</soCalled> would justify us in rejecting it. With
<lb/>this inequality of conditions, which it is sufficient just
<lb/>to notice, let us consider the array of texts which are
<lb/>drawn up against the practice in question; and par­
<lb/>ticularly those precepts which, <persName>Mr. Wakefield</persName> 
says,
<lb/>are evidences that directly and literally prove public 
<lb/>worship to be unauthorized by christianity, and incon­
<lb/>sistent with it, and which he distinguishes from those
<lb/>which condemn it merely by inference.</p>
          <p>The first of these direct evidences is the injunction,
<lb/>not to worship as the hypocrites, who are fond of ex­
<lb/>hibiting in the most public places. <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">And when thou
<lb/>prayest, be not as the hypocrites, for they love to pray
<lb/>standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the
<lb/>streets, that they may be seen of men; verily I say
<lb/>unto you, they have their reward. But thou, when
<lb/>thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou
<lb/>hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in se­
<lb/>cret.</quote> But is it not evident, that the force of this
<lb/>precept is not aimed against public prayer, but against 
<lb/>private prayer performed in public; against the os­
<lb/>tentatious display which seeks to distinguish us from
<lb/>others, not the genuine sympathy which makes us
<lb/>desirous of blending our feelings with theirs? It was
<lb/>devotion obtruding itself in the face of business, amidst
<lb/>the show and bustle of the world. It did not seek
<lb/>for fellowship, but observation. It did not want
<lb/>the concurrence of men, but to be seen by them.
<lb/>Even in the synagogue it was silent, solitary, unsocial,
<lb/>and with sullen reserve and cold disdain kept itself
<lb/>aloof from communion, and invited only applause.
<lb/>The <name>Pharisee</name> and the <name>Publican</name> both went
up to the
<lb/>temple to worship, but they worshipped not together.
<lb/>Certainly the delicate and modest nature of sincere
<lb/>piety must shrink from an exhibition like this; and

<pb n="295"/>
<milestone n="25(4)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">295</mw>

<lb/>would not wish to have its feelings noticed, but where
<lb/>at the same time they may be shared. This text
<lb/>therefore seems to be only a caution respecting the
<lb/>proper performance of our closet duties.</p>
          <p><quote rend="pre(“)post(”)"><persName>Jesus</persName>
saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the

<lb/>nor yet at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, worship the
Father. But the
<lb/>hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
<lb/>shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the
<lb/>Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a
<lb/>spirit.</quote> True it is, the hour is come in which it is
<lb/>allowed by all rational believers, that the acceptable­
<lb/>ness of prayer does not depend on the sacredness of
<lb/>any particular place. The <name>Jews</name> wanted to be inform­
<lb/>ed of this. They, naturally enough, were apt to con­
<lb/>sider their temple as the habitation of the Divine
<lb/>Being, in the same manner as a palace is the habita­
<lb/>tion of an earthly sovereign,—a place where men may
<lb/>come to make their court, and bring presents, and ask
<lb/>favours in return. These ideas have been done away
<lb/>by those more honourable notions of the Divine Being
<lb/>which our Saviour, and good men after him have la­
<lb/>boured to inculcate. We conceive of a church as of
<lb/>a building, not for God to reside, but for men to as­
<lb/>semble in; for, though God is a spirit, men have
<lb/>bodies, and they cannot meet to do any thing without
<lb/>having some place to do it in. <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">Neither in this

means therefore ex­
<lb/>clusively, with an idea of any peculiar sacredness, or
<lb/>superstitious preference to any other structure which
<lb/>might be equally commodious.</p>
          <p>With regard to the character of our Saviour him­
<lb/>self, it is certain he did not always call upon his dis­
<lb/>ciples to share that more intimate, and, if I may say
<lb/>so, confidential intercourse with his heavenly Father,
<lb/>which he may be supposed to have been favoured

<lb/>with; and it must be confessed, there is no formal
<lb/>mention made of any exercises of this kind either
<lb/>with them, or with the people at large. But his
<lb/>whole life was a prayer. He, who in his most fa­
<lb/>miliar and convivial moments was raising the thoughts
<lb/>of his hearers to God, and nourishing their piety by
<lb/>occasional instruction, could not be supposed to leave
<lb/>them disinclined to the intercourses of social piety.
<lb/>The beautiful commendatory prayer which he offered
<lb/>up when about to leave the world, though it was not
<lb/>entirely of the nature of social prayer, as his disciples
<lb/>did not join in it, yet, its being uttered in their pre­
<lb/>sence, and their being the object of it, seems to place
<lb/>it nearly on the same ground. In the very miracle of
<lb/>the loaves, which <persName>Mr. Wakefield</persName> has produced
as an
<lb/>instance of an incident which might have given rise to
<lb/>public prayer, and which was suffered to pass without
<lb/>it—in the account of this very miracle there is a di­
<lb/>rect precedent for the practice in question; for, look­
<lb/>ing up to heaven, <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">he
blessed</quote> before he brake the
<lb/>bread. This, indeed, appears to have been his con­
<lb/>stant practice. It certainly does not belong to private
<lb/>devotion, and is a species of prayer more apt, per­
<lb/>haps, than any other, to degenerate into a mere form.</p>
          <p>But if we do not find public worship, properly so
<lb/>called, in the life of our Saviour, it is because we look
<lb/>for it in the wrong place. It is not to be sought for
<lb/>in his instructions, either to the multitude at large, or
<lb/>to his disciples in their more private conversations.
<lb/>His public worship was paid where the rest of the
<lb/><name>Jews</name> paid theirs—in the Temple. He came up,
<lb/>with the concourse of assembled multitudes, to the
<lb/>appointed religious festivals; he ate the passover, and
<lb/>associated with his fellow-citizens, even in those rites
<lb/>and that form of worship which he knew was so soon
<lb/>to be abolished.</p>

          <p>Our Lord seems indeed to have been an early and
<lb/>regular frequenter of whatever public worship the
<lb/><name>Jews</name> had among them. What this was, besides their
<lb/>sacrifices and ceremonial observances, <persName>Mr. Wakefield</persName>
<lb/>is infinitely better able than the author of these re­
<lb/>marks to collect from the volumes of Rabbinical
<lb/>learning; but, without going deeper into their anti­
<lb/>quities than what may <choice><sic/><corr>be</corr></choice> gathered from those records of
<lb/>their history which are in the hands of every one, it
<lb/>may be seen that verbal addresses to the Divine Be­
<lb/>ing often accompanied the public expressions of their
<lb/>thanksgiving. In their earliest times we have the
<lb/>song of <persName>Moses</persName>, in the burden of which the
whole peo­
<lb/>ple, led by <persName>Miriam</persName>, joined in chorus. In
a more
<lb/>polished age, the fine prayer of <persName>Solomon</persName> at
the dedi­
<lb/>cation of the Temple, a composition which has never
<lb/>been excelled, comes yet nearer to our ideas of an
<lb/>address to the Divine Being; and the whole people
<lb/>bore a part in the worship by the response, <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">For he
<lb/>is good, for his mercy endureth for ever.</quote> A still
<lb/>more regular service is recorded by <persName>Nehemiah</persName>, 
when
<lb/>the people, after their return from the captivity, en­
<lb/>tered into that solemn renewal of their law described
<lb/>with so much affecting solemnity. They stood and
<lb/>confessed their sins, then they read the law; after
<lb/>which the <name>Levites</name> called upon them to stand up and
<lb/>bless the Lord their God. They stood up accord­
<lb/>ingly, and joined in what, I suppose, the author of the
<lb/><title>Enquiry</title> would call a pretty long prayer. And when
<lb/><persName>Ezra</persName> blessed the Lord, the people answered, Amen,
<lb/>Amen. All this is sufficiently similar not only to the
<lb/>spirit, but to the very routine of our present modes of
<lb/>worship. If it be said, that these instances all arose
<lb/>from peculiar and striking occasions, it may be an­
<lb/>swered, that it is not likely any other would be re­
<lb/>corded; and that the regularity and grace with which

<pb n="298"/>
<milestone n="25(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">298</mw>

<lb/>they seem to have been performed, indicate a people
<lb/>not unaccustomed to such exercises. Indeed the
<lb/><title>Psalms</title> of <persName>David</persName> afford every variety which
any of
<lb/>our prayers do; confession, ascription, thanksgiving,
<lb/>&amp;c. These, it should seem, were many of them set
<lb/>to music, and sung with proper responses; for even
<lb/>in the Temple, the chief business of which was not
<lb/>prayer but sacrifice, the <name>Levites</name> and other singers, at
<lb/>the time of the morning and evening sacrifice, sung
<lb/>psalms of praise to God before the altar, and in the
<lb/>conclusion the priests blessed the people<anchor xml:id="na5" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n5"/>. And it is
<lb/>not probable, that in a later period of their history,
<lb/>amidst a greater degree of refinement and cultivation,
<lb/>they should have contented themselves with mere
<lb/>ritual observances. This at least is evident, if in the
<lb/>time of our Saviour they had no worship similar
<lb/>to ours, he could not mean by any thing he said to
<lb/>hint a dislike of it; and if they had, he must have
<lb/>sanctioned the practice by conforming to it. But in­
<lb/>deed it is acknowledged by most, and <persName>Mr. Wakefield</persName>
<lb/>seems to admit, that after their return from the Baby­
<lb/>lonish captivity, when their hearts were purified by
<lb/>adversity and more attached to their religion, they
<lb/>had regular and stated worship in their synagogues,
<lb/>consisting of forms of prayer, reading the Scriptures,
<lb/>and expounding. In the former, we are told, a minis­
<lb/>ter, called from his office the angel or messenger of
<lb/>the church, officiated as the mouth of the congrega­
<lb/>tion; but for the latter part of the service it was usual
<lb/>to call upon any stranger to take his share, who appear­
<lb/>ed to be sufficiently qualified to read and expound
<lb/>the lessons of the day. And hence probably it was,
<lb/>that our Saviour did not pray in the synagogues,
<lb/>though he often taught there, and interpreted the
<lb/>Sciptures<anchor xml:id="na6" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n6"/>. Of their forms of prayer
eighteen are

<lb/>given, held to be of high antiquity and peculiar sacred­
<lb/>ness; and these are in a strain not dissimilar to the
<lb/>Liturgies of more modern times. In short, if we
<lb/>trace the accounts given us both of the plan of the
<lb/>service, and of its presbyters, ministers, and deacons,
<lb/>it will be found, that the christian church, in its cor­
<lb/>responding officers, its collects, litanies, and exposi­
<lb/>tions, is the legitimate daughter of the Jewish syna­
<lb/>gogue; and we shall be led to admire the singular
<lb/>fate of a nation, decreed to be at once imitated and
<lb/>despised.</p>
          <p>Thus much may be sufficient to say upon a sub­
<lb/>ject which, after all, is purely a question of historical
<lb/>curiosity.</p>
          <p>To return to the character of our Saviour. His
<lb/>great business in the world was instruction; and this
<lb/>he dispensed, not in a systematic, but a popular man­
<lb/>ner; nor yet in a vague and declamatory style, but in
<lb/>a pointed and appropriated one; not where it would
<lb/>most shine, but where it was most wanted. He was
<lb/>the great reformer, the innovator of his day; and the
<lb/>strain of his energetic eloquence was strongly pointed
<lb/>against abuses of all kinds, and precisely those points
<lb/>of duty were most insisted on which he found most
<lb/>neglected. Almost all his discourses are levelled
<lb/>against some prevailing vice of the times, some fash­
<lb/>ionable wordly maxim, some artful gloss of a well
<lb/>known precept, some evasion of an acknowledged 
<lb/>duty. They were delivered as occasion prompted,
<lb/>and therefore it was that they came so home to men's
<lb/>business and bosoms; for he might have delivered
<lb/>the most elaborate lectures on morality, and religion
<lb/>too, without offending the Scribes and <name>Pharisees</name>, if he
<lb/>had confined himself to system, and not attacked cor­
<lb/>ruption. We shall therefore meet with continual
dis­
<lb/>appointment if, in the few scattered discourses, most

<pb n="300"/>
<milestone n="25(6)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">300</mw>

<lb/>of them too conversations, which are preserved to us
<lb/>of our Saviour, we expect to find any thing like a
<lb/>regular code of laws, and still less a formulary of
<lb/>rules. He referred to known laws, and only endeav­
<lb/>oured to restore the spirit of them, and to exalt the
<lb/>motive of obedience. The great duty of honouring
<lb/>our parents had probably not found a place in his in­
<lb/>structions, but to expose the tradition which had made
<lb/>it of none effect. It is therefore a very inconclusive
<lb/>argument against a practice, either, that we are not
<lb/>expressly enjoined it in the Gospel, or that the abuses
<lb/>of it are strongly dwelt upon; and this may serve for
<lb/>a general answer to <persName>Mr. Wakefield's</persName>
objections built
<lb/>upon the animated denunciations against those who,
<lb/>for a pretence, make long prayers, and who cry,
<lb/><said rend="pre(“)post(”)">Lord, Lord</said>—against
vain repetitions—upon the
<lb/>exhortations to worship in spirit and in truth—the de­
<lb/>claration that the <name>Sabbath</name> is made for man, and not
<lb/>man for the <name>Sabbath</name>—with a thousand
others in the
<lb/>same strain, with which the Gospel undoubtedly
<lb/>abounds. But is the utility of a practice destroyed
<lb/>by the abuse of it; or is it of none, because it is not
<lb/>of the chief value?  Are none of our duties subordi­
<lb/>nate, yet real? or have they all the proud motto, <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="slant(italic)">Aut

<lb/>countries where it may be received. Now I do not
<lb/>know what right we have to suppose that the <name>Jews</name> in

<lb/>as to require a mode of worship which deserves to be

<lb/>bly as different from their countrymen in the time of
<lb/>the Judges, as we are from our ancestors of the <name>Saxon</name>
<lb/>heptarchy. They had long had among them most of
<lb/>those causes which tend to develope the mental pow­
<lb/>ers. A system of laws and polity, writers of the most
<lb/>distinguished excellence, commercial and political in­
<lb/>tercourse with other nations; they had acute and
<lb/>subtle disputants, and an acquaintance with different
<lb/>sects of philosophy; and, under these circumstances,
<lb/>it is probable that most of those questions would be
<lb/>agitated which, at similar preiods, have exercised and
<lb/>perplexed the human faculties. Be that as it may,
<lb/><persName>Mr. Wakefield</persName>, by considering public worship
as a 
<lb/>practice to be adapted to the exigencies of the times,
<lb/>evidently abandons the textual ground, in which nar­
<lb/>row path he seemed hitherto to have trod with such
<lb/>scrupulous precaution, and places it on the broader
<lb/>footing of utility. The utility of this practice, there­
<lb/>fore comes next to be considered.</p>
          <p>It is an error, which is extremely incident to minds
<lb/>of a delicate and anxious sensibility, to suppose that
<lb/>practices do no good which do not all the good that
<lb/>might be expected from them. Let those who, in a 
<lb/>desponding mood, are apt to think thus of public wor­
<lb/>ship, calculate, if they can, what would be the conse­
<lb/>quence if it were laid aside. Perhaps it is not easy
<lb/>to estimate how much of the manners as well as the
<lb/>morals—how much of the cultivation as well as the
<lb/>religion of a people is derived from this very source.
<lb/>If a legislator or philosopher were to undertake the
<lb/>civilization of a horde of wild savages, scattered along
<lb/>the waste in the drear loneliness of individual exist­
<lb/>ence, and averse to the faces of each other—if he
<lb/>had formed a plan to gather them together, and give
<lb/>them a principle of cohesion; he probably could not
<lb/>take a more effectual method than by persuading

<lb/>them to meet together in one place—at regular and
<lb/>stated times—and there to join together in a common
<lb/>act, imposing from its solemnity and endearing from
<lb/>the social nature of its exercises. If an adventurer
<lb/>were stranded on some foreign shore, and should find
<lb/>the inhabitants engaaged in such an act, he might draw
<lb/>the conclusion, that the blessings of order, internal
<lb/>peace, mutual confidence, and a considerable degree
<lb/>of information, existed there, as surely as the philoso­
<lb/>pher drew a similar inference from the discovery of
<lb/>mathematical diagrams traced upon the sand. And
<lb/>thus, in fact, it was, that in the early beginnings of
<lb/>society, legislators called in the assistance of religious
<lb/>ideas, and with the charm and melody of solemn
<lb/>hymns, like those of <persName>Orpheus</persName> or of
<persName>Linus</persName>, gathered
<lb/>round them the stupid, incurious barbarians, roused
<lb/>them to attention and softened them into docility.
<lb/>Agreeably to this train of thinking, our great dramatic
<lb/>moralist places the influences of social worship upon a
<lb/>par with the sacred touches of sympathetic sorrow,
<lb/>and the exhilarating pleasures of the hospitable board,
<lb/>and makes it one of the features which distinguish the

          <p>For, independent of the peculiar object of public
<lb/>religious assemblies, many collateral advantages are
<lb/>derived from them which the liberal thinker will by
<lb/>no means despise. The recurrence of appointed
<lb/>days of rest and leisure, which, but for this purpose,

<pb n="303"/>
<milestone n="26(2)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">303</mw>

<lb/>would never have been appointed, divides the weary
<lb/>months of labour and servitude with a separating line
<lb/>of a brighter colour. The church is a centre of union
<lb/>for neighbours, friends, and townsmen; and it is a rea­
<lb/>sonable and a pleasing ground of preference in our
<lb/>attachments, that we have <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">walked to the house of
<lb/>God in company.</quote> Even the common greetings that
<lb/>pass between those who meet there, are hallowed by
<lb/>the occasion of the meeting, and the spirit of civic
<lb/>urbanity is mingled with a still sweeter infusion of
<lb/>christian courtesy. By the recurrence of this inter­
<lb/>course, feuds and animosities are composed, which
<lb/>interrupted the harmony of friends and acquaintance:
<lb/>and those who avoided to meet because they could
<lb/>not forgive, are led to forgive, being obliged to meet.
<lb/>Its effect in humanizing the lower orders of society,
<lb/>and fashioning their manners to the order and deco­
<lb/>rum of civil life, is apparent to every reflecting mind.
<lb/>The poor who have not formed a habit of attending
<lb/>here, remain from week to week in their sordid cells,
<lb/>or issue thence to places of licentiousness more sordid;
<lb/>while those who assemble with the other inhabitants
<lb/>of the place, are brought into the frequent view of
<lb/>their superiors; their persons are known, their ap­
<lb/>pearance noted; the inquiring eye of benevolence
<lb/>pursues them to their humble cottages, and they are
<lb/>not unfrequently led home from social worship to the
<lb/>social meal. If the rich and poor were but thus
<lb/>brought together regularly and universally, that single
<lb/>circumstance would be found sufficient to remove the
<lb/>squalidness of misery, and the bitterness of want; and
<lb/>poverty would exist only as a sober shade in the pic­
<lb/>ture of life, on which the benevolent eye might rest
<lb/>with a degree of complacency when fatigued with the
<lb/>more gaudy colouring of luxury and show.</p>

          <p>The good effect of public worship in this light is
<lb/>remarkably conspicuous in the Sunday schools. Ma­
<lb/>ny of the children who attend have probably not very
<lb/>clearly comprehended any religious system; but the
<lb/>moving and acting under the public eye, together with
<lb/>a sense of duty and moral obligation, which, however
<lb/>obscure, always accompanies the exercises of religion,
<lb/>soon transforms them into a different kind of beings.
<lb/>They acquire a love of neatness and regularity; a
<lb/>sense of propriety insinuates itself into their young
<lb/>minds, and produces, instead of the sullen and un­
<lb/>tamed licentiousness which at once shuns and hates
<lb/>the restraints of better life, the modest deference and
<lb/>chastened demeanour of those who respect others be­
<lb/>cause they respect themselves.</p>
          <p>Public worship conveys a great deal of instruction
<lb/>in an indirect manner. Even those didactic prayers
<lb/>which run out into the enumeration of the attributes
<lb/>of the Divine Being, and of the duties of a virtuous
<lb/>life, though, perhaps, not strictly proper as prayer,
<lb/>have their use in storing the minds of the generality
<lb/>with ideas on these important subjects; and the beau­
<lb/>ty and sublimity of many of these compositions must
<lb/>operate powerfully in lifting the heart to God, and in­
<lb/>spiring it with a love of virtue. Improper as public
<lb/>prayers may have sometimes been, private prayers
<lb/>are likely to be still more so. Whatever contempt
<lb/><persName>Mr. Wakefield</persName> may choose to throw on the official
<lb/>abilities of those who lead the service, it will not be
<lb/>denied that they are generally better informed than
<lb/>those who follow. Men to whom spiritual ideas are
<lb/>familiar from reading and study, do not sufficiently
<lb/>appreciate the advantage which the illiterate enjoy by
<lb/>the fellowship and communication of superior minds,
<lb/>who are qualified to lead their ideas in the right
<lb/>track.</p>

          <p>Public worship is a means of invigorating faith.
<lb/>Though argument be one means of generating belief,
<lb/>and that on which all belief must ultimately rest, it is
<lb/>not the only means, nor, with many minds, the most
<lb/>efficacious. Practical faith is greatly assisted by
<lb/>joining in some act in which the presence and per­
<lb/>suasion of others give a sort of reality to our percep­
<lb/>tion of invisible things. The metaphysical reasoner,
<lb/>entangled in the nets of sophistry, may involve him­
<lb/>self in the intricacies of contradictory syllogisms till
<lb/>reason grows giddy, and scarcely able to hold the
<lb/>balance; but when he acts in presence of his fellow-
<lb/>creatures, his mind resumes its tone and vigour, and
<lb/>social devotion gives a colour and body to the deduc­
<lb/>tions of his reason. <persName>Berkeley</persName>, probably, never 
doubt­
<lb/>ed of the existence of the material world when he
<lb/>had quitted his closet. Some minds are not capable 
<lb/>of that firmness of decision which embraces truth upon
<lb/>a bare preponderancy of argument—some, through a
<lb/>timorous and melancholy spirit, remain always in a
<lb/>perplexed and doubting state, if they rest merely on
<lb/>the conclusions built upon their own investigation.
<lb/>But every act in consequence of our faith, strengthens
<lb/>faith. These, when they enter a place of worship,
<lb/>amidst all the animating accompaniments of social
<lb/>homage, are seized with a happy contagion; slow
<lb/>hesitating doubts vanish in a moment, and give way
<lb/>to sincere and cordial feeling. These are not proofs,
<lb/>it is true; but they are helps, adapted to our nature,
<lb/>necessary to the generality, expedient for all. As
<lb/>for the multitude, so unaccustomed are they to any
<lb/>process of abstruse reasoning, and so much do they
<lb/>require the assistance of some object within the grasp
<lb/>of their senses, that it is to be doubted whether they
<lb/>could be at all persuaded of the existence of a spiritual
<lb/>invisible power, if that existence was not statedly ac­

<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">26*</mw>

<mw type="pageNum">306</mw>

<lb/>knowledged by some act which should impress the
<lb/>reality of it upon their minds, by connecting it with
<lb/>places, persons, and times.</p>
          <p>Let it be observed, in the next place, that Public
<lb/>Worship is a civic meeting. The temple is the only
<lb/>place where human beings, of every rank and sex and
<lb/>age, meet together for one commone purpose, and join
<lb/>together in one common act. Other meetings are
<lb/>either political, or formed for the purposes of splen­
<lb/>dour and amusement; from both which, in this coun­
<lb/>try, the bulk of inhabitants are of necessity excluded.
<lb/>This is the only place, to enter which nothing more is
<lb/>necessary than to be of the same species;—the only
<lb/>place where man meets man not only as an equal but
<lb/>a brother; and where, by contemplating his duties,
<lb/>he may become sensible of his rights. So high and
<lb/>haughty is the spirit of aristocracy, and such the in­
<lb/>creasing pride of the privileged classes, that it is to
<lb/>be feared, if men did not attend at the same place
<lb/>here, it would hardly be believed they were meant to
<lb/>go to the same place hereafter. It is of service to
<lb/>the cause of freedom therefore, no less than to that
<lb/>of virtue, that there is one place where the invidious
<lb/>distinctions of wealth and titles are not admitted;
<lb/>where all are equal, not by making the low, proud;
<lb/>but by making the great, humble. How many a man
<lb/>exists who possesses not the smallest property in this
<lb/>earth, of which you call him lord; who, from the nar­
<lb/>rowing spirit of property, is circumscribed and hem­
<lb/>med in by the possessions of his more opulent neigh­
<lb/>bours, till there is scarcely an unoccupied spot of
<lb/>verdure on which he can set his foot to admire the
<lb/>beauties of nature, or barren mountain on which he
<lb/>can draw the fresh air without a trespass. The en­
<lb/>joyments of life are for others, the labours of it for
<lb/>him. He hears those of his class spoken of, collec­

<pb n="307"/>
<milestone n="26(4)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">307</mw>

<lb/>tively, as of machines, which are to be kept in repair
<lb/>indeed, but of which the sole use is to raise the hap­
<lb/>piness of the higher orders. Where, but in the tem­
<lb/>ples of religion, shall he learn that he is of the same
<lb/>species? He hears there (and were it for the first
<lb/>time, it would be with infinite astonishment,) that all
<lb/>are considered as alike ignorant and to be instructed;
<lb/>all alike sinful, and needing forgiveness; all alike
<lb/>bound by the same obligations, and animated by the
<lb/>same hopes. In the intercourses of the world the
<lb/>poor man is seen, but not noticed; he may be in the
<lb/>presence of his superiours, but he cannot be in their
<lb/>company.  In every other place it would be pre­
<lb/>sumption in him to let his voice be heard along with
<lb/>theirs; here alone they are both raised together, and
<lb/>blended in the full chorus of praise. In every other
<lb/>place it would be an offence to be near them, without
<lb/>showing in his attitudes and deportment the conscious
<lb/>marks of inferiority; here only he sees the prostra­
<lb/>tions of the rich as low as his, and hears them both
<lb/>addressed together in the majestic simplicity of a lan­
<lb/>guage that knows no adulation. Here the poor man
<lb/>learns that, in spite of the distinctions of rank, and the
<lb/>apparent inferiority of his condition, all the true goods
<lb/>of life, all that men dare petition for when in the pre­
<lb/>sence of their Maker—a sound mind, a healthful
<lb/>body, and daily bread,—lie within the scope of his
<lb/>own hopes and endeavours; and that in the large in­
<lb/>heritance to come, his expectations are no less ample
<lb/>than theirs. He rises from his knees, and feels him­
<lb/>self a man. He learns philosophy without its pride,
<lb/>and a spirit of liberty without its turbulence. Every
<lb/>time Social Worship is celebrated, it includes a virtual
<lb/>declaration of the rights of man.</p>
          <p>It may be further observed, that the regular ser­
<lb/>vices of the church are to us the more necessary, as

<pb n="308"/>

<lb/>we have laid aside many of those modes and expres­
<lb/>sions which gave a tincture of religion to our social
<lb/>intercourse and domestic manners. The regard to
<lb/>particular days and seasons is nearly worn off. The
<lb/>forms of epistolary correspondence, and the friendly
<lb/>salutations which, in the last century, breathed a spirit
<lb/>of affectionate piety, are exchanged for the degrading
<lb/>ceremonial of unmeaning servility. The <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">God be
<lb/>with you</quote>, <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">God bless you</quote>, 
<quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">If God permit</quote>,
<lb/><quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">Heaven have
you in its keeping</quote>,—like the grace­
<lb/>ful <foreign xml:lang="ar" rend="slant(italic)">Salam</foreign>, or salutation of peace among the 
eastern
<lb/>nations, kept up in the mind a sense of surround­
<lb/>ing providence of the Divine Being, and might, in
<lb/>some measure, supersede the necessity of more for­
<lb/>mal addresses; whereas, in the present state of so­
<lb/>ciety, a stranger might pass day after day, and week
<lb/>after week, in the bosom of a christian country, with­
<lb/>out suspecting the faith of its inhabitants (if public
<lb/>worship were laid aside) from any circumstance, un­
<lb/>less it were the obscure, half-pronounced blessing,
<lb/>which is still sometimes murmured over the table.</p>
          <p>Let it therefore be considered, when the length and
<lb/>abstracted nature of our public prayers is objected to,
<lb/>that we have nothing to take their place. If our at­
<lb/>tention was excited by processions, garlands, altars,
<lb/>and sacrifices, and every action of our lives intermix­
<lb/>ed with some religious rite, these expressions of our
<lb/>homage might be more readily dispensed with; but,
<lb/>in reality, tedious as <persName>Mr. Wakefield</persName> may
think long
<lb/>prayers, they suit better with the gravity of the na­
<lb/>tional disposition and the philosophic turn of our ideas,
<lb/>than any substitute which could be suggested by the
<lb/>most classic taste. Our prayers are become long,
<lb/>because our ceremonies are short.</p>
          <p>If we may suppose these views of the subject to
<lb/>have established the general utility of public worship,

<pb n="309"/>

<lb/>a question still arises, Is the obligation to it universal?
<lb/>Is attendance on its exercises to be expected from
<lb/>those whose own minds are temples more hallowed
<lb/>than any they can enter; and whose knowledge and
<lb/>cultivation render it probable, that in every popular
<lb/>service they will meet with much to object to, and
<lb/>little to interest a taste rendered fastidious by critical
<lb/>accuracy and elegant refinement? Without presum­
<lb/>ing to condemn the conduct of those who are in every
<lb/>respect so competent to form their own plans accord­
<lb/>ing to their own judgement, I would mention some
<lb/>considerations which, even to them, may present it in
<lb/>a light not unworthy their attention. It is, in the first
<lb/>place, an act of homage, and as such equally incum­
<lb/>bent on all. It is a profession of faith, less dubious
<lb/>even than the performance of moral duties, which
<lb/>may proceed from a well-directed prudence, or the
<lb/>harmony of a happy temperament. It is right and
<lb/>proper that Religion should have the honour of those
<lb/>who are calculated to do her honour. It is likewise
<lb/>useful for a pious man to be connected with pious
<lb/>people as such. Various associations are formed up­
<lb/>on the ground of something which men wish to im­
<lb/>prove or to enjoy in common. Literary men asso­
<lb/>ciate, musical men associate, political men associate
<lb/>together; and as there is a great deal of the com­
<lb/>merce of the world in which it would be impossible
<lb/>to introduce religion, there ought by way of balance
<lb/>to be some society of which that is the ground and
<lb/>principle; otherwise, from the very nature of our
<lb/>connexions with each other, we shall find religion less
<lb/>in our thoughts than almost anything else in which
<lb/>we have an interest, and insensibly it will waste and
<lb/>die away for mere want of aliment. But the attend­
<lb/>ance of men of literature and knowledge is perhaps
<lb/>most important from its effects upon others. The un­

<pb n="310"/>

<lb/>enlightened worship with most pleasure where those
<lb/>worship whose opinions they respect. A religion that
<lb/>is left for the vulgar will not long satisfy even them.
<lb/>There is harshness in saying to the bulk of mankind,
<lb/><quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">Stand aside, we are wiser
than you.</quote> There is
<lb/>harshness in saying, <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">Our
affections cannot move in

<lb/>terest.</quote> In the intercourses of life, the man of ur­
<lb/>banity makes a thousand sacrifices to the conciliating
<lb/>spirit of courtesy and the science of attentions. The
<lb/>exercises of devotion, <persName>Mr. Wakefield</persName> says,
are weari­
<lb/>some. Suppose they were so; how many meetings
<lb/>do we frequent, to how many conversations do we
<lb/>listen with benevolent attention, where our own pleas­
<lb/>ure and our own improvement are not the objects to
<lb/>which our time is given up? He who knows much
<lb/>must expect to be often present where he can learn
<lb/>nothing. While others are receiving information, he
<lb/>is practising a virtue. He, who in common life has
<lb/>learned to mix a regard to the feelings and opinions
<lb/>of others with the pursuit of his own gratifications,
<lb/>will bear, in the spirit of love and charity, the instruc­
<lb/>tion which to him is unnecessary, the amplification
<lb/>which to him is tiresome, the deficiencies of method
<lb/>or of elocution, to which his ear and his judgement
<lb/>are acutely sensible; the imperfections, in short, of
<lb/>men or of societies inferior to himself in taste or know­
<lb/>ledge;—as in conversation he bears with the commu­
<lb/>nicative overflowings of self-importance, the repetition
<lb/>of the well-known tale, and the recurrence of the
<lb/>numerous, burthensome forms of civilized society.</p>
          <p>It becomes us well to consider what would be the
<lb/>consequence, if the desertion of men of superior sense
<lb/>should become general in our assemblies. Not the
<lb/>abolition of public worship,—it is a practice too deeply

<pb n="311"/>
<milestone n="26(6)r" unit="sig"/>

<lb/>rooted in the very propensities of our nature; but this
<lb/>would be the consequence, that it would be thrown
<lb/>into the hands of professional men on the one hand,
<lb/>and of uninformed men on the other. By the one
<lb/>it would be corrupted; it would be debased by the
<lb/>other. Let the friends of moderation and good sense
<lb/>consider whether it is desirable, whether it is even
<lb/>safe, to withdraw from the public the powerful influ­
<lb/>ence of their taste, knowledge, and liberality. Let
<lb/>them consider whether they are prepared to take the
<lb/>consequences of trusting in the hands of any clergy, so
<lb/>powerful an engine as that of public worship and in­
<lb/>struction, without the salutary check of their presence
<lb/>who are best able to distinguish truth from falsehood,
<lb/>to detect unwarrantable pretensions, and to keep with­
<lb/>in tolerable bounds the wanderings of fanaticism.
<lb/>Attentive to the signs of the times, they will have
<lb/>remarked, on the one hand, a disposition to give into
<lb/>deception, greater than might naturally have been
<lb/>presumed of this age, which we compliment with the
<lb/>epithet of enlightened. Empiric extravagancies have
<lb/>been adopted, which violate every sober and consist­
<lb/>ent idea of the laws of nature, and new sects have
<lb/>sprung up, distinguished by the wildest reveries of
<lb/>visionary credulity. On the other, they will have ob­
<lb/>served indications of a desire to discourage the free­
<lb/>dom of investigation, to thicken the veil of mystery,
<lb/>and to revive every obsolete pretension of priestly
<lb/>power, which, in the most ignorant periods, the haugh­
<lb/>tiest churchman has ever dared to assume. They
<lb/>will have read with astonishment, an official exhorta­
<lb/>tion to the inferior clergy—it was not fulminated from
<lb/>the <name>Vatican</name>, it was not dragged to light from the
<lb/>mould and rust of remote ages—It was delivered by

<lb/>the notice and encounter the criticism of an enlighten­
<lb/>ed and philosophic people, and he has not scrupled 
<lb/>to tell them—that good works of a heretic are sin;
<lb/>and that such a one may go to hell with his load of
<lb/>moral merit on his back. He has not scrupled to
<lb/>rank the first philosopher of this kingdom, and the man
<lb/>in it perhaps of all others most actively solicitous for
<lb/>the spread of what he at least believes to be genuine
<lb/>christianity, with infidels and ath<choice><sic>ie</sic><corr>eis</corr></choice>ts; and thus, by
<lb/>obvious inference has piously consigned him to the
<lb/>same doom. He has revived claims and opinions
<lb/>which have upon their heads whole centuries of obliv­
<lb/>ion and contempt; and by slandering Morality, has
<lb/>thought to exalt Religion.—Reflecting on these things,
<lb/>they will consider whether the man of judgement does
<lb/>not desert the post assigned him by Providence, when
<lb/>he withdraws from popular assemblies both the coun­
<lb/>tenance of his example and the imposing awe of his
<lb/>presence; they will conceive themselves as invested
<lb/>with the high commission to take care <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="slant(italic)">nequid res­

          <p>The author of the <title>Enquiry</title> chooses to expatiate,—

<lb/>the different modes of worship practised amon<choice><sic/><corr>g</corr></choice>st men,
<lb/>and concludes it with characterizing this alarming

          <p>But might we not venture to ask,—Where, pray,
<lb/>is the harm of all this? unless indeed I will not allow
<lb/>my neighbour to boil his egg because I roast mine.

<lb/>Eggs are good and nutritious food either way; and
<lb/>in the manner of dressing them, fancy and taste, nay
<lb/>caprice, if you will, may fairly be consulted. If I
<lb/>prefer the leg of a pheasant, and my neighbour finds
<lb/>it dry, let each take what he likes. It would be a
<lb/>conclusion singularly absurd, that eggs and pheasants
<lb/>were not to be eaten. All the harm is in having but
<lb/>one table for guests of every description; and yet
<lb/>even there, were I at a public ordinary, good in other
<lb/>respects, I would rather conform my taste in some
<lb/>measure to that of my neighbour, than be reduced to
<lb/>the melancholy necessity of eating my morsel by my­

          <p>The dissenters cannot be supposed to pass over in
<lb/>silence <persName>Mr. Wakefield's</persName> strictures upon the manner
<lb/>in which they have chosen to conduct their public and
<lb/>social worship. They are surprised  and sorry to find
<lb/>themselves treated with such a mixture of bitterness
<lb/>and levity by a man whose abilities they respect, and
<lb/>whom they have shown themselves ready to embrace
<lb/>as a brother. They have their prejudices, they ac­
<lb/>knowledge—and he perhaps has his. Many forms
<lb/>and observances may to them be dear and venerable,
<lb/>through the force of early habit and association, which
<lb/>to a stranger in their <placeName>Israel</placeName> may appear
uncouth, un­
<lb/>necessary, or even marked with a shade of ridicule.
<lb/>They pity <persName>Mr. Wakefield's</persName> peculiar and
insulated sit­
<lb/>uation. Separating through the purest motives from
<lb/>one church, he has not found another with which he
<lb/>is inclined to associate; divided by difference of opin­
<lb/>ions from one class of <name>christians</name>, and by dissonance of
<lb/>taste from another, he finds the transition too violent
<lb/>from the college to the conventicle: he worships alone
<lb/>because he stands alone; and is, naturally perhaps,
<lb/>led to undervalue that fellowship which has been lost
<lb/>to him between his early predilections and his later

<lb/>opinions. If, however, the dissenters are not so hap­
<lb/>py as to gain his affection, they must be allowed to
<lb/>urge their claims upon his esteem. They wish him
<lb/>to reflect, that neither his classical knowledge, not his
<lb/>critical acumen, nor his acknowledged talents, set him
<lb/>so high in the esteem of good men, as that integrity 
<lb/>which he possesses in common with those whom he
<lb/>despises; they believe further consideration would
<lb/>suggest to him, that it were more candid to pass over
<lb/>those peculiarities which have originated in a delicate
<lb/>conscience and the fervour of devotion; and they can­
<lb/>not help asking, Whether they had reason to expect
<lb/>the severity of sarcastic ridicule from him, whose best
<lb/>praise it is that he has intimated their virtues and shared
<lb/>their sacrifices?</p>
          <p>The dissenters, however, do not make it their boast
<lb/>that they have nothing to reform. They have, per­
<lb/>haps, always been more conspicuous for principle than
<lb/>for taste; their practices are founded upon a preva­
<lb/><supplied reason="damaged" resp="p:sconnell.yuw">l</supplied>ence of
religious fervour, an animation and warmth of
<lb/>piety, which, if it no longer exists, it is vain to simu­
<lb/>late. But what they do make their boast is, that they
<lb/>acknowledge no principle which forbids them to re­
<lb/>form; that they have no leave to ask of bishops,
<lb/>synods, or parliaments, in order to lay aside forms
<lb/>which have become vapid. They are open to con­
<lb/>viction; they are ready to receive with thankfulness
<lb/>every sober and liberal remark which may assist them
<lb/>to improve their religious addresses, and model them
<lb/>to the temper of the public mind. But, with regard
<lb/>to those practices of superabundant devotion, which
<lb/>have drawn down upon them the indignation of the
<lb/>critic, it is the opinion of those who best know the
<lb/>dissenters of the present day, that they might have
<lb/>been suffered to fall quietly of themselves: they are
<lb/>supported by no authority, defrayed by no impost.

<lb/>and slumber over the exercises which their fathers
<lb/>attended with pious alacrity, the sons will of course
<lb/>learn to shorten them. If the disposition of their
<lb/>public services wants animation, as perhaps it does,
<lb/>the silent pews will be deserted one by one, and
<lb/>they will be obliged to seek some other mode of
<lb/>engaging the attention of their audience. But modes
<lb/>and forms affect not the essence of public worship;
<lb/>that may be performed with a form or without one;
<lb/>by words alone, or by symbolical expressions, com­
<lb/>bined with or separated from instruction; with or
<lb/>without the assistance of a particular order appointed
<lb/>to officiate in leading the devotions: it may be cele­
<lb/>brated one day in seven, or in eight, or in ten. In
<lb/>many of these particulars a certain deference should
<lb/>be had to the sentiments of that society with which,
<lb/>upon the whole, we think it best to connect ourselves;
<lb/>and, as time and manners change, these circumstances
<lb/>will vary; but the root of the practice is too strongly
<lb/>interwoven with the texture of the human frame ever
<lb/>to be abandoned. While man has wants, he will pray;
<lb/>while he is sensible of blessings, he will offer praise;
<lb/>while he has common wants and common blessings,
<lb/>he will pray and praise in company with his fellows;
<lb/>and while he feels himself a social being, he will not
<lb/>be persuaded to lay aside social worship.</p>
          <p>It must, however, be acknowledged, that, in order
<lb/>to give public worship all the grace and efficacy of
<lb/>which it is susceptible, much alteration is necessary.
<lb/>It is necessary here, as in every other concern, that
<lb/>timely reformation should prevent neglect. Much
<lb/>might be done by judgement, taste, and a devotional
<lb/>spirit united, to improve the plan of our religious as­

<pb n="316"/>
<milestone n="27(2)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">316</mw>

<lb/>semblies. Should a genius arise amongst us, qualified
<lb/>for such a task, and in circumstances favourable to
<lb/>his being listened to, he would probably remark, first,
<lb/>on the construction of our churches, so ill adapted are
<lb/>a great part of them to the purposes either of hearing
<lb/>or seeing. He would reprobate those little gloomy
<lb/>solitary cells, planned by the spirit of aristocracy,
<lb/>which deform the building no less to the eye of taste
<lb/>than to the eye of benevolence, and, insulating each
<lb/>family within its separate inclosure, favour at once the
<lb/>pride of rank and the laziness of indulgence. He
<lb/>might choose for these structures something of the
<lb/>amphitheatrical form, where the minister, on a raised
<lb/>platform, should be beheld with ease by the whole
<lb/>wave of people, at once bending together in deep hu­
<lb/>miliation, or spreading forth their hands in the earnest­
<lb/>ness of petition. It would certainly be found desira­
<lb/>ble that the people should themselves have a large
<lb/>share in the performance of the service, as the inter­
<lb/>mixture of their voices would both introduce more
<lb/>variety and greater animation; provided pains were
<lb/>taken by proper teaching to enable them to bear their
<lb/>part with a decorum and propriety, which, it must be
<lb/>confessed, we do not see at present amongst those
<lb/>whose public services possess the advantage of re­
<lb/>sponses. The explaining, and teaching them to recite,
<lb/>such hymns and collects as it might be thought proper
<lb/>they should bear a part in, would form a pleasing and
<lb/>useful branch of the instruction of young people, and
<lb/>of the lower classes; it would give them an interest in
<lb/>the public service, and might fill up agreeably a va­
<lb/>cant hour either on the <name>Sunday</name> or on some other lei­
<lb/>sure day, especially if they were likewise regularly
<lb/>instructed in singing for the same purpose. As we
<lb/>have never seen, perhaps we can hardly conceive,
<lb/>the effect which the united voices of a whole congre­

<pb n="317"/>
<milestone n="27(3)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">317</mw>

<lb/>gation, all in the lively expression of one feeling,
<lb/>would have upon the mind. We should then perceive
<lb/>not only that we were doing the same thing in the
<lb/>same place, but that we were doing it with one ac­
<lb/>cord. The deep silence of listening expectation, the
<lb/>burst of united praises, the solemn pauses that invite
<lb/>reflection, the varied tones of humiliation, gratitude,
<lb/>or persuasion, would swell and melt the heart by
<lb/>turns; nor would there be any reason to guard against
<lb/>the wandering eye, when every object it rested on
<lb/>must forcibly recall it to the duties of the place.—
<lb/>Possibly it might be found expedient to separate
<lb/>worship from instruction; the learned teacher from
<lb/>the leader of the public devotions, in whom voice, and
<lb/>popular talents, might perhaps be allowed to supersede
<lb/>a more deep and critical acquaintance with the doc­
<lb/>trines of theology. One consequence, at least, would
<lb/>follow such a separation, that instruction would be
<lb/>given more systematically.—Nothing, that is taught at
<lb/>all, is taught in so vague and desultory a manner as
<lb/>the doctrines of religion. A congregation may attend
<lb/>for years, even a good preacher, and never hear the
<lb/>evidences of either natural or revealed religion regu­
<lb/>larly explained to them; they may attend for years,
<lb/>and never hear a connected system of moral duties ex­
<lb/>tending to the different situations and relations of life:
<lb/>they may attend for years, and not even gain any clear
<lb/>idea of the history and chronology of the <rs type="title">Old</rs> and
<lb/><rs type="title">New Testament</rs>, which are read to them every <name>Sun­
<lb/>day</name>. They will hear abundance of excellent doc­
<lb/>trine, and will often feel their hearts warmed and their
<lb/>minds edified; but their ideas upon these subjects will
<lb/>be confused and imperfect, because they are treated
<lb/>on in a manner so totally different from every thing
<lb/>else which bears the name of instruction. This is
<lb/>probably owing, in a great measure, to the custom of

<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">27*</mw>
<pb n="318"/>
<milestone n="27(3)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">318</mw>

<lb/>prefixing to every pulpit-discourse a sentence, taken
<lb/>indiscriminately from any part of the Scriptures, un­
<lb/>der the name of a text, which at first implying an
<lb/>exposition, was afterwards used to suggest a subject;
<lb/>and is now, by degrees, dwindling into a motto.—
<lb/>Still, however, the custom subsists; and while it
<lb/>serves to supersede a more methodical course of in­
<lb/>struction, tends to keep up in the minds of the generality
<lb/>of hearers a very superstitious idea,—not now enter­
<lb/>tained, it is to be presumed, by the generality of those
<lb/>who teach,—of the equal sacredness and importance
<lb/>of every part of so miscellaneous a collection.</p>
          <p>If these insulated discourses, of which each is com­
<lb/>plete in itself, and therefore can have but little com­
<lb/>pass, were digested into a regular plan of lectures,
<lb/>supported by a course of reading, to which the audi­
<lb/>ence might be directed, it would have the further
<lb/>advantage of rousing the inattentive and restraining
<lb/>the rambling hearer by the interest which would be
<lb/>created by such a connected series of information.
<lb/>They would occupy a larger space in the mind, they
<lb/>would more frequently be the subject of recollection
<lb/>and meditation; there would be a fear of missing one
<lb/>link in such a chain of truths; and the more intelligent
<lb/>part of a congregation might find a useful and interest­
<lb/>ing employment in assisting the teacher in the instruc­
<lb/>tion of those who were not able to comprehend
<lb/>instruction with the same facility as themselves. When
<lb/>such a course of instruction had been delivered, it
<lb/>would not be expected that discourses, into which
<lb/>men of genius and learning had digested their best
<lb/>thoughts, should be thrown by, or brought forward
<lb/>again, as it were, by stealth; but they would be regu­
<lb/>larly and avowedly repeated at proper intervals. It is
<lb/>usual upon the continent for a set of sermons to be
<lb/>delivered in several churches, each of which has its

<mw type="pageNum">319</mw>

<lb/>officiating minister for the stated public worship; and
<lb/>thus a whole district partakes the advantage of the
<lb/>labours of a man eminent for composition. Perhaps
<lb/>it might be desirable to join to religious information
<lb/>some instruction in the laws of our country, which
<lb/>are, or ought to be, founded upon morals; and which,
<lb/>by a strange solecism, are obligatory upon all, and
<lb/>scarcely promulgated, much less explained.—Many
<lb/>ideas will offer themselves to a thinking man, who
<lb/>wishes not to abolish, but to improve the public wor­
<lb/>ship of his country. These are only hints, offered
<lb/>with diffidence and respect, to those who are able to
<lb/>judge of and carry them into effect.</p>
          <p>Above all it would be desirable to separate from
<lb/>religion that idea of gloom which in this country has
<lb/>but too generally accompanied it. The fact cannot
<lb/>be denied; the cause must be sought, partly in our
<lb/>national character, which, I am afraid, is not naturally
<lb/>either very cheerful or very social, and which we shall
<lb/>do well to meliorate by every possible attention to our
<lb/>habits of life;—and partly to the colour of our reli­
<lb/>gious systems. No one who embraces the common
<lb/>idea of future torments, together with the doctrine of
<lb/>election and reprobation, the insufficiency of virtue to
<lb/>escape the wrath of God, and the strange absurdity
<lb/>which, it should seem, through similarity of sound
<lb/>alone, has been admitted as an axiom, that sins com­
<lb/>mitted against an infinite being do therefore deserve
<lb/>infinite punishment—no one, I will venture to assert,
<lb/>can believe such tenets, and have them often in his
<lb/>thoughts, and yet be cheerful. Whence a system has
<lb/>arisen so incompatible with that justice and benevo­
<lb/>lence, which, in the discourses of our Saviour, are
<lb/>represented as the most essential attributes of the
<lb/>Divine Being, is not easy to trace. It is probable,
<lb/>however, that power, being the most prominent fea­

<pb n="320"/>
<milestone n="27(4)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">320</mw>

<lb/>ture in our conceptions of the Creator, and that of
<lb/>which we see the most striking image here on earth,
<lb/>(their being a greater portion of uncontrolled power
<lb/>than of unmixed wisdom or goodness to be found
<lb/>amongst human beings), the Deity would naturally
<lb/>be likened to an absolute monarch;—and most ab­
<lb/>solute monarchs having been tyrants, jealous of their
<lb/>sovereignty, averse to freedom of investigation, order­
<lb/>ing affairs, not with a view to the happiness of their
<lb/>subjects, but to the advancement of their own glory;
<lb/>not to be approached but with rich gifts and offerings;
<lb/>bestowing favours, not in proportion to merit, but
<lb/>from the pure influence of caprice and blind partiality;
<lb/>to those who have offended them, severe and unfor­
<lb/>giving, except induced to pardon by the importunate
<lb/>intercession of some favourite; confining their ene­
<lb/>mies, when they had overcome them, after a contest,
<lb/>in deep dark dungeons under ground, or putting them
<lb/>to death in the prolonged misery of excruciating tor­
<lb/>tures—these features of human depravity have been
<lb/>most faithfully transferred to the Supreme Being; and
<lb/>men have imaged to themselves how a <persName>Nero</persName> or a
<lb/><persName>Domitian</persName> would have acted, if from the extent 
of their
<lb/>dominion there had been no escape, and to the dura­
<lb/>tion of it no period.</p>
          <p>These ideas of the vulgar belief, terrible, but as
<lb/>yet vague and undefined, passed into the speculations
<lb/>of the schoolmen, by whom they were combined with
<lb/>the metaphysical idea of eternity, arranged in specific
<lb/>propositions, fixed in creeds, and elaborated into sys­
<lb/>tems, till at length they have been sublimed into all
<lb/>the tremendous horrors of the Calvinistic faith. These
<lb/>doctrines, it is true, among thinking people are losing
<lb/>ground; but there is still apparent, in that class called
<lb/>serious <name>christians</name>, a tenderness in exposing them; a
<lb/>sort of leaning towards them,—as in walking over a

<pb n="321"/>
<milestone n="27(5)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">321</mw>

<lb/>precipice one should lean to the safest side; an idea
<lb/>that they are, if not true, at least good to <choice><sic>to</sic><corr/></choice> 
be be­
<lb/>lieved, and that a salutary error is better than a dan­
<lb/>gerous truth. But that error can neither be salutary
<lb/>nor harmless, which attributes to the Deity injustice
<lb/>and cruelty; and that religion must have the worst of
<lb/>tendencies, which renders it dangerous for man to im­
<lb/>itate the being whom he worships. Let those who
<lb/>hold such tenets consider, that the invisible Creator
<lb/>has no name, and is identified only by his character;
<lb/>and they will tremble to think what being they are
<lb/>worshipping, when they invoke a power, capable of
<lb/>producing existence in order to continue it in never-
<lb/>ending torments. The God of the Assembly's Cate­
<lb/>chism is not the same God with the Deity of <persName>Thom­
<lb/>son's</persName> <title>Seasons</title>, and of
<persName>Hutcheson's</persName> <title>Ethics</title>. Unity of
<lb/>character, in what we adore, is much more essential
<lb/>than unity of person. We often boast, and with rea­
<lb/>son, of the purity of our religion, as opposed to the
<lb/>grossness of the theology of the <name>Greeks</name> and <name>Romans;</name>
<lb/>but we should remember that cruelty is as much worse
<lb/>than licentiousness, as a <name>Moloch</name> is worse than a satyr.
<lb/>—When will <name>christians</name> permit themselves to believe
<lb/>that the same conduct which gains them the approba­
<lb/>tion of good men here, will secure the favour of Heav­
<lb/>en hereafter? When will they cease making their
<lb/>court to their Maker by the same servile debasement
<lb/>and affectation of lowliness by which the vain poten­
<lb/>tates of the earth are flattered? When a harmless and
<lb/>well-meaning man, in the exaggerated figures of theo­
<lb/>logical rhetoric, calls himself the vilest of sinners, it is
<lb/>in precisely the same spirit of false humility, in which
<lb/>the courtier uses degrading and disqualifying express­
<lb/>ions, when he speaks of himself in his adulatory ad­
<lb/>dresses to his sovereign. When a good man draws

<pb n="322"/>
<milestone n="27(5)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">322</mw>

<lb/>near the close of a life, not free indeed from faults,
<lb/>but pure from crime, a life spent in the habitual exer­
<lb/>cise of all those virtues which adorn and dignify hu­
<lb/>man nature, and in the uniform approach to that per­
<lb/>fection which is confessedly unattainable in this im­
<lb/>perfect state; when a man—perhaps like <persName>Dr. Price</persName>,
<lb/>whose name will be ever pronounced with affectionate
<lb/>veneration and deep regard by all the friends of phi­
<lb/>losophy, virtue, and mankind—is about to resign his
<lb/>soul into the hands of his Maker, he ought to do it,
<lb/>not only with a reliance on his mercy, but his justice;
<lb/>a generous confidence and pious resignation should be
<lb/>blended in his deportment. It does not become him
<lb/>to pay the blasphemous homage of deprecating the
<lb/>wrath of God, when he ought to throw himself into
<lb/>the arms of his love. He is not to think that virtue is
<lb/>one thing here, and another in heaven; or that he, on
<lb/>whom blessings and eulogiums are ready to burst from
<lb/>all honest tongues, can be an object of punishment
<lb/>with Him who is infinitely more benevolent than any
<lb/>of his creatures.</p>
          <p>These remarks may be thought foreign to the sub­
<lb/>ject in question; but in fact they are not so. Public
<lb/>worship will be tinctured with gloom while our ideas of
<lb/>its object are darkened by superstition; it will be in­
<lb/>fected with hypocrisy while its professions and tenets
<lb/>run counter to the genuine unperverted moral sense of
<lb/>mankind; it will not meet the countenance of philoso­
<lb/>phers so long as we are obliged to unlearn our ethics,
<lb/>in order to learn divinity. Let it be considered that
<lb/>these opinions greatly favour immorality. The doc­
<lb/>trine that all are vile, and equally merit a state of pun­
<lb/>ishment, is an idea as consolatory to the profligate,
<lb/>as it is humiliating to the saint; and that is one
<lb/>reason why it has always been a favourite doctrine.

<lb/>The indecent confidences of a <persName>Dodd</persName>,<anchor xml:id="na7" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n7"/> and the debas­
<lb/>ing terrors of a <persName>Johnson</persName>, or of more
blameless men
<lb/>than he, spring from one and the same source. It
<lb/>prevents the genuine workings of real penitence, by
<lb/>enjoining confessions of imaginary demerit; it quench­
<lb/>es religious gratitude, because, conceiving only of two
<lb/>states of retribution, both in the extreme, and feeling
<lb/>that our crimes whatever they may be, cannot have
<lb/>deserved the one, we are not sufficiently thankful for
<lb/>the prospect of the other, which we look upon as only
<lb/>a necessary alternative. Lastly, it dissolves the con­
<lb/>nexion between religion and common life, by introdu­
<lb/>cing a set of phrases and a standard of moral feeling,
<lb/>totally different from those ideas of praise and blame,
<lb/>merit and demerit, upon which we do and must act,
<lb/>in our commerce with our fellow-creatures.</p>
          <p>There are periods in which the human mind seems
<lb/>to slumber, but this is not one of them. A keen spi­
<lb/>rit of research is now abroad, and demands reform.
<lb/>Perhaps in none of the nations of <placeName>Europe</placeName>
will their
<lb/>articles of faith, or their church establishments, or their
<lb/>modes of worship, be able to maintain their ground for
<lb/>many years in exactly the same position in which they
<lb/>stand at present. Religion and manners reciprocally
<lb/>act upon one another. As religion, well understood,
<lb/>is a most powerful agent in meliorating and softening our
<lb/>manners; so, on the other hand, manners as they ad­
<lb/>vance in cultivation, tend to correct and refine our reli­
<lb/>gion. Thus, to a nation in any degree acquainted with
<lb/>the social feelings, human sacrifices and sanguinary
<lb/>rites could never long appear obligatory. The mild spi­
<lb/>rit of christianity has, no doubt, had its influence in soft­

<pb n="324"/>
<milestone n="27(6)v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum"><choice><sic>243</sic><corr>324</corr></choice></mw>

<lb/>ening the ferocity of the Gothic times; and the increas­
<lb/>ing humanity of the present period will, in its turn, pro­
<lb/>duce juster ideas of christianity, and diffuse through
<lb/>the solemnities of our worship, the celebration of our
<lb/><name>sabbaths</name>, and every observance connected with reli­
<lb/>gion, that air of amenity and sweetness, which is the
<lb/>offspring of literature and the peaceful intercourses of
<lb/>society. The age which has demolished dungeons,
<lb/>rejected torture, and given so fair a prospect of abolish­
<lb/>ing the iniquity of the slave-trade, cannot long retain
<lb/>among its articles of belief the gloomy perplexities of
<lb/><name>Calvinism</name>, and the heart-withering perspective of cruel
<lb/>and never-ending punishments.</p>
