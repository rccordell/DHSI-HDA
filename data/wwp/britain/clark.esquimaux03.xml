               <lb/>ful satisfaction of beholding them on the
               <lb/>Hall steps. Accompanied by her excel­
               <lb/>lent friend, <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName>, they entered
               <lb/>the boat, and were soon clasped in her
               <lb/>arms. Words are inadequate to describe
               <lb/>her sensations of happiness, from the severe
               <lb/>shock and terror, on their account, that
               <lb/>she had sustained.
            </p>
            <p>After <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> had landed them on
               <lb/>the bank, he returned for the servants, and
               <lb/>conveyed them safely from the house to
               <lb/>the other side of the river. <persName>Felix</persName>, <persName>Rose</persName>,
               <lb/>and <persName>Jane</persName>, had secured what they consider­
               <lb/>ed most valuable; yet, had they escaped
               <lb/>without saving any thing from the devour­
               <lb/>ing flames, their mother would have been
               <lb/>contented, since their lives were spared.
               <lb/><persName>Robin</persName> had conveyed likewise from the
               <lb/>mansion a box of plate, which he placed

            <p>In the meantime the postillion returned,
               <lb/>after having spread the report of the fire
               <lb/>and summoned assistance. A numerous

               <lb/>and by their activity, and the quantity of
               <lb/>water near, with their persevering exer­
               <lb/>tions, the fire began to burn less furiously.
               <lb/>The firemen arrived shortly after from <placeName>Ex­
               <lb/>eter</placeName>, and by their zeal and perseverance
               <lb/>succeeded in extinguishing the flames, and
               <lb/>half only of the building was destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>Before the conflagration was subdued,
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> proposed going to the house
               <lb/>of her friend, <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName>, who was expect­
               <lb/>ed from <placeName>London</placeName> in a week, and requested
               <lb/><persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> to accompany them. But
               <lb/>this worthy man declined attending them,
               <lb/>observing that he was determined to re­
               <lb/>main with her servants, to watch and
               <lb/>guard their property from depredation.
               <lb/>He promised, however, to be with her in
               <lb/>the morning to breakfast.</p>
            <p>Most fortunately for <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, she
               <lb/>found all <persName>Mrs. Fane's</persName> household up, the

               <lb/>knowing how much his mistress was at­
               <lb/>tached to <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, was gone to her
               <lb/>house to offer his services, but in the con­
               <lb/>fusion he was unobserved by her. Beds
               <lb/>were soon prepared, as they had all been,
               <lb/>aired, and the apartments arranged, in ex­
               <lb/>pectation of their mistress's speedy return.

            <p><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, quite exhausted with fa­
               <lb/>tigue and anxiety, retired immediately to
               <lb/>repose her wearied frame, and her exam­
               <lb/>ple was imitated by her son and daughters.
               <lb/>They slept soundly, being quite overcome
               <lb/>with the agitation they had suffered, and
               <lb/>did not awake till <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> made them
               <lb/>a visit.

               <lb/>was generally uninhabited, was the only
               <lb/>part of the structure totally destroyed.

               <lb/>mation and zealous ardour displayed on

               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> had spoken in the highest
               <lb/>terms. To serve the wife and family of
               <lb/>his friend, the general, he had endured ex­
               <lb/>treme trouble and fatigue. Under an ex­
               <lb/>terior, cold, forbidding, and formal, he
               <lb/>veiled the most noble heart that ever
               <lb/>graced the human breast. He was, as the

               <lb/>them despised and ridiculed for their eco­
               <lb/>nomy, but it was frequently a proper fru­
               <lb/>gality and prudence, that enabled them, by
               <lb/>not impoverishing their fortune with pro­
               <lb/>fusion, to assist their friends in adversity.
            </p>
            <p>But <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> had not one narrow
               <lb/>sentiment—his hand, his heart, his purse,
               <lb/>were at the service of his friends. <persName>Gene­
               <lb/>ral Douglas</persName> and himself were boys toge­
               <lb/>ther at the same school, and as they ad­
               <lb/>vanced in  years, their friendship grew
               <lb/>with them. Their regard continued till
               <lb/>the general's duty as an officer called him
               <lb/>to a foreign country.
            </p>
            <p>A short time afterwards, <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName>
               <lb/>went to the <placeName>East Indies</placeName>, where he acquired
               <lb/>a princely fortune, which, united to the
               <lb/>small estates left him by his father, form­
               <lb/>ed altogether a very handsome income.
               <lb/>He purchased a valuable domain, in the
               <lb/>neighbourhood of <persName>sir James Douglas's</persName> seat,
               <lb/>where the general and himself renewed

               <lb/>friendship of their early days. It was a
               <lb/>lucky circumstance for <persName>general Douglas</persName>,
               <lb/>from the events that had lately happened
               <lb/>in <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, which made the advice and
               <lb/>society of a sincere friend a soothing con­
               <lb/>solation.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> and her husband seemed
               <lb/>destined to experience the utmost severity
               <lb/>of affliction, as the incidents to be related
               <lb/>will prove.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Sir James</persName> appeared to be more attached
               <lb/>to his brother than he had ever been to
               <lb/>any thing before, and the longer he was
               <lb/>with him, he was apparently most affec­
               <lb/>tionate, much more than it was possible to
               <lb/>imagine so avaricious and contracted a
               <lb/>mind could be. But the truth was, that
               <lb/>his tedious and severe illness had made
               <lb/>him reflect seriously. He had no other
               <lb/>near relation, who evinced the least inter­
               <lb/>est for his welfare; and on the continued
               <lb/>bed of sickness he felt how helpless and
               <lb/>dependent a creature man is. How su­
               <lb/>perior he found the attentive kindness of
            <mw type="sig" rend="align(center)break(yes)">B4</mw>

               <lb/>a relative, who is capable of attachment, to
               <lb/>the attendance of a hireling!
            </p>
            <p>In consequence of these just reflections,
               <lb/>he made a will in his brother <persName>general
               <lb/>Douglas's</persName> favour, attested by proper wit­
               <lb/>nesses, in which he bequeathed all his per­
               <lb/>sonal property, and every thing he pos­
               <lb/>sessed, to him and his family. A few
               <lb/>days after, <persName>sir James</persName> expired in the arms
               <lb/>of his brother, blessing him and his wife
               <lb/>with his latest breath, for the gentle, ami­
               <lb/>able conduct of <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> had gained
               <lb/>his esteem and regard.
            </p>
            <p>The general, now <persName>sir Felix Douglas</persName>,
               <lb/>took possession of his brother's bequest,
               <lb/>and intended, when his affairs were ar­
               <lb/>ranged, to send for his family to the Cas­
               <lb/>tle. It was his intention to make great
               <lb/>improvements at <placeName>Towie Craigs</placeName>, the ancient
               <lb/>residence of his ancestors for some hun­
               <lb/>dreds of years back, and to reside there
               <lb/>half the year.
            </p>
            <p>One day, when these thoughts occupied
               <lb/>his mind, he was interrupted by the ser­

            <pb/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="B5r"/>

               <lb/>vant's announcing that a gentleman wish­
               <lb/>ed to speak with him immediately, on
               <lb/>particular business. Always easy of ac­
               <lb/>cess, <persName>sir Felix</persName> desired him to be introduced.
            </p>
            <p>A short thick man, dressed in black,
               <lb/>with an awkward stooping gait, was now
               <lb/>admitted. He bowed so profoundly,
               <lb/>that his head nearly touched the ground.
               <lb/>His countenance expressed the deepest
               <lb/>cunning, and his small grey eyes were
               <lb/>sunk beneath their heavy lids.—<said>I am
               <lb/>sorry, sir,</said> said he, bowing low again,
               <lb/>as he approached, <said>to be obliged to com­
               <lb/>municate evil tidings, for I presume you
               <lb/>are not aware that there is another per­
               <lb/>son claims the estate of the late <persName>sir James</persName>,
               <lb/>to which you consider yourself the lawful
               <lb/>heir.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Sir Felix</persName> looked astonished, and then
               <lb/>replied—<said>I should indeed be grieved to
               <lb/>learn that my brother had acted with du­
               <lb/>plicity to me in his dying moments. If
               <lb/>he has, the deception is unpardonable, and
               <lb/>it would more sensibly afflict me, that he

               <lb/>should have practised deceit at that awful
               <lb/>hour, than all I may suffer from the loss
               <lb/>of his fortune. I must, however, request
               <lb/>to be acquainted with the name of the
               <lb/>person who wishes to deprive me of the
               <lb/>property <persName>sir James</persName> bequeathed to me and
               <lb/>my children, and by what right he intends
               <lb/>to dispossess me of the estates.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>He demands the fortune of the late
               <lb/><persName>sir James Douglas</persName>,</said> rejoined <persName>Mr. Graham</persName>,
               <lb/>the attorney, with repeated low bows, <said>as
               <lb/>his son and heir; and his mother likewise
               <lb/>claims her part, as his father's wife.</said>
            </p>
            <p>At these words <persName>sir Felix</persName> felt struck as
               <lb/>with a mortal blow. It was not for him­
               <lb/>self, but for his loved wife and children,
               <lb/>that he shuddered at the deprivation of
               <lb/>the fortune he had so long expected to re­
               <lb/>ceive; his brother's bequest appeared to
               <lb/>have rewarded him for his past sufferings,
               <lb/>by allowing him to make his wife and
               <lb/>children comfortable and happy. In the
               <lb/>well-founded expectation of this property,
               <lb/>he had also expended more money than
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">he</mw>

            <milestone unit="sig" n="B6r"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">11</mw>
               <lb/>he should otherwise have done, and liber­
               <lb/>ally lent a brother-officer some hundreds,
               <lb/>moved at his being in distress, with a
               <lb/>young family to support.
            </p>
            <p>Having recovered his composure, after
               <lb/>a pause of some minutes in which his ex­
               <lb/>pressive face denoted the inward emotion
               <lb/>of his soul, he calmly inquired where this
               <lb/>wife and child resided, whom he now heard
               <lb/>mentioned for the first time?
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Graham</persName> replied, again bowing very
               <lb/>low, which mockery of respect quite dis­
               <lb/>gusted <persName>sir Felix</persName>, from the messenger of
               <lb/>such ill news, that his honour, the late <persName>sir
               <lb/>James</persName>, was privately married, about nine
               <lb/>years ago, to <persName>Helen Ramsay</persName>, by whom he
               <lb/>had one son, named <persName>James</persName>, and that she
               <lb/>lived in a cottage near the Castle, with
               <lb/>her mother and child. Before his last ill­
               <lb/>ness, <persName>sir James</persName> often visited them, and
               <lb/>gave <persName>Helen</persName> money at different times,
               <lb/>which amply provided for their mainte­
               <lb/>nance; yet he continued from year to year
               <lb/>to put off the public declaration of his
            <mw type="sig" rend="align(center)break(yes)">B6</mw>

               <lb/>marriage. When <persName>Helen's</persName> situation, in
               <lb/>consequence of her union with <persName>sir James</persName>,
               <lb/>was made known to him, he dismissed her
               <lb/>from the Castle, where she resided as one
               <lb/>of his servants. <persName>Helen</persName> repaired to her
               <lb/>mother's cottage. There she was confined,
               <lb/>and her infant was supposed by the neigh­
               <lb/>bours to be the natural son of a <persName>Davie
               <lb/>M'Gregor</persName>, a young man who worked as
               <lb/>a labourer in <persName>sir James's</persName> grounds. To
               <lb/>oblige his master, he pretended to be the
               <lb/>father of the little boy, as <persName>sir James</persName> was
               <lb/>then desirous that his marriage with a ser­
               <lb/>vant should be kept a secret till after his
               <lb/>decease. <persName>Davie</persName> consequently decamped,
               <lb/>to avoid the disgrace and punishment that
               <lb/>attend affairs of this description in <placeName>Scot­
               <lb/>land</placeName>, and was accounted the parent of
               <lb/><persName>Helen's</persName> child, for which unmerited stigma
               <lb/>he received a sum of money from his mas­
               <lb/>ter.
            </p>
            <p>The general, as we shall again call him
               <lb/>(for he instantly dropped the title of ba­
               <lb/>ronet), inquired the name of the clergy­
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">man</mw>
            <pb/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="B7r"/>

               <lb/>man who had united his brother to <persName>Helen
               <lb/>Ramsay</persName>, and his present residence.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Graham</persName> then informed him that
               <lb/>the last intelligence he had received of
               <lb/>his being living was from <placeName>Edinburgh</placeName>,
               <lb/>where he resided in <placeName>Castle-street</placeName>. He was
               <lb/>named <persName>Murray</persName>, and had given <persName>Helen</persName> a
               <lb/>certificate of her marriage, attested by him
               <lb/>and other witnesses, who were, unluckily,
               <lb/>likewise absent; but this certificate <persName>Helen</persName>
               <lb/>carefully preserved.
            </p>
            <p>The general observed, that the whole of
               <lb/>this tale appeared to him very improbable
               <lb/>and mysterious, adding, that he should
               <lb/>not certainly resign his claim of right to
               <lb/>the estates and property bequeathed him
               <lb/>by his brother, till he had thoroughly in­
               <lb/>vestigated the entire transaction of this
               <lb/>singular affair, which, he must confess,
               <lb/>caused him a great share of uneasiness.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Graham</persName>, with a hypocritical face,
               <lb/>now took leave, saying, he hoped the ge­
               <lb/>neral would not be offended with him,
               <lb/>who had no further interest in the busi­
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">ness</mw>

               <lb/>ness than being merely employed by the
               <lb/>widow as her solicitor.
            </p>
            <p>Immediately after his departure, <persName>gene­
               <lb/>ral Douglas</persName> rode over to <persName>Lochnell</persName>, to his
               <lb/>friend <persName>Moncrief</persName>. He related all that pass­
               <lb/>ed with the attorney, and consulted with
               <lb/>him in what manner to act for the best.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> instantly conceived this
               <lb/>story to be a complete fabrication, and
               <lb/>deep plot, to obtain possession of <persName>sir James
               <lb/>Douglas's</persName> property, or to extort money.
               <lb/>Had the general offered the lawyer a con­
               <lb/>siderable sum, he doubted not that he
               <lb/>would have consented directly to hush up
               <lb/>the business. <persName>Graham</persName>, he informed him,
               <lb/>was quite a pettifogger, and bore the cha­
               <lb/>racter of being often guilty of the most
               <lb/>dishonourable actions, if his interest was
               <lb/>concerned: but he trusted that they should
               <lb/>be enabled to unmask the knave, and
               <lb/>worthless woman his tool.
            </p>
            <p><persName>General Douglas</persName> and <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> re­
               <lb/>paired together to the cottage that had

               <lb/>received by <persName>Helen Ramsay</persName>, a tall, raw­
               <lb/>boned, dark woman, with hard features.
               <lb/>Her son was with her, very unlike his mo­
               <lb/>ther, having coarse red hair, a fair skin, ex­
               <lb/>ceedingly freckled, and dressed in ragged
               <lb/>attire.
            </p>
            <p>Helen was closely questioned by the ge­
               <lb/>neral and <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName>, but she persisted
               <lb/>without variation in the truth of her sto­
               <lb/>ry, and produced a dirty piece of paper,
               <lb/>signed by <persName>Mr. Murray</persName>, as an evidence of
               <lb/>the legality of her marriage.

               <lb/>crief</persName>, <said>that if you were, as you profess to
               <lb/>be, the wife of the late <persName>sir James</persName>, that you
               <lb/>did not insist on being clothed and main­
               <lb/>tained more respectably.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Helen</persName> answered, that all the country
               <lb/>were all acquainted with his stinginess,
               <lb/>which made him grudge the least expence.
               <lb/>He had many a time mentioned, that the
               <lb/>reason he did not take her home, and in­
               <lb/>troduce her as his wife, was from the ap­
               <lb/>prehension of expending more money.

               <lb/>Frequently he lamented having commit­
               <lb/>ted himself by marrying her, as it was very
               <lb/>expensive to assist her and pay for the
               <lb/>support of his boy.
            </p>
            <p>Finding nothing satisfactory could be
               <lb/>obtained from <persName>Helen</persName>, who was apparently
               <lb/>artful, bold, and wicked, they left the
               <lb/>cottage, both convinced that the late <persName>sir
               <lb/>James</persName> had more taste than to have ex­
               <lb/>posed himself from the attachment for this
               <lb/>low, ugly, cunning woman.
            </p>
            <p><said>We must set out for <placeName>Edinburgh</placeName>,</said>
               <lb/>said <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName>, <said>and endeavour to
               <lb/>have an interview with the clergyman,
               <lb/>who, <persName>Helen</persName> affirms, married her to <persName>sir
               <lb/>James</persName>, as it appears to me a tale of mys­
               <lb/>tery. Your brother's chief fault was a
               <lb/>miserly propensity, but his character ne­
               <lb/>ver appeared to me to be the least decep­
               <lb/>tious. A good fortune should not, there­
               <lb/>fore, be tamely resigned, till a proper inves­
               <lb/>tigation has taken place.</said>
            </p>
            <p>The general now observed to his friend,

               <lb/>ably keep him a long time separated from
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, it was much his wish for
               <lb/>her to return to his daughters, from whom
               <lb/>they had both been so long absent. As
               <lb/>his title to the Castle and estates was now
               <lb/>disputed, he was particularly averse to her
               <lb/>remaining there alone. It was his inten­
               <lb/>tion, he continued, if this cause proved fa­
               <lb/>tal, to go to <placeName>London</placeName> with his family, as it
               <lb/>would be necessary, if his fortune received
               <lb/>so severe a blow, to remind his friends that
               <lb/>he was in existence. Some of his intimate
               <lb/>acquaintance, that he had not met with for
               <lb/>many years, had it in their power to for­
               <lb/>ward his son's promotion as an officer.
               <lb/><persName>General Douglas</persName> likewise mentioned, that
               <lb/>in the event of losing his brother's fortune,
               <lb/>he should endeavour to procure some situ­
               <lb/>ation under government for himself, as one
               <lb/>of his intimate friends, who was generally
               <lb/>resident in <placeName>London</placeName>, had great influence
               <lb/>with the minister. The only objection he
               <lb/>had to this plan was, that he felt an unea­
               <lb/>siness at the idea of suffering <persName>Mrs. Doug­

               <lb/>las</persName>, from whom he had never been long se­
               <lb/>parated since their marriage, to travel so
               <lb/>far without a companion.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> desired his friend not to
               <lb/>let that be an obstacle to his wishes, as he
               <lb/>would himself attend <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, hav­
               <lb/>ing business in <placeName>England</placeName>, which he intend­
               <lb/>ed to transact there in a few months, and
               <lb/>by accompanying his lady, it was only dis­
               <lb/>patching it a little sooner.
            </p>
            <p>The general replied, that he had greatly
               <lb/>relieved his mind by this friendly offer,
               <lb/>which, from his representation, he should
               <lb/>not scruple to accept, not suspecting it was
               <lb/>only a kind invention of <persName>Mr. Moncrief's</persName>
               <lb/>to serve him.
            </p>
            <p>A few days after this conversation, they
               <lb/>all set off together for <placeName>Edinburgh</placeName>, where
               <lb/><persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> left the
               <lb/>general to search out the clergyman, <persName>Mr.
               <lb/>Murray</persName>, and consult one of his most emi­
               <lb/>nent advocates respecting the contested es­
               <lb/>tates, and proceeded together to <placeName>England</placeName>.

               <lb/>d</persName>y and <persName>Maggie</persName> had been questioned by
               <lb/>them. Their opinion was asked relative
               <lb/>to the marriage, and both these old domes­
               <lb/>tics said they were certain that the whole
               <lb/>story was an invention; they suspected
               <lb/>that the villanous attorney had persuaded
               <lb/><persName>Helen Ramsay</persName> and her mother to pretend
               <lb/>she was married to <persName>sir James</persName>, and the child
               <lb/>his, when it was undoubtedly the base­
               <lb/>born offspring of <persName>Davie M'Gregor</persName> and <persName>He­
               <lb/>len</persName>. The old woman added, that <persName>Helen
               <lb/>Ramsay</persName> had only been hired to assist when
               <lb/><persName>sir James</persName> had formerly a dangerous fit of
               <lb/>illness, and she remembered often seeing
               <lb/>her very familiar with <persName>Davie</persName>.—<said>Let my
               <lb/>master have what faults he might,</said> said
               <lb/><persName>Maggie</persName>, <said>I am sure he would not have
               <lb/>demeaned himself with such a dirty slat­
               <lb/>tern; and if they could find poor <persName>Davie</persName>,
               <lb/>he would tell the truth, for he was an up­
               <lb/>right lad then, drawn out of the right road
               <lb/>by that <name>Maypole</name> wench<unclear reason="obscured">.</unclear></said> <persName>Maggie</persName> doubt­
               <lb/>ed not, if they found <persName>Davie</persName>, that he would
               <lb/>clear all up, but they must be sure to pro­

               <lb/>mise him that he should not be brought to
               <lb/>disgrace on account of the child, nor be
               <lb/>forced to pay for maintaining it, as he was
               <lb/>a needy lad, and of a downcast bashful tem­
               <lb/>per. The little boy, <persName>Maggie</persName> said, favour­
               <lb/>ed <persName>Davie</persName> much, whose head was as red as
               <lb/>a carrot, and he was not in the least like
               <lb/>her master's family.
            </p>
            <p>The general assured her they would
               <lb/>handsomely reward <persName>Davie</persName>, if he discovered
               <lb/><persName>Helen Ramsay's</persName> and the attorney's wick­
               <lb/>edness and deception; and they drove
               <lb/>from the Castle, with the old woman's ar­
               <lb/>dent wishes for their success, and that they
               <lb/>might defeat <persName>Graham</persName> and <persName>Helen's</persName> schemes.
            </p>
            <p>When <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> had been two days
               <lb/>at <persName>Mrs. Fane's</persName>, <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> proposed to
               <lb/>her (as it was the general's wish that they
               <lb/>should soon go to <placeName>London</placeName>) to take the
               <lb/>opportunity of his being with them, to set­
               <lb/>tle herself there in a house or lodgings.
               <lb/>The fire at <placeName>Treharne</placeName> had deprived them for
               <lb/>the present of a home, and he judged, from
               <lb/>the conversation that had passed, that his
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">friend</mw>

               <lb/>friend would prefer their going to town
               <lb/>from that circumstance. In the critical
               <lb/>situation of their affairs, he would certainly
               <lb/>be unwilling they should engage another
               <lb/>residence in the country.
            </p>
            <p>His society and advice was the greatest
               <lb/>advantage to the wife and children of his
               <lb/>friend, as the former, from having been so
               <lb/>long absent from the metropolis, was al­
               <lb/>most a stranger to it. She had only visit­
               <lb/>ed it occasionally before she was married,
               <lb/>at the most fashionable season of the year,
               <lb/>which was so long a period since, that it
               <lb/>was nearly the same as never having re­
               <lb/>sided there. The faithful and affectionate
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> was to travel with them, but <persName>Ro­
               <lb/>bin</persName> and <persName>Dolly</persName> were to be left at <placeName>Treharne</placeName>
               <lb/>till their mistress received the general's or­
               <lb/>ders respecting them, and if the old man­
               <lb/>sion was to be repaired. <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>
               <lb/>was likewise anxious to be in town before
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> quitted it, that she might apo­
               <lb/>logize for having been at her habitation,

               <lb/>and explain the necessity that obliged her
               <lb/>to intrude without permission.
            </p>
            <p>Although <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> considered that
               <lb/>friendship required no outward ceremo­
               <lb/>ny, yet she did not think it should su­
               <lb/>persede the necessity of good-breeding, as
               <lb/>well as good-humour, and that politeness
               <lb/>ought to be maintained with the most in­
               <lb/>timate friends. Such best, she thought,
               <lb/>evinced an equal steady mind, and ren­
               <lb/>dered friendship permanent.

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> had confided to her mother the
               <lb/>principal events that had occurred since
               <lb/>her departure for <placeName>Scotland</placeName>. She did not
               <lb/>even conceal the perfidy and violent con­
               <lb/>duct of her once-esteemed <persName>Courtenay</persName>.

            <p>Indescribable horror affected <persName>Mrs. Doug­
               <lb/>las</persName> at this description of her sufferings.

               <lb/>having been subjected to such insult and
               <lb/>cruelty, she was grateful to Providence

               <lb/>joiced at the marriage of the man who
               <lb/>would have been her destruction, as it res­
               <lb/>cued her daughter from additional impor­
               <lb/>tunity. What happiness did the reflection
               <lb/>impart, that <persName>Courtenay</persName> was become an
               <lb/>object of indifference to <persName>Rose</persName>!—time and
               <lb/>the remembrance of his ungenerous beha­
               <lb/>viour having healed the wound that his
               <lb/>infidelity had caused to lacerate her affec­
               <lb/>tionate bosom. With the character of the
               <lb/>brave, the amiable <persName>sir Eglamour Delavalle</persName>,
               <lb/>she was quite charmed. She relied on the
               <lb/>delineation of his good qualities described
               <lb/>by <persName>Felix</persName>, as it was impartial; but she
               <lb/>could not so well have depended on her
               <lb/>daughter's account, which might be influ­
               <lb/>enced by partiality.

            <p>The altered appearance of <persName>Jane</persName>, and her
               <lb/>dejection, made her very unhappy; other­
               <lb/>wise, the improvement in her temper and
               <lb/>manners would have been productive of
               <lb/>the purest satisfaction. A distrust of
               <lb/>something wrong having happened in her
               <lb/>absence pervaded her penetrating mind.

               <lb/>From this <mcr rend="slant(italic)">presentiment</mcr>, she was appre­
               <lb/>hensive of discovering some painful inci­

               <lb/>and seldom spoke of her to her other chil­

            <p>This unaltered affection had a powerful

               <lb/>old mansion. Treachery, she felt assured,
               <lb/>had caused the flames to burst out in the
               <lb/>uninhabited turret, and to burn such a
               <lb/>considerable part of the building, which
               <lb/>she regretted, from its having been the
               <lb/>abode of her ancestors time immemorial.
               <lb/>She was convinced the fire must have been
               <lb/>purposely kindled there, as no combustible
               <lb/>matter, or even a light, had been placed in
               <lb/>it for a week before. Notwithstanding her
               <lb/>partiality to <placeName>Treharne</placeName> and its environs, she
               <lb/>would not have wished to reside there
               <lb/>again (supposing no accident had injured
               <lb/>the building), unless her husband was with
               <lb/>her, and the mysterious and alarming
               <lb/>noises her children had heard were ex­
               <lb/>plained. From the horrible scenes <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>had encountered, she could not endure the
               <lb/>thoughts of living there, unless the en­

               <lb/>while it slept; and when it awoke, <persName>Caro­

               <lb/>terwards they walked to <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, to take

               <lb/>Its ruined dilapidated appearance <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>viewed with regret. She was attached to
               <lb/>this spot, which looked more romantic
               <lb/>from its being apparently in a state of de­
               <lb/>cay, washed by the silver waters of the ri­
               <lb/>ver, and placed at the bottom of a beau­
               <lb/>tiful valley. Here she had experienced
               <lb/>the keenest sorrow; but here also she had
               <lb/>tasted the purest pleasure, and the sweet
               <lb/>happiness of being beloved by the man of
               <lb/>her heart, who was deserving the most
               <lb/>exalted love.

            <p><persName>Rose</persName>, in compliance with her mother's

               <lb/>equally delighted with this promise. In
               <lb/>his youth, this venerable domestic had oc­
               <lb/>casionally visited the metropolis with the
               <lb/>late <persName>lord Treharne</persName>, but his continuance
               <lb/>there was generally only for a few weeks;
               <lb/>his lordship was always afraid that his sim­
               <lb/>plicity might be imposed on by designing
               <lb/>characters, and never allowed him to ac­
               <lb/>company him but when he expected to
               <lb/>remain a very short time in town. <persName>Ro­
               <lb/>bin</persName> was nevertheless delighted at the idea
               <lb/>of revisiting the scenes, though transitory,
               <lb/>of his youthful days, which he recollected
               <lb/>with satisfaction, when health glowed in
               <lb/>every vein, and each object was new and

               <lb/>folks were dressed in gold, silver, and jew­
               <lb/>els, with golden carriages, and all sorts of
               <lb/>beautiful things and fine sights. They

               <lb/>selves for the few necessaries they may

               <lb/>monthly, and at every festival sends them

            <p><said>Your conversation is too interesting
               <lb/>and entertaining,</said> replied <persName>Rose</persName>, <said>for dul­
               <lb/>ness to approach; and I only regret that
               <lb/>you have ceased your account of the <placeName>He­
               <lb/>brides</placeName>, from a kind wish that I may re­
               <lb/>ceive greater amusement. This is a cheer­
               <lb/>ful, pleasing entrance into <placeName>London</placeName>.</said>

            <p>As the mail-coach drove furiously up
               <lb/><placeName>Piccadilly</placeName>, <persName>Jane</persName> observed, that all the
               <lb/>people in town seemed in good-humour,
               <lb/>and were either smiling or laughing.
            </p>
            <p><said>They are not one particle the more
               <lb/>good-natured for this jocular appearance,</said>
               <lb/>exclaimed <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName>. <said>Idle and
               <lb/>thoughtless in general, they endeavour to
               <lb/>catch amusement from each passing ob­
               <lb/>ject. Follow them into retirement, and
               <lb/>you will find those who appear most mer­
               <lb/>ry devoured with spleen, morose, and sul­
               <lb/>len. The broad grin is not the counte­
               <lb/>nance of happiness.</said>
            </p>
            <p>From the mail, they were conveyed in
               <lb/>a hackney-coach to lodgings in <placeName>South
               <lb/>Audley-street</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> had written

               <lb/>to an acquaintance to engage them for <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Douglas</persName>, till she found it convenient to
               <lb/>provide herself with another habitation.
               <lb/>The master of the house was a respectable
               <lb/>tradesman, lately married, who kept a shop
               <lb/>in <placeName>Bond street</placeName>, and lived at this private
               <lb/>residence, attending the shop during the
               <lb/>day. <persName>Mrs. Linn</persName>, his wife, informed <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> that they had only one lodger
               <lb/>besides their family. The gentleman was
               <lb/>a <rs type="properAdjective">German</rs> nobleman, about forty, who had
               <lb/>resided at <placeName>Brussels</placeName>, until the <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> army
               <lb/>entered that city, and deprived him of
               <lb/>nearly the whole of his property.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> had desired his acquaint­
               <lb/>ance to select some situation near <placeName>Hyde
               <lb/>Park</placeName> for the residence of his friends. He
               <lb/>considered, that as they came from the
               <lb/>pure air of the country, the change was
               <lb/>very great, and it was necessary they
               <lb/>should be near a fine open place for their
               <lb/>morning walks. When <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> had
               <lb/>comfortably settled them in their present
               <lb/>abode, he took an affectionate leave, and

               <lb/>departed to join his friend at <placeName>Edinburgh</placeName>.
               <lb/>Previously he advised <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, as
               <lb/>she was in respectable good lodgings, not
               <lb/>to be precipitate in quitting them, for any
               <lb/>trifling cause, till she could provide her­
               <lb/>self with a house which would completely
               <lb/>suit her in all respects, and that she would
               <lb/>not be in haste to remove, as frequent re­
               <lb/>movals were troublesome, dangerous, and
               <lb/>expensive. <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> assured him
               <lb/>she would be guided by his advice, from
               <lb/>the high opinion she had of his judgment
               <lb/>and understanding.
            </p>
            <p>The report of <persName>sir James Douglas's</persName> death,
               <lb/>and that he had left the general heir to his
               <lb/>possessions, was quickly diffused among
               <lb/>all their connexions. Many persons who
               <lb/>had but a slight acquaintance with the
               <lb/>general and his lady left their cards, eager
               <lb/>to visit them, now they were considered
               <lb/>as wealthy. Those who imagined they
               <lb/>had inherited a splendid fortune were as­
               <lb/>tonished at not finding them in magnifi­
               <lb/>cent lodgings. They expressed their won­

               <lb/>der, when they left them, to each other,
               <lb/>at their living so retired, and not assu­
               <lb/>ming the title, as <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> in that
               <lb/>case was <persName>lady Douglas</persName>. However, they
               <lb/>thought proper to conjecture, that as pro­
               <lb/>bably they had not yet received much
               <lb/>money, the general and his lady wished to
               <lb/>live in retirement till their affairs were
               <lb/>quite arranged, and they could introduce
               <lb/>their children into the fashionable world
               <lb/>with great eclat.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> was agreeably surprised by
               <lb/>unexpectedly meeting her friend, whom
               <lb/>she tenderly loved, and entered into all
               <lb/>her joys and sorrows. She was quite gra­
               <lb/>tified that she had taken refuge at her
               <lb/>country-house in the hour of perplexity
               <lb/>and distress. To enjoy the society of
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, after so long a separation,
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> purposely remained some days
               <lb/>longer in town than she had intended.
               <lb/>This was a mutual satisfaction to the
               <lb/>friends; and <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> entreated, that till
               <lb/><placeName>Treharne</placeName> was rendered habitable, the ge­

               <lb/>neral and <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> would consider
               <lb/>hers as their country-house: it would be
               <lb/>very convenient, <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> observed, to
               <lb/>be near the spot, to superintend the work­
               <lb/>men, when they were employed on the
               <lb/>repairs necessary to make the building
               <lb/>comfortable.
            </p>
            <p>From never having been accustomed to
               <lb/>the disagreeable practice people have in
               <lb/><placeName>London</placeName> of staring rudely at every female,
               <lb/>even if old and ugly, as well as handsome,
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName> found this ill-bred trick
               <lb/>annoying and unpleasant. One gentle­
               <lb/>man, whose figure was not in the least
               <lb/>prepossessing, between fifty and sixty
               <lb/>years of age, with eyes bleared and encir­
               <lb/>cled with red, was exceedingly trouble­
               <lb/>some to them. They met him in <placeName>Hyde
               <lb/>Park</placeName>, where they had previously seen
               <lb/>him some days before. He followed them
               <lb/>from the Park, and began speaking in a 
               <lb/>gallant manner. They answered not, but
               <lb/>turning into <placeName>Piccadilly</placeName>, entered a shop to
               <lb/>avoid him, and waited there a considerable
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">time,</mw>
            <pb/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="C8r"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">39</mw>
               <lb/>time, with the hope of getting rid of him;
               <lb/>but, to their extreme mortification, when
               <lb/>they came out he was still watching.
            </p>
            <p>They went into several shops afterwards,
               <lb/>perceiving that he continued to follow;
               <lb/>but all to no purpose, as he persevered in
               <lb/>his attendance, till they were obliged to
               <lb/>go home. By this method he discovered
               <lb/>where they lived, to their excessive mor­
               <lb/>tification.
            </p>
            <p>From this period he became quite an
               <lb/>annoyance, and was constantly walking or
               <lb/>riding by the house, and they scarcely
               <lb/>ever dared approach the windows, from
               <lb/>the fear of seeing him, as whenever he
               <lb/>caught a glimpse of either, he bowed,
               <lb/>smiled, or kissed his hand.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> had received three letters from <persName>sir
               <lb/>Eglamour</persName>—two when he was marching
               <lb/>to <placeName>Portsmouth</placeName> for embarkation, and one
               <lb/>when he was on board, and ready to sail.
               <lb/>He mentioned in the last that he did not
               <lb/>then know to what place they were going.
            </p>
            <p>Soon after their arrival in town, a letter
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">from</mw>
            <pb/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="C8v"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">40</mw>
               <lb/>from him was forwarded that had been
               <lb/>sent to <placeName>Treharne</placeName>. It was not an answer
               <lb/>to the one she had written, informing him
               <lb/>of their journey to <placeName>London</placeName>, but to that
               <lb/>he had previously received from her, when
               <lb/>he was at <placeName>Portsmouth</placeName>, detained by the
               <lb/>wind. <persName>Sir Eglamour</persName> had written this
               <lb/>from the coast of <placeName>Holland</placeName>, to which place
               <lb/>the expedition in which he was engaged
               <lb/>was now known to be destined. He
               <lb/>requested she would not be uneasy if she
               <lb/>did not hear again from him for two or
               <lb/>three months, as he should be continu­
               <lb/>ally moving about with the army: fre­
               <lb/>quent skirmishes and other engagements,
               <lb/>which would cause his constant change of
               <lb/>residence, must prevent his writing. He
               <lb/>concluded with observing that, although
               <lb/>he had an incurable wound in his heart,
               <lb/>he hoped he should return unhurt in eve­
               <lb/>ry other respect, that her constancy might
               <lb/>not be shaken by his being disfigured.
               <lb/>However, he trusted if the fate of war de­
               <lb/>prived him of a leg or an arm, that she
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">would</mw>
            <pb/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="C9r"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">41</mw>
               <lb/>would not behave to him as the lady did
               <lb/>to her lover in <title>Marmontel's Tales</title>.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> sighed as she perused this, and
               <lb/>thought that no event, misfortune, or al­
               <lb/>teration in his person, could weaken her
               <lb/>attachment for him—so good, so brave,
               <lb/>and noble-minded, and who truly loved.
               <lb/>To restrain her tears at the idea of the
               <lb/>dangers he had to encounter she found im­
               <lb/>possible, as the feeble consolation of hear­
               <lb/>ing from him was now denied her.
            </p>
            <p>The first time that she heard the news­
               <lb/>man blowing his horn, she could not ima­
               <lb/>gine the meaning of it; but when it was
               <lb/>explained, and <persName>Rose</persName> learned that, on any
               <lb/>intelligence arriving from abroad, he al­
               <lb/>ways announced it, by calling—<said>Great
               <lb/>news! extraordinary news!</said> and sound­
               <lb/>ing his horn loudly, her affectionate and
               <lb/>feeling heart thrilled with agony and ter­
               <lb/>ror at the sound. Her whole frame would
               <lb/>shake with agitation, fearful of any bad
               <lb/>news from the army in <placeName>Holland</placeName>. Some­
               <lb/>times the newsman blew his horn late at

               <lb/>night, when <persName>Rose</persName> was fast asleep. At this
               <lb/>awful noise she awoke frequently, with
               <lb/>the most horrible images impressed on
               <lb/>her mind. She would fancy that a bat­
               <lb/>tle had been fought, and the recollection
               <lb/>of her beloved <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> would be
               <lb/>presented to her tortured imagination,
               <lb/>perhaps wounded and bleeding. At that
               <lb/>moment, how ardently did she wish that
               <lb/>she had been his wife, that she might
               <lb/>with propriety have shared his danger,
               <lb/>attended upon him, and by her ten­
               <lb/>der attention softened his pangs, if ill
               <lb/>from wounds or fatigue! The damp cli­
               <lb/>mate of <placeName>Holland</placeName> was likewise very un­
               <lb/>favourable for the health, and particularly
               <lb/>for him, who was only lately recovered
               <lb/>from the accident that introduced him to
               <lb/>her.
            </p>
            <p>A heavy shower of rain prevented <persName>Miss
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> and her sister from taking their
               <lb/>usual morning walk. The general post­
               <lb/>man knocked at the door, and, expecting
               <lb/>a letter from their father, which their mo­

               <lb/>ther was anxious to receive, <persName>Jane</persName> ran
               <lb/>down the stairs, to see if it was from him,
               <lb/>while <persName>Rose</persName>, eager to know likewise, fol­
               <lb/>lowed her quickly: but imagine the con­
               <lb/>sternation of both, at seeing <persName>captain
               <lb/>Courtenay</persName>, who had imitated the post­
               <lb/>man's knock, to get easy and prompt ad­
               <lb/>mittance!
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> retreated to the drawing-room,
               <lb/>where her mother was seated, and faintly
               <lb/>articulated, to the astonishment of her
               <lb/>mother, that <persName>captain Courtenay</persName> was at the
               <lb/>door. Before she could express her sur­
               <lb/>prise, he entered, having followed <persName>Jane</persName> up
               <lb/>stairs. <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> was quite petrified
               <lb/>with his assurance, and remembered the
               <lb/>threat that he would come and see her af­
               <lb/>ter his marriage, which he had now pre­
               <lb/>sumed to realize.

            <p><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> felt quite indignant at
               <lb/>his presumption in daring to visit them,
               <lb/>after his dishonourable, perfidious, and
               <lb/>brutal behaviour to her daughter. In­
               <lb/>fluenced by resentment, she said many se­

               <lb/>vere things; and <persName>Rose</persName> could not help ad­
               <lb/>miring, guilty as he was, the mildness and
               <lb/>patience with which he supported her sa­
               <lb/>tirical remarks on him: yet she could not
               <lb/>endure to remain any longer in the room
               <lb/>with a man who had behaved so cruelly
               <lb/>and incorrectly, and retired, leaving him
               <lb/>alone with her mother, <persName>Jane</persName> having quit­
               <lb/>ted the apartment before. To the ex­
               <lb/>treme amazement of <persName>Rose</persName> and her sister,
               <lb/>he remained a considerable time with <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Douglas</persName>. The interval appeared so long,
               <lb/>that they thought he would never have
               <lb/>taken his leave.
            </p>
            <p><said>Undoubtedly,</said> said <persName>Jane</persName> to <persName>Rose</persName>,
               <lb/><said>they have entered on some agreeable to­
               <lb/>pic of conversation, by his staying.</said>
            </p>
            <p>Just as she uttered these words, they
               <lb/>had the satisfaction of hearing him depart,
               <lb/>and when they returned to the drawing-
               <lb/>room, their mother said—<said>I thank you,
               <lb/>my dear <persName>Rose</persName>, for having left the room;
               <lb/>it was perfectly correct of you by that
               <lb/>conduct to resent the indignity offered

               <lb/>by his presuming to come and see you
               <lb/>after his marriage. Does he think that a
               <lb/>lady, because she has not a large fortune,
               <lb/>is to be insulted with impunity? He
               <lb/>dared not have behaved so to a wealthy
               <lb/>woman. What a despicable being to act
               <lb/>as he had done! I cannot think what
               <lb/>could possess him to remain all this time,
               <lb/>unless he thought of seeing you again,
               <lb/>and that you would return to the drawing-
               <lb/>room. No other circumstance, I should
               <lb/>imagine, would have influenced him to
               <lb/>stay, for I have been entertaining him
               <lb/>with no other conversation than severe
               <lb/>observations, and satirical remarks on him­
               <lb/>self and family. I must confess that he
               <lb/>bore with surprising temper all my satire
               <lb/>and severity, and did not once make an
               <lb/>ill-natured reply, conscious, like a man of
               <lb/>sense, that he had acted unjustly, and that
               <lb/>my behaviour proceeded from being irri­
               <lb/>tated at his conduct to my daughter. I
               <lb/>did it on purpose to make him feel no in­
               <lb/>clination to repeat his visit. Sincerely

            <p><said>Will you allow me to own, my dear­

               <lb/>day has quite pleased me, though I hope
               <lb/>never to see him again. It proves, by his
               <lb/>enduring all your satirical remarks so pa­
               <lb/>tiently, that he is a real gentleman, and
               <lb/>would not resent any thing a lady said:

            <p>As <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> was calmly conversing
               <lb/>with her daughters on this subject, <persName>Ka­
               <lb/>mira</persName> came in, with a face red and inflamed
               <lb/>with anger; she looked anxiously at <persName>Rose</persName>,
               <lb/>and then related that having been to a
               <lb/>shop in the neighbourhood, she saw <persName>cap­
               <lb/>tain Courtenay</persName> as she returned home,
               <lb/>coming from the house. Impressed with
               <lb/>the idea that he had been there to repeat
               <lb/>his insults to her dear <persName>Miss Rose</persName>, the <name>In­
               <lb/>dian</name> could not restrain her anger. In the

               <lb/>him in the street for his vile conduct, say­
               <lb/>ing, her young lady had got a much better
               <lb/>sweetheart than him, whose servant he
               <lb/>was not worthy to be. The imperfect
               <lb/><name>English</name>, and the singular mode in which she
               <lb/>expressed herself, attracted the attention
               <lb/>of the people passing by; a mob was be­
               <lb/>ginning to collect, and <persName>Courtenay</persName> gladly
               <lb/>ran off, to escape her torrent of severe re­
               <lb/>proaches.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> with difficulty suppressed
               <lb/>a smile at this account; yet, while she re­
               <lb/>primanded her for her impetuosity, and
               <lb/>publicly yielding to her passions, she could
               <lb/>not inwardly blame her violence. It was
               <lb/>natural for this poor <name>Indian</name> to be incensed
               <lb/>against him, after the infamous unfeeling
               <lb/>behaviour she had witnessed.

            <p><persName>Lady Morrington</persName> and <persName>mademoiselle de
               <lb/><placeName>Rimont</placeName></persName> arrived in town, and called shortly
               <lb/>after in <placeName>South Audley-street</placeName>. They had

               <lb/>and exaggerated account of the immense

               <lb/>fortune he had left, and that it was all be­
               <lb/>queathed to the general. <persName>Lady Morring­
               <lb/>ton</persName>, who was continually distressed for
               <lb/>money, from losing a great deal at cards,
               <lb/>of which she was immoderately and im­
               <lb/>prudently fond, was eager to visit <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Douglas</persName>, with the hope of borrowing some
               <lb/>money of her. Her ladyship pretended
               <lb/>to be delighted to see them, and pressed
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> and her daughters to fix a
               <lb/>day to meet a dinner-party at her house.
            </p>
            <p>She was so earnest in her invitation,
               <lb/>that <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> was at length persuaded
               <lb/>to oblige her ladyship, much against her
               <lb/>own inclination, and the day was appoint­
               <lb/>ed. This ceremony being settled, the
               <lb/>conversation happened to turn on the
               <lb/>death of <persName>sir James</persName>, and <persName>lady Morrington</persName>
               <lb/>congratulated them on the acquisition
               <lb/>they had received to their fortune.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> thanked her ladyship,
               <lb/>but observed that it was not a certainty
               <lb/>that the general would inherit her brother's

               <lb/>donation; and, very unlike a woman of
               <lb/>the world, candidly related every circum­
               <lb/>stance respecting this unfortunate affair.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Louise</persName> looked deeply concerned at the
               <lb/>disappointment they had experienced,
               <lb/>though it might not eventually be a real
               <lb/>sorrow. Every person acquainted with
               <lb/>the story conceived it to be an invention
               <lb/>of the attorney's and <persName>Helen's</persName>. She was
               <lb/>the companion of his vices, and her cha­
               <lb/>racter, on inquiry, discovered to be very
               <lb/>atrocious. The chief vexation was the
               <lb/>trouble, expence, and separation of the
               <lb/>general, which it caused, from his family;
               <lb/>but at all events, it was a serious inconveni­
               <lb/>ence for him, after the money he had ex­
               <lb/>pended on this occasion, to be so long
               <lb/>without receiving any part of the fortune.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Lady Morrington</persName> was however of a
               <lb/>different opinion, quite unpropitious to
               <lb/>their interest, and her manners changed
               <lb/>accordingly. It was the dazzling prospect
               <lb/>of their having a large inheritance divided
               <lb/>among them that made her so atten­

               <lb/>tive. Hardly could she disguise her mor­
               <lb/>tification at having been thus eager to vi­
               <lb/>sit them in town: she was convinced, since
               <lb/>they had no claim to opulence, that they
               <lb/>would soon sink into insignificance, judging
               <lb/>too justly of the dispositions of others by
               <lb/>her own. The idea that they might, if dis­
               <lb/>tressed, make some demand on her purse,
               <lb/>from believing her insincere professions of
               <lb/>friendship, filled her with terror. How
               <lb/>deeply did she regret having asked them
               <lb/>to dinner! for, with all her unblushing
               <lb/>confidence, it was impossible to decline
               <lb/>receiving them, whom she had persuaded
               <lb/>so urgently to accept her invitation.
            </p>
            <p>To hide her chagrin, her ladyship wish­
               <lb/>ed them good-morning, and retired, fol­
               <lb/>lowed by <persName>Louise</persName>, who, being accustomed
               <lb/>for several years to observe every emotion
               <lb/>that affected her, quickly penetrated the
               <lb/>meaning of her altered looks and manners,
               <lb/>and secretly despised a mind so selfish and
               <lb/>worldly. The moment that her carriage
               <lb/>drove from the door, <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> went

               <lb/>out with her daughters, to purchase many
               <lb/>articles of dress for them and her son, at a
               <lb/>linen-draper's her ladyship had eagerly re­
               <lb/>commended soon after she came in. <persName>Lady
               <lb/>Morrington</persName> was considerably in his debt,
               <lb/>and hoped to pacify him by recommend­
               <lb/>ing a wealthy customer. She had inform­
               <lb/>ed <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> that he would give her
               <lb/>credit, if she mentioned her ladyship's
               <lb/>name, as <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> did not find it con­
               <lb/>venient, till she received remittances from
               <lb/><placeName>Scotland</placeName>, to expend any ready money.

            <p>Having made their purchases, they re­

               <lb/>It will demonstrate itself by its actions:

            <p><persName>Mary</persName> confided to <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>, that she
               <lb/>was soon going to be married to a noble­

               <lb/>to <persName>Rose</persName> the superb jewels and elegant
               <lb/>dresses presented for this joyful occasion.
               <lb/>In the event of her marriage, <persName>Miss Her­
               <lb/>bert</persName> observed that she should be more
               <lb/>her own mistress than at present, and
               <lb/>could have her friend to reside frequently

               <lb/>liberally assist her, if she required it, with
               <lb/>money or any thing she wanted, having a
               <lb/>very handsome settlement from her in­
               <lb/>tended husband. This was in consequence
               <lb/>of the large fortune <persName>Mr. Herbert</persName> had be­

               <lb/>for those she loved.

               <lb/>pointment, and cost, in which they had
               <lb/>been involved since her uncle's decease,
               <lb/>from a new claimant having started up to
               <lb/>demand <persName>sir James's</persName> property, which had
               <lb/>caused infinite trouble to her father, and
               <lb/>vexation to the whole family.

            <p>Unlike <persName>lady Morrington</persName>, the intelli­

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> smiled, and observed that she was
               <lb/>more good-natured than the generality of
               <lb/>her sex, who are not disposed to marry
               <lb/>off their friends—but hoped never to re­

            <p>This day was one of the happiest that

               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName> for allowing them to converse with­
               <lb/>out restraint. The principal subjects that

               <lb/>an insignificant individual, a <persName>Mr. Foster</persName>,
               <lb/>who endured neglect and impertinence
               <lb/>for the sake of a good dinner. <persName>Lady Mor­
               <lb/>rington</persName> was determined to avoid mortify­
               <lb/>ing herself, by escaping the humiliation of
               <lb/>introducing girls not endowed with for­
               <lb/>tune to any more of her acquaintance.
               <lb/><persName>Lady Elinor Murray</persName>, daughter to the
               <lb/><persName>earl of <placeName>Arlberry</placeName></persName>, was very good-humour­
               <lb/>ed, and on a visit at <persName>lady Morrington's</persName>,
               <lb/>therefore it was impossible to prevent
               <lb/>her being present. The rest of the party
               <lb/>consisted of <persName>lady Harvey</persName>, <persName>Miss Herbert</persName>
               <lb/>and her admirer <persName>lord Beaufort</persName>, <persName>sir Henry
               <lb/>Arundel</persName>, the <persName>count de <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>, and <persName>Mr.
               <lb/>Foster</persName>, who, to their great astonishment,
               <lb/>when he was presented to their notice,
               <lb/>proved to be the gentleman that had fol­

               <lb/>man, which made the levity of his con­
               <lb/>duct to them inexcusable.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Lady Elinor</persName> was very interesting, about
               <lb/>five-and-twenty. Her person was small,
               <lb/>but delicately formed, with the gentlest
               <lb/>manners, and a countenance soft, fair, and
               <lb/>pleasing. The dinner was exceedingly
               <lb/>splendid, but, like all magnificent ban­
               <lb/>quets, tedious, dull, and fatiguing.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> was delighted when this
               <lb/>ceremony was over, and the ladies retired
               <lb/>to the drawing-room. <persName>Lady Elinor</persName> had
               <lb/>been placed near her at table, and she was
               <lb/>quite fascinated with her new companion,
               <lb/>who was unassuming, and rather reserved
               <lb/>at first. Her ladyship's reserve wore off
               <lb/>by degrees, and she then seemed equally
               <lb/>pleased with <persName>Rose</persName>.
            </p>

            <p>The long-expected letter from <placeName>Scotland</placeName>
               <lb/>at length arrived; but the perusal of it,
               <lb/>alas! was productive of sorrow only. It
               <lb/>was not written by the general, but <persName>Mr.
               <lb/>Moncrief</persName>, who mentioned how painful it
               <lb/>was for him to impart the heart-wounding
               <lb/>intelligence that <persName>general Douglas</persName> had been
               <lb/>confined several days to his bed. A fever
               <lb/>had been the consequence of the mental
               <lb/>agitation and fatigue he had undergone, in
               <lb/>the fruitless search for the clergyman and

            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> was agonized as she per­
               <lb/>used their friend's letter. The best of
               <lb/>men and of husbands pressed the couch of
               <lb/>sickness, caused by severe misfortune, now
               <lb/>could she hesitate a moment in flying to
               <lb/>attend on him.
            </p>
            <p>Her mind was torn with contending
               <lb/>emotions, at the idea of leaving her daugh­

               <lb/>and with cruel agony at the situation of
               <lb/>her loved husband, from whom she could
               <lb/>not endure to be absent. Feeling it her
               <lb/>inclination, as well as duty, to go directly
               <lb/>to him, the conflict and trial were almost
               <lb/>too much for her affectionate bosom: yet
               <lb/>she decided directly how to act, and check­
               <lb/>ed, as much as possible, after the first
               <lb/>shock, the anguish that racked her breast,
               <lb/>that her frame might be enabled to sup­
               <lb/>port whatever acute misery was in store
               <lb/>for her.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> recommended her daugh­
               <lb/>ters to the protection of their brother. It
               <lb/>was the only source of comfort that he was
               <lb/>with them, though she feared that conso­
               <lb/>lation would not last long, as his leave of
               <lb/>absence was nearly expired. But, unwill­
               <lb/>ing to anticipate evil, from being too well
               <lb/>acquainted with real sorrow, she hoped he
               <lb/>would be able to renew the permission,
               <lb/>and desired he would write to his colonel,
               <lb/>to request it as a particular favour.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> likewise requested <persName>Mr.

               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName>, assuring them, that at some future

               <lb/>ward any kindness her children experien­
               <lb/>ced from them.
            </p>
            <p>The advice she now gave her son and
               <lb/>daughters was nearly the same as when
               <lb/>she left them before, except that she still
               <lb/>more impressively entreated them to be
               <lb/>prudent and correct, as the town was re­
               <lb/>plete with dangers for young people who
               <lb/>were not very cautious in their conduct.
               <lb/>Their mother desired also that they would
               <lb/>decline every invitation, their father's cri­
               <lb/>tical state of health being a sufficient ex­
               <lb/>cuse; and by acting in this manner, they
               <lb/>would avoid expending money, which was
               <lb/>not convenient, in the embarrassed situation
               <lb/>of their finances. She likewise exhorted
               <lb/>them to be as economical as possible on
               <lb/>every occasion; and having previously taken
               <lb/>a place in the coach for <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, left her
               <lb/>daughters and <persName>Kamira</persName> in tears, though she
               <lb/>would not suffer hers to flow.

               <lb/>you would give her credit if she made use
               <lb/>of her ladyship's name. You may be cer­
               <lb/>tain of having your money, though not
               <lb/>immediately, as we are engaged in an ex­
               <lb/>pensive lawsuit, that embarrasses us at
               <lb/>present.</said>

            <p><said>That's neither here nor there to me,

               <lb/>What's you or your affairs to me? You
               <lb/>need not speak about my lady; she's slow

               <lb/>attendance for years before one can see the
               <lb/>colour of her money. Besides, she's no
               <lb/>friend of yours. I went to ask if her lady­
               <lb/>ship would be answerable for the goods
               <lb/>you have taken, and she said—<said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">By no

               <lb/>you must send the money, as I have told
               <lb/>you, or you'll know the consequence, for

               <lb/>fore <persName>Rose</persName> could reply, he vulgarly banged
               <lb/>the drawing-room door after him, leaving
               <lb/>poor <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> nearly in a state of
               <lb/>distraction, from never having experienced
               <lb/>such ill-bred and unfeeling insolence.
            </p>
            <p>She was not intimate enough with <persName>lady
               <lb/>Harvey</persName> to ask any pecuniary favour; and
               <lb/>even if she had, <persName>Rose</persName> knew she was often
               <lb/>distressed for money herself. Her only
               <lb/>friend in <placeName>London</placeName>, who could assist her,
               <lb/>was <persName>Miss Herbert</persName>, as from <persName>lady Morring­
               <lb/>ton</persName> no relief could be expected, after such
               <lb/>glaring duplicity.
            </p>
            <p>These reflections influenced her to write
               <lb/>a note, which she instantly dispatched by
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> to <persName>Mary Herbert</persName>. In a few hur­

               <lb/>requested the loan of fifteen pounds, the

               <lb/>per.

            <p>The faithful <persName>Kamira</persName>, to whom she con­
               <lb/>fided what had happened, went off with
               <lb/>tears in her eyes; and <persName>Rose</persName> then sought
               <lb/>her sister, to impart this additional sorrow.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> was overwhelmed with affliction at
               <lb/>the sufferings <persName>Rose</persName> was destined to en­
               <lb/>dure, but endeavoured to lessen her un­
               <lb/>easiness, by representing that the man only
               <lb/>threatened, from being prejudiced against
               <lb/>them by <persName>lady Morrington</persName>. She could not
               <lb/>imagine he would be so uncommonly se­
               <lb/>vere as to put his menaces in execution,
               <lb/>and if he did, advised her not to be alarm­
               <lb/>ed, as <persName>Mary Herbert</persName>, who was so wealthy,
               <lb/>and going to be well married, would cer­
               <lb/>tainly serve her, after such ardent profes­
               <lb/>sions of friendship.

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> was too much depressed by me­
               <lb/>lancholy to be equally confident of success,
               <lb/>as <persName>Mary</persName> might not have that sum by her.

               <lb/>deprived, thus critically situated, of her

               <lb/>shield her poor mother from it.

            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> returned quickly with an an­
               <lb/>swer. <persName>Rose</persName>, overcome with agitation,
               <lb/>tore open the note, and found it contained
               <lb/>a cold refusal. <persName>Mary Herbert</persName> replied, that
               <lb/>she had not so large a sum as fifteen pounds
               <lb/>in the house, having expended all her rea­
               <lb/>dy money in preparations for her wedding,
               <lb/>which was to take place in a few days. It
               <lb/>was her intention afterwards to look out
               <lb/>for a trinket to send her as a remem­
               <lb/>brance, and advised her to apply to some
               <lb/>other friend. <persName>Mary</persName> then coolly concluded

            </p>
            <p>Insensibly (as she finished reading this
               <lb/>cold-hearted note) tears of wounded sensi­
               <lb/>bility trickled down her lovely face. They
               <lb/>were not caused by disappointment at be­

               <lb/>grief, at discovering that the friend she
               <lb/>fervently loved, with purest truth, was
               <lb/>deceitful and hard-hearted. All hope of

               <lb/>ger did not pain her so acutely as the
               <lb/>knowledge of her beloved <persName>Mary's</persName> selfish­
               <lb/>ness, and insensible, frigid, and pitiless

               <lb/>to her, but it was not an easy task, after
               <lb/>the sincere affection she had entertained
               <lb/>for her unfeeling friend.

            <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> was bewildered in think­

               <lb/>apply to any slight acquaintance she could
               <lb/>not endure, and it was distressing to ex­
               <lb/>pose her misfortunes to people who knew
               <lb/>but little of her, and only paid attention

               <lb/>willingly have resigned existence; the joys
               <lb/>and sufferings of the ill-fated <persName>Rose</persName> were
               <lb/>hers.

               <lb/>Herbert</persName>, as there would probably be mo­

               <lb/>the letter, and perceived it did not con­
               <lb/>tain what she expected, in an agitated
               <lb/>voice she exclaimed—<said>Me think <persName>Miss

               <lb/>she cannot feel compassion for the woes of

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> now wrote to the linendraper by

               <lb/>suspend the harsh measures he had threat­
               <lb/>ened, till she received news from <placeName>Edin­

               <lb/>patience, of a remittance being enclosed,
               <lb/>part of which she would, without delay,
               <lb/>forward to him. This she hoped would
               <lb/>pacify him for some time, and in that in­
               <lb/>terval she flattered herself it would be in
               <lb/>her power to liquidate his debt.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> desired <persName>Kamira</persName> and her
               <lb/>sister to keep <persName>Felix</persName> in ignorance of what
               <lb/>had passed, as it would only make him un­
               <lb/>happy, and answer no good purpose. Her
               <lb/>brother was going to <placeName>Richmond</placeName>, in the
               <lb/>evening, on a visit for a fortnight, and
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> trusted to have this unpleasant af­
               <lb/>fair settled before his return. More anx­
               <lb/>ious for the happiness of others that she
               <lb/>regarded, than her own, it was always her
               <lb/>wish to avoid wounding the feelings of
               <lb/>those she loved. Her parents only were
               <lb/>dearer to her than her brave, her amiable
               <lb/>brother.
            </p>
            <p>Two days had elapsed since the linen­
               <lb/>draper's disagreeable visit. Early on the
               <lb/>third morning, <persName>Rose</persName> had just sunk into a
               <lb/>profound slumber, from having been awake
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">the</mw>

            <milestone unit="sig" n="E6r"/>

               <lb/>the greater part of the night with anxiety.
               <lb/>This refreshing sleep, that would have in­
               <lb/>vigorated her harassed form, was soon dis­
               <lb/>turbed by a loud, violent noise, as if seve­
               <lb/>ral people were quarrelling. <persName>Jane</persName> had ri­
               <lb/>sen and left the apartment, but <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>quickly distinguished her voice and <persName>Ka­
               <lb/>mira's</persName> in high-spirited altercation with
               <lb/>some person. At length she heard <persName>Ka­
               <lb/>mira</persName> distinctly say—<said>Me tell you she not
               <lb/>here; me tell you <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> out of
               <lb/>town.</said>
            </p>
            <p>That instant <persName>Rose</persName> was overcome with
               <lb/>horror, suspecting too truly the occasion
               <lb/>of these sounds. She jumped out of bed,
               <lb/>and bolted the door. The noise and
               <lb/>voices grew louder and louder, till they
               <lb/>approached the chamber-door, and she
               <lb/>heard two men talking violently to <persName>Ka­
               <lb/>mira</persName>. The men then tried to open her
               <lb/>door, saying—<said>She is here.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> replied—<said>Me tell you no; an­
               <lb/>other lady sleep in that room. You pu­
               <lb/>nished you disturb lady.</said>

            <p>At these words the men retreated down
               <lb/>the stairs, to the inexpressible alleviation
               <lb/>of her terror, having remained trembling
               <lb/>in bed all the time. <persName>Rose</persName> hoped she had
               <lb/>escaped, and that they had left the house,
               <lb/>as every thing was still for a few minutes;
               <lb/>but, to her melancholy disappointment,
               <lb/>the noise commenced again. She heard
               <lb/>the men running up the stairs, and one of
               <lb/>them exclaimed—<said><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> is cer­
               <lb/>tainly in this room: come, <persName>Dick</persName>, let us
               <lb/>break open the door.</said>
            </p>
            <p>From these circumstances and excla­
               <lb/>mations combined, <persName>Rose</persName> had guessed the
               <lb/>truth, and was convinced these men were
               <lb/>bailiffs, sent to arrest her by the linendra­
               <lb/>per. It was better, she judged, to avoid
               <lb/>having the door broken open, and called
               <lb/>out—<said>Gentlemen, if you will have pa­
               <lb/>tience, I will surrender myself, without
               <lb/>your being obliged to use force; I merely
               <lb/>request you will allow me time to dress.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Certainly, ma'am,</said> said one of the
               <lb/>men; <said>if you are civil we will be so too.

               <lb/>I shall amuse myself in making love to

               <lb/>You be beast! you be wretch!</said>
            </p>
            <p>The men only laughed, while she con­
               <lb/>tinued to scold them, till her young lady
               <lb/>was dressed, and came out to them. <persName>Miss
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> had been rather slow in dressing,
               <lb/>as her hands shook, and she could scarcely
               <lb/>stand. In vain she endeavoured to con­
               <lb/>sole <persName>Kamira</persName>, who was drowned in tears,
               <lb/>bitterly lamenting her hapless fate. She
               <lb/>then asked permission of the men to speak
               <lb/>privately with her sister, which they
               <lb/>granted. <persName>Rose</persName> gave <persName>Jane</persName> some money,
               <lb/>and entreated she would keep up her spi­
               <lb/>rits, as she was nearly fainting.

            <p>With all the fortitude she could assume,
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> now prepared to meet this severe
               <lb/>trial, though <persName>Jane</persName> almost banished her re­
               <lb/>solution by exclaiming, and weeping as
               <lb/>she spoke—<said>How will you be able to
               <lb/>bear this, ill as you already are with sor­

            <p><said>God will give me strength,</said> replied
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName>; and, returning to the men, inform­

            </p>
            <p>Interested by her appearance and man­
               <lb/>ners, the bailiffs, though most hard-heart­
               <lb/>ed, were very polite and respectful. Find­
               <lb/>ing that she objected to going from the
               <lb/>door to the spunging-house in a coach, as
               <lb/>it might cause the neighbours to discover
               <lb/>the affair, one of the men took her writing-
               <lb/>desk, and a bundle of clothes, as it was
               <lb/>uncertain how long she would be confined,
               <lb/>and walked out first; <persName>Rose</persName> followed him,
               <lb/>and the other bailiff left the house a little
               <lb/>while after, and walked at a short distance,
               <lb/>so that neither appeared to belong to her.
               <lb/>When they had gone through two or three
               <lb/>streets, the men called a hackney-coach;
               <lb/>they handed her into it with great respect,
               <lb/>and then got in afterwards, ordering the
               <lb/>coachman where to drive.
            </p>
            <p>As they drove along, the men humanely
               <lb/>endeavoured to comfort her; and that she
               <lb/>might not think it disgraceful to be arrest­

               <lb/>ed, told her that a lady of quality had
               <lb/>been confined a fortnight in the same
               <lb/>house to which she was going, and a cap­
               <lb/>tain in the army also. The captain had
               <lb/>been in high spirits when he first entered;
               <lb/>but so many debts had lately appeared
               <lb/>against him, that he had confined himself
               <lb/>to his bed from vexation, and was to be
               <lb/>sent very shortly to the <name>King's Bench</name>.
               <lb/>One of the men said he expected to be
               <lb/>taken to prison himself for debt, and in­
               <lb/>formed her likewise of the best way to
               <lb/>proceed to get speedily released. The
               <lb/>misery in which she was involved did not
               <lb/>prevent her from being pleased with the
               <lb/>civility and respect of her rough compa­
               <lb/>nions.
            </p>
            <p>At last the coach arrived, and stopped
               <lb/>before the gloomy spunging-house. The
               <lb/>heart of the unfortunate <persName>Rose</persName> sunk deeply
               <lb/>when she gazed with horror at the iron-
               <lb/>barred windows, where desolation seemed
               <lb/>to reign triumphant. The men perceived

               <lb/>the change in her countenance, and, to
               <lb/>weaken the effect the shock had on her
               <lb/>mind, told her the confinement would be
               <lb/>very short, if she wrote directly to her
               <lb/>friends, as every letter she might rely on
               <lb/>having carefully forwarded.
            </p>
            <p>The street-door opened, and she was
               <lb/>ushered through another inner door, well
               <lb/>secured with iron bars and bolts, &amp;c. The
               <lb/>men delivered up her property, and she
               <lb/>was then conducted into a small drawing-
               <lb/>room, on the first floor, furnished neatly,
               <lb/>with a pianoforte in it. <persName>Rose</persName> immediate­
               <lb/>ly sat down to her desk, and wrote letters
               <lb/>to every one she thought likely to serve
               <lb/>her, and dispatched them off. She had
               <lb/>not tasted any food since she had been up,
               <lb/>and an elderly squint-eyed woman, who
               <lb/>was the servant of the house, came in and
               <lb/>asked if she would like breakfast? <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>replied that she could not eat any thing,
               <lb/>but would partake of an early dinner in­
               <lb/>stead. This woman, whose appearance

               <lb/>she did not like, though exceedingly at­
               <lb/>tentive, said—<said>Come, Miss, and play a
               <lb/>tune on the piano, to amuse yourself.</said>

            <p>At that moment the man who opened
               <lb/>the inner door to keep the prisoners secure,
               <lb/>entered to demand some silver, to go and
               <lb/>search the office, he said, to see if there
               <lb/>were any detainers. <persName>Rose</persName> assured them
               <lb/>that could not be, not having any debts
               <lb/>as even this they had arrested her for was
               <lb/>not hers. The man replied, that made no

               <lb/>pretty a woman as ever was seen, before
               <lb/>she lost her eye and her leg; but I don't
               <lb/>like to remind her of her <distinct>misfortins</distinct>, for

               <lb/>drunken being, could not help but smiling at
               <lb/>his vanity, as he was humpbacked, old,
               <lb/>and ordinary in his person. She saw the

               <lb/>when her elderly attendant came, desired

               <lb/>sent with any letters or messages for her
               <lb/>again. Different people belonging to the

               <lb/>apartment occasionally, with some excuse
               <lb/>or other, which <persName>Rose</persName> imagined was to

               <lb/>During this interval, when severe morti­
               <lb/>fication and heart-rending anguish over­
               <lb/>whelmed her, not a tear fell from her eye,
               <lb/>or sigh heaved her bosom. She sat im­
               <lb/>movable, and stupified with sorrow.
            </p>
            <p>While <persName>Rose</persName> was thus situated, the el­
               <lb/>derly woman came in and said—<said>A gen­

            <p>At that instant <persName>captain Courtenay</persName> en­
               <lb/>tered. <persName>Rose</persName> gazed on him with an eye
               <lb/>of vacancy, and, absorbed in her own pain­
               <lb/>ful reflections, scarcely recollected he was
               <lb/>in existence till her addressed her.

               <lb/>emperor of <placeName>Russia</placeName> here as you. Though
               <lb/>you had become indifferent to me, which
               <lb/>you will say is a rude speech, I could not
               <lb/>hear of your imprisonment without com­
               <lb/>ing to extricate you, on condition that you
               <lb/>reward my passion, for I am not cut out
               <lb/>for platonic love. No, no, my dear girl,
               <lb/>it is too cold and barren; mutual tender­
               <lb/>ness is the soul of real attachment.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>How dare you, sir, speak to me of
               <lb/>love? It is profaning so noble a senti­
               <lb/>ment for your lips to mention it; it is
               <lb/>not becoming in a married man. Do not
               <lb/>presume on my misfortunes: I would
               <lb/>sooner meet death, in its most horrid
               <lb/>shape, than act with impropriety. Never

               <lb/>exhausted with the exertion of speaking
               <lb/>to him before, as she felt exceedingly weak
               <lb/>and faint. He now wished her good-
               <lb/>morning, saying she might depend on see­
               <lb/>ing him again, when he hoped to find her
               <lb/>in a better and more reasonable humour.
               <lb/>It was with indescribably satisfaction that
               <lb/>she saw him depart, and it was some plea­
               <lb/>sure that his visit had been short; yet the
               <lb/>prospect of a repetition of it, when he
               <lb/>would probably conduct himself different­
               <lb/>ly, caused in her perturbed mind the most
               <lb/>serious apprehension. She resolved there­
               <lb/>fore to request, as a very great favour, of
               <lb/>the master and mistress of the house, that
               <lb/>they would not allow <persName>captain Courtenay</persName>
               <lb/>to be admitted to her apartment.
            </p>
            <p>Yet the idea of their not complying
               <lb/>with her entreaties, and being forced to
               <lb/>see him the next day, thrilled her with
               <lb/>horror. The recollection of her beloved
               <lb/><persName>sir Eglamour</persName> made her still more averse
               <lb/>to meeting this worthless man, as she
               <lb/>could not endure expressions of attach­

               <lb/>ment from any one but him she faithfully
               <lb/>loved, and who merited the most true and
               <lb/>exquisite tenderness. Inwardly she im­
               <lb/>plored Heaven to rescue her from a trial
               <lb/>so severe, and from the house that now
               <lb/>sheltered her, as the thought of sleeping
               <lb/>in such a place was misery most poignant.
            </p>
            <p>The windows were all fenced with
               <lb/>strong bars; even the yard at the back
               <lb/>of the house was guarded with bars at the
               <lb/>top, which alarmed her in the case of fire.
               <lb/>Should such an accident happen, <persName>Rose</persName> fear­
               <lb/>ed that escape would be impossible, more
               <lb/>particularly as the squinting woman told
               <lb/>her she was to sleep in one of the attics
               <lb/>near her; it was very dangerous, if the
               <lb/>house was on fire, to be on the highest
               <lb/>floor in it. Her uneasiness was likewise
               <lb/>increased by the look and manner of this
               <lb/>woman, to whom she felt an involuntary
               <lb/>repugnance, notwithstanding her civility.
            </p>
            <p>At two o'clock the mistress of the house
               <lb/>sent up her dinner, cooked so indifferently
               <lb/>that she only ate a few mouthfuls, which

               <lb/>refreshed her very little; and for this
               <lb/>wretched meal they charged her an enor­
               <lb/>mous price. After dinner, her mother's
               <lb/>landlord, <persName>Mr. Linn</persName>, called to see her, and
               <lb/>inquired if he could be of any service? At
               <lb/>the sight of him, who reminded <persName>Rose</persName> of
               <lb/>her mother, her sister, and <persName>Felix</persName>, from
               <lb/>whom she was at present most painfully
               <lb/>separated, she was overcome with emo­
               <lb/>tion, and for the first time since her capti­
               <lb/>vity burst into tears.
            </p>
            <p>With humanity that would have graced
               <lb/>a more exalted station, the good man
               <lb/>strove to impart consolation, and offered
               <lb/>to go anywhere, or convey any messages
               <lb/>for her. In consequence of these obliging
               <lb/>offers, <persName>Rose</persName> requested him to wait on her
               <lb/>father's solicitor, and explain her situa­
               <lb/>tion. She then asked after <persName>Jane</persName>, and was
               <lb/>informed that she suffered inexpressible
               <lb/>affliction, not having forgot that she was
               <lb/>a sister.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Linn</persName> went away. Evening came,

               <lb/>release, had yet occurred. Tea was brought
               <lb/>to her, and while she was drinking it, and
               <lb/>endeavouring to reconcile her mind to re­
               <lb/>maining all night, as it appeared inevita­
               <lb/>ble, footsteps were heard coming hastily
               <lb/>up stairs. Many persons were confined in
               <lb/>this house, which the woman said was
               <lb/>nearly full; therefore different people were
               <lb/>constantly going up and down, which ex­
               <lb/>cluded every hope of its being visitors to
               <lb/>herself, till the door suddenly opened.
               <lb/>Two respectable strangers entered; one of
               <lb/>them, a tall handsome young man, impart­
               <lb/>ed the pleasing intelligence that he was
               <lb/>arrived to restore her to liberty, and the
               <lb/>other, considerably older, a short, stout,
               <lb/>dark man, she found was employed by
               <lb/>the lawyer who had arrested her by de­
               <lb/>sire of the linendraper.
            </p>
            <p>The handsome young man observed, that
               <lb/>it was a very unpleasant situation for a lady,
               <lb/>and <persName>Rose</persName> replied that it was both new and
               <lb/>distressing indeed.

            <p>He now produced a paper, which he
               <lb/>desired her to sign, and left the room for
               <lb/>a few minutes. When he was gone, the
               <lb/>dark man seemed to pity her, and said it
               <lb/>was shameful to arrest a lady for so trifling
               <lb/>a sum.

            <p><said>You had better sign <persName>Caroline Doug­

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> thanked him, and answered in the

               <lb/>could scarcely recognize her.
            </p>
            <p>The handsome man now requested <persName>Miss
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> to sign the paper with her own
               <lb/>name, though she told him the other gen­
               <lb/>tleman desired she would not. He now
               <lb/>requested the people of the house to bring
               <lb/>their bill, in a very harsh voice. It amount­
               <lb/>ed to a great deal, as they charged extra­
               <lb/>vagantly for the use of the room, fire, can­
               <lb/>dles, and the uncomfortable meals they
               <lb/>had provided. <persName>Kamira</persName> had brought a
               <lb/>hackney-coach, which waited to convey
               <lb/>her lady home. The gentlemen attended
               <lb/>her down stairs, and the porter at the inner
               <lb/>door requested she would give him some
               <lb/>money. Reluctantly she gave him eigh­
               <lb/>teen-pence, and the woman three shillings,

            </p>

               <lb/><said>She called with elderly gentleman to see
               <lb/>you. When she ask me for you, I wring
               <lb/>my hands, I shake my head, and cry very
               <lb/>much—say too, you take away by two
               <lb/>wicked men. My lady ask where you

               <lb/>gone, name of street, and gentleman too.
               <lb/>Me tell her all about it. My lady say, <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">don't
               <lb/>fret, you see her again; she shall be with
               <lb/>you at night.</said> Me go down on my knees,
               <lb/>me kiss her feet; but she no let me—she
               <lb/>give me her little white hand to kiss. This
               <lb/>night elderly gentleman come to me; he
               <lb/>give me money to pay hackney-coach,
               <lb/>and told me to go fetch you from spungy-
               <lb/>house: that is all.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>What an angel <persName>lady Elinor</persName> is!</said> said
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName>. <said>I feel grateful to her beyond the
               <lb/>power of language to express. Almost a
               <lb/>stranger to me, and to have such angelic
               <lb/>goodness and compassion, while those who
               <lb/>have known me much longer neglect and
               <lb/>forsake me, because I am in distress, after
               <lb/>the most ardent and unasked professions of
               <lb/>friendship. How I shall ever love her!
               <lb/>It appears as if this new friend was sent
               <lb/>to console me for the loss of one I truly

            <p>The hackney-coach now stopped at her

               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName> welcomed her sister with unfeigned
               <lb/>pleasure. Never had <persName>Jane</persName> displayed more

               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> was conveyed from their residence
               <lb/>to the spunging-house, which imparted a

               <lb/>sister she had become more affectionate
               <lb/>than formerly. Adversity is the only

               <lb/>knowledgment to <persName>lady Elinor</persName>, in which

               <lb/>her thanks in person, and hoped her lady­
               <lb/>ship would indulge her by calling shortly

            <p><persName>Mr. and Mrs. Linn</persName> received her on her

               <lb/>disagreeable circumstance of her having

               <lb/>were worthy good people.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Lady Elinor</persName> waited on <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>
               <lb/>the following morning, with the elderly
               <lb/>gentleman <persName>Kamira</persName> had spoken of. He
               <lb/>was a distant relation of the <persName>earl of <placeName>Arl­
               <lb/>berry</placeName></persName>, her father, and his name <persName>Murray</persName>.
               <lb/>His age was seventy-five, but he did not
               <lb/>look older than sixty, from having always
               <lb/>been virtuous, temperate, and benevolent.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> was more fascinated than ever
               <lb/>with the manners and conversation of
               <lb/><persName>lady Elinor</persName>. She would not hint at the
               <lb/>favour she had conferred; and when she
               <lb/>suspected that <persName>Rose</persName> wished to enter on
               <lb/>the subject, avoided it with the greatest
               <lb/>delicacy. <persName>Mr. Murray</persName> had been very fond
               <lb/>of <persName>lady Elinor</persName> from a child, which af­
               <lb/>fection she warmly returned, being grate­
               <lb/>ful for his constant endeavours to add to
               <lb/>her happiness when so young. Into her

               <lb/>youthful mind he instilled the necessity
               <lb/>of being beneficent; and that by pro­
               <lb/>moting the welfare of our fellow-creatures
               <lb/>in distress, we increase our own felicity.
               <lb/>The sentiments of him <persName>lady Elinor</persName> re­
               <lb/>vered and loved as a second parent she
               <lb/>naturally adopted, and became the same
               <lb/>humane, good, and charitable character.
               <lb/>To behold such virtue in a lovely young
               <lb/>lady touches the heart even more than

            </p>
            <p>At an early period of his life, <persName>Mr. Mur­
               <lb/>ray</persName> was in very narrow circumstances,
               <lb/>from having had an extravagant father.
               <lb/>In consequence of being thus situated, he
               <lb/>established himself at <placeName>Lisbon</placeName>, as a wine-
               <lb/>merchant, where, in a few years, he rea­
               <lb/>lized a handsome fortune. <persName>Mr. Richard
               <lb/>Murray</persName> related many anecdotes to <persName>Rose</persName>,
               <lb/>which gave her a very favourable impres­
               <lb/>sion of the <rs type="properAdjective">Portuguese</rs> character. <persName>Mr.
               <lb/>Richard Murray</persName>, at one time, when he
               <lb/>was in business as a merchant, had consi­

               <lb/>derable property, and much money owing
               <lb/>to him; but from having bills unexpect­
               <lb/>edly presented for payment, to the amount
               <lb/>of five thousand pounds, he thought he
               <lb/>must become a bankrupt, and was going to
               <lb/>take refuge in a convent, where people in
               <lb/>embarrassment in <placeName>Portugal</placeName> always fly. As
               <lb/>he was walking on his way there, he met
               <lb/>a <rs type="properAdjective">Portuguese</rs> gentleman, with whom he
               <lb/>often played at chess in the evening.
            </p>
            <p><said>You look melancholy to-day, <persName>signor
               <lb/>Ricardo</persName>,</said> said the gentleman, for he was
               <lb/>called in <placeName>Portugal</placeName> <persName>Ricardo</persName>, from his <rs type="properAdjective">Chris­
               <lb/>tian</rs> name being <persName>Richard</persName>.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Richard Murray</persName> replied, that he
               <lb/>was very dull, as he was going to a con­
               <lb/>vent.
            </p>
            <p><said>But why go to a convent?</said> rejoined
               <lb/>the <name>Portuguese</name>.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Murray</persName> then related his situation,
               <lb/>which moved the generous, feeling <name>Portu­
               <lb/>guese</name>, who instantly lent him money suf­
               <lb/>ficient to extricate him from his difficul­
               <lb/>ties; and he became more flourishing than

               <lb/>before. This made <persName>Mr. Richard Murray</persName>
               <lb/>very partial to the natives of <placeName>Portugal</placeName>, of
               <lb/>whom he recounted several instances of
               <lb/>their ardour when they formed a friend­
               <lb/>ship, which proved their warmth of heart.
               <lb/>He gave away a large fortune among them
               <lb/>in charity. Every week three hundred
               <lb/>beggars assembled at his door on a certain
               <lb/>day, and were relieved, besides many others
               <lb/>to whom he allowed monthly pay. <persName>Mr.
               <lb/>Richard Murray</persName> resided chiefly in <placeName>Portu­
               <lb/>gal</placeName>, and only visited <placeName>England</placeName> occasionally,
               <lb/>as he was now growing very old. He
               <lb/>told <persName>Rose</persName>, that she resembled a young la­
               <lb/>dy to whom he was ardently attached at
               <lb/>twenty—<said>That is the reason, <persName>Miss Doug­
               <lb/>las</persName>,</said> added <persName>Mr. Murray</persName>, <said>that I am an old
               <lb/>bachelor.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>As you say I resemble the object of
               <lb/>your early regard,</said> replied <persName>Rose</persName>, <said>may I,
               <lb/>without being impertinent, ask how you
               <lb/>came to be separated from her?</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I discovered, after our attachment had
               <lb/>taken place some months, that she was a

               <lb/><name>Roman Catholic</name>; and, as I was a <name>Protest­
               <lb/>ant</name>, I was averse to marrying any one of
               <lb/>a different religion, as all my relations
               <lb/>would have been indignant at my making
               <lb/>such a choice, to which I felt repugnant
               <lb/>myself. This prevented our union, as she
               <lb/>would not change her religion. Thus was
               <lb/>I doomed to be disappointed in love, for I
               <lb/>could never attach myself to any other wo­
               <lb/>man, though she was easily consoled, and
               <lb/>married soon after. You are, young lady,
               <lb/>the only person that ever resembled her
               <lb/>in my opinion. I resided opposite to her
               <lb/>father's house in <placeName>Lisbon</placeName>; and at the be­
               <lb/>ginning of our attachment, she would
               <lb/>come into the balcony in the evening, in
               <lb/>her walking-dress. I then appeared at
               <lb/>my window, and that was the signal for
               <lb/>our walking out together. But I hope,
               <lb/><persName>Miss Douglas</persName>, you will be more fortunate
               <lb/>in love than my mistress and myself; for
               <lb/>I was informed she lived very miserably,
               <lb/>and always wished she had been my wife.</said>

               <lb/>the most beneficent of beings, who passed
               <lb/>every day in searching out and relieving
               <lb/>the wretched victims of misfortune.

            <p><persName>Mr. Richard Murray</persName> smiled, and told
               <lb/>her she had never been in love, or she
               <lb/>would not think any thing could compen­
               <lb/>sate for the loss of the object of her attach­

            <p><persName>Lady Elinor</persName> now informed <persName>Rose</persName>, that
               <lb/>she was to remove the following morning

               <lb/><placeName>Arlberry</placeName></persName> was expected in a few days in
               <lb/>town. Her ladyship added, that she

               <lb/>Elinor</persName> was mildness and sweet itself,
               <lb/>with a fine understanding, and a great
               <lb/>deal of penetration; easily she perceived,
               <lb/>therefore, that <persName>lady Morrington</persName> was of a

               <lb/>ed malevolence, and was particularly cap­
               <lb/>tivated with her unaffected sense and soft­
               <lb/>ness.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Lady Elinor</persName> admired the beautiful co­
               <lb/>lour that tinted the cheek and animated
               <lb/>the countenance of <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>. When
               <lb/>she observed to <persName>lady Morrington</persName> how
               <lb/>much she admired the blooming look of
               <lb/>health that distinguished her, her lady­
               <lb/>ship exclaimed, in a splenetic tone—<said>No­
               <lb/>body gives her credit for it; most people
               <lb/>say she is painted.</said>
            </p>
            <p>This speech quite disgusted <persName>lady Elinor</persName>,
               <lb/>who thought it so unkind and illiberal,
               <lb/>that she determined to evince more atten­
               <lb/>tion for the young lady thus meanly slan­
               <lb/>dered; for to this untruth <persName>lady Morring­
               <lb/>ton</persName> added another. She asserted that the
               <lb/>conduct of <persName>Rose</persName> was incorrect, and that she
               <lb/>flirted too much.—<said>I do not say she has
               <lb/>acted criminally,</said> continued her ladyship,
               <lb/><said>but imprudently—with too much levity.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Lady Elinor's</persName> discernment soon dis­
               <lb/>covered why she criticised her so unmer­
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">cifully,</mw>

               <lb/>cifully, and also calumniated the unoffend­
               <lb/>ing girl, evidently because she was preju­
               <lb/>diced in her favour. She discerned the
               <lb/>falsehood of her description, for <persName>Rose</persName> was
               <lb/>cheerful, without any improper vivacity
               <lb/>that borders on indiscretion.
            </p>
            <p>The character her ladyship had drawn
               <lb/>of her would have been more applicable
               <lb/>to <persName>Jane</persName> formerly, before misfortune had
               <lb/>corrected her errors. Since her separation
               <lb/>from <persName>Guildford</persName>, she was amazingly improv­
               <lb/>ed, and the alteration afforded her mother
               <lb/>the most refined pleasure. Every letter
               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName> had received from <persName>colonel Guilford</persName>
               <lb/>since they left <placeName>Devonshire</placeName> gave a satisfac­
               <lb/>tory account of little <persName>Caroline</persName>, whom she
               <lb/>was impatient to embrace, and anxious,
               <lb/>for her sake, to return to <placeName>Treharne</placeName>.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> sent to <placeName>Piccadilly</placeName>, to gain infor­
               <lb/>mation of <persName>Mary's</persName> (now <persName>lady Beaufort's</persName>)
               <lb/>residence, and received the intelligence of
               <lb/>her being at <placeName>Twickenham</placeName>, with his lord­
               <lb/>ship. <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> immediately address­
               <lb/>ed a letter to her, congratulating <persName>Mary</persName> on

               <lb/>her marriage, which she imagined had pre­
               <lb/>vented her from thinking of a friend truly
               <lb/>attached to her, who would always feel
               <lb/>the most sincere regard, if treated with
               <lb/>still greater unkindness. Notwithstand­
               <lb/>ing her engagements, <persName>Rose</persName> continued to
               <lb/>say, that she was convinced she would
               <lb/>be glad to hear she was released, by the
               <lb/>goodness of an excellent friend, from her
               <lb/>severe difficulties, which had caused her
               <lb/>to suffer most cruelly.
            </p>
            <p>Though <persName>Rose</persName> forgave <persName>Mary</persName> for her un­
               <lb/>feeling neglect, yet she could not help
               <lb/>shedding tears as the reflection obtruded
               <lb/>and pointed out the obduracy, ungentle­
               <lb/>ness, and unfriendliness of her behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>While she was sealing this letter, which
               <lb/>had occasioned very painful thoughts, <persName>Ka­
               <lb/>mira</persName> entered the room—<said>Me sorry in­
               <lb/>terrupt you, but gentleman come, wish
               <lb/>speak you directly.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Who is it?</said> said <persName>Rose</persName>.
            </p>
            <p><said>Me do not know.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> immediately went down, and found

            <milestone unit="sig" n="F9r"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">113</mw>
               <lb/><persName>Eustace</persName>, who seemed rejoiced to behold
               <lb/>her again—<said>How could you say you did
               <lb/>not know who it was, <persName>Kamira</persName>?</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Gentleman told to me, <said rend="pre(‘)post()">You not tell;

            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> could not help smiling at this ac­
               <lb/>count, as it appeared that <persName>Eustace</persName> flattered
               <lb/>himself she would be uncommonly glad
               <lb/>to see him. In the course of conversation,
               <lb/>he disclosed to <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> and her sis­
               <lb/>ter that his affairs were arranged sooner
               <lb/>than he expected, and that he had recover­
               <lb/>ed a considerable sum of money owing to
               <lb/>him, which had quite banished all his
               <lb/>cares, and he felt much happier than when
               <lb/>he left <placeName>England</placeName>. He mentioned that he
               <lb/>had visited <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, where he obtained
               <lb/>their address in town, and how much he
               <lb/>was shocked at observing the destruction
               <lb/>of that venerable building by the fire.
               <lb/><persName>Eustace</persName> expressed such infinite joy at see­
               <lb/>ing <persName>Rose</persName>, and evinced friendship so truly

               <lb/>affectionate, that it was impossible to avoid
               <lb/>being pleased with a conduct quite oppo­
               <lb/>site to the behaviour she expected from
               <lb/>him; it convinced her that his temper
               <lb/>was more faulty than his heart. The ex­
               <lb/>amples revealed to her, of the perfidy and
               <lb/>ingratitude too prevalent, made her view
               <lb/>with satisfaction and esteem a character
               <lb/>apparently capable of gratitude, of which
               <lb/>instances were very rare, although this vir­
               <lb/>tue was strikingly illustrated in the dispo­
               <lb/>sition of the grateful and faithful <persName>Kamira</persName>.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> considered <persName>Eustace</persName> as an addition
               <lb/>to the number of her friends, and related
               <lb/>to him the disagreeable circumstances at­
               <lb/>tendant on the death of <persName>sir James Douglas</persName>,
               <lb/>and that her father's claim to the estates
               <lb/>was disputed.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Eustace</persName> evidently sympathized in every
               <lb/>sorrow that afflicted her, and entreated,
               <lb/>if she wanted money at any time, that she
               <lb/>would apply to him, as he had not forgot­

               <lb/>has happened, which you will be concern­
               <lb/>ed to hear. My old relation is dead, and
               <lb/>not bequeathed me a shilling, after all his
               <lb/>repeated promises. Is it not aggravating,
               <lb/>when he buoyed up my hopes for a num­
               <lb/>ber of years?</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Perhaps if you had inherited all the
               <lb/>wealth he possessed, you would not have
               <lb/>been so happy as you are now. You
               <lb/>appear gay and cheerful; and if you had
               <lb/>received great riches, great cares would
               <lb/>have attended them, and instead of being
               <lb/>lively, your anxiety would be increased,
               <lb/>from solicitude respecting this long-ex­
               <lb/>pected fortune.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Eustace</persName> laughed—<said>Your philosophical
               <lb/>observations are very good, but I confess
               <lb/>I should prefer having plenty of money;
               <lb/>I cannot acquiesce with your opinion on
               <lb/>that subject.</said>

               <lb/>was introduced by <persName>Kamira</persName>. She was a
               <lb/>good-natured vulgar woman, and said to
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName>—<said>You had a letter from <placeName>Scotland</placeName>,
               <lb/>I understand, this morning, <persName>Miss Doug­
               <lb/>las</persName>, saying your papa was much better,
               <lb/>and out of danger, which I be very glad
               <lb/>to hear. Now, Miss, as this is the case, I
               <lb/>should be vastly glad if you would come
               <lb/>to the play with me; and your sister would
               <lb/>like to go, I think.</said>

            <p>At this moment <persName>Jane</persName> entered, and <persName>Mrs.

               <lb/>tickets for the pit at <placeName>Covent-garden</placeName>, and
               <lb/>hoped she would persuade her sister to go
               <lb/>there.—<said>It will divert you both a little, I
               <lb/>think,</said> said <persName>Mrs. Linn</persName>, <said>after all the
               <lb/>trouble you have been in. It is a deep

            <p><persName>Eustace</persName> thanked her, and said he should

               <lb/>was disposed to accept it, yet reluctantly
               <lb/>consented, from never having been in the
               <lb/>pit before. To this situation in the theatre
               <lb/>she had formed an aversion, from the ap­
               <lb/>prehension of having any thing thrown
               <lb/>from the galleries on her head, and likewise

               <lb/>ment, as his <rs type="properAdjective">Scotch</rs> relations were dis­

            <p><persName>Mrs. Linn</persName> detailed all this information

               <lb/>ingly well. Her complexion was very
               <lb/>dark—her manners extremely pleasing,
               <lb/>and she had a melancholy air which in­
               <lb/>terested <persName>Rose</persName>, as she attributed it to
               <lb/>grief at being separated from her hus­

            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Linn's</persName> country cousin was a good-
               <lb/>looking young man, who appeared sim­
               <lb/>plicity itself. His dialect was very pro­

               <lb/>vincial, but he seemed an amiable benefi­
               <lb/>cent creature.
            </p>
            <p>When the party entered the pit, it was
               <lb/>quite early, and the performance did not
               <lb/>commence for a long time afterwards. The
               <lb/>country cousin placed himself on one side
               <lb/>of <persName>Rose</persName>, and <persName>Eustace</persName> on the other.
            </p>
            <p><said>Do but look, <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>,</said> said the
               <lb/>former, <said>at that young man, and two
               <lb/>young women with him. They appear as
               <lb/>if they only came here to stuff their maw.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> directed her eyes to them, and
               <lb/>perceived that all three were eating al­
               <lb/>monds and raisins, apples, oranges, and
               <lb/>cakes, as if for a wager. The young man
               <lb/>was placed between the females, who tit­
               <lb/>tered, and seemed highly diverted when
               <lb/>he poured some liquid out of a bottle for
               <lb/>them to drink. One of the young wo­
               <lb/>men had a large white face, bloated with
               <lb/>good-living, and looked so inanimate and
               <lb/>greedy, that it was really a portrait of
               <lb/>heavy gluttony.
            </p>
            <p><said>It makes me sick to look at that white-

               <lb/>sin; <said>her face is like a piece of dough.
               <lb/>It astonishes me that the young man can
               <lb/>be so civil to her, for he seems to be a
               <lb/>sweetheart. To be sure, there is no ac­
               <lb/>counting for liking, but I could not fancy
               <lb/>such a stupid gormandizing thing.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> smiled, and could not but approve
               <lb/>the aversion he expressed.
            </p>
            <p>Near this group was seated a hand­
               <lb/>some gentlemanly man, with a morose
               <lb/>countenance, and by his side a pretty
               <lb/><name>Frenchwoman</name>, evidently his wife. He
               <lb/>seemed very discontented because they
               <lb/>waited a long time before the play began.
            </p>
            <p><said>I am quite tired of staying here,</said> he
               <lb/>growled out, in a peevish surly tone.
               <lb/><said>If the performance does not begin soon,
               <lb/>I shall leave the theatre.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said><emph rend="slant(italic)">Patience, patience!</emph></said> replied the sweet
               <lb/><name>Frenchwoman</name>, in a soft harmonious voice,
               <lb/>which, contrasted with the harsh tones
               <lb/>and fretful manner of her husband, quite
               <lb/>entertained <persName>Rose</persName>.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> now looked round the
               <lb/>house, and gazed at an old lady, dressed

            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">122</mw>
               <lb/>very gaudily, in one of the lower boxes.
               <lb/>The poor old lady had been afflicted with
               <lb/>the palsy, and her head shook so much,
               <lb/>that every eye was directed at her. <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>was concerned at her want of understand­
               <lb/>ing in making herself a public shew, as
               <lb/>she attracted the notice of all the spec­
               <lb/>tators. She regretted that the old lady
               <lb/>did not seek more rational and retired
               <lb/>amusement.
            </p>
            <p>This evening seemed destined for elder­
               <lb/>ly ladies to make themselves quite gazing-
               <lb/>stocks. Another, about the same age as
               <lb/>the former, being exceedingly deaf, had a
               <lb/>speaking-trumpet of an uncommon length,
               <lb/>which looked very ridiculous, hanging
               <lb/>over the side of the box.
            </p>
            <p>The part of <persName>Monimia</persName> was inimitably
               <lb/>well performed; and during one very af­
               <lb/>fecting scene, <persName>Rose</persName> could not help crying.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Linn</persName> perceived her emotion, and
               <lb/>called out to her—<said>Come, come, Miss!
               <lb/>what nonsense is this, crying for a sham!
               <lb/>Now, Miss, I thought you had more

               <lb/>sense, and would not be so foolish as to
               <lb/>cry for a sham—No, no, indeed.</said>
            </p>
            <p>This ridiculous speech quite dried up
               <lb/>her tears, and its absurdity inclined her
               <lb/>rather to laugh than weep.
            </p>
            <p>When the play was nearly finished,
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> discovered <persName>lady Elinor</persName> in one of the
               <lb/>private boxes with <persName>lady Morrington</persName> and
               <lb/><persName>sir Henry Arundel</persName>. <persName>Sir Henry</persName> she thought
               <lb/>looked very dull, though her ladyship was
               <lb/>talking to him with apparent energy, and
               <lb/>another gentleman to <persName>lady Elinor</persName>.
            </p>
            <p>The entertainment now took place; and
               <lb/>just before it began, a blind man was led in.
            </p>
            <p><said>Only think how odd it is, Miss!</said> said
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Linn</persName>; <said>here is a blind man come
               <lb/>to see the play!</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>To hear the music, undoubtedly,</said> re­

            </p>
            <p>The eccentricity of her companions
               <lb/>quite diverted her, and the singularity of
               <lb/>the country cousin more particularly than
               <lb/>the others. A fashionable fop, in the

            </p>
            <p><said>You do not dress in such a coxcomi­
               <lb/>cal style in the country?</said> said <persName>Rose</persName> to the
               <lb/>cousin.
            </p>
            <p><said>Oh no, <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>; it would not
               <lb/>do to dress in that manner with our
               <lb/>country way of speaking; it will not suit,
               <lb/>and be quite out of character.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> thought this observation truly
               <lb/>sensible; and as <persName>Eustace</persName> was obliged to
               <lb/>quit the theatre before the entertainment
               <lb/>was quite finished, the cousin offered her
               <lb/>his arm.
            </p>
            <p>As she proceeded with him and the rest
               <lb/>of the party to <placeName>South Audley-street</placeName>, he in­
               <lb/>formed her that he was come to town to
               <lb/>consult a physician respecting his health,
               <lb/>and had been with one that morning, who
               <lb/>was allowed to be very skilful.

               <lb/>they are very deceiving. Certainly mine
               <lb/>is an odd sort of a complaint—it is being
               <lb/>always hungry, and having constantly a
               <lb/>craving for food. The doctor asked me
               <lb/>how many meals I ate every day? and I
               <lb/>told him, when I got up in the morning,
               <lb/>I had a quart-bason of milk and bread;
               <lb/>at breakfast, two rounds of hot buttered
               <lb/>toast, and tea; bread and cheese for my
               <lb/>lunch; and at dinner, at least a pound and
               <lb/>a half of solid meat, with vegetables, and
               <lb/>half of the pudding, to which I helped
               <lb/>myself. The physician said to me—<said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">But
               <lb/>if you take half the pudding, as you are
               <lb/>a large family, what is there left for the

               <lb/>fore they walked in the Park, entered <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Linn's</persName> parlour, to inquire after her health,
               <lb/>but were going to retreat when they per­
               <lb/>ceived she was conversing with two strange
               <lb/>gentlemen.
            </p>
            <p><said>Don't run away, ladies—I insist upon
               <lb/>it you do not!</said> exclaimed this good-na­
               <lb/>tured vulgar woman; <said>I have no secrets.
               <lb/>One of these gentlemen is settling about
               <lb/>boarding with me, as our <distinct><rs type="properAdjective">Jarman</rs></distinct> count
               <lb/>talks of leaving soon for <distinct><placeName>Jarmany</placeName></distinct>. Come,
               <lb/>sit down, ladies; I shall be vexed if you
               <lb/>don't.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName> complied, and had lei­
               <lb/>sure, while the younger of the gentlemen
               <lb/>was speaking to <persName>Mrs. Linn</persName>, to look at
               <lb/>them both. The elder of the gentlemen
               <lb/>was apparently about forty, and the other,
               <lb/>a dashing-looking young man, appeared
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">to</mw>

               <lb/>to be six-and-twenty.—<said>I hope,</said> said he
               <lb/>to <persName>Mrs. Linn</persName>, <said>that your husband is not
               <lb/>infirm, as I should not like to board with
               <lb/>any one who was so. I must also inform
               <lb/>you, that I expected every day to have an
               <lb/>original dinner.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I don't know what you mean, sir, by
               <lb/>an original dinner.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Then, madam, I will explain it—I
               <lb/>mean something dressed fresh and hot
               <lb/>every day.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>My friend,</said> said the elderly man,
               <lb/><said>paid three hundred a-year at the board­
               <lb/>ing-house where he resided last, and I
               <lb/>think he ought to have been well treated
               <lb/>for that sum, which is not commonly
               <lb/>given.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>So I think, sir,</said> replied <persName>Mrs. Linn</persName>;
               <lb/><said>it is a very handsome price, and you
               <lb/>may be sure, if he pays it me, he shall
               <lb/>have fish, flesh, and fowl too, hot every
               <lb/>day.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I was quite disgusted with a board­
               <lb/>ing-house,</said> said the dashing young man;

               <lb/><said>for that reason I intend to board in a
               <lb/>private family. You would hardly be­
               <lb/>lieve it, madam, but we had daily <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">hachis</foreign>,
               <lb/>or <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">grillé</foreign>, till I was quite tired of it—never
               <lb/>an original meal. Sunday was the only
               <lb/>flash dinner, and then, unfortunately, I
               <lb/>always dined out.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I never heard of hashee and grillee be­
               <lb/>fore, sir,</said> ejaculated <persName>Mrs. Linn</persName>; <said>I sup­
               <lb/>pose they be some new-fangled dishes. I
               <lb/>don't know how much of your fashionable vic­
               <lb/>tuals, though I can dress cutlets mante­
               <lb/>nong way as well as any body; and for
               <lb/>good boiled and roast, nobody, I'll be bold
               <lb/>to say, can dress a dinner better. As for
               <lb/>pastry and puddings, I have them at my
               <lb/>fingers' ends; and if you should be poor­
               <lb/>ly at any time, I can make you a good
               <lb/>drop of broth or gruel with any one, let
               <lb/>them be who they will.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I doubt not, madam, being very com­
               <lb/>fortable under your protection and roof,
               <lb/>yet I cannot give a decisive answer at pre­
               <lb/>sent. I have several other places to visit;

               <lb/>but rely on hearing from me to-morrow.
               <lb/>Good-morning, madam—good morning,
               <lb/>ladies!</said> and with a graceful bow he quit­
               <lb/>ted the parlour, followed by his companion.
            </p>
            <p>When the street-door closed on them,
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Linn</persName> said, in a doleful voice—<said>I
               <lb/>believe I have been throwing away my
               <lb/>time in listening to these fellows, who, I
               <lb/>think, on second thoughts, are a couple of
               <lb/>swindlers, going about making fools of
               <lb/>people they are not likely to cheat. If I
               <lb/>don't hear from them to-morrow, I shall
               <lb/>set them down for what I have said. Three
               <lb/>hundredy a-year indeed! a likely story!—
               <lb/>few people would give so extravagant a
               <lb/>price, with his hashee and his grillee; for
               <lb/>all he is decked out so smart, and talks of
               <lb/>his fine dishes, I dare say his belly is
               <lb/>pretty empty—he looks as lank as a grey­
               <lb/>hound, and would be glad of a good mut­
               <lb/>ton-hash, such as I make, with mushroom
               <lb/>catsup.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I am of the same opinion, <persName>Mrs. Linn</persName>,

               <lb/>their being swindlers; but confess I have
               <lb/>been highly diverted with the dasher's
               <lb/>original dinners; there is something quite
               <lb/>new in the expression.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> acknowledged that she had been
               <lb/>equally entertained.
            </p>
            <p><said>I dare to say,</said> exclaimed <persName>Mrs. Linn</persName>,
               <lb/><said>that if I had been a lone woman, they
               <lb/>would have thought to take me in: but
               <lb/>they should have seen they had the wrong
               <lb/>sow by the ear, if I had not been married.</said>
            </p>
            <p>The sisters now quitted <persName>Mrs. Linn</persName>;
               <lb/>and when they came back from their ac­
               <lb/>customed walk in <placeName>Hyde-park</placeName>, found an
               <lb/>order from the colonel of the regiment to
               <lb/>which <persName>Felix</persName> belonged, commanding him
               <lb/>to join his battalion immediately. It was

               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> felt a consolation, since he was oblig­
               <lb/>ed to leave them, at the prospect of his re­
               <lb/>siding near their parents. The colonel ob­

               <lb/>absent! The knowledge of such an event
               <lb/>befalling his dear sister <persName>Rose</persName> would have
               <lb/>made his susceptible and affectionate mind
               <lb/>quite miserable; it would have induced
               <lb/>him to apply then to his father, who might
               <lb/>have been inconvenienced to obtain this
               <lb/>sum, in addition to his other expences. Her
               <lb/>grateful heart glowed with warmest grati­
               <lb/>tude to that sweet benevolent creature,
               <lb/><persName>lady Elinor</persName>, whom she valued as her
               <lb/>guardian angel; goodness, thus exquisite
               <lb/>and rare, had saved her from excess of
               <lb/>misery, and shielded her from being ex­
               <lb/>posed to repeated insults from <persName>Courtenay</persName>,

               <lb/>taken advantage of her forlorn and un­
               <lb/>protected situation.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> was mentally reflecting with plea­
               <lb/>sure on the perfections that adorned <persName>lady
               <lb/>Elinor's</persName> character, when the object of her
               <lb/>contemplation called to see her. Her lady­
               <lb/>ship was introduced to <persName>Felix</persName>, who attend­
               <lb/>ed them soon after to a fashionable auction,
               <lb/>as he was allowed three days' indulgence,
               <lb/>to have his new clothes made, and procure
               <lb/>several military articles that he required.
            </p>
            <p>Here they met <persName>lady Beaufort</persName>, who pre­
               <lb/>tended to be very happy to meet her,
               <lb/>which <persName>Rose</persName>, from the attachment she had
               <lb/>ever entertained for her, too weakly and
               <lb/>readily credited.
            </p>
            <p>When they quitted the auction-room,
               <lb/><persName>lady Elinor</persName> observed—<said>There is some­
               <lb/>thing in <persName>lady Beaufort's</persName> countenance that
               <lb/>does not please me—it is inanimate and
               <lb/>malevolent; and I have heard her make

               <lb/>mate friend, which gave me a vile opinion
               <lb/>of her, since I have known you speak
               <lb/>in the highest terms of her. I cannot
               <lb/>therefore admire your discernment in the
               <lb/>choice of a friend. Did you never ob­
               <lb/>serve how intolerably vain she is?</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I loved her so sincerely, that I could
               <lb/>not discover any fault in her disposition.
               <lb/>Yet she judges me guilty of the greatest
               <lb/>crime—a crime which the world in gene­
               <lb/>ral never pardons.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>What is it?</said> replied <persName>lady Elinor</persName>.
            </p>
            <p><said>Poverty,</said> rejoined <persName>Rose</persName>, smiling—<said>an
               <lb/>offence that is not to be forgiven by world­
               <lb/>ly characters. If they find you justly

            <p><persName>Felix</persName> and <persName>lady Elinor</persName> were amused
               <lb/>with this assertion, and acknowledged its
               <lb/>usual correctness. They set <persName>Felix</persName> down
               <lb/>at his hatter's, and proceeded to <placeName>South
               <lb/>Audley-street</placeName>, where <persName>lady Elinor</persName> left

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> had just divested herself of her

               <lb/>moned her to <persName>sir Henry Arundel</persName>. His vi­
               <lb/>sit was to <persName>Felix</persName>, and on being informed he
               <lb/>was out on military business, he asked for
               <lb/>the ladies. <persName>Jane</persName> said she would join them
               <lb/>when she had finished her letter, and <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>was compelled to attend <persName>sir Henry</persName>.
            </p>
            <p>His countenance brightened with in­
               <lb/>ward satisfaction at meeting with her
               <lb/>alone, an opportunity which he had long
               <lb/>sighed for, but never before obtained, as
               <lb/>he had an aversion to disclosing his senti­
               <lb/>ments in writing. By personally avowing
               <lb/>his passion, he imagined it more easy to
               <lb/>discern if his suit was acceptable to the ob­
               <lb/>ject of his enamoured fancy.

               <lb/>him in her esteem, as it convinced <persName>Rose</persName> of
               <lb/>the truth of his regard, <persName>sir Henry</persName> unequi­

               <lb/>that had ever made an impression on his

            </p>
            <p>It deeply wounded <persName>Rose</persName> to decline the
               <lb/>addresses, and inflict pain on the mind of
               <lb/>so amiable and accomplished a man, who
               <lb/>honoured her by his selection and offer of

               <lb/>males who were solicitous to attract his

               <lb/><persName>Delavalle</persName>, and the genuine affection she
               <lb/>felt for him alone, that neither time, ab­
               <lb/>sence, nor any event, could lessen, influ­
               <lb/>enced her to decisively, though in the
               <lb/>mildest and most delicate manner, reject
               <lb/>his addresses.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Sir Henry</persName> betrayed an emotion at her
               <lb/>refusal, that she had never before witness­
               <lb/>ed, and was affected so vehemently, that
               <lb/>he even shed tears.
            </p>
            <p>The tender heart of <persName>Rose</persName> could not be­
               <lb/>hold unmoved such exquisite sensibility
               <lb/>and ardent regard; it made her quite
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">miserable;</mw>
            <pb/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="G9v"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">138</mw>
               <lb/>miserable; and in a voice hardly articulate
               <lb/>and intelligible, from suppressed internal
               <lb/>agitation and grief, she assured <persName>sir Henry</persName>,
               <lb/>that had her affection not been previously
               <lb/>engaged, before his declaration of esteem,
               <lb/>there was no man who would have prefer­
               <lb/>red to him, or whose love would have flat­
               <lb/>tered her more. This prior engagement,
               <lb/>she hoped, would be a sufficient apology
               <lb/>to him, who was so honourable himself,
               <lb/>for her declining to give him any encou­
               <lb/>ragement.
            </p>
            <p>A confession thus kind and gentle soft­
               <lb/>ened, in a slight degree, the severe pangs
               <lb/>his disappointment and her rejection had
               <lb/>caused. At this interesting moment <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>entered, and guessed what had passed,
               <lb/>from the expression of melancholy in <persName>sir
               <lb/>Henry's</persName> countenance, and the serious air
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> wore. To revive their spirits, she
               <lb/>said a number of ridiculous things, and
               <lb/>succeeded in restoring their composure.
            </p>
            <p>When <persName>sir Henry</persName> was going, <persName>Rose</persName> held
               <lb/>out her hand to him. He respectfully
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">took</mw>
            <pb/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="G10r"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">139</mw>
               <lb/>took it, and said, dejectedly—<said>Since I
               <lb/>have lost the cherished hope of acquiring
               <lb/>the title of your lover, which has for a te­
               <lb/>dious interval been my highest ambition,
               <lb/>allow me the appellation that I value next
               <lb/>to it, the name of your friend. A true
               <lb/>and faithful one, if I am permitted that
               <lb/>honour, you will find me for life.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> thanked him, and replied, with
               <lb/>unfeigned sincerity, that she should feel
               <lb/>truly gratified to rank him among the
               <lb/>number of her friends, for whom she al­
               <lb/>ready had the highest esteem, the most
               <lb/>lasting foundation for friendship.
            </p>
            <p>When he was gone, <persName>Rose</persName> exclaimed,
               <lb/>with a sigh—<said>How ardently do I wish
               <lb/>for my best beloved's return, for I am un­
               <lb/>happy at being subjected to proposals of
               <lb/>marriage when I am engaged! It asto­
               <lb/>nishes me that any woman can like to be
               <lb/>a coquette, and take a pleasure in the un­
               <lb/>easiness of those who adore her, and whose
               <lb/>affection she has gained by a false appear­
               <lb/>ance of tenderness she does not feel. I

               <lb/>wish I was married, and I should then be
               <lb/>protected from a repetition of similar un­
               <lb/>pleasant scenes. <persName>Courtenay</persName> has given me
               <lb/>a distaste to professions of love—it is only
               <lb/>from my <persName>Delavalle's</persName> lips that I wish to
               <lb/>hear that endearing word pronounced.</said>
            </p>
            <p>Before <persName>Rose</persName> had quite finished speak­
               <lb/>ing, the <persName>count de <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName> was announced.
               <lb/>Since they had met him at <persName>lady Morring­
               <lb/>ton's</persName>, he had frequently visited them, and
               <lb/>was so assiduous and attentive to <persName>Jane</persName>,
               <lb/>that it inspired <persName>Rose</persName> with the expectation
               <lb/>that it would end in a mutual attachment,
               <lb/>and that she would enjoy the felicity of
               <lb/>seeing her happily united to a man who
               <lb/>really loved her, and that her parents would
               <lb/>approve.
            </p>
            <p><persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName> requested to be allowed to
               <lb/>attend them to an exhibition of paintings
               <lb/>in the neighbourhood. Solicitous to oblige
               <lb/>the count, from the hope of seeing him
               <lb/>happily married to <persName>Jane</persName>, <persName>Rose</persName> instantly
               <lb/>complied, and persuaded her sister to ac­
               <lb/>cept this invitation.

            <p>When they entered the exhibition-room,
               <lb/>the first object their eyes encountered was
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>, leaning on an elegant-looking
               <lb/>man's arm, and waddling about from one
               <lb/>picture to the other.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> turned very pale at the sight of her
               <lb/>bitter enemy, the corrupt source of her
               <lb/>greatest errors, who had instigated <persName>Guil­
               <lb/>ford</persName> to plot her ruin, and by her vulgar
               <lb/>barbarity reduced her to the verge of the
               <lb/>grave. She trembled so excessively, that
               <lb/>it obliged her to hold <persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName>'s</persName> arm
               <lb/>more firmly, and she moved on with him
               <lb/>and her sister, almost unconscious where
               <lb/>she was. That she might not be recog­
               <lb/>nized by her was her utmost wish, and
               <lb/>she hoped it, as the room was very full of
               <lb/>company.
            </p>
            <p>Doomed, however, to disappointment,
               <lb/>at the moment when <persName>Jane</persName> thought she had
               <lb/>escaped, and she was going away, <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Pryce</persName> turned back, saying—<said>Let us have
               <lb/>another look,</said> and rather rolling than walk­
               <lb/>ing, advanced again to the top of the room,

               <lb/>opposite to where <persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName> and his fair
               <lb/>companions were standing.
            </p>
            <p>No sooner did this malicious woman
               <lb/>glance her eye on the party, than she in­
               <lb/>stantly knew them, and with all the ma­
               <lb/>lice inherent in her wicked disposition, in­
               <lb/>elegantly bawled out—<said>How do you do,
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Guilford</persName>?</said> and boldly approached
               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName>. <said>How is your child?</said> she malig­
               <lb/>nantly continued; <said>well, I hope? You
               <lb/>look better than you did before your con­
               <lb/>finement—quite like a single Miss.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> was now as white as her sister,
               <lb/>who sunk insensible into <persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName>'s</persName>
               <lb/>arms, that eagerly supported her.
            </p>
            <p><said>What affectation?</said> cried <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>;

            <p>The natural gentleness of <persName>Rose</persName> yielded

               <lb/>her sister's indiscretion daring to publicly
               <lb/>and brutally insult her, and she exclaim­
               <lb/>ed, with great spirit—<said>Begone, woman!

               <lb/>ted the count, in an indignant tone; <said>if
               <lb/>you presume to address these young la­
               <lb/>dies with any additional impertinence and
               <lb/>insolence, I shall forget your sex, and chas­

               <lb/>your protector shall not prevent your re­

               <lb/>serves.</said>
            </p>
            <p>High words now ensued between the
               <lb/>count and <persName>Mrs. Pryce's</persName> companion, as <persName>De
               <lb/><placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName> had silenced her. They ex­
               <lb/>changed cards, and the count was evident­
               <lb/>ly anxious to remove <persName>Jane</persName> from this situ­
               <lb/>ation, that attracted every eye towards
               <lb/>them, as his lovely burthen continued
               <lb/>senseless.
            </p>
            <p>A man belonging to the exhibition pro­
               <lb/>cured a hackney-coach, in which they
               <lb/>placed <persName>Jane</persName>, who was beginning to reco­

               <lb/>ver from her swoon, and had quite regain­
               <lb/>ed her senses when they reached home.
               <lb/>Though restored to animation, <persName>Jane</persName> felt
               <lb/>so ill and dejected, that <persName>Rose</persName> advised her
               <lb/>being undressed and put to bed.
            </p>
            <p>In the meanwhile <persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName> express­
               <lb/>ed an anxiety respecting her sister, that
               <lb/>prepossessed <persName>Rose</persName> exceedingly, and made
               <lb/>her judge that his heart was feeling; and
               <lb/>his spirited behaviour in defence of <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>heightened her good opinion. He would
               <lb/>not quit the house till informed of her re­
               <lb/>covery, and that she had sunk into a calm
               <lb/>slumber.
            </p>
            <p>The count came early the following
               <lb/>morning, to inquire after the health of
               <lb/><persName>Miss Jane Douglas</persName>, who was not up, being
               <lb/>very ill and feverish.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> conjectured, from appearances,
               <lb/>that <persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName> entertained a real attach­
               <lb/>ment for her sister; she concluded, there­
               <lb/>fore, that if his love was as ardent as she
               <lb/>supposed, it would not be lessened if she
               <lb/>imparted the cruel deception practised by

               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> and <persName>colonel Guilford</persName> on her
               <lb/>innocent inexperienced sister, of whose
               <lb/>ignorance of the world they had basely
               <lb/>taken advantage. <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> reflect­
               <lb/>ed, that if she did not relate the truth, the
               <lb/>count might form conjectures more disad­
               <lb/>vantageous to <persName>Jane</persName> than the reality. Im­
               <lb/>prudence alone could be attributed to her
               <lb/>in this unfortunate affair, for there was not
               <lb/>the least criminality attached to her; and
               <lb/>no man truly enamoured could object to
               <lb/>marrying her because she had been the
               <lb/>victim of deceit.
            </p>
            <p>In answer to some question <persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>
               <lb/>put to her, relative to their acquaintance
               <lb/>with <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>, <persName>Rose</persName> replied, that if he
               <lb/>would promise not to betray the confi­
               <lb/>dence she was inclined to repose, from a
               <lb/>high opinion of his honour, she would de­
               <lb/>velop, without reserve, every circumstance
               <lb/>relating to <persName>Jane</persName> that at present appeared
               <lb/>mysterious.
            </p>
            <p>The count assured her that she might
               <lb/>rely on the trust being sacred, and that he

            <p>In consequence of these protestations of
               <lb/>secrecy, <persName>Rose</persName> related the circumstances re­
               <lb/>lative to their first acquaintance with <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Pryce</persName>, her subsequent artifices to persuade
               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName> to visit her unknown to her family,
               <lb/>her introduction of <persName>colonel Guilford</persName>, and,
               <lb/>owing to her persuasion and manœuvres,
               <lb/>the fatal termination of this connexion in
               <lb/>a pretended marriage with the colonel.
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> likewise related the cruel insults of
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>, when <persName>Jane</persName> was placed in a si­
               <lb/>tuation that would have melted any heart

            <p><persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName> was much affected with
               <lb/>this interesting narration, and did not as­

               <lb/>prospect of his intentions being honour­

               <lb/>and designing <persName>Guilford</persName> to effect her ruin.
               <lb/>The favourable expectations of <persName>Rose</persName> were
               <lb/>increased when <persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName> assured her
               <lb/>that he had the highest esteem, admiration,
               <lb/>and pity, for <persName>Miss Jane</persName>, that her narrative
               <lb/>had increased.
            </p>
            <p><said>I flatter myself,</said> he exclaimed, when
               <lb/>they separated, <said>that I shall, at some hap­
               <lb/>py period, have it in my power to call you
               <lb/>by the affectionate name of sister, as I
               <lb/>have lately hoped that my attentions were
               <lb/>not displeasing. May I therefore solicit
               <lb/>an interview with <persName>Miss Jane</persName>, as soon as
               <lb/>her health will allow her to receive me?</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> replied, that he might depend on
               <lb/>every exertion on her part to persuade her
               <lb/>sister to give him an early meeting; and
               <lb/>when the count left her, her spirits were
               <lb/>quite elevated. His last speech clearly
               <lb/>insinuated, that his love was such as would
               <lb/>reflect honour on the object of his regard.
               <lb/>This hope quite soothed the mind of <persName>Rose</persName>,
               <lb/>whose highest ambition was to see <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>well and happily married. In this re­

               <lb/>spectable station, she knew that she would
               <lb/>be protected from the insults of <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Pryce</persName>, whose malignant perseverance in
               <lb/>grossly affronting her was uncommon (not­
               <lb/>withstanding malevolence is too predomi­
               <lb/>nant), as <persName>Jane</persName> never molested or offended
               <lb/>her, though she had proved the cause of
               <lb/>her destruction.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> was quite recovered the next day,
               <lb/>and when the count waited on <persName>Miss Doug­
               <lb/>las</persName>, he had the satisfaction of seeing the
               <lb/>sisters together. <persName>Rose</persName> had imparted to
               <lb/>her sister the conversation that passed be­
               <lb/>tween her and <persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>, and in a few
               <lb/>minutes left <persName>Jane</persName> alone with him. <persName>Felix</persName>
               <lb/>was out, and did not return till late at
               <lb/>night, being wholly engaged with his mi­
               <lb/>litary affairs.
            </p>
            <p>The count remained two hours with
               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName>, uninterrupted by <persName>Rose</persName>, who was de­
               <lb/>lighted at perceiving her sister in high
               <lb/>spirits, as it convinced her their conversa­
               <lb/>tion had been satisfactory; and she warm­
               <lb/>ly participated in the felicity that had long

               <lb/>been a stranger to the bosom of <persName>Jane
               <lb/>Douglas</persName>. It was indeed very proper that
               <lb/>poor <persName>Rose</persName> should enjoy a gleam of happi­
               <lb/>ness, as the exquisite feelings of her mind
               <lb/>were doomed to be continually lacerated.
            </p>
            <p>The moment now arrived when she was
               <lb/>to part with a brother, the best and most
               <lb/>affectionate of human beings. In every
               <lb/>situation of life in which he was engaged,
               <lb/>he had conducted himself with integrity,
               <lb/>courage, and propriety, and his family
               <lb/>were honoured by the superiority of his
               <lb/>character. His affection and friendship
               <lb/>was a sweet and soothing balm to <persName>Rose</persName>,
               <lb/>and supported her resolution in the most
               <lb/>trying scenes. She could never endure
               <lb/>the thoughts of disgracing him by acting
               <lb/>unworthily. Had her inclination for vir­
               <lb/>tue been weak, her attachment to him
               <lb/>would have been an excitement to it, that
               <lb/>her sister's conduct might be a credit to
               <lb/>him. His sensibility resembled hers, though
               <lb/>he sustained the wounds of misfortune
               <lb/>with manly energy. <persName>Rose</persName>, who knew the

               <lb/>acuteness of his feelings, always concealed
               <lb/>(when she conveniently could) every event
               <lb/>that would hurt them.
            </p>
            <p>By <persName>Felix</persName> she sent an affectionate letter
               <lb/>to her parents, requesting to hear from
               <lb/>them, as it appeared a long time since her
               <lb/>mother had written, whom she congratu­
               <lb/>lated on her father's recovery.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> liked her brother, who had an in­
               <lb/>dulgence for her failings, that few brothers
               <lb/>would have had; yet she did not feel
               <lb/>that enthusiastic regard that <persName>Rose</persName> felt for
               <lb/>every object of her ardent attachment.
               <lb/>Though much improved in her manners,
               <lb/>her disposition still remained selfish, and
               <lb/>she only poignantly felt for her own suf­
               <lb/>ferings, and any event connected with her
               <lb/>passions and happiness. Her child she
               <lb/>loved, and was interested in its welfare—
               <lb/>it was a part of herself; but to the infant of
               <lb/>any other person, however nearly related,
               <lb/>she would have been quite indifferent.
               <lb/>Her affection for her sister was governed
               <lb/>by the same motive; she was useful to
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">her,</mw>
            <pb/>

               <lb/>her, and shielded her from many sorrows
               <lb/>that would have pressed more heavily had
               <lb/>she not shared them, and lightened her
               <lb/>cares by her advice and participation in
               <lb/>every thing that afflicted her. But had
               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName> never erred, she would not have
               <lb/>known the value of her sisterly tenderness,
               <lb/>and despised it; nor would she have made
               <lb/>that allowance for the faults of <persName>Rose</persName>, if
               <lb/>she had been indiscreet, that her sister did
               <lb/>for her, but viewed her errors with severi­
               <lb/>ty. Never, indeed, were two characters
               <lb/>more opposite; for the compassionate heart
               <lb/>of <persName>Rose</persName> was moved with pity for the af­
               <lb/>flictions even of a stranger, and her tears
               <lb/>fell at the recital of their woes, as the soft
               <lb/>summer-shower that bathes the sweet­
               <lb/>briar's scented leaves, and exhales its fra­
               <lb/>grance.

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> continued alone the greater part
               <lb/>of the day, and when her sister and her­
               <lb/>self met in the evening, had the satisfac­
               <lb/>tion of hearing that the count had been
               <lb/>with her several hours. The pleasure he
               <lb/>apparently took in the society of <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>convinced her that the fancy he had taken

               <lb/>and lasting passion, frequent intercourse
               <lb/>having heightened his regard.

               <lb/>jewels and wedding-clothes. It was not
               <lb/>exactly the conduct she would have adopt­
               <lb/>ed on such an occasion, but she remember­
               <lb/>ed, in extenuation of <persName>Mary</persName>, the she had
               <lb/>acted as the generality of mankind would
               <lb/>have done, who do not like to make sacri­
               <lb/>fices even for their dearest friend. <persName>Lady
               <lb/>Elinor</persName> would have pursued a very differ­
               <lb/>ent line of conduct, but few who resembled
               <lb/>her in sweetness and superior excellence
               <lb/>existed. <persName>Mary</persName> was dear to her, but she
               <lb/>could not esteem her as she did her fair pre­
               <lb/>server, <persName>lady Elinor</persName>, whom she admired, re­
               <lb/>spected, and idolized.
            </p>
            <p>On returning home, as it was late, she
               <lb/>was informed by <persName>Kamira</persName> that <persName>Jane</persName> had re­
               <lb/>tired to rest, being a little indisposed—that
               <lb/><persName>Eustace</persName> had left his card, and <persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>
               <lb/>made (as usual) a very long visit.
            </p>
            <p>Pleased with the occurrences and news
               <lb/>of the day, <persName>Rose</persName> sought their apartment,
               <lb/>where she found her sister fast asleep, and
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">was</mw>

            <milestone unit="sig" n="H7r"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">157</mw>
               <lb/>was careful not to disturb her. She had
               <lb/>learnt from <persName>lady Beaufort</persName>, whose lord had
               <lb/>several relations in the army, that the troops
               <lb/>were soon to return from <placeName>Holland</placeName>, and that
               <lb/><persName>sir Eglamour Delavalle</persName> had escaped the
               <lb/>dangers of the last battle. This soothing
               <lb/>intelligence inspired the consoling idea that
               <lb/>all their affairs would wear a favourable as­
               <lb/>pect; and with these agreeable thoughts oc­
               <lb/>cupying her mind, sleep quickly sealed her
               <lb/>eyelids, and her slumbers were calm and re­
               <lb/>freshing.
            </p>
            <p>At the usual hour <persName>Rose Douglas</persName> awoke,
               <lb/>revived and cheerful, as the restoration of
               <lb/><persName>Mary</persName>, in some degree, to her good opinion,
               <lb/>animated her mind. She was naturally so
               <lb/>gentle and affectionate, that it was painful
               <lb/>for her to think harshly of any one she had
               <lb/>valued.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> had left the room, but that was cus­
               <lb/>tomary since her separation from <persName>Guilford</persName>,
               <lb/>that had prevented her sleeping so much
               <lb/>as formerly, as she was frequently restless,
               <lb/>from disagreeable thoughts and cruel re­
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">flections</mw>

            <milestone unit="sig" n="H7v"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">158</mw>
               <lb/>flections that obtruded, and banished her
               <lb/>morning repose.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> wished she had risen less early, as
               <lb/>she was impatient to impart <persName>lady Beaufort's</persName>
               <lb/>kindness and winning attention. She dress­
               <lb/>ed hastily, and on going to arrange her glos­
               <lb/>sy ringlets before the looking-glass, per­
               <lb/>ceived a letter on the dressing-table, direct­
               <lb/>ed to her. The address was in a hand­
               <lb/>writing she did not know, and she smiled
               <lb/>at the idea of having slept so soundly that
               <lb/>she did not hear <persName>Kamira</persName> enter, and place it
               <lb/>there, as it was not on the toilet at night,
               <lb/>when she undressed.
            </p>
            <p>But when <persName>Rose</persName> opened this unwelcome
               <lb/>letter, consternation and misery inexpres­
               <lb/>sible saddened her mind, where cheerfulness
               <lb/>and serenity were inmates till she perused
               <lb/>its depressing contents. Alas! it was from
               <lb/>the weak, giddy, and inconsiderate <persName>Jane</persName>,
               <lb/>who had already caused her the most bitter
               <lb/>sorrow.
            </p>
            <p>After a very affectionate beginning, she
               <lb/>informed <persName>Rose</persName> she had withdrawn from

               <lb/>their residence, to place herself under the
               <lb/>protection of the <persName>count de <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>, who
               <lb/>had liberally made a very handsome set­
               <lb/>tlement on her. <persName>Jane</persName> observed that she
               <lb/>was tempted to accept this offer, as she
               <lb/>beheld no other prospect but that of mea­
               <lb/>gre poverty staring them in the face, and
               <lb/>expected, if the lawsuit terminated unfa­
               <lb/>vourably, which they had every reason to
               <lb/>fear, that they would all be totally ruined.
               <lb/>To be poor she could not support, and
               <lb/>listened, in consequence, to the count's ar­
               <lb/>guments in favour of the step she had
               <lb/>taken, which she would not weary her
               <lb/>now by repeating. His persuasions were
               <lb/>enforced by his suggesting that she could
               <lb/>never hope to be married after the indis­
               <lb/>cretion she had committed; it would, he
               <lb/>said, prevent a man of delicacy from think­
               <lb/>ing of her in an honourable light. She
               <lb/>considered it, therefore, as the wisest plan
               <lb/>to follow his advice, being likewise influ­
               <lb/>enced by his promise of allowing her child
               <lb/>to be with her—a felicity she could not

               <lb/>otherwise hope to taste while she remained
               <lb/>unmarried. <persName>Jane</persName> added, that she reflect­
               <lb/>ed, even if she did, her husband would
               <lb/>probably dislike the sight of <persName>Caroline</persName>, if
               <lb/>he knew it was the offspring of another
               <lb/>lover, and would constantly remind him
               <lb/>of her former imprudence. An addi­
               <lb/>tional inducement for placing herself un­
               <lb/>der the same roof with the <persName>count de <placeName>Fon­
               <lb/>tenai</placeName></persName>, was his solemn promise never to
               <lb/>forsake her; and if she proved faithful,
               <lb/>and her conduct was such as he wished,
               <lb/>he would then marry her. <persName>Jane</persName> con­
               <lb/>cluded her letter with requesting <persName>Rose</persName> to
               <lb/>visit her privately, as she was anxious
               <lb/>to see her, and would never forget her
               <lb/>sisterly kindness, which she remembered
               <lb/>with affection, and desired her acceptance
               <lb/>of a ten-pound note which she enclosed.
            </p>
            <p>Before <persName>Rose</persName> finished perusing this let­
               <lb/>ter, she was overcome with a sensation
               <lb/>that almost choked her. Her sister that
               <lb/>she tenderly loved, and for whom she had
               <lb/>suffered so much, was now lost and aban­
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">doned,</mw>
            <pb/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="H9r"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">161</mw>
               <lb/>doned, she feared for ever. It wounded
               <lb/>her to the soul that <persName>Jane</persName> should imagine
               <lb/>for a moment that she would receive the
               <lb/>money she had by guilt and indiscretion
               <lb/>obtained. The temptation was strong, as
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> was then distressed for money, hav­
               <lb/>ing been at great expence on account of
               <lb/>her dear <persName>Felix</persName>, from whom she concealed
               <lb/>the reduced state of their finances, as she
               <lb/>hoped and expected to receive a remit­
               <lb/>tance from her father: yet she remained
               <lb/>firm in her resolution of restoring the ten
               <lb/>pounds to her sister.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> now touched the bell for <persName>Kamira</persName>,
               <lb/>and when the faithful creature entered,
               <lb/>threw her arms around her neck, and, al­
               <lb/>most in a state of distraction, wept aloud
               <lb/>on her bosom. Though the <name>Indian</name> was
               <lb/>ignorant why her tears flowed, she min­
               <lb/>gled hers with the drops of sensibility that
               <lb/>bathed the pallid face of her beloved <persName>Miss
               <lb/>Rose</persName>.
            </p>
            <p>When the heart-rending emotion that
               <lb/>agitated <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> had a little sub­
            <mw type="catch" rend="align(right)break(yes)">sided,</mw>

               <lb/>sided, she confided to <persName>Kamira</persName> the anguish
               <lb/>that <persName>Jane</persName> had planted in her bosom.—
               <lb/><said>Now,</said> she exclaimed, <said>all hope of reclaim­
               <lb/>ing her is destroyed! To relapse a second
               <lb/>time from virtue banishes every idea and
               <lb/>expectation of repentance and reforma­
               <lb/>tion.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> was deeply affected with poig­
               <lb/>nant grief at this recital. Morality and
               <lb/>religion had been forcibly and impressively
               <lb/>inculcated on her flexible mind by <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Douglas</persName>, which was strengthened by ob­
               <lb/>serving the amiable and excellent conduct
               <lb/>of the gentle <persName>Rose</persName>. The <name>Indian</name> was like­
               <lb/>wise naturally well inclined and good,
               <lb/>and one of the most virtuous characters
               <lb/>that ever breathed. Her virtue had fre­
               <lb/>quently been attacked by vicious charac­
               <lb/>ters, but <persName>Kamira</persName> always continued steadily
               <lb/>chaste and correct. <persName>Losquillo</persName>, her loved
               <lb/>husband, was the only man for whom she
               <lb/>had felt attachment, and, torn from him
               <lb/>by the treachery of the perfidious <persName>Ro­
               <lb/>becka</persName>, to his memory her constant heart

            <pb/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="H10r"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">163</mw>
               <lb/>remained ever faithful. Though many
               <lb/>years had revolved since the young ladies
               <lb/>discovered her in the wood, she looked
               <lb/>nearly as young as she then appeared.
               <lb/>Her brown complexion did not fade and
               <lb/>lose its lustre, as a fairer skin frequently
               <lb/>does; and her dark, expressive, open coun­
               <lb/>tenance, was universally admired.
            </p>
            <p>Had <persName>Rose</persName> nourished the least expecta­
               <lb/>tion of her sister's return to rectitude, she
               <lb/>would have been less miserable; but that
               <lb/>fond hope it was impossible to cherish,
               <lb/>since she had coldly and deliberately re­
               <lb/>signed herself to the count, whose trea­
               <lb/>chery in persuading her to act thus, after
               <lb/>insinuating his designs were honourable,
               <lb/>inspired her with resentment and detesta­
               <lb/>tion. The feeble and improbable prospect
               <lb/>he had held out to her of marriage at a fu­
               <lb/>ture period, after the sufferings she had
               <lb/>endured from the duplicity of <persName>Guilford</persName>,
               <lb/>made her fear she was indeed incorrigible.
               <lb/>For her elopement with the colonel a
               <lb/>reasonable excuse might be made, as she

               <lb/>was cruelly deceived by a fictitious mar­
               <lb/>riage, and a first error should always be
               <lb/>pardoned; contrition and improvement

               <lb/>write my sister first, and enclose the note
               <lb/>she sent.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>No, no,</said> said <persName>Kamira</persName>, whose anxiety

               <lb/>for her health made her angry; <said>me scold
               <lb/>you you no eat breakfast, or try to eat a lit­
               <lb/>tle; first you eat something, then write;
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> take letter for you after.</said>
            </p>
            <p>Such tender affection, such anxious care,
               <lb/>were irresistible; and leaning on her faith­
               <lb/>ful <name>Indian's</name> arm, <persName>Rose</persName> went to the draw­
               <lb/>ing-room, where breakfast had been already
               <lb/>prepared for her and <persName>Jane</persName>. <persName>Rose</persName> drank
               <lb/>some tea, but the bread and butter re­
               <lb/>mained untouched, though she endea­
               <lb/>voured to swallow a few mouthfuls, that
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> might not be grieved. The <name>In­
               <lb/>dian</name> endeavoured to tempt her appetite
               <lb/>by every method her affectionate heart
               <lb/>could devise, but in vain, and was quite
               <lb/>melancholy at her want of success.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> observed that <persName>Miss Jane</persName> must
               <lb/>have stolen softly out at the street-door,
               <lb/>before any one was up in the house, very
               <lb/>early, as her departure was unperceived by
               <lb/>any person. All her clothes, except those
               <lb/>she wore, were left behind, as she men­
               <lb/>tioned in the postscript of her letter that

               <lb/>they were useless to her, <persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>
               <lb/>having purchased numerous articles of
               <lb/>dress in the newest and most elegant style;
               <lb/>and to his love she was likewise indebted
               <lb/>for very superb jewels.
            </p>
            <p>The <name>Indian</name> removed the tea-equipage,
               <lb/>and left <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> to compose her let­
               <lb/>ter. The paper was blotted with her tears
               <lb/>in many places, and she commenced her
               <lb/>writing by saying, that since <persName>Jane</persName> had
               <lb/>assured her she was fixed in her resolu­
               <lb/>tion never to return home, and was quite
               <lb/>determined, it was in vain to persuade her;
               <lb/>yet she regretted that the dread of pecu­
               <lb/>niary difficulties influenced her to em­
               <lb/>brace a dishonourable life, more particu­
               <lb/>larly as she had ever shewn her an exam­
               <lb/>ple of fortitude. <persName>Rose</persName> entreated her to
               <lb/>recollect that she always dreaded a life of
               <lb/>vice, and had heard her frequently assert
               <lb/>that she would endure mortification, inso­
               <lb/>lence, and distress, rather than act wrong.
               <lb/>She had hitherto, in every sorrow, confided
               <lb/>in the goodness of Providence, that never

               <lb/>forsakes those who trust firmly in its di­
               <lb/>vine superintendence. <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> add­
               <lb/>ed, that it was with pain and reluctance
               <lb/>she was obliged to mention that, since she
               <lb/>had chosen to live in a manner so opposite
               <lb/>to her principles, she must decline, much
               <lb/>as she loved her, and ever should, any com­
               <lb/>munication, unless she was deserted by the
               <lb/>perfidious count. In that case, which she
               <lb/>was apprehensive might occur, she should
               <lb/>ever find her affectionate and friendly,
               <lb/>though it was her duty to shun her while she
               <lb/>lived in splendid guilt. <persName>Rose</persName> thanked her
               <lb/>for her feeling and kindness in sending the
               <lb/>ten-pound note, but begged to return it,
               <lb/>as she could not, however embarrassed,
               <lb/>accept a gift that would appear as if she
               <lb/>wished to profit by her indiscretion.
            </p>
            <p>When <persName>Rose</persName> had sealed this letter, she
               <lb/>directed it, with a trembling hand, to <persName>ma­
               <lb/>dame de <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>, by which name <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>had told her she was now distinguished.
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> was sent with it to <placeName>Somerset-street</placeName>,
               <lb/><placeName>Portman-square</placeName>, <persName>Jane</persName> having informed

               <lb/>her that the count had taken a fur­
               <lb/>nished house there for her as his wife.
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> told her not to wait for an answer,
               <lb/>but merely give it in; and the <name>Indian</name> and
               <lb/>herself both agreed to tell whoever in­
               <lb/>quired after her sister, that she was absent
               <lb/>on a visit, and if <persName>Mrs. Linn</persName> asked where
               <lb/>she was, to repeat the same story, as she
               <lb/>had not perceived her departure. As <placeName>So­
               <lb/>merset-street</placeName> was not far from her resi­
               <lb/>dence, <persName>Kamira</persName> soon returned, looking very
               <lb/>dull, and said, in a melancholy tone—<said>It
               <lb/>be a fine grand house where <persName>Miss Jane</persName>
               <lb/>live; fat footman, with great paunch, open

            </p>

            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> blushed at her want of firmness,
               <lb/>when she recollected the afflictions of the
               <lb/>amiable <name>Esquimaux</name>—torn from her coun­
               <lb/>try, her husband, relations, and wounded
               <lb/>by a sanguinary rival. In so many pain­
               <lb/>ful scenes and trials, her fidelity was un­
               <lb/>shaken; and <persName>Rose</persName> suppressed the painful
               <lb/>emotions that agitated her, to avoid giv­
               <lb/>ing uneasiness to the attached <name>Indian</name>.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Eustace</persName> came, as he usually did almost
               <lb/>every day, and perceiving <persName>Rose</persName> looked
               <lb/>more pallid than she was in general, advised
               <lb/>her to take a walk in the Park, as <placeName>London</placeName>
               <lb/>had robbed her cheek of its rural bloom.
               <lb/>He inquired after <persName>Miss Jane Douglas</persName>, and
               <lb/>learnt she had quitted home on a visit.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Kamira</persName>, who was present when he ask­
               <lb/>ed <persName>Rose</persName> to walk, exclaimed—<said>You go,

               <lb/>you look ill then. Walk good for you—

            <p><persName>Eustace</persName> laughed at the <name>Indian's</name> speech;
               <lb/>he was accustomed to hear her give ad­
               <lb/>vice; and was acquainted with her his­
               <lb/>tory from <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>, who had describ­
               <lb/>ed the ardour of her attachment to the
               <lb/>whole family, though <persName>Rose</persName> was dearest to
               <lb/>her faithful bosom.
            </p>
            <p>As <persName>Eustace</persName> and <persName>Rose</persName> proceeded to
               <lb/><placeName>Hyde-park</placeName>, he unexpectedly introduced
               <lb/>the subject of his affection for her, which
               <lb/>she endeavoured to evade. But fruitless
               <lb/>were her attempts to divert his attention
               <lb/>from this kind of conversation; and most
               <lb/>disagreeably was she surprised at his pre­
               <lb/>suming to hint that he wished her to be
               <lb/>his, on terms that she disdained from a
               <lb/>man of the highest rank, and particularly
               <lb/>from him. He mentioned that he could
               <lb/>not afford to marry, being unable to sup­
               <lb/>port a wife in the style he must, if mar­
               <lb/>ried, from his superior and respectable
               <lb/>connexions.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> would not interrupt him, pur­

               <lb/>tion would lead him to unveil his moral
               <lb/>depravity, so contrary to virtuous princi­
               <lb/>ples.
            </p>
            <p><said>Besides,</said> continued <persName>Eustace</persName>, (who,
               <lb/>from her silence, though she approved
               <lb/>what he had advanced), <said>I could not af­
               <lb/>ford to let you dress so handsomely as
               <lb/>you do now, like a lady of fortune and
               <lb/>fashion; it would make me wretched to
               <lb/>see you, as my wife, less elegantly attired.
               <lb/>But this promise I will solemnly make
               <lb/>you, if you comply with my proposals,
               <lb/>which is, that I will never marry an­
               <lb/>other, and when I feel myself at the point
               <lb/>of death, will then give you my hand,
               <lb/>that, as my wife, you may take possession
               <lb/>of my property.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> felt quite indignant, and the ut­
               <lb/>most contempt for his wickedness and pre­
               <lb/>sumption, in supposing he could persuade
               <lb/>her to be indiscreet. This pernicious dis­
               <lb/>closure of his vicious designs did not in­
               <lb/>deed wound her feelings as <persName>Courtenay's</persName>

               <lb/>ferent to her, and her heart wholly engaged
               <lb/>to another. She had been pleased with
               <lb/>the gratitude he pretended to feel, and
               <lb/>condescended, on that account, to consi­
               <lb/>der him as a friend; but his worthless be­
               <lb/>haviour, in daring to insult her with this
               <lb/>gross declaration, forfeited completely all
               <lb/>claim to her esteem, as she was convinced
               <lb/>he had hoped to succeed from having been
               <lb/>informed by her of the cloud that obscured
               <lb/>the prosperity of her family at present.
               <lb/>It was probable, she imagined, that he had
               <lb/>also heard of her pecuniary difficulties and
               <lb/>severe misfortunes, and, like an artful law­
               <lb/>yer, wished to take advantage of her dis­
               <lb/>tress. To mortify him, therefore, she re­
               <lb/>solved to conceal her engagement with the
               <lb/>noble and excellent <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>, as his
               <lb/>vanity might attribute her refusal to being
               <lb/>engaged, and conclude she would have
               <lb/>weakly yielded to his persuasions, had she
               <lb/>not been contracted to <persName>Delavalle</persName>. Her
               <lb/>heart, her every thought, was truly devoted
               <lb/>to her brave lover, who would have flown to

               <lb/>her in the dark hour of adversity, and con­
               <lb/>soled her with his pure, his ardent affection.
            </p>
            <p>As <persName>Rose</persName> reflected on what <persName>Eustace</persName> had
               <lb/>been saying, she could scarcely check her­
               <lb/>self from exclaiming—<said>What a world is
               <lb/>this, when such characters as yours, who
               <lb/>ought to be grateful to me, endeavour,
               <lb/>under the mask of friendship and regard,
               <lb/>to effect my destruction!</said>
            </p>
            <p>While these thoughts passed in her
               <lb/>mind, <persName>Eustace</persName> interpreted her silence as a
               <lb/>propitious omen, and anxiously awaited
               <lb/>her answer. He was, consequently, sur­
               <lb/>prised and chagrined, when <persName>Rose</persName> calmly
               <lb/>reprobated his infamous offer, tending evi­
               <lb/>dently to ruin her peace of mind. No
               <lb/>worldly consideration, she said, could
               <lb/>tempt her to act incorrectly; and she
               <lb/>hoped, for his own sake, that he would,

               <lb/>ing severely insulted a gentleman's daugh­

            <p><said>If you had but a small fortune,</said> re­
               <lb/>plied <persName>Eustace</persName>, whose mortification was in­
               <lb/>expressible, <said>I would, with delight, risk
               <lb/>marrying you; but with my narrow in­
               <lb/>come it is impossible for me to support a
               <lb/>wife. Oh, if you had but a fortune!</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Then you do not think me a fortune
               <lb/>of myself?</said> replied <persName>Rose</persName>, laughing: <said>very
               <lb/>ungallant truly! The wisest plan, there­
               <lb/>fore, for you, is to quite give me up, which
               <lb/>will be no difficult task, if I judge right;
               <lb/>for, be assured, if you were a king, I would
               <lb/>reject your dishonourable proposals with
               <lb/>the contempt I now do your present offer.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Eustace</persName> was inwardly almost enraged to
               <lb/>distraction (though he stifled it) at the cheer­
               <lb/>ful indifference she displayed, as it prov­
               <lb/>ed her contemptible opinion of him. He
               <lb/>became sullen and out of humour, which
               <lb/>diverted <persName>Rose</persName>, and banished the recollec­
               <lb/>tion of her sorrows. He told her how

            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">176</mw>
               <lb/>ill and ugly she looked, and was at last
               <lb/>so exceedingly impertinent, that she was
               <lb/>obliged to say, that although she had
               <lb/>wished to consider him as a friend, it was
               <lb/>beneath her to endure a deficiency of po­
               <lb/>liteness, and rudeness she did not deserve.
               <lb/>Yet, in remembrance of their long acquaint­
               <lb/>ance, and his professions of friendship and
               <lb/>service, she would excuse his ill-humour,
               <lb/>if he promised in future to conduct himself
               <lb/>like a gentleman; otherwise she must de­
               <lb/>cline his visits.
            </p>
            <p>To these observations he answered not,
               <lb/>but presented an excellent picture of spleen
               <lb/>and sullenness, and coldly wishing her
               <lb/>good-morning at her own door, he walked
               <lb/>hastily off, secretly provoked at the spirit
               <lb/>she had displayed, and that he had expos­
               <lb/>ed himself without meeting any success.
            </p>
            <p>In the drawing-room was her worthy
               <lb/>old <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> friend, <persName>Jerry Wizzle</persName>, waiting
               <lb/>for her return. He had arrived in town
               <lb/>from <placeName>Devonshire</placeName> on business for his father
               <lb/>three days before; and <persName>Rose</persName> felt truly glad

               <lb/>to see him. She was greatly amused by
               <lb/>his relating to her all the country news.
            </p>
            <p>After detailing every thing interesting,
               <lb/>he suddenly asked her if she had seen <persName>Mr.
               <lb/>Eustace</persName>?
            </p>
            <p><said>I have this instant parted from him at
               <lb/>the street-door,</said> replied <persName>Rose</persName>, <said>having
               <lb/>been escorted by him to the Park and back
               <lb/>again.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>It is a pity you are already engaged,</said>
               <lb/>said <persName>Mr. Jerry</persName>, with a smile, <said>though
               <lb/>certainly your choice is very superior.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>For what reason do you say you re­
               <lb/>gret that I am engaged?</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Because another wealthy offer would
               <lb/>be at your ladyship's command. Assured­
               <lb/>ly you have heard that <persName>Mr. Eustace</persName> is
               <lb/>come into possession, since his return to
               <lb/><placeName>England</placeName>, of a very handsome fortune?</said>
            </p>
            <p>The astonishment of <persName>Rose</persName> for some mi­
               <lb/>nutes was indescribable. She was silent a
               <lb/>short time, and then exclaimed—<said>I am
               <lb/>doomed almost daily, <persName>Mr. Jerry</persName>, to receive
               <lb/>some fresh instance of the deceit and false­

               <lb/>hood of mankind. The first intelligence
               <lb/>I gained from <persName>Eustace</persName> on his arrival, quite
               <lb/>unasked, was the death of his relation,
               <lb/>who had not left him a single shilling. He
               <lb/>alleged his poverty as an excuse for not
               <lb/>offering me his hand, being disappointed
               <lb/>in his relative's having neglected to be­
               <lb/>queath him a legacy. How mean is de­
               <lb/>ception! and how contemptible and use­
               <lb/>less it is to speak untruths, when they are
               <lb/>always discovered at last by some accident
               <lb/>or other!</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>His character,</said> observed <persName>Jerry Wizzle</persName>,
               <lb/><said>has not been improved by adversity,
               <lb/>which I have learnt lately he has severely
               <lb/>experienced, and that he sought and ob­
               <lb/>tained refuge at <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, where your fa­
               <lb/>ther's roof sheltered him, and he found a
               <lb/>home and consolation in your kindness that
               <lb/>he could not meet with anywhere else. If
               <lb/>this is true, he is a consummate ungrateful
               <lb/>villain, for in my opinion, ingratitude de­
               <lb/>serves death: it is the blackest of all crimes.</said>

            <p><persName>Mr. Jerry</persName> concluded with requesting he
               <lb/>might have the pleasure of attending her
               <lb/>next morning to a fashionable exhibition.
               <lb/>He seemed to attach great value to her
               <lb/>granting this favour; and she could not
               <lb/>refuse to confer this trifling happiness on
               <lb/>her worthy old friend.
            </p>
            <p>After returning from the exhibition the
               <lb/>following morning with <persName>Jerry</persName>, she found
               <lb/>an unexpected letter from <persName>colonel Guil­
               <lb/>ford</persName> lying on the table. <persName>Mr. Jerry</persName> said he
               <lb/>would leave her now to peruse her letter,
               <lb/>and went away much pleased with having
               <lb/>publicly attended his lovely favourite,

               <lb/>where he perceived with exultation how
               <lb/>much she was admired.
            </p>
            <p>When he was gone, <persName>Rose</persName> found, on
               <lb/>reading <persName>colonel Guilford's</persName> letter, that her
               <lb/>sister had written to him, desiring he
               <lb/>would consign her dear <persName>Caroline</persName> to the
               <lb/>care of a trusty person she intended to
               <lb/>send for the child. The colonel added, that
               <lb/>since <persName>Jane</persName> had not explained for what rea­
               <lb/>son she wished the infant to be sent, he
               <lb/>should not give up his daughter (whom
               <lb/>he tenderly loved) till he had heard from
               <lb/><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> likewise. Though <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>was fondly endeared to him, he continued,
               <lb/>yet he doubted her prudence and judg­
               <lb/>ment, which did not equal her sister's;
               <lb/>and being desired to direct his answer to
               <lb/>another street made him very suspicious.
               <lb/>He was apprehensive, from these observa­
               <lb/>tions, that all was not right, which made
               <lb/>him uneasy, as he was solicitous that
               <lb/><persName>Jane's</persName> conduct should be correct; and his
               <lb/>first wish was to have it in his power to

               <lb/>repair the injury he had committed from
               <lb/>excess of fondness. The colonel ended
               <lb/>with saying, that if he did not shortly re­
               <lb/>ceive a satisfactory letter from <persName>Rose</persName>, he
               <lb/>should come up to town, and seek an ex­
               <lb/>planation.
            </p>
            <p>To this letter it was a most difficult and
               <lb/>painful task to return an answer. <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>must either expose her sister, or tell such
               <lb/>falsehoods to excuse her as would be easily
               <lb/>detected, and make her word doubted in
               <lb/>future, which was inconsistent with her
               <lb/>character, that disdained a violation of
               <lb/>truth. She resolved, therefore, to wait
               <lb/>some days before she answered it, and con­
               <lb/>sult <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName>, whose advice she highly
               <lb/>respected. This lady was the only person
               <lb/>of their acquaintance to whom <persName>Jane's</persName> for­
               <lb/>mer imprudence was confided, and to her
               <lb/>she could write on the subject of the mis­
               <lb/>fortune that had since occurred; it would
               <lb/>not be an additional exposure, as if detail­
               <lb/>ed to any other person less interested.
               <lb/>The idea of giving pain to her mother (al­

               <lb/>ready too deeply afflicted), was insupport­
               <lb/>able, and <persName>Rose</persName> determined to conceal the
               <lb/>cruel event till the last moment it could be
               <lb/>kept secret, which was quite soon enough
               <lb/>to divulge an afflictive disclosure. Good
               <lb/>news she was ever eager to communicate,
               <lb/>but disagreeable intelligence she was un­
               <lb/>willing to reveal before it was absolutely
               <lb/>necessary. After much reflection, she in­
               <lb/>tended in a day or two to write <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Fane</persName>, and ask her opinion how she should
               <lb/>act for the best.
            </p>
            <p>After <persName>Rose</persName> had formed this resolution,
               <lb/>her uneasiness was, in a trifling degree, re­
               <lb/>moved; and at this moment, when her
               <lb/>mind was more calm and resigned, a loud
               <lb/>thundering at the door announced a visitor
               <lb/>of importance. <persName>Rose</persName> looked from the
               <lb/>window, and beheld with satisfaction <persName>lady
               <lb/>Elinor's</persName> carriage. The sight of her was a
               <lb/>healing balm, and her conversation, re­
               <lb/>plete with sense and sweetness, was a real
               <lb/>consolation, and banished the recollection
               <lb/>of sorrow.

               <lb/>to listen to the praises of the brother she

               <lb/>ing to her affectionate heart. <persName>Lady Eli­
               <lb/>nor's</persName> approbation of <persName>Felix</persName> suggested the
               <lb/>thought, that probably she secretly ad­
               <lb/>mired him; and it would have been her
               <lb/>highest ambition to see him united to
               <lb/>so charming and excellent a character.
               <lb/>But her brother's want of fortune, even if

               <lb/>assiduous and attentive, while she was ap­

               <lb/>Your sister looked more dazzlingly lovely
               <lb/>than I had ever seen her; she was cer­

               <lb/>could see her countenance change, which

               <lb/>sweetness blunted the keen edge of her
               <lb/>misfortunes. <persName>Lady Elinor</persName> began convers­
               <lb/>ing on other subjects, to divert her atten­
               <lb/>tion from one most distressing. She men­
               <lb/>tioned that she had many kind messages
               <lb/>and the affectionate remembrance to deliver
               <lb/>to her from poor <persName>Louise de <placeName>Rimont</placeName></persName>, who
               <lb/>was in a very indifferent state of health.
               <lb/><persName>Louise</persName> regretted exceedingly not having
               <lb/>seen <persName>Rose</persName>, who had not called for a long
               <lb/>time at <persName>lady Morrington's</persName>, as her freezing
               <lb/>coldness led her to imagine her visits were
               <lb/>not acceptable; had her ladyship indeed
               <lb/>wished to see her, she would have declined
               <lb/>going, after her mean deceit. <persName>Lady Mor­

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> feelingly lamented the lengthened
               <lb/>illness of <persName>Louise</persName>, and observed, that had she
               <lb/>known she continued so ill, she would have
               <lb/>encountered, to see her, the proud looks
               <lb/>and sarcasms of her ladyship.

            <p><said>I am very glad, however, that your

               <lb/>of yours; and you would not have liked
               <lb/>to meet him there. The world slanders
               <lb/>her amazingly for her extreme intimacy
               <lb/>with this profligate man—unjustly, I hope,
               <lb/>for the sake of her daughters and my lord,
               <lb/>who is good-natured and unsuspicious

               <lb/>self-approbation, that she had been a good
               <lb/>sister, and exerted herself to reform <persName>Jane</persName>,
               <lb/>and disguise her errors from being pub­
               <lb/>lished. Since she had nobly performed
               <lb/>her duty, she desired her to recollect also
               <lb/>she had parents, who would be deprived of
               <lb/>the comfort of an amiable daughter's af­
               <lb/>fection, if she undermined her constitu­

               <lb/>keenly she mourned the disgrace <persName>Jane</persName> had
               <lb/>incurred by this additional act of impru­
               <lb/>dence. The anger of the general, from
               <lb/>whom this elopement could not be for
               <lb/>ever kept secret, and the anguish of her
               <lb/>mother, all forcibly occurred to her mind,
               <lb/>and made her shudder for the consequence.
               <lb/>The delicate sense <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> had of fe­

            <p><persName>Mr. Murray</persName> looked more benign than

               <lb/>benevolence of his nature irradiated his
               <lb/>countenance. <persName>Rose</persName> admired his ruddy
               <lb/>clear skin, that had the freshness of the
               <lb/>cheek of youth; and his shining silver
               <lb/>locks, waving on his fine open forehead,
               <lb/>where time had strewed but a few wrinkles,

               <lb/>it would prevent <persName>Rose</persName> from brooding
               <lb/>alone over her calamities, as her sister's de­

               <lb/>I never listen to tales of malevolence and
               <lb/>slander, proceeding often from malice and
               <lb/>envy; but I witnessed, with <persName>lady Elinor</persName>,
               <lb/>the scene it hurt her feelings to describe.
               <lb/>Anxiety for your reputation, which I wish
               <lb/>to be as spotless as your mind, made me
               <lb/>desirous to develop the truth. Give me
               <lb/>your sister's direction, and I will endea­
               <lb/>vour to alleviate your grief respecting her,
               <lb/>by exciting, if possible, contrition; and
               <lb/>hope, by my friendly admonitions, to re­

               <lb/>to come in the carriage, and convey back

               <lb/>injurious to her friend to entertain the idea
               <lb/>of a refusal. Accordingly, she instantly
               <lb/>dispatched a note to her by the twopenny-
               <lb/>post, requesting her immediate assistance,
               <lb/>observing, that as <persName>lady Beaufort</persName> mention­
               <lb/>ed, when they last met, that she was pleas­
               <lb/>ed she considered her as one of her friends,
               <lb/>she had now used the privilege of friend­

            <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> was perfectly tranquil re­

               <lb/>to doubt her willingness to assist her, since
               <lb/>she had it in her power to grant this favour.
               <lb/>Early the next morning, to her extreme
               <lb/>surprise, at an hour so unusual, a loud
               <lb/>knock at the door made her expect to see
               <lb/>one of her acquaintance. The person, of

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> could scarcely command her coun­

               <lb/>Her assumed starched appearance, which
               <lb/>she intended for impressive dignity, to awe
               <lb/>and terrify <persName>Rose</persName>, had so striking an effect
               <lb/>on her risible muscles, that she could not
               <lb/>suppress a smile when she replied—<said>I

               <lb/>and duplicity. Tell her that a title cannot
               <lb/>ennoble a low mind, and only makes her
               <lb/>insincerity, malignity, and grossness, more
               <lb/>glaring. I suppose she thought her ma­
               <lb/>levolence would strike deeper by making
               <lb/>you her messenger, who, she has often
               <lb/>mentioned, was quite my enemy. Paltry,
               <lb/>mean creature! how much I compassion­
               <lb/>ate her little mind, and deplore, for her

            <p>Astonished at the spirit <persName>Rose</persName> displayed,
               <lb/>anger flashed from the large eyes of the
               <lb/>disappointed <persName>lady Morrington</persName>, who seem­
               <lb/>ed inclined to depart from the precise air
               <lb/>she had affected. However, on second
               <lb/>thoughts, she gulped down her mortifica­
               <lb/>tion of rage, and rose from her seat, which
               <lb/>she had taken while <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> was
               <lb/>speaking. <persName>Rose</persName> flew to the bell, and very
               <lb/>ceremoniously attended her ladyship to
               <lb/>the door of the drawing-room. Unable to
               <lb/>articulate from vexation, at the ease and
               <lb/>indifference with which she had received
               <lb/>her former friend's vulgar insult, she slight­
               <lb/>ly bowed her head, and retired, eager to
               <lb/>acquaint <persName>lady Beaufort</persName> with the contempt
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> had evinced at her insulting low at­

               <lb/>by her insulting message would have made
               <lb/>her very ill. It did not occur to her lady­

               <lb/>becomes contemptible by their degrading
               <lb/>conduct, they are too much despised for

            <p>To supply the money deficient to pay

               <lb/>several other trinkets, to a jeweller's, to

               <lb/>departure. <persName>Rose</persName> promised to see them
               <lb/>again, and had the satisfaction of finding
               <lb/>herself most happily situated with <persName>lady
               <lb/>Elinor</persName>.
            </p>
            <p>The <persName>earl of <placeName>Arlberry</placeName></persName> had superior man­
               <lb/>ners, but was one of those characters that
               <lb/>have no striking <mcr rend="slant(italic)">trait</mcr> to distinguish them,
               <lb/>and was not gifted with much talent for
               <lb/>conversation. His passions were calmly re­
               <lb/>gulated, and neither joy or sorrow seemed
               <lb/>to make any impression on the equanimity
               <lb/>that governed them. If he was displeased,
               <lb/>he was too polite to express his resentment
               <lb/>warmly, and was one of those beings who
               <lb/>walk quietly through life, without pain, but
               <lb/>with very little pleasure. His daughter
               <lb/>was the object of his strongest attachment,
               <lb/>and to her he was indulgent.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Lord Arlberry</persName> had a place at court, which
               <lb/>chiefly engaged his time, and <persName>Rose</persName> was
               <lb/>happy at seeing his lordship rarely, as his

               <lb/>frigid, though strictly polite manners, and
               <lb/>ceremonious address, were so opposite to
               <lb/><persName>lady Elinor's</persName>, who was equally correct in
               <lb/>politeness, without his chilling reserve.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> had been a week with her
               <lb/>friend—a week that would have passed in
               <lb/>genuine happiness, had it not been clouded
               <lb/>by the recollection of <persName>sir Eglamour's</persName> absence
               <lb/>and distance from her, united with the pain­
               <lb/>ful remembrance of her sister's situation.
            </p>
            <p>At this period a letter arrived from <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Fane</persName>, entreating <persName>Rose</persName> to set off directly
               <lb/>for her residence, where she should find a
               <lb/>home for ever, if she approved it, and an­
               <lb/>other parent, as she tenderly loved her as
               <lb/>her own daughter. <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> added, that
               <lb/>she could not endure the prospect of her
               <lb/>remaining alone in <placeName>London</placeName>, a place fraught
               <lb/>with dangers for young people, as she was
               <lb/>of opinion <persName>Jane</persName> might have escaped the
               <lb/>contagion of error, had she been elsewhere.
               <lb/>This considerate lady assured her that she
               <lb/>intended waiting on <persName>colonel Guilford</persName>, and
               <lb/>disclosing to him candidly the events that

               <lb/>had lately passed, to spare <persName>Rose</persName> the distress­
               <lb/>ing avowal; and concluded with observing,
               <lb/>that <persName>Caroline</persName> was grown a lovely child, and
               <lb/>resembled her aunt more than her mother.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> was musing on the contents of this
               <lb/>friendly letter, when a note was delivered
               <lb/>to her, with the address scarcely legible.
               <lb/>On opening it, she perceived some lines
               <lb/>scrawled apparently by a very inferior hand.
               <lb/>At the first perusal they were unintelligi­
               <lb/>ble from incorrect spelling, but on closely
               <lb/>examining the writing, she deciphered,
               <lb/>with unutterable sensations of horror, that
               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName> was dying, and that if she wished to
               <lb/>see her any more alive, she must hasten in­
               <lb/>stantly to <placeName>Somerset-street</placeName>.
            </p>
            <p>To describe the agony of <persName>Rose</persName> is impos­
               <lb/>sible; yet she checked her anguish, as it
               <lb/>was indispensably requisite she should act,
               <lb/>and, perhaps, by prompt exertion might
               <lb/>save her. With a countenance that por­
               <lb/>trayed her mental sufferings, she threw on
               <lb/>hastily a bonnet and shawl, and rushed into

               <lb/>her friend's room. Without speaking, she
               <lb/>put the note into her hand.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Lady Elinor</persName> read it, and then gazed at
               <lb/>her face, which betrayed internal suppress­
               <lb/>ed woe surpassing description. Acutely
               <lb/>did she participate in the repeated sorrows
               <lb/>destined to invade her tranquillity.—<said>I
               <lb/>see your fortitude,</said> she exclaimed, <said>and
               <lb/>admire it. Persevere! We will have a
               <lb/>hackney-coach, and I will go with you to
               <lb/>the door of that hateful house.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> pressed her hand with gratitude,
               <lb/>but could not speak.
            </p>
            <p>The coach was procured, and, overcome
               <lb/>with dejection and dread, <persName>Rose</persName> got into the
               <lb/>vehicle, followed by her true friend. They
               <lb/>both preserved a mournful silence till it
               <lb/>stopped at the detestable house where <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>had fatally taken up her abode. <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>breathed with difficulty—a faintness came
               <lb/>over her, and, in a voice scarcely audible,
               <lb/>she requested <persName>lady Elinor</persName>, on her return
               <lb/>home, to send <persName>Kamira</persName> to her.

            <p>A footman now opened the door, whose
               <lb/>countenance bore witness that some dread­
               <lb/>ful scene had been acted here. Faltering
               <lb/>as she spoke, <persName>Rose</persName> asked for <persName>madame de

            <p><said>Will you be so good as to walk this
               <lb/>way,</said> replied the man, and ascending the
               <lb/>stairs, conducted <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> to a draw­
               <lb/>ing-room. A medical gentleman and a fe­
               <lb/>male attendant stood near a large couch,
               <lb/>where was extended the nearly-expiring
               <lb/>form of <persName>Jane</persName>. The white robe that enve­
               <lb/>loped her slender figure was spotted in
               <lb/>several places with blood, that flowed from
               <lb/>a mortal wound that had pierced her side.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> advanced to the couch where her
               <lb/>unhappy sister reclined, with approaching
               <lb/>death imprinted on every line of her once
               <lb/>animated face. A faint smile lightly gleam­
               <lb/>ed over it at the sight of <persName>Rose</persName>.—<said>Dear

               <lb/>terday—I was married—to the count—by
               <lb/>a <rs type="properAdjective">Catholic</rs> priest. I was wretched—at not
               <lb/>being—his wife. His love was not weak­
               <lb/>ened; to make me happy—he consented
               <lb/>—we were united—and he lamented—that
               <lb/>distrust—in which he was—educated—
               <lb/>that made him unjust—till then. He
               <lb/>doubted my affection—and feared I might
               <lb/>—abandon him—and caused—his reluc­
               <lb/>tance—to marry me. Fatal suspicion! it
               <lb/>has ruined me―</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane's</persName> breath grew now so short, that she
               <lb/>was obliged to rest some minutes before she
               <lb/>could proceed; yet she seemed very anx­
               <lb/>ious to continue speaking. The doctor ad­
               <lb/>ministered a cordial to her, and she revived
               <lb/>sufficiently to again address <persName>Rose</persName>.

               <lb/>became more difficult than ever, and <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>raised up her hand to relieve her. She took
               <lb/>her cold clammy hand in hers, which <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>feebly pressed, and breathed her last sigh
               <lb/>in the arms of her affectionate sister, her
               <lb/>dying glance resting on her countenance,
               <lb/>nearly as white as her own, shaded with the
               <lb/>pale livery of death.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> had expired without a groan, and
               <lb/>looked so serene and pleasing, that <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>did not imagine that the last closing scene
               <lb/>of life was over. When fatally convinced
               <lb/>that her spirit had fled from its earthly te­
               <lb/>nement, and that the fortitude she had as­
               <lb/>sumed could no longer benefit her beloved
               <lb/>sister, insensible, alas! to kindness or cru­
               <lb/>elty, <persName>Rose</persName> yielded to deep, heart-rending
               <lb/>sorrow.
            </p>
            <p>With frantic grief she uttered the most
               <lb/>heart-piercing shrieks, for having suppress­
               <lb/>ed the anguish that overwhelmed her, to
               <lb/>avoid afflicting <persName>Jane</persName>, it had a more violent
               <lb/>effect when she could indulge it. The

               <lb/>whose sake she had encountered the great­

               <lb/>return, in the most shocking and affecting
               <lb/>manner. The only shadow of comfort that
               <lb/>remained was her having been united to
               <lb/>the <persName>count de <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>, and it was now in
               <lb/><persName>Rose's</persName> power to conceal from her parents
               <lb/>the erroneous part of her sister's conduct.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> and the benevolent <persName>Mr. Murray</persName>
               <lb/>arrived happily at the critical moment
               <lb/>when <persName>Miss Douglas's</persName> agonizing sorrow was
               <lb/>at the greatest height. Though nearly de­
               <lb/>lirious with the frenzied grief that threat­
               <lb/>ened to shake her reason, <persName>Mr. Murray</persName> in­
               <lb/>sisted on her being removed to the <persName>earl of
               <lb/><placeName>Arlberry</placeName>'s</persName> residence.
            </p>
            <p>With difficulty they tore her from the
               <lb/>inanimate corse of her loved sister, which
               <lb/>she embraced and kissed, and then spoke
               <lb/>to it, as if living, with a tenderness and af­
               <lb/>fection that melted all who were present,
               <lb/>and tears of pity fell from every eye. <persName>Mr.
               <lb/>Murray</persName> and her sister's female servant at­
               <lb/>tended <persName>Rose</persName> to the earl's, where <persName>lady Eli­

               <lb/>nor</persName> received her with a kindness and com­
               <lb/>passion that first calmed the distraction of
               <lb/>her perturbed mind.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> remained with the breathless
               <lb/>body of the hapless and misguided <persName>countess
               <lb/>de <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>, to watch over and see that the
               <lb/>last sad duties were paid to all that was left
               <lb/>of this once lively and lovely woman, who
               <lb/>had fallen an early sacrifice to levity and
               <lb/>imprudence.
            </p>
            <p>When <persName>Mr. Murray</persName> had seen <persName>Rose</persName> safely
               <lb/>placed under the protection of the amiable
               <lb/><persName>lady Elinor</persName>, he returned to <placeName>Somerset-street</placeName>,
               <lb/>to inquire into the particulars relative to
               <lb/>this sad catastrophe, and received nearly
               <lb/>the following intelligence:—
            </p>
            <p><persName>Colonel Guilford</persName> was quite impatient at
               <lb/>not receiving an answer by return of post
               <lb/>from <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>. In consequence of
               <lb/>this disappointment, he set off directly for
               <lb/><placeName>London</placeName>, and, the day after his arrival,
               <lb/>watched about the house where <persName>Jane</persName> re­
               <lb/>sided, as he would not approach her former
               <lb/>residence, fearful of seeing <persName>Rose</persName>, with

               <lb/>whom he was offended for not immediate­
               <lb/>ly answering his letter, and suspected that
               <lb/>she approved whatever line of conduct her
               <lb/>sister chose to pursue. From a window
               <lb/>opposite to the house, he beheld, with sti­
               <lb/>fled rage, <persName>Jane</persName> come out, leaning on the
               <lb/>arm of the <persName>count de <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>; and the mis­
               <lb/>tress of the house informed him, that she
               <lb/>understood the young gentleman and lady
               <lb/>were a new-married couple.
            </p>
            <p>On the following day he planted himself
               <lb/>in his former post, and again had the mor­
               <lb/>tification of seeing her, elegantly dressed,
               <lb/>and more attractive to him than before, handed
               <lb/>into a handsome chariot by the count, who
               <lb/>got in afterwards. He was driven to fren­
               <lb/>zy at this sight, for either as <persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName>'s</persName>
               <lb/>mistress or wife, to him she was irrecover­
               <lb/>ably lost. <placeName>Guilford</placeName> really loved <placeName>Jane</placeName>, and
               <lb/>would not have deserted her for any con­
               <lb/>sideration, having incurred immense ex­
               <lb/>pence and trouble to obtain her.
            </p>
            <p>Distraction seized his brain, as the pangs
               <lb/>of disappointed love agonized his mind,

               <lb/>and remorse touched his heart for having
               <lb/>first led her astray from the paths of duty,
               <lb/>which caused her to more easily become
               <lb/>the victim, a second time, of temptation.
            </p>
            <p>Determined to revenge himself on his
               <lb/>happy rival, whose felicity he was resolved
               <lb/>should not be unmolested, as he considered
               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName> as torn from him without hope, he
               <lb/>armed himself with a brace of loaded pis­
               <lb/>tols. Vengeance and wounded affection
               <lb/>racked his tortured breast, and he was firm
               <lb/>in his purpose of making the count fight,
               <lb/>and inwardly decided that either <persName>De Fon­
               <lb/>tenai</persName> or himself should lifeless fall.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Colonel Guilford</persName> stationed himself in
               <lb/><placeName>Somerset-street</placeName> till he perceived the count,
               <lb/>who had gone out exceedingly early, return
               <lb/>home. From the window where he had
               <lb/>watched them previously, he beheld him
               <lb/>enter the drawing-room where <persName>Jane</persName> was.
               <lb/>Wild with jealousy, and a desire to be re­
               <lb/>venged, he hastily left his concealment op­
               <lb/>posite, and knocked at his rival's door. A
               <lb/>maid-servant opened it, and without ask­

               <lb/>ing any questions, he rushed up the stairs,
               <lb/>and into the drawing-room, leaving the
               <lb/>maid, who took him for a robber, in terror
               <lb/>and amazement.
            </p>
            <p>When <persName>Guilford</persName> entered, with the look of
               <lb/>a maniac, <persName>Jane</persName> shrieked with horror. She
               <lb/>was seated in an affectionate manner by
               <lb/>the side of <persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName> (who had the day
               <lb/>before made her his bride); her hand was
               <lb/>clasped in his, and his arm was round her
               <lb/>waist.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Guilford's</persName> brain maddened at the sight.
               <lb/>He drew the fatal pistols from his pocket.
               <lb/>—<said>Here, destroyer of my peace!</said> he mad­
               <lb/>ly exclaimed, in a furious voice, <said>take one
               <lb/>of these! both or either of us shall die! Let
               <lb/>that faithless creature, that I still love to
               <lb/>distraction, see us perish, and share the mis­
               <lb/>chief, the misery she has made me suffer!</said>
            </p>
            <p>The count, though a fop, was not defi­
               <lb/>cient in courage; he seized one of the pis­
               <lb/>tols, and <persName>Guilford</persName> the other. At that mo­
               <lb/>ment <persName>Jane</persName>, till then silent, and petrified
               <lb/>with gloomy terror, flew to him, and en­

               <lb/>deavoured, almost unconscious of what she
               <lb/>did, to wrest the pistol from his hand. In
               <lb/>the struggle it suddenly went off, and its
               <lb/>contents lodged in the side of the wretched
               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName>. She groaned, tottered a few steps,
               <lb/>and then fell fainting on the floor.
            </p>
            <p><persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>, wild with affliction and
               <lb/>anguish, raised her from the spot where
               <lb/>she fell, and placed her on the couch.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Colonel Guilford</persName>, stunned at beholding
               <lb/>the ruin he had caused, and the murdered
               <lb/>senseless body of her he loved, staggered
               <lb/>almost insensible to the further end of the
               <lb/>room.
            </p>
            <p>The count thought that he, the author of
               <lb/>this horrible spectacle, who had perhaps de­
               <lb/>prived him for ever of the object he adored,
               <lb/>was now trying to escape from the misery
               <lb/>he had caused. The idea enraged him to
               <lb/>fury; he looked at <persName>Jane</persName>, who appeared
               <lb/>mortally wounded, and grasping the other
               <lb/>pistol, which the colonel had thrown down,
               <lb/>with too sure an aim shot <persName>Guilford</persName> through

               <lb/>convulsed, writhed in agony, and breathed
               <lb/>his last sigh.
            </p>
            <p>The heart-piercing shrieks of <persName>Jane</persName> when
               <lb/>wounded, the groans of the expiring <persName>Guil­
               <lb/>ford</persName>, and report of the pistols, brought up
               <lb/>the servants, who were alarmed at these
               <lb/>unusual sounds. They advised and be­
               <lb/>sought their master to save himself before
               <lb/>it was too late, as, if he remained, he
               <lb/>would be apprehended for the murder of
               <lb/><persName>colonel Guilford</persName>.
            </p>
            <p>The count was unwilling to quite <persName>Jane</persName>,
               <lb/>who was beginning to recover her senses;
               <lb/>but they represented so forcibly the dan­
               <lb/>ger that would attend him if he continued
               <lb/>there, and that he would then be snatched
               <lb/>from her, that he yielded to their humane
               <lb/>entreaties for him to be gone. After im­
               <lb/>printing a mournful kiss on her pale lips,
               <lb/><persName>De <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName> quitted his home, and tra­
               <lb/>velled expeditiously to the nearest sea­
               <lb/>port, to take the first opportunity of em­
               <lb/>barking for a foreign country, till the

               <lb/>bably be commenced against him by <persName>Guil­
               <lb/>ford's</persName> friends was determined.
            </p>
            <p>The servants had promised the count
               <lb/>that the greatest care should be taken of
               <lb/><persName>madame de <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>, and the most assi­
               <lb/>duous attention paid her. They had urged
               <lb/>the necessity of his instant flight, as his
               <lb/>being a foreigner would be very much to
               <lb/>his disadvantage. A surgeon was sent
               <lb/>for to examine the wounds of <persName>Jane</persName> and
               <lb/><persName>Guilford</persName>.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> revived a little, and sufficiently so
               <lb/>afterwards to desire her sister might be
               <lb/>sent for, though her wound was pronoun­
               <lb/>ced mortal; but in <persName>Guilford</persName> the last strug­
               <lb/>gle of expiring nature had passed—he was
               <lb/>quite dead. His body was removed into
               <lb/>another apartment, and seldom had a scene
               <lb/>so replete with horror, and appalling to
               <lb/>the feeling mind, been witnessed.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Murray</persName> sent an express to <persName>Guil­
               <lb/>ford's</persName> elder brother, with whom he was

               <lb/>large fortune, and had the body conveyed
               <lb/>to his residence a few miles from town.
               <lb/>When the cause of his death was related
               <lb/>to him, and by whose hand he had fallen,
               <lb/>he was resolved to avenge <persName>colonel Guil­
               <lb/>ford's</persName> fate by a strict search after the
               <lb/><persName>count de <placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName>, whom he determined
               <lb/>to bring to justice, that he might be tried
               <lb/>for his brother's murder.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Murray</persName> secretly hoped that <persName>De
               <lb/><placeName>Fontenai</placeName></persName> had by this time escaped, as the
               <lb/>horrible catastrophe would, if the count
               <lb/>was seized, be publicly mentioned, and
               <lb/>cause the deepest affliction to the general
               <lb/>and the surviving part of his family, and
               <lb/>on that account he wished this unfortu­
               <lb/>nate affair to be consigned to oblivion.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> remained in <placeName>Somerset-street</placeName> till
               <lb/>the interment of the lamented <persName>Jane</persName>, the
               <lb/>hapless victim of her own imprudence,
               <lb/>had taken place. So many tears did the
               <lb/>feeling <name>Esquimaux</name> shed for her untimely
               <lb/>end, that she was nearly reduced to a ske­

               <lb/>leton; and when she appeared before <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>attired in deep mourning, scarcely could
               <lb/>she recognize her.
            </p>
            <p>Thus few, degrading, and unhappy for
               <lb/>herself, were the days of the young, the
               <lb/>giddy, and lovely <persName>Jane</persName>. The transient
               <lb/>moments of pleasure she enjoyed could
               <lb/>not recompense her for the acute hours of
               <lb/>remorse and misery she endured. Had
               <lb/>her indiscretion only wounded her own
               <lb/>peace, the fate she sought would not have
               <lb/>been so lamentable; but grief for her pre­
               <lb/>mature melancholy death was likewise
               <lb/>severely destructive to the health of her
               <lb/>sister, and caused her friend <persName>lady Elinor</persName>
               <lb/>to be apprehensive that the consequence
               <lb/>of her sorrow would be fatal, and <persName>general
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> be deprived, almost at the same

               <lb/>She reflected, and recalled to remembrance
               <lb/>her mother's words, who had often said to
               <lb/>her and her sister, that repentance and
               <lb/>pain generally follow the steps of guilt,

            <p>To <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> devolved the cruel task

               <lb/>neral and his lady, but not the dreadful
               <lb/>circumstances attendant on it. <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName>
               <lb/>wrote a letter to <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, in which
               <lb/>she said she sincerely condoled with her
               <lb/>on her late great loss, and truly felt its
               <lb/>extent; but when she reflected it was the
               <lb/>act of the greatest and best of beings, she
               <lb/>hoped she would not refuse consolation.

               <lb/>calamity is the most heart-rending which
               <lb/>can befall a parent; but recollect that you
               <lb/>still possess good and dutiful children, and
               <lb/>I am sure that you will be resigned to that

            <p>However kind and consolatory were

               <lb/>the general supported the fatal stroke with

               <lb/>her journey into <placeName>Devonshire</placeName>; yet she
               <lb/>dreaded to revisit the scene of her inno­
               <lb/>cent and youthful happiness, since it
               <lb/>would forcibly remind her of her loved
               <lb/>sister, whose errors were forgotten in the
               <lb/>grave, and her good and pleasing qualities
               <lb/>only remembered.
            </p>
            <p>Mild as <persName>Rose</persName> naturally was, she was detest­
               <lb/>ed, and could hardly restrain from execra­
               <lb/>ting <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>, the original source of all
               <lb/><persName>Jane's</persName> faults and sorrows, as the society of
               <lb/>an unprincipled vicious woman is replete
               <lb/>with danger for a young person whose pliant
               <lb/>disposition is easily susceptible of danger­
               <lb/>ous impressions; yet she was anxious to
               <lb/>embrace the orphan <persName>Caroline</persName>—ill-fated
               <lb/>child of unfortunate parents, whom she
               <lb/>determined ever to regard, and consider
               <lb/>with the tenderness of a mother.
            </p>
            <p>The separation between <persName>lady Elinor</persName> and
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> was particularly affecting on the part
               <lb/>of the latter, who quitted her with unfeign­
               <lb/>ed regret. Her heart, which was alive to
               <lb/>gratitude, felt at that instant the very
               <lb/>great obligations she had conferred. So

               <lb/>rich, so fair, and high in rank; and to blend
               <lb/>with all these advantages the purest com­
               <lb/>passion, with a benevolence that sought
               <lb/>privacy, was a character so infinitely an­
               <lb/>gelic, that she must only be known to be
               <lb/>ardently loved. <persName>Lady Elinor</persName> had not mere­
               <lb/>ly commiserated her woes, but effectually
               <lb/>served her; and when she pressed her hand
               <lb/>at parting, the evident emotion of her
               <lb/>countenance convinced this friend of the
               <lb/>children of sorrow that her feeling benefi­
               <lb/>cence had not been bestowed on an ingrate.
            </p>
            <p><said>Never will I forget how much I owe
               <lb/>you,</said> exclaimed <persName>Rose</persName> to <persName>lady Elinor</persName>, just
               <lb/>before her departure. <said>Esteem and gra­
               <lb/>titude shall be cherished in my breast, till

            <p>The <persName>earl of <placeName>Arlberry</placeName>'s</persName> carriage conveyed

               <lb/>stage on their journey to <placeName>Devonshire</placeName>.
               <lb/>When the venerable <persName>Murray</persName> took leave
               <lb/>of her, the day before she left <placeName>London</placeName>, he

               <lb/>mentioned that, as he was acquainted with
               <lb/>every particular relating to the affairs of
               <lb/>her family, he would acquaint her with
               <lb/>a sudden thought that had occurred to
               <lb/>him. He was reflecting on the difficul­
               <lb/>ties thrown in the general's way to pre­
               <lb/>vent his taking possession of his late bro­
               <lb/>ther's estates and property, and recollected
               <lb/>that the clergyman she had spoken of as
               <lb/>having united <persName>sir James Douglas</persName> to <persName>He­
               <lb/>len Ramsay</persName> was probably his cousin, as
               <lb/>he had a relation of that name belonging
               <lb/>to the church. In consequence of this re­
               <lb/>flection, he intended writing to the reve­
               <lb/>rend <persName>Mr. Murray</persName>, to inquire if he had
               <lb/>ever resided near the <placeName>Castle of Towie
               <lb/>Craigs</placeName>, and married <persName>sir James</persName>, or <persName>Davie
               <lb/>M'Gregor</persName>, to the woman called <persName>Helen
               <lb/>Ramsay</persName>. <persName>Mr. Richard Murray</persName> continued to
               <lb/>say, that in the event of hearing any thing
               <lb/>satisfactory, he would write her the ac­
               <lb/>count at <persName>Mrs. Fane's</persName>, and also inform <persName>ge­
               <lb/>neral Douglas</persName> of the agreeable intelligence,

               <lb/>which he should be most happy to com­
               <lb/>municate.
            </p>
            <p>A faint dawn of hope gleamed in the
               <lb/>bosom of <persName>Rose</persName> at this unexpected disco­
               <lb/>very; but she dared not indulge the pleas­
               <lb/>ing expectation, from the fear of disappoint­
               <lb/>ment, to which she had become inured.
               <lb/>Yet she ardently wished that her father
               <lb/>might conquer his misfortunes, and his
               <lb/>declining years happiness, tranquillity, and
               <lb/>plenty, would then crown.
            </p>
            <p>After <persName>lord Arlberry's</persName> carriage had re­
               <lb/>turned to town, <persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Kamira</persName> got into
               <lb/>a postchaise, as <persName>lady Elinor</persName> had insisted on
               <lb/>defraying the expences of her journey, and
               <lb/>would not allow her, in the weakened
               <lb/>state of her health, to travel in a public
               <lb/>conveyance. The spirits of the feeling
               <lb/><name>Esquimaux</name>, hitherto generally all life and
               <lb/>vivacity, were strikingly altered and de­
               <lb/>pressed, and she was never cheerful but
               <lb/>when she perceived <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> less sad.
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> had written to <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName>, mention­
               <lb/>ing at what time she expected to arrive at
            <mw type="sig" rend="align(center)break(yes)">L6</mw>

               <lb/>the nearest inn, about a mile from her re­
               <lb/>sidence; and here she found that lady's
               <lb/>post-chariot waiting to convey her home.
            </p>
            <p>This attention was most pleasing, and
               <lb/>the soothing consolation of her kindness,
               <lb/>when she arrived, a little renovated her
               <lb/>dejected mind. <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> observed that
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Kamira</persName> were apparently much
               <lb/>fatigued; she insisted on their retiring in­
               <lb/>stantly to rest, and perceiving that <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>had a slight cold, gave her some whey
               <lb/>herself in bed.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> arose the following morn­
               <lb/>ing, much benefited by the truly mater­
               <lb/>nal tenderness of her old friend, and was
               <lb/>quite refreshed and revived. After break­
               <lb/>fasting together, she told <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> it was
               <lb/>her intention to walk over to <placeName>Treharne</placeName> to
               <lb/>visit <persName>Robin</persName> and <persName>Dolly</persName>, and as soon as her
               <lb/>strength was more recruited, to call upon
               <lb/><persName>Caroline</persName>.
            </p>
            <p><said>You are not strong enough to walk
               <lb/>so far yet,</said> replied <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName>: <said>my cha­

               <lb/>you may amuse yourself in strolling about
               <lb/>the garden, and then return here.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> thanked her, and <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> or­
               <lb/>dered it to be brought to the door as soon
               <lb/>as it could be got ready.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> was composed and re­
               <lb/>signed, till the turrets of <placeName>Treharne</placeName> appear­
               <lb/>ed in view, rising above the trees; her
               <lb/>heart palpitated, and a cold shivering came
               <lb/>over her: but when the whole of the edi­
               <lb/>fice broke on her sight, she flung herself
               <lb/>back in the carriage, and wept in agony.
               <lb/>The desolate demolished appearance of the
               <lb/>old mansion reminded her of her own fate,
               <lb/>and that of her family. Part of it was
               <lb/>laid in the dust, as <persName>Jane</persName> the youngest of
               <lb/>them was, perhaps never to be restored,
               <lb/>as the miserable state of their finances
               <lb/>seemed to denounce that it must remain
               <lb/>for ever in ruins. <persName>Kamira</persName> sounded the
               <lb/>well-known bugle, and <persName>Robin</persName> and <persName>Dolly</persName>,
               <lb/>clad in deep mourning, the gift of <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Fane</persName>, appeared directly on the Hall steps.

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> prevented a continuance of this

               <lb/>some present to drink hers and his mas­
               <lb/>ter and mistress's health, not forgetting
               <lb/>to include her brother's. She likewise
               <lb/>charmed <persName>Dolly</persName>, by informing her she had
               <lb/>brought down a smart bonnet and shawl
               <lb/>for her to wear on <name>Sundays</name> and holidays,
               <lb/>which quite won the simple maiden's heart.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Dolly</persName> now attended <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> and
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> to the garden and hermitage. Her
               <lb/>young lady was much pleased with the
               <lb/>neat order in which she had kept the plants
               <lb/>and hermitage. When they had walked

               <lb/>told <persName>Kamira</persName> to go and chat with her old
               <lb/>friends, <persName>Robin</persName> and <persName>Dolly</persName>, and she would
               <lb/>in that interval walk over the apartments
               <lb/>that remained of their once-extensive and
               <lb/>comfortable, though ancient residence.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> experienced a melancholy pleasure
               <lb/>in retracing the scenes of her early youth,

               <lb/>before real sorrow had clouded her mo­
               <lb/>ments. In the library her sister's lute re­
               <lb/>minded her of happier days, and affected
               <lb/>her so much, that she desisted from ex­
               <lb/>ploring any more of the apartments, and
               <lb/>left the library. She recollected having
               <lb/>forgotten her scarf, and that it was in her
               <lb/>former bedchamber. As she went in search
               <lb/>of it, she inwardly determined to make
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> remove every article that would
               <lb/>remind her of <persName>Jane</persName> into a closet in that
               <lb/>room, and carefully lock them up.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> was descending the stairs, after
               <lb/>recovering her scarf, overwhelmed with
               <lb/>pensive reflections, when happening acci­
               <lb/>dentally to turn her head, she perceived,
               <lb/>from a door on the staircase, a man with
               <lb/>a rough black head, peeing at her.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> behaved as if she had not
               <lb/>perceived him, and hoped that he thought
               <lb/>she had not, as she proceeded slowly and
               <lb/>quietly down. The unexpected object she
               <lb/>had beheld on the staircase she did not
               <lb/>notice to <persName>Robin</persName> or <persName>Dolly</persName>, as it would

               <lb/>alarm their fears. <persName>Rose</persName> conjectured that
               <lb/>he belonged to the gang of thieves who
               <lb/>she imagined had caused the strange sounds
               <lb/>that occasionally, for so many years, had
               <lb/>molested the Hall at night, and at length,
               <lb/>she supposed, set the building on fire. It
               <lb/>might indeed be a sweetheart of <persName>Dolly's</persName>,
               <lb/>whom she had received probably unknown
               <lb/>to her father. In that case, she was averse
               <lb/>to discovering this love affair, by mention­
               <lb/>ing what she had seen, as the old man
               <lb/>would most likely be displeased with his
               <lb/>daughter.
            </p>
            <p>With her firmly-attached <name>Indian</name>, <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>now quitted <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, overcome with de­
               <lb/>jection; for the picture of desolation this
               <lb/>once-cheerful mansion presented, where
               <lb/>happiness and gaiety formerly enlivened
               <lb/>its antique walls, was so forcibly contrast­
               <lb/>ed with its lonely ruined air, that her spi­
               <lb/>rits were depressed by the painful recol­
               <lb/>lections it recalled.
            </p>
            <p>Yet each corroding care and pensive
               <lb/>thought were removed as with a magic

               <lb/>wand, when she discovered the pure and un­
               <lb/>expected felicity that awaited her on return­
               <lb/>ing home. <persName>Sir Eglamour Delavalle</persName>, brave
               <lb/>as he was good, was waiting to receive her
               <lb/>at the door of <persName>Mrs. Fane's</persName> residence. He
               <lb/>handed her from the carriage, looking more
               <lb/>handsome and fascinating than ever.
            </p>
            <p>The transition from pensive sadness to
               <lb/>excess of happiness nearly overpowered
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName>. Supported by her faithful lover, she
               <lb/>reached the drawing-room, and being then
               <lb/>free from witnesses, they affectionately
               <lb/>embraced.
            </p>
            <p>This instant of purest bliss rewarded
               <lb/>them for every anxious and painful mo­
               <lb/>ment they had endured; and only those
               <lb/>who have truly loved can imagine their
               <lb/>genuine unalloyed delight. To gaze on
               <lb/>the form—to hear the voice they loved,
               <lb/>was to them unequalled joy. Much are
               <lb/>those to be pitied who are incapable of the
               <lb/>tenderness of true affection, which ennobles
               <lb/>the heart, susceptible then of the best and
               <lb/>noblest impressions.

            <p><persName>Lady Elinor</persName> had merely informed <persName>sir

            <p><persName>Sir Eglamour</persName> smiled. He perceived the
               <lb/>uneasiness she felt, and instantly endea­
               <lb/>voured to disperse it.—<said>The loss of for­

               <lb/><said>with energy: that I can repair. I pos­

               <lb/>ed to assure you it is in my power to shel­

               <lb/>only the woman I love, but the general
               <lb/>and your mother shall likewise partake of

               <lb/>me, and after whom I made a frequent

               <lb/>which I shall truly rejoice, after a fruitless

               <lb/>ing to bring them to justice.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>For your sake, if not for my own, I
               <lb/>shall be very cautious in the steps I take
               <lb/>against them. But, to speak the truth, I
               <lb/>should dislike exceedingly to fall by such
               <lb/>dishonourable hands; therefore, depend
               <lb/>on my being vigilant and prudent. It is
               <lb/>my intention to attack them with a strong
               <lb/>force, well armed, and there cannot be the

            <p>Part of a regular marching regiment

               <lb/>was slightly acquainted with one of the

               <lb/>to the colonel. He then mentioned the
               <lb/>affair of the smugglers in confidence to
               <lb/>him, as it was strictly proper and prudent
               <lb/>the measures he intended to take should
               <lb/>be kept secret, that these ruffians might
               <lb/>not be aware of the plan laid to ensnare

            <p>It frequently happens, that when for­

               <lb/>A short time after the arrival of <persName>sir Eg­

            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">240</mw>
               <lb/>man, informing him that he was resident
               <lb/>several years near the <placeName>Castle of Towie
               <lb/>Craigs</placeName>, and married <persName>Davie M'Gregor</persName> to
               <lb/><persName>Helen Ramsay</persName>. This relation added, that
               <lb/>a report of his death had been spread, which
               <lb/>had encouraged, he imagined, the villan­
               <lb/>ous attorney to invent the tale respecting
               <lb/><persName>sir James's</persName> marriage, who, contrary to every
               <lb/>idea of marrying a woman so obscure, had,
               <lb/>in his hearing, often expressed an aversion
               <lb/>to <persName>Helen</persName>, saying she was a bold impudent
               <lb/>creature, and that he would discharge her
               <lb/>from his service when his health was re­
               <lb/>stored. The clergyman gave the same cha­
               <lb/>racter of <persName>Davie</persName> as was previously sketched,
               <lb/>observing that he was inoffensive and well-
               <lb/>disposed. His place of abode, he doubted
               <lb/>not, would be easily discovered, and he
               <lb/>ready to come forward to serve the gene­
               <lb/>ral, if necessary. But his testimony of the
               <lb/>falsehood of <persName>Helen's</persName> statement would, he
               <lb/>imagined, be quite sufficient to prove a
               <lb/>conspiracy to deprive <persName>general Douglas</persName> of

               <lb/>all the intelligence in his power to eluci­
               <lb/>date this iniquitous transaction. It was
               <lb/>his intention, he observed, to defray the

               <lb/>happy to make him a handsome recom­
               <lb/>pence for his trouble, as the fortunate ter­

               <lb/>He had proved that his affection was void
               <lb/>of any regard to private advantage, which
               <lb/>heightened her solicitude to reward his

               <lb/>cealed, now began to put his scheme into exe­
               <lb/>cution. He procured from his new ac­
               <lb/>quaintance, <persName>colonel Jenkins</persName>, fifty soldiers,
               <lb/>well armed, not dressed in their military
               <lb/>habits, but in shabby plain clothes. They
               <lb/>all arrived one dark evening at <placeName>Treharne</placeName>,
               <lb/>and were received quietly by <persName>Robin</persName>, who
               <lb/>distributed and secreted them in different
               <lb/>parts of the ruined building, which was ex­
               <lb/>tensive enough to have contained a great­
               <lb/>er body of men; but most of them were
               <lb/>placed near the cellars, where the fire had
               <lb/>been first kindled.
            </p>
            <p>In the dead of the night, when all had
               <lb/>retired to rest, and every thing was still,
               <lb/><persName>sir Eglamour</persName>, unknown to <persName>Rose</persName>, stole
               <lb/>down the stairs, and softly opening the
               <lb/>house-door at <persName>Mrs. Fane's</persName>, it was gently
               <lb/>closed after him by one of the domestics.
               <lb/>He then joined his servant, who was wait­
               <lb/>ing with two horses a few yards from the
               <lb/>house; and mounting one of them, rode
               <lb/>swiftly off, followed by his man. Some
               <lb/>of the soldiers, in eager expectation of his

               <lb/>arrival, had placed themselves on the op­
               <lb/>posite side of the river, and they crossed
               <lb/>over to the Hall together as quietly as
               <lb/>possible. Strongly armed, twenty of them
               <lb/>attended <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> into the first cel­
               <lb/>lar, where it was settled fifteen were to
               <lb/>remain, and the remainder were to be sta­
               <lb/>tioned outside, except one, that was to
               <lb/>be centinel near the long passage; and if
               <lb/>the party advancing forward were to be
               <lb/>attacked, he was to blow a shrill loud whis­
               <lb/>tle, and all the soldiers at that sound were
               <lb/>to rush forward to defend their comrades.
            </p>
            <p>They passed uninterrupted through the
               <lb/>vaults and long passage which <persName>Rose</persName> and
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> had formerly examined, and at
               <lb/>length reached the first cavern, which ap­
               <lb/>peared to them inhabited. On opening the
               <lb/>door conducting to its interior, a sulphurous
               <lb/>smell and thick smoke issued from it, and
               <lb/>nearly suffocated them. At the same in­
               <lb/>stant a low moaning attracted their atten­
               <lb/>tion; but the vapours and smoky scent
               <lb/>were so oppressive, that the men did not

               <lb/>like to advance, till their commander ex­
               <lb/>claimed—<said>Leave open the door, and the
               <lb/>fume will disperse gradually.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Sir Eglamour</persName> then pushed forward into
               <lb/>that part of the subterranean retreat from
               <lb/>whence the groans proceeded. Here re­
               <lb/>clined, on a bed (described in the second
               <lb/>volume) the form of a lady in the meridian
               <lb/>of life, apparently expiring, as her face was
               <lb/>convulsed and distorted, as if writhing in
               <lb/>the agonies of death. It was immediately
               <lb/>conjectured by <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> and the men,
               <lb/>that the charcoal they discovered had been
               <lb/>used to air the cavern, which was very
               <lb/>damp, probably from being long uninha­
               <lb/>bited, had been burnt in too large a quan­
               <lb/>tity, and set fire to some wood near. There
               <lb/>was no discharge outward for the smoke,
               <lb/>which, united with the suffocating fume
               <lb/>and smell of sulphur, had overpowered the
               <lb/>lady's senses, and nearly choked her by
               <lb/>excluding a pure free air.
            </p>
            <p><said>Bear the lady from the cave into the
               <lb/>hall,</said> said <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>, to three of the

               <lb/>soldiers, <said rend="pre()">and send your comrades to sup­
               <lb/>ply your place. The change may recover
               <lb/>her, and restore respiration, which appears
               <lb/>almost gone. I know not if she is respect­
               <lb/>able—I fear otherwise; but humanity de­

               <lb/>ance in our power.</said>
            </p>
            <p>The men obeyed him, and after waiting
               <lb/>till the other soldiers arrived, <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>
               <lb/>entered, through a door opposite to that
               <lb/>which conducted them to the lady, into
               <lb/>a long narrow vault, containing an im­
               <lb/>mense number of casks, some of them emp­
               <lb/>ty, but the principal part of them stored
               <lb/>with smuggled brandy, <name>Hollands</name>, and
               <lb/>wine. From this vault they went into
               <lb/>another, filled with wearing apparel of eve­
               <lb/>ry description, and foreign habits. Among
               <lb/>these they distinguished the turban and
               <lb/>garments of the unhappy <name>Moor</name> that <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>had seen extended a murdered corse, and
               <lb/>was doomed, after being saved, from a wa­
               <lb/>tery grave, to lose his life by the assassin
               <lb/>of the cavern. <persName>Rose</persName> had described his

               <lb/>dress, and the horrid spectacle he presented
               <lb/>to her terrified sight, and <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> re­
               <lb/>cognized his clothes from her descriptive
               <lb/>account. A variety of guns, pistols, swords,
               <lb/>and other instruments of dark murder and
               <lb/>secret assassination, the vaults likewise
               <lb/>contained. Their leader again addressed
               <lb/>the soldiers, and observed that they must
               <lb/>continue their search with the utmost cau­
               <lb/>tion and silence, and the mystery, he
               <lb/>thought, would soon be disclosed, and suc­
               <lb/>cess attend their researches and pursuit of
               <lb/>the ruffians, who had committed such law­
               <lb/>less and sanguinary deeds.
            </p>
            <p>They pursued their route onwards with­
               <lb/>out speaking, till they attained a small
               <lb/>cave, with more barrels in it. This open­
               <lb/>ed into the cavern where <persName>Rose</persName> beheld
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> and the stranger, who had ex­
               <lb/>cited an interest in her bosom, from his
               <lb/>elegant superior air, though disguised.
               <lb/>The sound of several voices in earnest dis­
               <lb/>course made the party suddenly halt, and
               <lb/>attentively listen.

            <p>By the conversation passing in the next
               <lb/>cave, it did not appear that many persons
               <lb/>were assembled there. <persName>Sir Eglamour</persName> whis­
               <lb/>pered to his soldiers, that now, if they were
               <lb/>resolved and courageous, an excellent op­
               <lb/>portunity offered for seizing the smug­
               <lb/>glers, that he supposed were collected in
               <lb/>the adjacent cavern. They unanimously
               <lb/>declared they were eager to attempt mak­
               <lb/>ing the villains their prisoners, and at a sig­
               <lb/>nal given by him, rushed to the door, which
               <lb/>they burst open, and discovered only six
               <lb/>men meanly dressed. These men were seated
               <lb/>at a table, with a good supper before them, and
               <lb/>a plentiful supply of beer and brandy. The
               <lb/>soldiers secured them without opposition,
               <lb/>and <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> said to his companions,
               <lb/>who were not employed to guard the
               <lb/>smugglers—<said>Let us pursue our examina­
               <lb/>tion, and continue the search till we arrive
               <lb/>at the sea-shore.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>It is giving yourself useless trouble,

               <lb/>racter, it will not be prudent to attend to

               <lb/>give time for a large body of your brother
               <lb/>smugglers to overpower us. I shall go
               <lb/>forward and examine every avenue and
               <lb/>recess leading from hence to the sea, and
               <lb/>if I find, on my return, that your veracity
               <lb/>is unquestioned, I will then listen to your

               <lb/>tered the most merciless villains, till they at­
               <lb/>tained the desolate ruined house on the sea
               <lb/>beach. They found his wretched abode
               <lb/>quite deserted, with the appearance of its
               <lb/>inmates having fled from it precipitately.
               <lb/>They afterwards left the ruined house,
               <lb/>and returned to the caverns, where they
               <lb/>secured the entrance withinside so strong­
               <lb/>ly, that it was impossible for any one to
               <lb/>enter by that communication, and soon
               <lb/>arrived at the spot they had quitted.
            </p>
            <p>The man who had first addressed <persName>sir
               <lb/>Eglamour</persName> was again the spokesman for
               <lb/>the others, who looked very dejected, and
               <lb/>not in the least daring. This smuggler
               <lb/>informed <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> that it was twenty
               <lb/>years since smuggling had been practised
               <lb/>upon that part of the coast to a great ex­
               <lb/>tent. <persName>Lord Treharne</persName>, the brother of <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Douglas</persName>, was connected with these men,
               <lb/>who considered him as their chief, as they
               <lb/>were under great obligations to his lord­
               <lb/>ship, for allowing them the use of the
               <lb/>caves for their retreat, where they could

               <lb/>safely conceal their contraband goods.
               <lb/>Here they also secreted the plunder they
               <lb/>obtained from vessels that were frequently
               <lb/>wrecked near the spot. In stormy wea­
               <lb/>ther, the most ferocious part of the gang,
               <lb/>who were foreigners, brought from abroad
               <lb/>by <persName>lord Treharne</persName>, watched for several
               <lb/>miles along the coast, to pillage the wrecks,
               <lb/>and rob any shipwrecked persons who
               <lb/>gained the land with any property they
               <lb/>had saved from the waves; and the booty
               <lb/>on these occasions was often very valuable.

               <lb/>him to league with our company, and add
               <lb/>some people dependent on him, besides
               <lb/>the foreigners, to our numbers, and his
               <lb/>lordship's share of the money and spoils
               <lb/>we gained was always the most consider­
               <lb/>able. The fisherman and his wife, at the

               <lb/>dations was so well contrived by my lord,
               <lb/>that we always escaped detection. Yet
               <lb/>many unfortunate victims have fallen be­
               <lb/>neath the murderous hand of the most
               <lb/>savage and bloodthirsty of our comrades,
               <lb/>and were buried in the ground below the
               <lb/>caves, so very deep that the bodies could
               <lb/>not easily be discovered. The plunder we
               <lb/>obtained in jewels and gold was very im­
               <lb/>portant, as well as the profits we got by im­

               <lb/>small, compared to the others. One of the

               <lb/>My wife, who was very dear to me, and
               <lb/>five little children, were starving, as a long
               <lb/>fit of illness had thrown me out of em­

               <lb/>one of them, as it was their plan to aug­
               <lb/>ment their numbers as much as possible,
               <lb/>and not a single man had ever proved
               <lb/>treacherous. <persName>Colonel Guilford</persName>, who was

               <lb/>the Hall was haunted, and cause such an

               <lb/>our total ruin: we had no other safe re­
               <lb/>fuge where we could secretly shelter our­
               <lb/>selves and our goods. His lordship like­
               <lb/>wise employed us to carry off <persName>Miss Doug­
               <lb/>las</persName> and her maid. The young lady was
               <lb/>to have been placed under the protection
               <lb/>of <persName>captain Courtenay</persName>, who had promised
               <lb/>her uncle a large sum of money for this
               <lb/>piece of service, though the captain did not
               <lb/>know my lord was confederate with robbers
               <lb/>and smugglers. However, I was so moved
               <lb/>with <persName>Miss Douglas's</persName> situation, who I had

               <lb/>up to <persName>captain Courtenay</persName>, whose intentions
               <lb/>were, I was certain, very base, and would
               <lb/>ill treat her from revenge, as I was told.
               <lb/>These thoughts made me contrive her es­

               <lb/>the foreigners, and most infamous of the

               <lb/>to him. They had a meeting in the ca­

               <lb/>give her money, or take her with him,
               <lb/>though she vowed revenge. Her threats
               <lb/>hastened his departure, and he embarked
               <lb/>before daybreak yesterday morning. His
               <lb/>lordship desired us to avoid her, and the
               <lb/>wind being favourable, the vessel sailed
               <lb/>directly; yet I cannot help thinking that
               <lb/>it was something more than the charcoal
               <lb/>that reduced her, sir, to the state in which
               <lb/>she was found.</said>
            </p>
            <p>There was a decided air of truth in what

               <lb/>desired the smugglers to finish their repast,

            <p>While they were enjoying this refresh­

               <lb/>ation of the service the man had rendered
               <lb/><persName>Miss Douglas</persName>, to suffer him and his com­
               <lb/>panions to escape. They all assured him,
               <lb/>that they had intended, when their com­
               <lb/>rades left them, to enter as seamen on board
               <lb/>a man-of-war, for sailors (at that time) were
               <lb/>much required for his majesty's navy. Af­
               <lb/>ter the soldiers and smugglers had regaled
               <lb/>themselves, the latter were conveyed and

               <lb/>Her he beheld a stiffened corse. Life had

               <lb/>in the habitation of the family she had ir­
               <lb/>reparably injured. Conscious of her crimes,
               <lb/>she asked her forgiveness, saying, that since
               <lb/>the death of the unfortunate <persName>Jane</persName>, which
               <lb/>had reached her ears, the most torturing
               <lb/>remorse had deprived her of sleep and
               <lb/>rest. Misguided by her, she knew that
               <lb/>she had consigned her sister to an early
               <lb/>grave, who might have lived, but for her
               <lb/>blighting hand, in innocence and peace.
               <lb/>The horror those thoughts inspired, and
               <lb/>the desertion of <persName>lord Treharne</persName>, inflamed
               <lb/>her senses, and in a moment of outrageous
               <lb/>despair, she had taken a draught of poison,
               <lb/>to end her guilty and miserable existence.
               <lb/>The venomous potion was not, however, so
               <lb/>speedy in its operation as she expected, and
               <lb/>allowed her to confess her crimes, the only
               <lb/>atonement she could make for guilt un­
               <lb/>equalled.
            </p>
            <p>The body of this wretched creature pre­

               <lb/>gured that countenance, which inspired
               <lb/>aversion and terror, instead of pity. No
               <lb/>tear of regret and affectionate sorrow be­

               <lb/>the darkness of night, and surrounding

               <lb/>to avoid disturbing their repose, and in a
               <lb/>low voice addressed the man who assisted
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> to escape.
            </p>
            <p><said>I will allow you to fly from this con­

               <lb/>I give you now a handsome sum of money

            </p>
            <p>They unanimously swore to observe his

               <lb/>come to support his rank. But this in­
               <lb/>convenience was unfelt, as his father came
               <lb/>immediately into possession of the exten­
               <lb/>sive fortune bequeathed by <persName>sir James
               <lb/>Douglas</persName>, which enabled him to bestow suf­
               <lb/>ficient wealth on <persName>Felix</persName> to allow his ap­
               <lb/>pearing as a nobleman.

            <p><persName>Helen Ramsay</persName>, and the hypocritical at­

               <lb/>they merited for the conspiracy formed
               <lb/>against <persName>general Douglas</persName>. In the course of
               <lb/>their examination, it was revealed that even
               <lb/>this plot was planned by <persName>lord Treharne</persName> and

               <lb/>ness, felt richly rewarded for having en­
               <lb/>dured adversity with courage and resigna­
               <lb/>tion. To promote the lasting felicity of <persName>sir
               <lb/>Eglamour</persName> was her first wish and intention,
               <lb/>by every effort to please him, and secure
               <lb/>his esteem and attachment. He was the
               <lb/>only man who had ever excited her grati­
               <lb/>tude and admiration. His disinterested
               <lb/>conduct, when he thought her portionless,
               <lb/>demanded the former sentiment, and his
               <lb/>accomplishments and manly beauty claim­
               <lb/>ed the latter.
            </p>
            <p>Those beings who had compassionated
               <lb/>her sorrows were not forgotten, and hand­
               <lb/>somely recompensed for the feeling they
               <lb/>had evinced. <persName>Rose</persName> never blushed at the
               <lb/>recollection of having experienced unde­
               <lb/>served indigence and affliction. It was a
               <lb/>superior gratification to her to assist the un­
               <lb/>fortunate, whose sufferings she poignantly
               <lb/>commiserated, from having sustained simi­
               <lb/>lar distress.

               <lb/>versation, that could win and strengthen
               <lb/>affection, attached her husband to her with
               <lb/>heightened regard, that never weakened.
               <lb/>Her parents were grateful to Heaven for
               <lb/>giving them a child so truly amiable, and
               <lb/>her friends found a soothing balm in her
               <lb/>friendship, when affliction oppressed, and
               <lb/>the purest felicity, when all their prospects
               <lb/>were smiling. The victims of poverty and

            <p>The fraternal love existing between her
               <lb/>brother <persName>Felix</persName> and herself remained un­

               <lb/>her, nor could she be persuaded to quit her

               <lb/>free, <persName>sir Felix Douglas</persName> having settled a li­
