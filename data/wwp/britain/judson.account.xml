        <p>
          <quote>For six months past, I have been so engaged in missionary
<lb/>work, that the dear land of my nativity has occupied but few of
<lb/>my thoughts. A short time since, however, the <title rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Memoir of
<lb/><persName>Henry Martyn</persName></title> was put into my hands; and while reading the
<lb/>account of his departure from <placeName>England</placeName>, the sad but joyful
<lb/>morning on which I bade adieu to <placeName>America</placeName>, came fresh to my
<lb/>remembrance, and a train of sensations were excited, of which
<lb/>I have often been the subject. I walked out in the virandah, and
<lb/>the sun was sinking in the west; I fancied that I saw my far
<lb/>distant brethren rising from sweet repose, and engaging in the
<lb/>various duties of life. Their countenances passed before my
<lb/>mind; and while recollecting that I should enjoy their society
<lb/>no more on earth, my thoughts were quickly transported to
<lb/>that happy world, in which all whose names are written in the
<lb/><title>Book of Life</title> shall be united, never again to part. Reflections
<lb/>like these often cheer the hour of solitude, and produce emotions
<lb/>indescribably pleasant.</quote>

        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">It</hi> may not hitherto have been generally known in
<placeName>England</placeName>,
	  <lb/>that in the year <date when="1812">1812</date>, the <persName>Rev. Adoniram Judson</persName> engaged 
	  <lb/>in a Mission to the <placeName>Burman Empire</placeName>, under the direction of
	  <lb/>the <orgName>American Board of Baptist Missions</orgName>; and settled at
	  <lb/><placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, on the eastern coast of the <placeName>Bay of Bengal</placeName>. After
	  <lb/>encountering many difficulties and privations, during the
	  <lb/>first six years of his residence in that country, he acquired a
	  <lb/>thorough knowledge of the language; translated a consider­
	  <lb/>able part of the <rs type="title">New Testament</rs>; and composed Tracts,
	  <lb/>which were circulated among the natives of <placeName>Burmah</placeName>. Much
	  <lb/>inquiry on the subject of religion was thus excited, and several
	  <lb/>genuine converts were formed into a Christian Society, con­
	  <lb/>ducting themselves in every respect consistently with their
	  <lb/>Christian profession.</p>
        <p><persName>Mrs. Judson's</persName> health having suffered greatly from the 
	  <lb/>effects of the climate, her removal to a  colder latitude
	  <lb/>became necessary, which occasioned her visit to <placeName>England</placeName> on
	  <lb/>her way to <placeName>America</placeName>, in the summer of <date when="1822">1822</date>. The particulars
	  <lb/>she communicated concerning the inhabitants of the <placeName>Burman 
	  <lb/>Empire</placeName>, and the rise and progress of the Burman Mission,
	  <lb/>were in this country new and highly interesting. She was,
	  <lb/>therefore, earnestly requested to write a detailed account of
	  <lb/>the Mission, which might be printed for general information.
	  <lb/>In compliance with this request, on her voyage to <placeName>America</placeName>,
	  <lb/>she commenced, and during her residence there completed,
	  <lb/>the first Fourteen Letters which are contained in the present
	  <lb/>volume. The remainder were written after her return to 
	  <lb/><placeName>Burmah</placeName>.</p>
        <p>It appears that female education forms no part of the
<lb/>Burman system: on the contrary, national prejudice is
<lb/>strongly opposed to the principle. Slavery is carried on,
 
<pb n="vi"/>

	  <lb/>similar, in many respects, to that which prevailed under the 
	  <lb/>Mosaic dispensation. When the father of a family is over­
	  <lb/>whelmed with debt, he has recourse to the sale of his wife
	  <lb/>and children; and if the sum he receives for them be not
	  <lb/>sufficient, he offers himself in order to balance the account.
	  <lb/>Not unfrequently, under the despotic government of the
	  <lb/>Empire, a tax is levied on an individual far beyond his ability 
	  <lb/>to pay, and he is put to the torture until he has entered into
	  <lb/>an engagement to produce the sum required: the sale of
	  <lb/>his wife and children takes place for this purpose. Hence
	  <lb/>there are multitudes of slaves in the <placeName>Burman Empire</placeName>. But
	  <lb/>those slaves whose situation is peculiarly calculated to excite
	  <lb/>compassion, are children whose parents die involved in debt.
	  <lb/>The creditor immediately lays claim to the helpless orphans,
	  <lb/>and either retains them for his debt, whatever may be its
	  <lb/>amount, or sells them for an equivalent sum. To redeem
	  <lb/>a few female orphan slaves of this description, is an object
	  <lb/>which <persName>Mrs. Judson</persName> proposes to herself, in order to com­
	  <lb/>mence with them a system of instruction; hoping that, 
	  <lb/>should her labours succeed, their conduct in after life may
	  <lb/>convince the <name>Burmans</name> of the utility of female education.</p>
        <p>The profits from this publication, if any should arise,
	  <lb/>will be appropriated to the redemption from slavery and
	  <lb/>to the education, of female children in <placeName>Burmah</placeName>, under the
	  <lb/>immediate superintendance of <persName>Mrs. Judson</persName>.</p>

        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">A connected</hi> account of the origin, progress, and suc­
	  <lb/>cess, of the American Baptist Mission to the <placeName>Burman
	    <lb/>Empire</placeName>, was first suggested by friends in <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, who were
	  <lb/>desirous of a better acquaintance with particular circum­
	  <lb/>stances, than could be obtained from any publication extant.</p>
        <p>On embarking for <placeName>Europe</placeName>, I indulged the hope of being 
	  <lb/>able to commence a work of this kind, during the passage;
	  <lb/>but my ill state of health, together with the scanty materials 
	  <lb/>then in my possession, induced me to defer it until a more
	  <lb/>favourable period.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, I found a high degree of in­
	  <lb/>terest, relative to the Burman Mission; excited, principally,
	  <lb/>by a few articles of intelligence which had found their way
	  <lb/>from these shores across the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>, and which continually 
	  <lb/>prompted the inquiry, <said>How shall we obtain all the in­
	  <lb/>formation which has been transmitted to your American 
	  <lb/>Board?</said> Frequently was the request reiterated, to make
	  <lb/>a compilation of documents, in such a form as to give a
	  <lb/>history of events, from the commencement of the mission 
	  <lb/>to the present time.</p>
        <p>From no one was this request more forcibly and con­
	  <lb/>stantly made, than from that esteemed friend to whom these 
	  <lb/>letters are addressed; who, from my first arrival in <placeName>England</placeName>,
	  <lb/>until my departure for my native shores, manifested the
	  <lb/>affectionate concern of a father, and spared no exertions to
	  <lb/>increase my comfort, improve my health, and enhance my
	  <lb/>usefulness. He entered warmly into our missionary views,
	  <lb/>and endeavored to cherish the flame, already kindled, in his
	  <lb/>circle; and his last request, received at the very moment of
	  <lb/>my embarkation at <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>, had no inconsiderable influence
	  <lb/>in prevailing on me to commence the present compilation.</p>
        <p>Since my arrival in this country, my health has so far de­
	  <lb/>clined as to prevent my imparting to my beloved friends that

	  <lb/>oral information which I had so fondly expected and ardently 
	  <lb/>desired. This circumstance has been an additional induce­
	  <lb/>ment to devote every moment of leisure, and respite from
	  <lb/>pain, to the compilation of this work; and it is to me no
v	  <lb/>small source of consolation, that, while endeavoring to
	  <lb/>obtain my health, in my secluded and retired situation, I
	  <lb/>have been able to prepare and present to my Christian 
	  <lb/>friends, a concise view of the faithfulness and mercy of God,
	  <lb/>as exhibited in the formation of a little church, in one of
	  <lb/>the largest heathen empires in the world.</p>
        <p>While I consider the following letters as a substitute for 
	  <lb/>verbal communications, I cannot refrain from bespeaking
	  <lb/>the candour of my friends in perusing them.</p>
        <p>Much additional interesting matter would have been
	  <lb/>communicated, more attention to style and elegance of
	  <lb/>expression would have been given, and more particularity in
	  <lb/>selection and arrangement would have appeared, had my
	  <lb/>health allowed. This must be my apology for omissions and
	  <lb/>errors of every kind. But, poor as is the garb in which
	  <lb/>these letters are attired, a full conviction that the providential
	  <lb/>circumstances therein detailed, will have a tendency to excite
	  <lb/>grateful emotions in the hearts of many of God's dear
	  <lb/>children, induces me to make an immediate and joyful offer 
	  <lb/>of this little work.</p>
        <p>I gladly embrace the present opportunity to express my
	  <lb/>thanks, and sense of obligation, for the continued and in­
	  <lb/>numerable proofs of Christian affection, which have been
	  <lb/>manifested by the <orgName>Board of Managers of the General Con­
	  <lb/>vention</orgName>; by female societies; and by many individuals,
	  <lb/>in their endeavors to add to my comfort and aid me in
	  <lb/>my designs, since my arrival in this country.</p>
        <p>That the blessings of thousands, ready to perish, may
	  <lb/>descend upon all interested in the missionary cause; and
	  <lb/>that every individual who shall peruse these letters may raise
	  <lb/>his heart to God, in prayer for the conversion of the heathen,
	  <lb/>is the sincere and constant desire of</p>

	  <lb/>has been richly experienced in the very storms of ad­
	  <lb/>versity. To honour of Divine grace would I re­
	  <lb/>cord, that we have never encountered trials greater 
	  <lb/>than we have been enabled to bear, and a way for
	  <lb/>escape from imminent danger and peril has always
	  <lb/>been provided.</p>
        <p>Previously to a personal relation, a slight sketch of
	  <lb/>the <placeName>Burman Empire</placeName>, its geographical situation, go­
	  <lb/>vernment, and some of the principal traits in the cha­
	  <lb/>racter of its inhabitants, may not be uninteresting.</p>
        <p>This empire comprises the former kingdoms of 
	  <lb/><placeName>Arracan</placeName>, <placeName>Ava</placeName>, and
<placeName>Pegue</placeName>,whose sovereigns were dis­
	  <lb/>placed by the celebrated <persName>Alompra</persName>, the founder of the
	  <lb/>present dynasty, or by his successors. This, and some
	  <lb/>adjacent countries, have sometimes been termed Indo-
	    <lb/>Chinese nations, as situated between <placeName>India Proper</placeName> and
	  <lb/><placeName>China</placeName>. The empire of <placeName>Burmah</placeName>, in its present state,
	  <lb/>is about 1200 miles in length, and 8 or 900 in the 
	  <lb/>broadest part. It extends from the 9th to the 28th
	  <lb/>degree North latitude, and from the 91st to the 108th
	  <lb/>East longitude; and contains a population estimated
	  <lb/>at about nineteen millions. The northern part of the
	  <lb/>country is barren and mountainous; but the plains
	  <lb/>and valleys, situated more southerly, are very fertile.
	  <lb/>The climate is considered salubrious, and the natives
	  <lb/>are remarkably healthy and vigorous. The govern­
	  <lb/>ment is strictly monarchical. The emperor is an ab­
	  <lb/>solute sovereign, and is regarded as the sole lord and
	  <lb/>proprietor of life and property in his dominions; and,
	  <lb/>without the concurrence of any, his word is irresistible 
	  <lb/>law. Four private ministers of state, (called <foreign xml:lang="my">Atwen­
	    <lb/>woon</foreign>) and four public ministers of state, (<foreign xml:lang="my">Woongyee</foreign>)
	  <lb/>are the organs of administration. The latter compose
 
<pb n="3"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">3</mw>
	  <lb/>the supreme court of the empire, (<foreign xml:lang="my">Tlowtdau</foreign>) in the
	  <lb/>name of which all imperial edicts are issued.</p>
        <p>The <placeName>Burman empire</placeName> is divided into districts, each of
	  <lb/>which is governed by the viceroy, (<foreign xml:lang="my">Myoowoon</foreign>) and a 
	  <lb/>court, (<foreign xml:lang="my">Yongdau</foreign>). The district courts are composed
	  <lb/>of a president, (<foreign xml:lang="my">Yawoon</foreign>)—chief magistrate, (<foreign xml:lang="my">Ski-kai</foreign>)
	  <lb/>—collectors of the port, (<foreign xml:lang="my">Akoukwoon</foreign>)—auditors,
	  <lb/>(<foreign xml:lang="my">Narkandau</foreign>)—and secretaries, (<foreign xml:lang="my">Saragyee</foreign>).</p>
        <p>The members of the district courts, and the wives,
	  <lb/>relations, and favourites of viceroys, have also the
	  <lb/>privilege of holding private courts, and of deciding
	  <lb/>petty causes subject to appeal to higher authority.</p>
        <p>The <name>Burmans</name> are <name>Boodhists</name> or a nation of atheists.
	  <lb/>They believe that existence involves in itself the prin­
	  <lb/>ciples of misery and destruction: consequently, there
	  <lb/>is no eternal God. The whole universe, say they, is
	  <lb/>only destruction and re-production. It therefore be­
	  <lb/>comes a wise man to raise his desires above all things
	  <lb/>that exist, and aspire to <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="my">Nigban</foreign>, the <mcr>state</mcr> in which 
	  <lb/>there is no existence. Rewards and punishments fol­
	  <lb/>low meritorious and sinful acts, agreeably to the
	  <lb/><mcr>nature</mcr> of things. <persName>Gaudama</persName>, their last <name>Boodh</name>, or 
	  <lb/>deity, in consequence of meritorious acts, arrived
	  <lb/>that state of perfection, which made him deserving of

	  <lb/>than most of the Eastern nations. They are frank and

	  <lb/>racterizes the <name>Hindoos</name>; and of that revengeful ma­
	  <lb/>lignity which is a leading trait in the Malay character.
	  <lb/>Some of their men are powerful logicians, and take

        <p>Soon after he had graduated, at one of our American
	  <lb/>universities, he commenced making a tour of the
	  <lb/><placeName>United States</placeName>. Some providential circumstances, while
	  <lb/>on his journey, led him to doubt the truth of those
	  <lb/>deistical sentiments which he had recently adopted. His
	  <lb/>mind became so deeply impressed with the probability
	  <lb/>of the Divine authenticity of the Scriptures, that he
	  <lb/>could no longer continue his journey; but returned to
	  <lb/>his father's house, for the express purpose of examin­
	  <lb/>ing thoroughly the foundation of the Christian re­
	  <lb/>ligion. After continuing his investigations for some
	  <lb/>time, he became convinced that the Scriptures were of
	  <lb/>Divine origin, and that he himself was in a lost situa­
	  <lb/>tion by nature, and needed renovation previous to an
	  <lb/>admittance into heaven. It now became his sole en­
	  <lb/>quiry, <quote>What shall I do to be saved?</quote></p>
        <p>A theological seminary at <placeName>Andover</placeName>, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>,
	  <lb/>was about this time established; but the rules of the
	  <lb/>institution required evidence of evangelical piety in all
	  <lb/>who were admitted. <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> was desirous of en­
	  <lb/>tering this college, for the purpose of being benefitted
	  <lb/>by the theological lectures; but hardly ventured to
	  <lb/>make application, conscious that he was destitute of
	  <lb/>the proper qualifications. His ardent desire, however,
	  <lb/>of becoming acquainted with the religious students,
	  <lb/>and of being in a situation to gain religious instruc­
	  <lb/>tion, overcame every obstacle, and he applied for ad­
	  <lb/>mittance; at the same time assuring the professors of
	  <lb/>his having no hope that he had been a subject of re­
	  <lb/>generating grace. He was, notwithstanding, ad­
	  <lb/>mitted; and, in the course of a few weeks, gained
	  <lb/>satisfactory evidence of having obtained an interest in
	  <lb/>Christ, and turned his attention to those studies which 

<pb n="6"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">6</mw>
	  <lb/>were most calculated to make him useful in the
	  <lb/>ministry.</p>
        <p>Some time in the last year of his residence in this
	  <lb/>theological seminary, he met with <persName>Dr. Buchanan's</persName>
	  <lb/><quote>Star in the East</quote>. This first led his thoughts to an
	  <lb/>Eastern mission. The subject harassed his mind from
	  <lb/>day to day, and he felt deeply impressed with the im­
	  <lb/>portance of making some attempt to rescue the pe­
	  <lb/>rishing millions of the East. He communicated these
	  <lb/>impressions to the professors and students, but they
	  <lb/>all discouraged him. He then wrote to the Directors
	  <lb/>of the <orgName>London Missionary Society</orgName>, explained his views,
	  <lb/>and requested information on the subject of missions.
	  <lb/>He received a most encouraging reply, and an invita­
	  <lb/>tion to visit <placeName>England</placeName>, to obtain in person the necessary
	  <lb/>information.</p>
        <p>Soon after this, Messrs. <persName>Nott</persName>, <persName>Newell</persName>, and <persName>Hall</persName>
	  <lb/>joined him, all of them resolving to leave their native
	  <lb/>land, and engage on the arduous work of missionaries,
	  <lb/>as soon as Providence should open a way. At a meet­
	  <lb/>ing of the <orgName>Massachusetts Association</orgName>, <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> and
	  <lb/>his associates presented a paper, which first made 
	  <lb/>known to  the public their missionary designs. This,
	  <lb/>together with further representations and conversa­
	  <lb/>tions, originated the <orgName rend="pre(ldquo;)post(rdquo;)">American Board of Commis­
	    <lb/>sioners for Foreign Missions</orgName>.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the formation of this Board, <persName>Mr. Jud­
	    <lb/>son</persName> was authorised by its members to go on a mission 
	  <lb/>of inquiry to <placeName>England</placeName>, and to ascertain what degree of
	  <lb/>assistance could be obtained, in case our own funds 
	  <lb/>should be inadequate to the undertaking. On his
	  <lb/>voyage thither, the ship was taken by a French pri­
	  <lb/>vateer; and, as if to try the purity of his missionary

<pb n="7"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">7</mw>	
	  <lb/>zeal, <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> was put on board, and, after being
	  <lb/>detained as a prisoner for several weeks, was safely
	  <lb/>conveyed to the dungeon of a French prison in
	  <lb/><placeName>Bayonne</placeName>. Through the assistance, however, of an 
	  <lb/>American gentleman, who saw <persName>Mr. J.</persName> conveyed through
	  <lb/>the streets, he procured his release, and, after a most
	  <lb/>difficult struggle to obtain official passports from
	  <lb/><persName>Napoleon</persName>, (it was in <date when="1811">1811</date>,) he was allowed to pro­
	  <lb/>ceed through the country, and to pass the <placeName>Channel</placeName> to
	  <lb/><placeName>England</placeName>. In that highly favoured land, he obtained
	  <lb/>all the assistance, encouragement, and information he
	  <lb/>desired, and returned again to <placeName>America</placeName>, after an ab­
	  <lb/>sence of nearly a year.</p>
        <p>A few months after his return, the Board came to a 
	  <lb/>resolution of sending the missionaries in the first ship
	  <lb/>ready to sail for the East.</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Rice</persName>, another student at <placeName>Andover</placeName>, whose mind
	  <lb/>had long been impressed with the melancholy situa­
	  <lb/>tion of the heathen, but who, hithero, had been un­
	  <lb/>determined, now offered himself to the Board, and
	  <lb/>begged to be allowed the privilege of accompanying
	  <lb/>his brethren.</p>
        <p>In the winter of <date when="1812">1812</date>, <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Newell</persName>, <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Judson</persName> and myself, embarked from <placeName>Salem</placeName>, on board
	  <lb/>the <name>Caravan</name>; at the same time the other three mis­
	  <lb/>sionaries sailed from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>
        <p>We arrived in <placeName>Calcutta</placeName>, in <name>May</name>, after a pleasant
	  <lb/>passage of four months. But our heavenly Father
	  <lb/>saw our unfitness to engage in his service, previously
	  <lb/>to our entering disciplinary school. In our native
	  <lb/>country we had never known trials, or adversity; and
	  <lb/>though we had, I trust, endeavoured to count the cost,
	  <lb/>and expected a frequent cloudy sky in our missionary

<mw type="pageNum">8</mw>	
	  <lb/>atmosphere, it was our prevailing hope, that our sun
	  <lb/>would still shine bright.</p>
        <p>And now, my dear Sir, I need make no apology for
	  <lb/>detailing circumstances relating to the government of
	  <lb/>the <orgName>Honourable East India Company</orgName>. You well know
	  <lb/>the prejudices which existed, relative to this subject,
	  <lb/>before the renewal of the charter in <date when="1813">1813</date>. We arrived
	  <lb/>in <placeName>Calcutta</placeName> during the administration of <persName>Lord Minto</persName>.
	  <lb/>A few days after our landing, we received orders to
	  <lb/>return immediately to <placeName>America</placeName>, in the same ship in
	  <lb/>which we came; and our captain was refused a port-
	  <lb/>clearance, unless he would enter into an enagagement
	  <lb/>to take us back. This was an occurrence we did not
	  <lb/>expect, and was aimed at the foundation of our dearest
	  <lb/>hopes. Our friends in <placeName>Calcutta</placeName> informed us that there
	  <lb/>was no method of evading this order, unless we could
	  <lb/>obtain permission to go some place not under the
	  <lb/><orgName>Honourable Company's</orgName> government. It was then our
	  <lb/>wish to go to the <placeName>Burman empire</placeName>; but the existing
	  <lb/>difficulties between the English and Burman govern­
	  <lb/>ments, rendered the attempt presumptuous. We ac­
	  <lb/>cordingly made application for permission to go to the
	  <lb/><placeName>Isle of France</placeName>, which was readily granted. One vessel
	  <lb/>only was on the point of sailing, and she could accom­
	  <lb/>modate but two passengers. The situation of my
	  <lb/>friend, <persName>Mrs. Newell</persName>, rendered it necessary that she
	  <lb/>should arrive at some home as early as possible.  <persName>Mr.</persName>
	  <lb/>and <persName>Mrs. Newell</persName>, therefore, embraced the opportunity
	    <lb/>this ship presented.</p>
        <p>We were detained in <placeName>Calcutta</placeName> two months longer.
	  <lb/>The government noticing our continuance, supposed,
	  <lb/>probably, that we intended remaining in <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, and
	  <lb/>issued a most peremptory order for our being sent

<pb n="9"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">9</mw>	
	  <lb/>immediately on board one of the <orgName>Honourable Com­
	    <lb/>pany's</orgName> vessels, bound to <placeName>England</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Rice</persName> had, in
	  <lb/>the mean time, joined us. A petty officer accompanied
	  <lb/>Messrs. <persName>Rice</persName> and <persName>Judson</persName> to their place of residence,
	  <lb/>and requested them not to leave it without permis­
	  <lb/>sion. We saw our names inserted in the public 
	  <lb/>papers, as passengers on board a certain ship, and
	  <lb/>now there appeared very little hope of our escape.
	  <lb/><name>Mr. Rice</name> and <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>, however, soon ascertained
	  <lb/>that a ship would sail for the <placeName>Isle of France</placeName> in two
	  <lb/>days. They applied for a pass from the chief magis­
	  <lb/>trate, but were refused.—They communicated to the
	  <lb/>captain of the ship their circumstances, and asked if
	  <lb/>he would venture to take them on board without a
	  <lb/>pass? He replied that he would be neutral; that
	  <lb/>there was his ship, and that they might do as they 
	  <lb/>pleased.</p>
        <p>With the assistance of the gentleman in whose
	  <lb/>house we were residing, we obtained coolies (porters)
	  <lb/>to convey our baggage, and, at twelve o'clock at
	  <lb/>night, we embarked, though the gates of the dock­
	  <lb/>yards were closed, and the opening of them, at that
	  <lb/>time of the night, was quite contrary to the regula­
	  <lb/>tions of the Company. The next morning the ship 
	  <lb/>sailed. She had proceeded down the river, for two
	  <lb/>days, when a government despatch arrived, forbidding 
	  <lb/>the pilot to go farther, as passengers were on board
	  <lb/>who had been ordered to <placeName>England</placeName>. It was one o'clock
	  <lb/>in the morning when this prohibition was received.
	  <lb/>and as the vessel had, providentially, anchored near
	  <lb/>the only English dwelling within several miles, we
	  <lb/>immediately went on shore.</p>
        <p>The next morning, the captain, though very kind
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">B5</mw>

<pb n="10"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">10</mw>
	  <lb/>and obliging, informed us, that his duty to his em­
	  <lb/>ployers and government, required that our baggage
	  <lb/>should be removed; and that we could proceed no
	  <lb/>farther. We were successful in procuring boats for
	  <lb/>our conveyance, word was returned to the governor
	  <lb/>that no such persons were on board, and the ship was
	  <lb/>allowed to go on her way.</p>
        <p>We knew not what course to take, feeling assured
	  <lb/>that, should we return to <placeName>Calcutta</placeName>, we should be sent
	  <lb/>to <placeName>England</placeName>, and, if we continued at the place in which
	  <lb/>we then were, we should certainly be discovered. We
	  <lb/>therefore went down the river as far as <placeName>Fultah</placeName>, about
	  <lb/>fifty miles from <placeName>Calcutta</placeName>, where we procured lodgings.
	  <lb/>Here we partook, in some measure, of the feelings of
	  <lb/>those who are every moment expecting a discovery;
	  <lb/>and, though we were conscious of having done our
	  <lb/>duty, in thus refusing to comply with the orders of
	  <lb/>government, we could not help feeling somewhat 
	  <lb/>alarmed at the arrival of every boat at the <placeName>Ghaut</placeName>,
	  <lb/>and the appearance of every new face. We had con­
	  <lb/>tinued in this situation four days, anxiously applying
	  <lb/>to every ship passing down the river, for admittance,
	  <lb/>to whatever port bound. We had given up all hope
	  <lb/>for escape, and thought we must return again to <placeName>Cal­
	  <lb/>cutta</placeName>, when a letter was handed to <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>, con­
	  <lb/>taining a pass to go on board the ship we had so lately
	  <lb/>left. We knew not who procured it, but our hearts 
	  <lb/>rejoiced, we thanked God, and took courage. The
	  <lb/>ship had been gone down the river four days, and
	  <lb/>was probably out at sea. It was then dark, and we
	  <lb/>were about seventy miles from <placeName>Saugar</placeName>, the place where
	  <lb/>the ship lay, if not gone to sea. But there was no 
	  <lb/>alternative. We went on board our boats, the boat­

<pb n="11"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">11</mw>
	  <lb/>men rowed hard all night and all the next day, at the
	  <lb/>close of which we had the inexpressible pleasure of
	  <lb/>discovering the ship safely anchored in <placeName>Saugar</placeName> roads,
	  <lb/>having been detained much longer than expected,
	  <lb/>from the circumstances that some of the <name>Lascars</name> had
	  <lb/>not arrived.</p>
        <p>These providential occurrences, my dear Sir, had
	  <lb/>such a tendency to strengthen our trust and confidence
	  <lb/>in God, that we now felt assured he had something for
	  <lb/>us to do, and that he would, in his own time and way,
	  <lb/>mark out our path before us. The precious moments
	  <lb/>we enjoyed, in sweet communion with God, more,
	  <lb/>far more, than compensated for our unexpected trials.</p>
        <p>We seriously thought of making an effort to esta­
	  <lb/>blish a mission on the island of <placeName>Madagascar</placeName>, thinking
	  <lb/>it was, perhaps, the design of Providence in sending
	  <lb/>us to the <placeName>Isle of France</placeName>, for that purpose. With these
	  <lb/>views we immediately commenced studying the French 
	  <lb/>language, continued it during our passage, and for
	  <lb/>some time after our arrival.</p>
        <p>The intelligence of the death of our beloved friend,
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Newell</persName>, was a shock we were not prepared to
	  <lb/>expect. On our voyage we had constantly anticipated
	  <lb/>the pleasure of again meeting our friends and
	  <lb/>early associates, <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Newell</persName>. It had scarcely
	  <lb/>entered our thoughts that either of them would be no
	  <lb/>more. But we were, by this solemn providence, taught
	  <lb/>a lesson we had been backward in learning, that our
	  <lb/>dearest plans might be defeated by the call of death!</p>
        <p>After our feelings had, in some measure, subsided,
	  <lb/>we made enquiries respecting <placeName>Madagascar</placeName>, but, finding
	  <lb/>it impossible there to establish a mission, our atten­
	  <lb/>tion was again turned to the East. <persName>Governor Farquhar</persName>

	  <lb/>had received orders from the supreme government in
	  <lb/><placeName>Bengal</placeName>, to <quote>have an eye on those American mis­
	  <lb/>sionaries</quote>. He, however, very kindly and politely 
	  <lb/>informed us that we were at liberty to go where we
	  <lb/>wished, so far as he was concerned, and we accord­
	  <lb/>ingly embraced the first opportunity which presented
	  <lb/>itself for our return to <placeName>India</placeName>.</p>
        <p>While at the <placeName>Isle of France</placeName> it was thought advisable,
	  <lb/>both by <persName>Mr. Rice</persName> and <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>, that the former
	  <lb/>should return to <placeName>America</placeName>, and attempt establishing
	  <lb/>Foreign missionary societies among the <name>Baptists</name>.</p>
        <p>After three months' residence at the <placeName>Isle of France</placeName>,
	  <lb/>we embarked for <placeName>Madras</placeName>, at which place we arrived in
<lb/><date when="1813-06"><name>June</name>, 1813</date>. Here, again, we were assured of the
	  <lb/>hostile disposition of the <orgName>Honourable Company's</orgName> go­
	  <lb/>vernment towards missionary exertions, as manifested
	  <lb/>in a late attempt to send to <placeName>England</placeName> our former mis­
	  <lb/>sionary associates, the <persName>Rev. Messrs. Nott</persName> and <persName>Hall</persName>,
	  <lb/>who had proceeded to <placeName xml:id="a01" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n01">Bombay</placeName>.</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Judson's</persName> first object, therefore, was to ascertain
	  <lb/>what ships were lying in the <placeName>Madras</placeName> roads, and he
	  <lb/>found the only one which would sail, previously to in­
	  <lb/>formation being given to the Supreme government in

	  <lb/>A mission to the <placeName>Burman empire</placeName>, desirable as it was,
	  <lb/>we had been in the habit of viewing with a kind of 
	  <lb/>horror, and, though dissuaded from the attempt by
	  <lb/>our friends at <placeName>Madras</placeName>, we now saw the hand of Pro­
	  <lb/>vidence pointing to that region, as the scene of our future labours.</p>

        <p>
          <quote>My heart often sinks within me, when I think of
	    <lb/>living among a people whose tender mercies are cruel.
	    <lb/>But, when I reflect upon their miserable state, as desti­
	    <lb/>tute of the Gospel, and that it is easy for our heavenly
	    <lb/>Father to protect us in the midst of danger, I feel
	    <lb/>willing to go, and live and die among them; and it is
	    <lb/>our daily prayer that it may please God to enable us to
	    <lb/>continue in that savage country. Farewell to the pri­
	    <lb/>vileges and conveniences of civilized life! Farewell to
	    <lb/>refined Christian society! We shall enjoy these com­
	    <lb/>forts no more; but <placeName>Burmah</placeName> will be a good place to
	    <lb/>grow in grace, to live near God, and be prepared to
	    <lb/>die. O, my dear parents and sisters, how little you
	    <lb/>know how to estimate your enjoyments, in your quiet
	    <lb/>homes, with all the comforts of life! How little you
	    <lb/>know how to prize dear Christian society, as you have
	    <lb/>never been deprived of it! How little you can realize 
	    <lb/>the toils and perplexities of traversing the ocean; and
	    <lb/>how little you can know of the solid comfort of trust­
	    <lb/>ing in God, when dangers stand threatening to devour!
	    <lb/>But these privations, these dangers and toils, and 
	    <lb/>these comforts, are ours, and we rejoice in them, and
	    <lb/>think it an inestimable privilege that our heavenly

	  <lb/>those articles which they considered necessary on our
	  <lb/>first arrival. Among other things, a valuable European 
	  <lb/>woman servant was provided. We sent her on board
	  <lb/>two days before we went ourselves. On the <date when="--06-22">22d of
<lb/><name>June</name></date> we embarked for <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. The ship was just
	    <lb/>getting under way, when the servant, above men­
	    <lb/>tioned, fell on the floor, apparently in a fit, but all our
	    <lb/>endeavours to recover her were ineffectual, for she
	    <lb/>never breathed more. It was too late to supply
	    <lb/>her place, and we were obliged to proceed without an
	    <lb/>attendant. I was immediately taken dangerously ill,
	    <lb/>and thought, indeed, that the time of my departure
	    <lb/>was at hand, and that all my toils and perplexities were
	    <lb/>at an end. But a particular account of our dangerous
	    <lb/>voyage, and the gloomy prospects on our first arrival
	    <lb/>in <placeName>Burmah</placeName>, is given in a letter from <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> to the
<lb/><lb/><orgName>Board of Missions</orgName>.—<quote rend="post()">We commended ourselves to
	    <lb/>the care of God, and embarked in a crazy old vessel,

<pb n="15"/>

<mw type="pageNum">15</mw>
	   <lb/>manned entirely by native sailors, the captain being
	    <lb/>the only person on board that could speak our lan­
	    <lb/>guage, and we had no other apartment than what was 
	    <lb/>made by canvass. Our passage was very tedious.
	    <lb/><persName>Mrs. Judson</persName> was taken dangerously ill, and continued 
	    <lb/>so, until, at one period, I came to experience the aw­
	    <lb/>ful sensation, which necessarily resulted from the ex­
	    <lb/>pectation of an immediate separation from her, who
	    <lb/>was the only remaining companion in my wanderings.
	    <lb/>About the same time, the captain being unable to
	    <lb/>make the <placeName>Carnicobar island</placeName>, where he intended taking
	    <lb/>a cargo of cocoa nuts, we were driven into a dangerous
	    <lb/>strait, between the <placeName>Little and Great Andamans</placeName>, two
	    <lb/>savage coasts, where the captain had never been
	    <lb/>before, and where, if we had been cast on shore, we
	    <lb/>should (according to all accounts) have been killed 
	    <lb/>and eaten by the natives. But, as one evil is some­
	    <lb/>times an antidote to another, so it happened with us.
	    <lb/>Our being driven into this dangerous, but quiet chan­
	    <lb/>nel, brought immediate relief to the agitated and ex­
	    <lb/>hausted frame of <persName>Mrs. Judson</persName>, and conduced essentially
	    <lb/>to her recovery. And, in the event, we were safely 
	    <lb/>conducted over the black rocks, which we sometimes
	    <lb/>saw in the gulf below; and, on the eastern side of
	    <lb/>the island, found favourable winds, which gently wafted
	    <lb/>us forward to <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. But, on our arrival here,
	    <lb/>other trials awaited us.</quote></p>

          <quote>We had never before seen a place where European

	    <lb/>and cheerless, and unpromising did all things appear,
	    <lb/>that the evening of that day, after my return to the
	    <lb/>ship, we have marked as the most gloomy and dis­
	    <lb/>tressing that we ever passed. Such were our weak­
	    <lb/>nesses, that we felt we had no portion here below,
	    <lb/>and found consolation only in looking beyond our
	    <lb/>pilgrimage, which we tried to flatter ourselves would
	    <lb/>be short, to that peaceful region, where the wicked
	    <lb/>cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. But
	    <lb/>if ever we commended ourselves, sincerely and with­
	    <lb/>out reserve, to the disposal of our heavenly Father, it
	    <lb/>was on this evening. And, after some recollections
	    <lb/>and prayer, we experienced something of the presence 
	    <lb/>of Him who cleaveth closer than a brother; some­
	    <lb/>thing of that peace which our Saviour bequeathed
	    <lb/>to his followers—a legacy, which we know, from
	    <lb/>this experience, endures when the fleeting plea­
	    <lb/>sures and unsubstantial riches of the world are passed
	    <lb/>away. The next day <persName>Mrs. Judson</persName> was carried into the
	    <lb/>town, being unable to walk, and we found a home at
	    <lb/>the mission house erected by <persName>Mr. Chater</persName>. We soon
	    <lb/>began to find that it was in our hearts to live and die
	    <lb/>with the <name>Burmans</name>. We gradually became reconciled
	    <lb/>to the place, and from a conviction of the superior 
	    <lb/>importance of this to any unoccupied station, and a
	    <lb/>hope that, notwithstanding the frightful accounts we
	    <lb/>had received, we should find it practicable to remain,
	    <lb/>we were induced to pitch our tent. We applied very
	    <lb/>soon to the study of the language, and in this we
	    <lb/>have been closely engaged to the present time, so far
	    <lb/>as <persName>Mrs. Judson's</persName> health, and my numerous interrup­
	    <lb/>tions have permitted.</quote>

        <p>We now, my dear Sir, felt ourselves, in every sense

	  <lb/>of the word, on heathen ground. Not an individual
	  <lb/>of any description with whom we could unite in social
	  <lb/>prayer. We were surrounded by despotism, avarice,
	  <lb/>and cruelty; and the darkness, the dreadful moral
	  <lb/>darkness, of heathen idolatry, was evident, wherever
	  <lb/>we turned our eyes. Our tongues could not perform
	  <lb/>their office, for the language of the <name>Burmans</name> was then
	  <lb/>to us a perfect jargon, and no animating prospect of
	  <lb/>speedily overcoming this difficulty cheered the gloomy
	  <lb/>scene. Yet our heavenly Father suffered us not to
	  <lb/>despond. He compelled us to feel the full force of
	  <lb/>those precious promises, relative to the conversion of
	  <lb/>the heathen, which encourged us to look forward
	  <lb/>with a degree of hope, which has since astonished 
	  <lb/>ourselves. We found the language extremely difficult,
	  <lb/>and we had no teacher who understood both the
	  <lb/>English and Burman languages. Our only mode of
	  <lb/>ascertaining the names of the objects which met our
	  <lb/>eye, was by pointing to them, in the presence of our
	  <lb/>teacher, who would immediately speak the names in
	  <lb/><name>Burman</name>; we then expressed them as nearly as pos­
	  <lb/>sible by the Roman character, till we had sufficiently
	  <lb/>acquired the power of the <name>Burman</name>.</p>
        <p>As the state of the mission, from the period above­

	    <lb/>gone to <placeName>Ava</placeName>, having received an order to vaccinate
	    <lb/>some of the members of the royal family. <persName>Mrs. Carey</persName>
	    <lb/>is a native of the country, though of European ex­
	    <lb/>traction. She has the entire charge of the family,
	    <lb/>being familiar with the language, which enables her 
	    <lb/>to give directions to the servants. This circumstance
	    <lb/>relieves me from every concern of this nature, so
	    <lb/>that I devote my whole time to the study of the 
	    <lb/>language, which we find very difficult; but, with
	    <lb/>diligence and perseverance, I doubt not we shall
	    <lb/>be able to read, write, and speak it, in a few years,
	    <lb/>with ease.</p>
                <p>Our teacher is a good-natured, intelligent man.
	    <lb/>Although it is contrary to the <mcr>cast</mcr> of a <name>Hindoo</name>, he
	      <lb/>sits in a chair by us, and will eat with us. When he
	      <lb/>first came, he was not very willing to instruct me,
	      <lb/>appearing to feel that it was rather beneath him to in­
	      <lb/>stuct a female, as the females here are held in the
	      <lb/>lowest estimation. But when he saw I was deter­
	      <lb/>mined to persevere, and that <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> was as de­
	      <lb/>sirous that he should instruct me as himself, he was
              <lb/>more attentive.</p>
                <p>As it respects our food, we get along much better
	    <lb/>than we expected. We have no bread, butter, cheese,
	    <lb/>potatoes, or scarcely any thing to which we have been
	    <lb/>accustomed. Our principle food is rice and curried
	    <lb/>fowl, and fowls stewed with cucumbers. But, instead
	    <lb/>of murmuring that we have no more of the comforts
	    <lb/>of life, we have great reason to be thankful that we
	    <lb/>have so many.</p>
                <p>There are no English families in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, and
	    <lb/>there is not a female in all <placeName>Burmah</placeName> with whom I can

	    <lb/>appearance, every where covered with vegetation
	    <lb/>and, if cultivated, would be one of the finest in the
	    <lb/>world. But the poor natives have little inducement 
	    <lb/>to labour, or to accumulate property, as it would, pro­
	    <lb/>bably, be taken from them by their oppressive rulers.—
	    <lb/>Many of them live on leaves and vegetables, which
	    <lb/>grow spontaneously, and some actually die with
	    <lb/>hunger. At the present time there is quite a famine.
	    <lb/>Every article of provision is extremely high; there­
	    <lb/>fore many are induced to steal whatever comes in their
	    <lb/>way. There are constant robberies and murders com­
	    <lb/>mitted. Scarcely a night passes, but houses are
	    <lb/>broken open, and things are stolen; but our trust and
	    <lb/>confidence are in our heavenly Father, who can easily
	    <lb/>preserve and protect us, though a host should encamp
	    <lb/>about us. I think God has taught us, by experience,
	    <lb/>what it is to trust in him, and to find comfort and 
	    <lb/>peace in feeling that he is every where present. O,

                <p>We are still going on in the language, though our

	    <lb/>means by which we can communicate religions truths
	    <lb/>to this perishing people.</p>
                <p>From our first embarking for <placeName>India</placeName>, we have had
	    <lb/>our eye on this empire, as a final residence; but we
	    <lb/>have been repeatedly discouraged by the dreadful ac­
	    <lb/>counts we have had of the ferocity and barbarity of
	    <lb/>the natives, together with the many privations we must
	    <lb/>suffer among entire heathens. Several missionaries
	    <lb/>have made an attempt to reside here, but have been
	    <lb/>discouraged, and left the place, without effecting any
	    <lb/>thing. And some of these missionaries, we had reason
	    <lb/>to think, possessed much more piety and devotedness
	    <lb/>to missions than ourselves. No wonder, then, that
	    <lb/>we were discouraged. But, after our heavenly Father
	    <lb/>had severely tried us, in causing us to be driven from
	    <lb/>place to place; he shut up every door, and made us
		  <lb/>feel willing <quote>to take our lives in our hands</quote>, and to
	    <lb/>come to this heathen land, to spend the remainder of
	    <lb/>our days.</p>
                <p>But, will you believe me, when I say we are
	    <lb/>cheerful and happy? though we find the government 
	    <lb/>and people just as we expected; though we find our­
	    <lb/>selves almost destitute of all those sources of enjoy­
	    <lb/>ment to which we have been accustomed, and are in
	    <lb/>the midst of a people, who, at present, are almost
	    <lb/>desperate, on account of the scarcity of provisions;
	    <lb/>though we are exposed to robbers by night, and in­
	    <lb/>vaders by day, yet we both unite in saying we never
	    <lb/>were happier, never more contented in any situation,
	    <lb/>than the present. We feel that this is the post to
	    <lb/>which God hath appointed us; that we are in the 
	    <lb/>path of duty; and in a situation, which, of all others,
	    <lb/>presents the most extensive field for usefulness. And,

<pb n="21"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B11r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">21</mw>
	    <lb/>though we are surrounded with danger and death, we
	    <lb/>feel that God can, with infinite ease, preserve and sup­
	    <lb/>port us under the most heavy sufferings. But, for
	    <lb/>these feelings, we are indebted wholly to the free, rich,
	    <lb/>and sovereign grace of our Redeemer, and are still
	    <lb/>dependent on him for a continuance of them; for it
	    <lb/>is not three months since we looked at this situation,
	    <lb/>with all that dread and horror which you can imagine.
	    <lb/>It is our daily prayer, that we may be continued here,
	    <lb/>and be made a blessing to the poor <name>Burmans</name>, who
	    <lb/>are perishing for lack of knowledge.</p>
                <p>But we mourn our unfitness to be engaged in the
	    <lb/>great work of communicating religious knowledge to
	    <lb/>the dark and benighted mind of a heathen. Our only
	    <lb/>hope is in God. We know that he can bless his own
	    <lb/>truth to the salvation of sinners, though it may be 
	    <lb/>communicated in ever so broken a manner; and by the
	    <lb/>meanest of creatures. We rejoice that this great,
	    <lb/>this powerful God, is our father and our friend, and
	    <lb/>has opened a way of access for us sinners, and has
	    <lb/>commanded us to open our mouths wide, with the pro­
	    <lb/>mise that he will fill them. He hath also said, he
	    <lb/><quote>will give the heathen to his Son, for an inheritance,
	      <lb/>and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession.</quote></p>
                <p>We cannot but hope the glorious day is drawing
	    <lb/>near, when the promise will be fulfilled; and that
	    <lb/>among other heathen nations, <placeName>Burmah</placeName>, cruel, ava­

		<lb/>ver pipe in her mouth, smoking. At her appearance,
		<lb/>all the other wives took their seats at a respectful dis­
		<lb/>tance, and sat in a crouching posture, without speak­
		<lb/>ing. She received me very politely, took me by the 
		<lb/>hand, seated me upon a mat, and herself by me. She
		<lb/>excused herself for not coming in sooner, saying she
		<lb/>was unwell. One of the women brought her a bunch
		<lb/>of flowers, of which she took several and ornamented

	    <lb/>very near the one we had just left, and, after stab­
	    <lb/>bing the owner, robbed the house of every thing they
	    <lb/>could find. The robbers were armed with large knives,
	    <lb/>spears, and guns, which put all the people around in
	    <lb/>such fear, that none dared to go to the assistance of

                <p>This evening <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> and myself went to see
	    <lb/>the person who was stabbed. We found him lying on

<pb n="31"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">31</mw>
	    <lb/>viceroy asked me if I knew how to dance in the Eng­
	    <lb/>glish way? I told her it was not proper for the
	    <lb/>wives of priests to dance. She immediately assented,
	    <lb/>and thought that a sufficient reason for my declining.
	    <lb/>She then asked what kind of teacher <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>
	    <lb/>was? I told her, speaking in their idiom, that he was
	    <lb/>a sacred teacher, that is, a teacher of the will of the
	    <lb/>true God.</p>
                <p>The <name>Burmans</name> have a very great regard for their
	    <lb/>priests. They consider them a higher order of beings
	    <lb/>than other men. This was the cause of the marked
	    <lb/>attention we received from her ladyship. I wish I
	    <lb/>could write you something about the conversion of the
	    <lb/><name>Burmans</name>, or their eagerness to hear the word of God.</p>
                <p>No missionary has ever attempted to preach
	    <lb/>among the natives, so that we are hardly able to judge 
	    <lb/>how the gospel would be received, if publicly preach­
	    <lb/>ed. Yet their firm belief of the divine origin of their
	    <lb/>religion, renders it improbable, to human appearance,
	    <lb/>that they would willingly receive the gospel.</p>
                <p>We often converse with our teachers and servants
	    <lb/>on the subject of our coming to this country, and tell
	    <lb/>them, if they die in their present state, they will
	    <lb/>surely be lost. But they say <quote>Our religion is good
	      <lb/>for us, yours for you</quote>. But we are far from being
	    <lb/>discouraged. We are sensible that the hearts of the
	    <lb/>heathen, as well as those of <name>Christians</name>, are in the hands 
	    <lb/>of God, and in his own time he will turn them unto 
	    <lb/>himself.</p>
                <p>Much wisdom and precaution are necessary in our
	    <lb/>present situation. A little departure from prudence
	    <lb/>might at once destroy the mission. We still feel

	    <lb/>that we undertook this mission.</p>
                <p>This climate is one of the most healthy in the

	  <lb/>I ought, under some circumstances, to make an
	  <lb/>apology for saying so much about our personal con­
	  <lb/>cerns; but, when I recollect how frequently you
	  <lb/>urged me to be particular in my relation, and to send
	  <lb/>you every thing that had ever been printed, I feel 
	  <lb/>that an excuse of any kind is unnecessary.</p>
        <p>A letter written about this time to <persName>Mr. Newell</persName> our
	  <lb/>former associate, is a continued description of our
	  <lb/>plans and prospects:</p>

          <p>A few days since we welcomed yours of <date when="--12-18"><name>December</name><lb/>18th</date>, the only one we have recived since you left us,
	      <lb/>at <placeName>Port Louis</placeName>. It brought fresh to my mind a re­
	      <lb/>collection of scenes formerly enjoyed in our dear 
	      <lb/>native country. Well do I remember our first 
	      <lb/>interesting conversations on missions, and on the
	      <lb/>probable events that awaited us in <placeName>India</placeName>. Those 
	    <lb/>were happy days. <persName>Newell</persName> and <persName>Judson</persName>, <persName>Harriet</persName> and
	    <lb/><persName>Ann</persName>, then were united in the strictest friendship—
	      <lb/>then anticipated spending their lives together, in
	      <lb/>sharing the trials and toils, the pleasures and enjoy­
	      <lb/>ments, of a missionary life. But, alas! behold us
	      <lb/>now! In the <placeName>Isle of France</placeName>, solitary and alone, lies all
	      <lb/>that was once visible of the lovely <persName>Harriet</persName>. A melan­
	      <lb/>choly wanderer, in the <placeName>Island of Ceylon</placeName>, is brother 
	      <lb/><persName>Newell</persName>; and the savage, heathen empire of <placeName>Burmah</placeName>,
	      <lb/>is destined to be the future residence of <persName>Judson</persName> and
	    <lb/><persName>Ann</persName>! But is this seperation to be for ever? shall we
	      <lb/>four never again enjoy social, happy intercourse? Yes,

	    <lb/>There is a rest, a peaceful, happy rest, where <persName>Jesus</persName>

<lb/>idea of our situation here, and of our plans and
	    <lb/>prospects. We have found the country, as we
	    <lb/>expected, in a most deplorable state, full of darkness,
	    <lb/>idolatry, and cruelty,—full of commotion and un­
	    <lb/>certainty. We daily feel that the existence and per­
	    <lb/>petuity of this mission, still in an infant state, depend
	    <lb/>in a peculiar manner on the interposing hand of Pro­
	    <lb/>vidence, and, from this impres<choice><sic/><corr>s</corr></choice>ion alone, we are en­
	    <lb/>couraged still to remain. As it respects our temporal
	    <lb/>privations, use has made them familiar, and easy to be
	    <lb/>borne; they are of short duration, and, when brought
	    <lb/>in competition with the worth of immortal souls, sink
	    <lb/>into nothing. We have no society, no dear Christian
	    <lb/>friends; and, with the exception of two or three sea
	    <lb/>captains, who now and then call on us, we never see a
	    <lb/>European face. When we feel a disposition to sigh
	    <lb/>for the enjoyments of our native country, we turn to
	    <lb/>eyes on the miserable objects around. We behold
	    <lb/>some of them labouring hard for a scanty subsistence,
	    <lb/>oppressed by an avaricious government, which is ever
	    <lb/>ready to seize what industry has hardly earned; we
	    <lb/>behold others sick and diseased, daily begging the
	    <lb/>few grains of rice, which, when obtained, are scarcely
	    <lb/>sufficient to protract their wretched existence, and
	    <lb/>with no other habitation to cover them from the
	    <lb/>burning sun or chilly rains, than that which a small
	    <lb/>piece of cloth, raised on four bamboos, under the
	    <lb/>shade of a tree, can afford. While we behold these
	    <lb/>scenes, we feel that we have all the comforts, and, in
	    <lb/>comparison, even the luxuries of life. We feel that 
	    <lb/>our temporal cup of blessings is full, and runneth over.
	    <lb/>But is our temporal lot so much superior to theirs?
	    <lb/>O, how infinitely superior spiritual blessings!

	    <lb/>While they vainly imagine to purchase promotion, in
	    <lb/>another state of existence, by strictly worshipping their
	    <lb/>idols, and building pagodas; our hopes of future hap­
	    <lb/>piness are fixed on the Lamb of God, who taketh away
	    <lb/>the sin of the world. When we have a realizing sense
	    <lb/>of these things, my dear brother, we forget our native
	    <lb/>country and former enjoyments, and feel contented and
	    <lb/>happy with our lot, with but one wish remaining, that
	    <lb/>of being instrumental in leading these <name>Burmans</name> to
	    <lb/>partake of the same source of happiness with our­
	    <lb/>selves.</p>
          <p>Our progress in the language is slow, as it is
	    <lb/>peculiarly hard of acquisition. We can, however,
	    <lb/>read, write, and converse with tolerable ease; and
	    <lb/>frequently spend whole evenings very pleasantly in
	    <lb/>conversing with our Burman friends.— We have been
	    <lb/>very fortunate in procuring good instructors, <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Judson's</persName> teacher is a very learned man, was formerly
	    <lb/>a priest, and resided at court. He has a thorough
	    <lb/>knowledge of the grammatical construction of the
	    <lb/>language, likewise of the <name>Pali</name>, the learned language
	    <lb/>of the <name>Burmans</name>.</p>
          <p>We are very anxious to hear from our dearest bre­
	    <lb/>thren, <persName>Nott</persName> and <persName>Hall</persName>. We firmly believe they will yet
	    <lb/>be permitted to stay in <placeName>India</placeName>, notwithstanding their
	    <lb/>repeated difficulties. They have, indeed, had a trying
	    <lb/>time: but, perhaps, it is to prepare them for further
	    <lb/>usefulness.</p>
          <p>We have not yet received our letters from <placeName>America</placeName>,
	    <lb/>or had the least intelligence what were the contents
	    <lb/>of yours. Ours were sent to the <placeName>Isle of France</placeName> about
	    <lb/>the time we arrived in <placeName>Madras</placeName>, and the vessel which
	    <lb/>carried them has not been heard of since. You may

	    <lb/>easily judge of our feelings of disappointment.
	    <lb/>You can hardly form an idea of what eagerness we
	    <lb/>receive every scrap of intelligence from any part of
	    <lb/>the <name>Christian</name> world. Write us long and frequent let­
	    <lb/>ters. Any thing respecting yourself or the other
	    <lb/>brethren, will be interesting to us. I do not ask you
	    <lb/>to excuse this long letter, for I doubt not your interest 
	    <lb/>in our concerns.</p>

        <p>The above extracts will give you some idea of the
	  <lb/>state of the country, and of our mode of living, dur­
	  <lb/>ing the two first years of our residence in that heathen
	  <lb/>land. Yet we never felt a desponding sensation.
	  <lb/>Those providential occurrences, which directed us
	  <lb/>thither, were referred to, as a kind of assurance that
	  <lb/>we were in the path of duty; we were convinced that
	  <lb/>we had followed the leadings of Providence, and 
	  <lb/>doubted not, that by the time we were qualified to
	  <lb/>communicate religious truth, the present apparently
	  <lb/>insurmountable obstacles would be removed, and that
	  <lb/>some way would be opened for the establishment of
	  <lb/>the mission. A disciplinary school, however, was still
	  <lb/>open for our benefit.</p>
        <p>After the first six months of our residence in <placeName>Ran­
	  <lb/>goon</placeName>, my health had been on the decline, and as there
	  <lb/>was no medical aid in the country, <persName>Mr. J.</persName> felt the ne­
	  <lb/>cessity of my going to some foreign port for its resto­
	  <lb/>ration. Such was the state of our infant mission,
	  <lb/>that I could not consent that <persName>Mr. J.</persName> should accompany
<lb/>me. I therefore embarked in <date when="1814-01"><name>January</name>, 1814</date>, for <placeName>Mad
	  <lb/>ras</placeName>, at which place I entirely recovered, and returned
<lb/>in the <name>April</name> following. During my absence, <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>
	  <lb/>had no individual <name>Christian</name> with whom he could con­
	  <lb/>verse, or unite in prayer. He, however, pursued his

	  <lb/>great object, the acquiring of the language; and
	  <lb/>during this interval, was much encouraged by accounts
	  <lb/>from our dear native country, of the rapid increase of
	  <lb/>a missionary spirit.</p>
        <p>It would perhaps be unnecessary for me to mention
	  <lb/>the circumstances of our becoming <name>Baptists</name> on our
	  <lb/>passage out to <placeName>India</placeName>, were it not in connexion with
	  <lb/>the formation of the present <orgName>Baptist Board of Mis­
	  <lb/>sions</orgName>. A missionary impulse, before unknown, was
	  <lb/>given to the Baptist denomination throughout the 
	  <lb/><placeName>United States</placeName>, by the indefatigable exertions of <persName>Mr.
	  <lb/>Rice</persName>, and by the circumstance of there being a mis­
	  <lb/>sionary on heathen ground, of their own order, look­
	  <lb/>ing to them for encouragement and co<choice><sic>␣</sic><corr>-</corr></choice>operation.</p>
        <p>On the <date when="1814-05-18">18th of <name>May</name>, 1814</date>, a meeting of Baptist
	  <lb/>ministers, from most of the States, took place in <placeName>Phi­
	  <lb/>ladelphia</placeName>, for the purpose of forming a General Con­
	  <lb/>vention, in order to concentrate the energies, and direct
	  <lb/>the efforts of the denomination, in sending the
	  <lb/>gospel to the heathen.</p>
        <p>
          <quote>Perhaps no event (remarks one who was present)
	    <lb/>has ever taken place among the Baptist denomination
	    <lb/>in <placeName>America</placeName>, which has excited more lively interest,
	    <lb/>than the late missionary convention. It was, indeed,
	    <lb/>a sight no less novel than interesting, to behold bre­
	    <lb/>thren who had hitherto been personally unknown to
	    <lb/>each other, collecting from north to south, from <placeName>Mas­
	      <lb/>sachusetts</placeName> to <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, a distance of more than a thou­
	    <lb/>sand miles, for the important purpose of forming a
	    <lb/>General Convention.</quote>

        <p>How much encouragement <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>, in his soli­
	  <lb/>tary situation, derived from the above-mentioned event,
	  <lb/>may be seen from the following extracts from his

I am sometimes a little dispirited, when I reflect,

	    <lb/>preach the gospel to the people in their own tongue,

	    <lb/>ral years to acquire such a language, in order to con­
	    <lb/>verse, and write intelligently on the great truths of the

	    <lb/>they (as he was afterwards convinced) knew not what

	    <lb/>find that he has not counted the cost. If he should be
	    <lb/>so fortunate as to obtain a good interpreter, he may
	    <lb/>be useful by that means. But he will learn, especially
	    <lb/>if he is in a new place, where the way if not prepared, 
	    <lb/>and no previous ideas communicated, that to qualify
	    <lb/>himself to communicate divine truth intelligibly, by his
	    <lb/>voice or pen, is not the work of a year. However,

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">From</hi> our first embarking in the missionary enter­
	  <lb/>prise, afflictions and trials had ever  been intermixed
	  <lb/>with our most prosperous circumstances. But on this
	  <lb/>we had calculated; though we often found ourselves
	  <lb/>unprepared to meet trials in that way, which an un­
	  <lb/>erring Providence saw necessary. Our hopes, relative
	  <lb/>to the gradual progress and final success of the mission,
	  <lb/>were, until now, very sanguine; and we fondly trusted
	  <lb/>that whatever trials would have a tendency to retard or
	  <lb/>impede its advancement, would be averted. But not
	  <lb/>so. The gradual decline of <persName>Mr. Judson's</persName>  health, began
	  <lb/>to effect a revolution in our missionary plans, hopes, 
	  <lb/>and prospects. His anxiety to preach the unsearchable
	  <lb/>riches of Christ to the <name>Burmans,</name>  had induced him to 
	  <lb/>apply more closely to the study of the language  than
	  <lb/>an eastern climate would allow. This circumstance,  
	  <lb/>together with the want of exercise and proper diet,
	  <lb/>reduced him to an alarming state of debility and nerv­
	  <lb/>ous affection. The following letters will give you
	  <lb/>some idea of our situation at this time:</p>

	    <lb/>my pen to address you — must again tell you of
	    <lb/>trials and afflictions, which have, more or less, been
	    <lb/>our lot from our first engaging in the mission. <persName>Mr. 
	    <lb/>Judson</persName>, in consequence of too close application to
	    <lb/>study, during the hot season, has so far injured his
	    <lb/>head and nerves, that he is entirely unable to study, or
	    <lb/>attend to any thing. His illness has been gradually
	    <lb/>increasing for four months, and it is now three, since 
	    <lb/>he laid aside study altogether. For some time after 
	    <lb/>his eyes were affected, I read to him in <name>Burman</name>, and
	    <lb/>in this way he was enabled to continue his studies.
	    <lb/>But now the state of his nerves is such, that he cannot
	    <lb/>even hear me read. His digestive powers are so weak,
	    <lb/>that he is unable to take any nourishment, except rice
	    <lb/>and vegetables. We are seriously contemplating a voyage
	    <lb/>to <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, hoping that the sea air, or some medical
	    <lb/>assistance, may be beneficial. We cannot comprehend
	    <lb/>the design of Providence in these things. If we go
	    <lb/>to <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, the mission must, at least, for a time,  be	    
	    <lb/>given up, as there is no one to continue here. Whe­

	    <lb/>ther we shall ever be able to return, or not, is uncer­

	    <lb/>tain. We had fondly hoped that, by the time the lan­
	    <lb/>guage was acquired, a wide and effectual door would 
	    <lb/>be opened for the preaching of the gospel. But our
	    <lb/>hopes are blasted, and our brightest prospects dark­
	    <lb/>ened. And now, my dear parents, I think I hear you 
	    <lb/>say, <quote>Are you not discouraged yet? Is it not best
	    <lb/>entirely to abandon your object, and come home to	    
	    <lb/><placeName>America</placeName>, and settle down in peace and quiet?</quote>  No! 
	    <lb/>by no means. We will still intercede with our hea­ 
	    <lb/>venly Father, not only to return us to this mission, 
	    <lb/>but to make this affliction tend greatly to its advance­

	    <lb/>ment. Or, if we may not be permitted to return, we 
	    <lb/>will beg and plead with others to come, and go on 
	    <lb/>with the mission. We will tell them that it is possible 
	    <lb/>for the missionary families to live in <placeName>Burmah</placeName> without mo­ 
	    <lb/>lestation. We will tell them what our eyes have seen, ­ 
	    <lb/>and what our eyes have heard, of the dreadful delusions 
	    <lb/>of this people, and how much they need the commise­ 
	    <lb/>ration of the Christian world. We will do more. We  
	    <lb/>will return to <placeName>Burmah</placeName> with them, and spend the re­  
	    <lb/>mainder of our days, though deprived of health and 
	    <lb/>strength, in assisting them to acquire the language, 
	    <lb/>and encouraging them in their arduous work. No, 
	    <lb/>my dear parents, our hearts are fixed on this mission;  
	    <lb/>and, with grace assisting us, we shall relinquish it 
	    <lb/>only with our lives.</p>
                <p>
A few days after the death of our little boy, her 
	  <lb/>highness, the viceroy's wife, visited us, with a nume­  
	  <lb/>rous retinue. She really appeared to sympathize with 
	  <lb/>us in our affliction, and requested <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> not to 
	  <lb/>let it too much affect his health, which was already 
	  <lb/>very feeble. Some time after her visit, she invited us 
	  <lb/>to go out into the country with her, for the benefit of 
	  <lb/>our health, and that our minds, as she expressed it, 
	  <lb/>might become cool. We consented; and she sent us 
	  <lb/>an elephant, with a howdah upon it, for our convey­ 
	  <lb/>ance. We went three or four miles through the woods. 
	  <lb/>Sometimes the small trees were so near together, that
	  <lb/>our way was impassable, but by the elephant's breaking 
	  <lb/>them down, which he did with the greatest ease, at 
	  <lb/>the word of the driver. The scene was truly inter­ 
	  <lb/>esting. Picture to yourselves, my dear parents, thirty 
	  <lb/>men with spears and guns, and red caps on their heads, 
	  <lb/>which partly covered their shoulders, then a huge ele­

	  <lb/>phant caparisoned with a gilt howdah, which contained 
	  <lb/>a tall, genteel female, richly dressed in red and white 
	  <lb/>silk. We had the honour of riding next to her lady­  
	  <lb/>ship; after us, three or four elephants, with her son 
	  <lb/>and some of the members of government.  Two or 
	  <lb/>three hundred followers, male and female, concluded 
	  <lb/>the procession. Our ride terminated in the centre of  
	  <lb/>a beautiful garden of the viceroy's. I say beautiful,  
	  <lb/>because it was entirely the work of nature —; art had 
	  <lb/>no hand in it. It was full of a variety of fruit trees, 
	  <lb/>growing wild and luxuriant. The noble banyan formed 
	  <lb/>a delightful shade, under which our mats were spread, 
	  <lb/>and we seated ourselves to enjoy the scenery around 
	  <lb/>us. Nothing could exceed the endeavours of the 
	  <lb/>vice-reine to make our excursion agreeable. She ga­ 
	  <lb/>thered fruit, and pared it; culled flowers, and knotted 
	  <lb/>them, and presented them with her own hands; which 
	  <lb/>was a mark of her condescension. At dinner she had 
	  <lb/>her cloth spread by ours, nor did she refuse to partake 
	  <lb/>of whatever we presented her. We returned in the 
	  <lb/>evening, fatigued with riding on the elephant, delighted 
	  <lb/>with the country and hospitality of the <name>Burmans</name>, 
	  <lb/>and dejected and depressed with their superstition 
	  <lb/>and idolatry —; their darkness, and ignorance of the 
	  <lb/>true God.</p>
                <p>
Though we have never said any thing to the vice­ 
	  <lb/>roy's family on the subject of religion, yet they perceive
	  <lb/>a great difference between us and the other foreigners 
	  <lb/>who occasionally visit them. <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> seldom goes 
	  <lb/>to the government-house, as it is easier for me to have 
	  <lb/>access to her ladyship, than for him to do business 
	  <lb/>with the viceroy. She treats me with great familiarity; 
	  <lb/>but I am generally reserved and serious in her presence,

	  <lb/>yet manifest a tender concern for her welfare, with 
	  <lb/>which she is much pleased. I do not yet despair of 
	  <lb/>finding some opportunity to introduce the subject of 
	  <lb/>religion to her, in such a way as may not appear in­ 
	  <lb/>trusive or disgusting. Were I to appear before her in 
	  <lb/>the character of a teacher, she would think me far 
	  <lb/>beneath her notice, and perhaps forbid my approaching 
	  <lb/>her again: therefore, I think it most judicious to con­ 
	  <lb/>vince her, by my conduct, that I am really different 
	  <lb/>from other females who surround her, and so far to 
	  <lb/>gain her confidence and affection, that I can gradually 
	  <lb/>introduce the subject, without her perceiving my
	  <lb/>object.</p>

	    <lb/>but joy cometh in the morning.</quote> Yes, my dear parents,
	  <lb/>I can write of mercies, as well as afflictions. The 
	  <lb/>dark cloud, which hung over us, when I last wrote, is 
	  <lb/>dispersed; and the sun of prosperity, when more 
	  <lb/>brilliant by contrast, once more shines upon us. We 
	  <lb/>are still in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, and our prospects brighter than 
	  <lb/>ever. A few days after my last date, a pious captain 
	  <lb/>from <placeName>Bengal</placeName> offered us a passage to <placeName>Calcutta</placeName>. This 
	  <lb/>circumstance determined us on going, as <persName>Mr. Judson's</persName> 
	  <lb/>health continued to decline; and we made prepara­ 
	  <lb/>tions accordingly. The captain, who resided with us, 
	  <lb/>during his stay in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, suggested the  idea of <persName>Mr. 
	    <lb/>Judson's</persName> taking exercise on horseback every morning 
	  <lb/>with him, and for this purpose procured a horse. This 
	  <lb/>exercise was at first painful; but, by persevering in 
	  <lb/>it, and adopting a more generous diet, he found he 
	  <lb/>was not growing worse, as he had been for the three 
	  <lb/>last months. Still, however, his disorder appeared 
	  <lb/>obstinate, and urged the necessity of a voyage to sea.

	  <lb/>We had got every thing in readiness, even an order 
	  <lb/>from the viceroy, without which no female can leave 
	  <lb/>the country, when we received the joyful intelligence 
	  <lb/>that <persName>Mr. Hough</persName> and his family had arrived in <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, 
	  <lb/>and would soon join us at <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. I immediately 
	  <lb/>gave up the idea of going, though we still thought a 
	    <lb/>voyage necessary  for <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>. The vessel, how­  
	    <lb/>ever, in which we were to sail, was destined much 
	    <lb/>longer than we expected. During this time the dis­  
	    <lb/>tressing pain in <persName>Mr. Judson's</persName> head was less frequent, 
	    <lb/>and, by persevering in his course of exercise and 
	    <lb/>change of diet, we began to hope that he might be 
	    <lb/>restored to health, without going to sea, and we 
	    <lb/>therefore relinquished the voyage altogether. His 
	    <lb/>health is now much better, though he is not able to 
	    <lb/>study so closely as formerly.</p>
                <p>
	    The vice-reine has lately been called to <placeName>Ava</placeName>, but 
	    <lb/>the viceroy still remains. I regretted her going, on 
	    <lb/>several accounts. She had evidently become much 
	    <lb/>attached to me. I had an opportunity of trying the 
	    <lb/>sincerity of her friendship at the time we procured our 
	    <lb/>order for going to <placeName>Bengal</placeName>. I went to her with a pe­ 
	    <lb/>tition, which <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> had written, and, contrary to 
	    <lb/><placeName>Burman</placeName> custom, appeared without a present. She 
	    <lb/>was in an inner room, with the viceroy, when I pre­ 
	    <lb/>sented the petition; and, after hearing it read, she 
	    <lb/>said it should be granted. She called her secretary, 
	    <lb/>and directed him to write an official order, have it re­ 
	    <lb/>gularly passed through all the offices, and impressed 
	    <lb/>with the royal stamp. I was determined not to leave 
	    <lb/>her until I received the order, as it would be very dif­ 
	    <lb/>ficult to obtain it, unless delivered in her presence. It 
	    <lb/>was not long after the order was sent for the govern­

	    <lb/>ment-house, before one of her under officers came in, 
	    <lb/>and told me it would be a long time before my order 
	    <lb/>would pass through the several offices, and that I had 
	    <lb/>better return to my house, and he would bring it me. 
	    <lb/>The viceroy's wife asked me if that would answer my 
	    <lb/>purpose?  Being perfectly acquainted with the object 
	    <lb/>of the man, I replied, that I had had much anxiety on 
	    <lb/>account of this order, and, if it was her pleasure I 
	    <lb/>preferred waiting for it. She said it should be as I 
	    <lb/>wished, and ordered the man to expedite the business. 
	    <lb/>Being ill, she did not leave her room through the day, 
	    <lb/>and I had an opportunity of conversing much with 
	    <lb/>her. Among other things, she asked what was <persName>Mr. 
	    <lb/>Judson's</persName> object in coming to this country?  Before I 
	    <lb/>had time to answer, an elderly woman present, with 
	    <lb/>whom I had had considerable conversation on the sub­ 
	    <lb/>ject of religion, replied that <said><persName>Mr. Judson</persName> had come to 
	      <lb/>tell the <placeName>Burmans</placeName> of the true God,</said> &amp;c.; and went on 
	    <lb/>and related all that I had ever said to her. The vice­ 
	      <lb/>roy's  wife then asked me what was the difference be­ 
	    <lb/>tween the God I worshipped, and <persName>Gaudama</persName>?  I had 
	    <lb/>begun to tell her, when one of her people brought in 
	    <lb/>a bag of silver. After she had given orders respecting 
	    <lb/>the money, she wished me to proceed. I had but just 
	    <lb/>begun the second time, when two or three members 
	    <lb/>of government came in, and there it ended. My order 
	    <lb/>was delivered me towards evening; and then I made 
	    <lb/>her a present, expressed the obligations I was under, 
	    <lb/>and bid her good evening. When an order of this kind 
	    <lb/>is procured by the under officers, it costs about twenty­ 
	    <lb/> five dollars, besides much trouble and perplexity.</p>
                <p>My health is tolerably good, my time was never so	  
	    <lb/>completely occupied as at present, and I would not

	    <lb/>change situations with any person on earth. For a
	    <lb/>month or two past, I have been employed in writing a 
	    <lb/>little Catechism for children, in the Burman language.
	    <lb/>It is just completed, and I am teaching it to a few 
	    <lb/>children under my care who are learning to read.</p>
                <p>Thus, my dear parents, I have given you a general 
	    <lb/>account of our circumstances for several months. I 
	    <lb/>must now conclude, and prepare my letters to send to 
	    <lb/><placeName>Calcutta</placeName>, by the present opportunity. Rest assured 
	    <lb/>that this letter leaves us in more comfortable circum­ 
	    <lb/>stances than we have ever before enjoyed in this place. 
	    <lb/>But we need more grace, more humility, and more 
	    <lb/>devotedness to the cause of God. Do not let a day 
	    <lb/>pass without praying for us.</p>

	    <lb/>and eyes, which has prevented my making any advance 
	    <lb/>in the language, and, the greater part of the time, has 
	    <lb/>incapacitated me for even writing a letter. I had fully 
	    <lb/>made up my mind to take passage to <placeName>Bengal</placeName> with 
	    <lb/><persName>Captain Kidd</persName>, a pious man, who has been living with 
	    <lb/>us for the last two months, when the news reached us 
	    <lb/>that brother <persName>Hough</persName> had arrived in <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, and might 
	    <lb/>be expected here in a few weeks. I consequently con­ 
	    <lb/>cluded to wait, for the present, and take some future

	    <lb/>medical assistance, without which, I have for some 
	    <lb/>time feared I should never be able to apply myself 
	    <lb/>again to my studies. Within a few days, however, I 
	    <lb/>have felt more relief from the pain and distressing 
	    <lb/>weakness of my eyes, than I have known since I was

	    <lb/>first taken; and I begin to hope that measures I am 
	    <lb/>now pursuing will issue in my recovery, without a 
	    <lb/>sea voyage.</p>
                <p>

	  Since the <date when="1816-04-11">11th of last <name>April</name></date>, I have not been able 
	  <lb/>to read a page in a Burman book. During this period 
	  <lb/>I found that I could attend, with less pain, to the 
	  <lb/>compilation of a Burman grammar, than to any other 
	  <lb/>study. And this I was induced to persevere in, from 
	  <lb/>the hope that, if I was never again able to prosecute 
	  <lb/>the study of the language, the knowledge I had hi­ 
	  <lb/>therto acquired, would not be wholly lost to a suc­ 
	  <lb/>cessor. The grammar is now completed, and I fully 
	  <lb/>intended to forward you a copy by this conveyance; 
	  <lb/>but I find that, in my present state, it is impossible for 
	  <lb/>me to transcribe it. All that I can do at present, is to 
	  <lb/>send you a copy of a Burman tract, which has been 
	  <lb/>chiefly composed during the same period, and which I 
	  <lb/>accompany with an English translation. The Burman 
	  <lb/>original is pronounced by my teacher and others, not 
	  <lb/>only intelligible, but perspicuous; and to get this 
	  <lb/>printed was one object that I had in view in going to 
<lb/><placeName>Bengal</placeName>. <persName>Brother Hough</persName> has, however, just sent round 
		  <lb/>a press and types, which are now in the <placeName>Rangoon river</placeName>; 
	  <lb/>and as he expects to follow himself, the first opportu­ 
	  <lb/>nity, and, as I have heard, he understands the printing 
	  <lb/>business, I hope the time is not far distant when we 
	  <lb/>shall have a bit of bread to give to the starving, pe­ 
	  <lb/>rishing <name>Burmans</name> around us.</p>
                <p>

It will probably be impossible to keep the press 
	  <lb/>long in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. It will be ordered up to <placeName>Ava</placeName> as 
	  <lb/>soon as the news of such a curiosity reaches the king's 
	  <lb/>ears. Nor is this to be regretted; under the over­ 
	  <lb/>ruling providence of God, it may open a wide door to

	  <lb/>missionary exertions. Two of us would remove to 
	  <lb/><placeName>Ava</placeName>. But we could not subsist there, without an in­ 
	  <lb/>termediate station at <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. In this view of things, 
	  <lb/>it would be very desirable that another man should be 
	  <lb/>found to accompany brother <persName>Rice</persName>. If I should say 
	  <lb/>two men with brother <persName>Rice</persName>, as I wish to do, it might 
	  <lb/>appear inconsistent with something I wrote some time 
	  <lb/>ago. However, the press and a station at <placeName>Ava</placeName>, quite

	  <lb/>myself. And the more I think of it, the more I am 
	  <lb/>inclined to believe that it is the way in which the gos­ 
	  <lb/>pel is to be introduced into this empire.</p>

	  <lb/>to make an attempt on the Eastern side. As for 
	  <lb/>myself, I fear I shall prove only a pioneer, and do a 
	  <lb/>little in preparing the way for others. But, such as I

        <p>On the <date when="1816-10-15">15th <name>October</name>, 1816</date>, we had the happiness

	  <lb/>Board under whose patronage we then were. After a

	      <lb/>Hough</persName> has settled in one part of the mission house; 
	    <lb/>and we are now united, both as a church of Christ, 
	    <lb/>and as a mission society. Our regulations, on the lat­ 
	    <lb/>ter point, we here submit to the Board. It will be 
	    <lb/>evident, at first sight, that these regulations have a 
	    <lb/>prospective view, and are framed somewhat differently 
	    <lb/>from what they would have been, had we not expected 
	    <lb/>that our number would soon be enlarged. But we 
	    <lb/>hope the time is not far distant, when they will 
	    <lb/>receive the signatures of others also.</p>
                <p>

It is true that one of us remained about three 
	  <lb/>years in this place, without uttering any Macedonian 
	    <lb/>cries. But, we apprehend, that the time is now come, 
	    <lb/>when it is consistent with the strictest prudence to lift 
	    <lb/>up our voice, and say, Come over the ocean and 
	    <lb/>help us.</p>
                <p>

By a residence of three years in this country, 
	  <lb/>many doubts, which at first occurred, are removed; 
	  <lb/>and many points concerning the practicability of a 
	  <lb/>mission, and the prospect of success, are ascertained. 
	  <lb/>We cannot now enter much into detail; but we desire 
	  <lb/>to say, that we see the mission established in this land.
	  <lb/>We unite in opinion, that a wide door is set open for 
		<lb/>the introduction of the religion of <persName>Jesus</persName> into this 
	  <lb/>great empire. We have at present no governmental 
	  <lb/>interdict to encounter, and no greater obstacles than 
	  <lb/>such as oppose the progress of missionaries in every 
	  <lb/>heathen land. It appears to us (and may it so appear 
	  <lb/>to our fathers and brethren) that God, in removing 
	  <lb/>the English mission from this place, and substituting 
	  <lb/>in their stead an American mission, is emphatically 
	  <lb/>calling on the American churches to compassionate 
	  <lb/>the poor <name>Burmans</name>, and to send their silver, and their

      <lb/>gold, and their young men, to this eastern part of the 
      <lb/>world, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.</p>
                <p>It is with great pleasure that we announce the 
	<lb/>valuable present of a press and Burman types, made 
	<lb/>us by the Serampore brethren. We are now closing­ 
	<lb/>in a room, for a temporary printing office; and hope, 
	<lb/>very soon, to issue a gospel tract, which has been in 
	<lb/>readiness some time; and which is intended to give 
	<lb/>the heathen around us some idea of the way of salva­ 
	<lb/>tion through the Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>. But we cannot 
	<lb/>move one step in the way of printing without money. 
	<lb/>We therefore beg an immediate appropriation, not 
	<lb/>only to liquidate the expenses already incurred, but to 
	<lb/>enable us to proceed in this all-important part of our 
	<lb/>work. The accounts of the mission press, we propose 
	<lb/>to keep distinct; and they shall be transmitted, toge­ 
	<lb/>ther with the accounts of the mission.</p>
                <p>

We know not how long the press will be per­ 
	<lb/>mitted to remain in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>; we should not, how­ 
	<lb/>ever, deprecate its removal to <placeName>Ava</placeName>. Such a measure 
	<lb/>would, doubtless, tend to the furtherance of the cause, 
	<lb/>and the introduction of religion into the very heart of 
	<lb/>the empire, where <persName>Satan's</persName> seat is. But, in this case, 
	<lb/>more men, and more money, would be imperiously 
	<lb/>demanded; and, we trust, that the patronage of the 
	<lb/>Board will not fail in these necessary points. We 
	<lb/>desire, humbly, to repeat to the Board, what the first 
<lb/>missionaries from the <orgName>Baptist Society</orgName> in <placeName>England</placeName> said 
	<lb/>to their friends, when on the point of embarkation in 
	<lb/>the great work, which seems destined to illuminate 
	<lb/><placeName>Western India</placeName> with the light of the gospel: <said>We 
	  <lb/>are,</said> said they, <said>like men going down into a well;

	    <lb/>grace of God, to see <placeName>Eastern India</placeName> also beginning to 
	    <lb/>participate in the same glorious light. Many years 
	    <lb/>may intervene in the latter, as well as the former 
	    <lb/>case; many difficulties and disappointments may try 
	    <lb/>your faith and ours. But let patience have her perfect 
	    <lb/>work; let us not be weary of well doing; for, in due

	  A letter written by <persName>Mr. Hough</persName>, <date when="1817-02-20"><name>February</name> 20th, 
	    <lb/>1817</date>, contains some interesting particulars relative to 
	  <lb/>the mission; and also describes the Burman mode of 
	  <lb/>burying the priests:</p>
        <quote rend="bestow((pre(“))(p))post(”)">
          <p>

I could not, before I came here, form any idea 
	    <lb/>how my time would be occupied, after I should be­ 
	    <lb/>come engaged in the work for which I came hither; 
	    <lb/>and, therefore, made promises to write more, and 
	    <lb/>oftener, than I fear I shall be able to do. I often think 
	    <lb/>how happy I should be, could I step into your house, 
	    <lb/>or you into ours, and spend a few hours in telling you 
	    <lb/>all my mind; how I feel, and what I want to be done 
	    <lb/>for these poor <name>Burmans</name>. But while this pleasure is 
	    <lb/>denied me, there is a hope constantly administering to 
	    <lb/>my mind a sweet consolation, that we shall see each 
	    <lb/>other in a better <said>house not made with hands.</said>  Such 
	    <lb/>a hope as this I would not exchange for any considera­ 
	    <lb/>tion; no, not even for the felicity of meeting all my 
	    <lb/>friends again in this world. Since I have been here, 
	    <lb/>I have felt, in a good degree, assured that I am in the 
	    <lb/>path of duty. I am in a work with which my soul is 
	    <lb/>delighted. My spiritual enjoyments seem much to 
	    <lb/>have increased, and I am enabled to look forward, 
	    <lb/>with an increased confidence, to the end of this, and

	    <lb/>to another existence. I am not, however, free from a 
	    <lb/>state of uncertainty on the subject of my own salva­ 
	    <lb/>tion; yet, on self-examination, my heart appears to 
	    <lb/>have its hold on Divine truth strengthened; and, sur­ 
	    <lb/>rounded with objects of human kind, in a most lament­ 
	    <lb/>able state of religious debasement, it is impossible for 
	    <lb/>me not to esteem the precious gospel of the grace of 
	    <lb/>God, as the richest source of sacred consolation. I 
	    <lb/>can say truly, I had no idea of a state of heathenism 
	    <lb/>before I saw it. A warm-hearted <name>Christian</name> in <placeName>America</placeName> 
	    <lb/>would think that a poor miserable idolater would leap 
	    <lb/>for joy at the message of grace. But it is not so in 
	    <lb/><placeName>Burmah</placeName>—

          <p>The few with whom brother <persName>Judson</persName> has con­ 
	    <lb/>versed, since I have been here, appear inaccessible to 
	    <lb/>truth. They sit unaffected, and go away unimpressed 
	    <lb/>with what they have heard. They are unconvinced by 
	    <lb/>arguments, and unmoved by love; and the conver­ 
	    <lb/>sion of a <name>Burman</name>,  or even the excitement of a thought 
	    <lb/>towards the truth, must and will be a sovereign act of 
	    <lb/>Divine power. We long to see that act of power dis­ 
	    <lb/>played: even one instance would fill us with joy.</p>
          <p><persName>Brother Judson</persName> has never yet been abroad to 
	    <lb/>preach. He has applied himself constantly to the study 
	    <lb/>of the language, with a view to the translation of 
	    <lb/>the <rs type="title">New Testament</rs>. We both concur in the opinion, 
	    <lb/>that, before preaching be undertaken, to any consider­ 
	    <lb/>able degree, some portion of the Scriptures should be 
	    <lb/>in circulation.</p>
          <p>

	    The <name>Burmans</name>, when any thing is said to them on 
	    <lb/>the subject of divine truth, inquire for our holy books; 
<pb n="65"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D9r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">65</mw>

	    <lb/>and it is a pleasing fact, that scarcely a <name>Burman</name>, with 
	    <lb/>the exception of females, is capable of reading. 
	    <lb/>Besides, during the progress of translation, many the­ 
	    <lb/>ological terms, appropriate to the different branches 
	    <lb/>of doctrine, may be familiarly acquired, and their use 
	    <lb/>established; which, without much consideration, 
	    <lb/>might be erroneously employed, and thus wrong ideas 
	    <lb/>conveyed. Having, therefore, press and types here, 
	    <lb/>we cannot, conscientiously, withhold from this people 
	    <lb/>the precious oracles of God. This opinion has in­ 
	    <lb/>fluenced us to issue, as soon as preparations could 
	    <lb/>possibly be made, two small tracts — one a Summary 
	    <lb/>of Christian Doctrine, and the other a Catechism. 
	    <lb/>The one I was enabled to print the latter part of the 
	    <lb/>last, and the other the first of the present month — a 
	    <lb/>copy of each I send you. By them you will see how 
	    <lb/>much we need a new fount of types; many of the 
	    <lb/>letters are almost illegible. These two little tracts are 
	    <lb/>the first printing ever done in <placeName>Burmah</placeName>; and it is a 
	    <lb/>fact, grateful to every Christian feeling, that God has 
	    <lb/>reserved the introduction of this art here, for his own 
	    <lb/>use.</p>
          <p>

Having been hitherto employed for the most part 
	    <lb/>of the time in a printing-office, it has been impossible 
	    <lb/>for me to make those advances towards an attainment 
	    <lb/>of the language, that I have desired, and that other­ 
	    <lb/>wise would have been the case. While my progress 
	    <lb/>is necessarily slow in acquiring the language, I am 
	    <lb/>comforted under the reflection, that my employment 
	    <lb/>is of that kind which will rather assist, than retard my 
	    <lb/>advance, and that, without two or three year's study, I 
	    <lb/>can be instrumental in conveying the knowledge of 
	    <lb/>everlasting life to the <name>Burmans</name>. I am now thankful

	    <lb/>to say that <mcr>a priest dies</mcr>; his body was immediately 
	    <lb/>wrapped up in tar and wax; holes were perforated 
	    <lb/>through his feet, and some distance up the legs, into 
	    <lb/>which one end of a hollow bamboo was inserted, and 
	    <lb/>the other fixed in the ground; the body was then 
	    <lb/>pressed and squeezed, so that its fluids were forced 
	    <lb/>down through the legs, and conveyed off by means of 
	    <lb/>the bamboos; in this state of preservation the body

	    <lb/>and returned sorry that we had spent our time to so

	    <lb/>stage, or tower, about twelve or fifteen feet high, 
	    <lb/>ornamented with paintings of different colours and

	    <lb/>different hues, and the corpse, half of which was 
	    <lb/>visible above the edge of the coffin, entirely covered 
	    <lb/>with gold leaf. Around the tower and balcony were 
	    <lb/>fixed several bamboo poles, covered with red cloth,

	    <lb/>displaying red flags at their ends, and small umbrellas, 
	    <lb/>glittering with spangles; among which was one larger 
	    <lb/>than the others, covered with gold leaf, shading the 
	    <lb/>corpse from the sun. Around the upper part of the 
	    <lb/>balcony was suspended a curtain of white gauze, 
	    <lb/>about a cubit in width, the lower edge of which was 
	    <lb/>hung round with small pieces of isinglass; above the 
	    <lb/>whole was raised a lofty quadrangular pyramid, gra­ 
	    <lb/>duating into a spire, constructed in a light manner, of 
	    <lb/>split bamboo, covered with small figures, cut out of 
	    <lb/>white cloth, and waving to and fro, for some distance, 
	    <lb/>in the air. The whole, from the ground to the top of 
	    <lb/>the spire, might measure fifty feet. This curious 
	    <lb/>structure, with some <mcr>living</mcr> priests upon it, was drawn 
	    <lb/>half a mile by <mcr>women</mcr> and <mcr>boys</mcr>, delighted with the 
	    <lb/>sport, and in the midst of a large concourse of shout­ 
	    <lb/>ing and joyous spectators. On their arrival at the 
	    <lb/>place of burning, ropes were attached to the hind end 
	    <lb/>of the car, and a whimsical sham contest, by adverse 
	    <lb/>pulling, was for some time maintained, one party 
	    <lb/>seemingly indicating a reluctance to have the precious 
	    <lb/>corpse burned. At length, the foremost party pre­

	    <lb/>this, there were loud shoutings, clapping of hands, 
	    <lb/>the sound of drums, of tinkling and wind instruments, 
	    <lb/>and a most disgusting exhibition of female dancing, 
	    <lb/>but no weeping or wailing. The vehicle was taken 
	    <lb/>to pieces, the most valuable parts of which were 
	    <lb/>preserved, and the body consumed.</p>

	    Although the <name>Burmans</name> have every motive, ac­ 
	    <lb/>cording to their system of religion, to practise good 
	    <lb/>works, yet no people can be worse. Their religious 
	    <lb/>motives are wholly inadequate to the production of

	    <lb/>any good, or to maintain private and public morality. 
	    <lb/>It may be said of the <name>Burman</name>, as of every other pagan 
	    <lb/>religion, there is no power in it to make men better, 
	    <lb/>and its best precepts are no criterion, by which to 
	    <lb/>judge of the moral character of its devotees. The 
	    <lb/><name>Burmans</name> are subtle, thievish, mercenary, addicted to 
	    <lb/>robbery and fraud; truth and honesty are not known 
	    <lb/>among them as virtues. They are excessively prone 
	    <lb/>to gambling and sporting.</p>
                <p>

The government of the country is in the will of the 
	    <lb/>sovereign, who considers his subjects as slaves: in 
	    <lb/>short, every person coming into the country reports 
	    <lb/>himself <said>the king's most willing slave.</said>  The viceroy 
	    <lb/>of <placeName>Rangoon</placeName> acts with a power limited only by the 
	    <lb/>king. He punishes criminals with severity. The 
	    <lb/>mildest manner of suffering death is to have the head 
	    <lb/>taken off, which is done with a large knife, and at one 
	    <lb/>stroke. Reprieves from extreme desert, however, are 
	    <lb/>often purchased with money; but when a malefactor 
	    <lb/>is destitute of friends and money, he dies without 
	    <lb/>mercy.</p>

	    <lb/>them; their thighs and legs were then tied in their 
	    <lb/>natural position; they were ripped open from the 
	    <lb/>lowest to the highest extremity of the stomach, and 
	    <lb/>their vitals and part of their bowels were hanging out; 
	    <lb/>large gashes were cut in a downward direction on their 
	    <lb/>sides and thighs, so as to bare the ribs and thigh 
	    <lb/>bones: one, who I suppose was more guilty than the 
	    <lb/>rest, had an iron instrument thrust side-long through 
	    <lb/>the breast, and part of his vitals pushed out in the 
	    <lb/>opposite direction. Thus, with the under jaw fallen,

	    <lb/>men were carried to the place of execution. We went 
	    <lb/>to witness the affecting scene. On our arrival there, 
	    <lb/>we heard the report of a gun, and looking about, we 
	    <lb/>saw a man tied to a tree, and six others sitting on the 
	    <lb/>ground with their hands tied behind them. Observing 
	    <lb/>the man at the tree, we saw a circular figure painted 
	    <lb/>on his stomach, about three inches in diameter, for a 
	    <lb/>mark to shoot at, for he was to die in this way. At 
	    <lb/>that moment, there was another discharge of a 
	    <lb/>musket; but the shot again missed; a third and fourth 
	    <lb/>time he was fired at, but without effect. At every shot 
	    <lb/>there was a loud peal of laughter from the surrounding 
	    <lb/>spectators. He was then loosed from the tree, and a 
	    <lb/>messenger sent to the governor, who returned with a 
	    <lb/>reprieve. His younger brother, who was one of the 
	    <lb/>seven, was then tied to the tree. The first shot slightly 
	    <lb/>touched his arm; the second struck him in the heart, 
	    <lb/>and he instantly expired; at the same moment, the

	    <lb/>remaining five, each at one blow, were beheaded. We 
	    <lb/>saw a man put his foot on one of the trunks, and press 
	    <lb/>it with as little feeling as one would tread upon a 
	    <lb/>beast. Their bodies were then dragged along on the 
	    <lb/>ground a short distance, and their heads taken up by 
	    <lb/>the hair and removed. The two brothers, when con­ 
	    <lb/>demned to die, requested to be shot, asking, at the 
	    <lb/>same time, to be pardoned if the fourth shot should 
	    <lb/>miss. The elder brother was therefore spared, while 
	    <lb/>the fate of the other was more lamentable. The su­ 
	    <lb/>perstitious <name>Burmans</name> suppose, from the circumstance 
	    <lb/>of the request of the two brothers, and the escape of 
	    <lb/>the elder one, that some charm prevented his death. 
	    <lb/>The crimes of these poor creatures were various. One 
	    <lb/>had been digging under a pagoda, another had stabbed 
	    <lb/>a woman, but had not killed her; the others, as nearly 
	    <lb/>as we can learn, were robbers.</p>

	  <lb/>After which, finding we had paper sufficient for an 
		  <lb/>edition of eight hundred copies of <title><persName>St. Matthew</persName></title>, we 
	  <lb/>concluded to undertake this one gospel, by way of 
	  <lb/>trial, and as introductory to a larger edition of the 
	  <lb/>whole <rs type="title">New Testament</rs>. I am now translating the 
	  <lb/>eleventh chapter, and in the printing room the third 
	  <lb/>half sheet is setting up.</p>
                <p><lb/>Having premised thus much concerning the 
	  <lb/>present posture of our affairs, I proceed to mention 
	  <lb/>the circumstances which induced me to take up my
	  <lb/>pen at this time. I have this day been visited by the
	  <lb/><mcr>first</mcr> inquirer after religion, that I have seen in <placeName>Burmah</placeName>.
	  <lb/>For, although in the course of two years, I have 
	  <lb/>preached the gospel to many, and though some have 
	  <lb/>visited me several times, and conversed on the subject
	  <lb/>of religion; yet I have never had much reason to
	  <lb/>believe that their visits originated in a spirit of sincere
	  <lb/>inquiry. Conversations on religion have always been
	  <lb/>of my proposing; and though I have sometimes been 
	  <lb/>encouraged to hope that truth had made some im­
	  <lb/>pression, never, until to-day, have I met with one who
	  <lb/>was fairly entitled to the epithet of <mcr>Inquirer</mcr>.</p>
                <p><lb/>As I was sitting with my teacher, as usual, a <name>Bur­ 
	  <lb/>man</name> of respectable appearance, and followed by a 
	  <lb/>servant, came up to the steps, and sat down by me. I
	  <lb/>asked him the usual question, where he came from?
	  <lb/>to which he gave me no explicit reply; and I began
	  <lb/>to suspect that he had come from the government­
	  <lb/>house, to enforce a trifling request, which, in the 
	  <lb/>morning we had declined. He soon, however, unde­
	  <lb/>ceived and astonished me, by asking, <said>How long a 
		<lb/>time will it take me to learn the religion of <persName>Jesus</persName>?</said>
	  <lb/>I replied, that such a question could not be answered.

	<lb/>If God gave light and wisdom, the religion of <persName>Jesus</persName>
	  <lb/>was soon learnt, but without God, a man might study 
	  <lb/>all his life long, and make no proficiency. But how,
	<lb/>continued I, came you to know any thing of <persName>Jesus</persName>?
	  <lb/>Have you been here before?  <said>No.</said>  Have you seen
	<lb/>any writings concerning <persName>Jesus</persName>?  <said>I have seen two
	<lb/>little books.</said>  Who is <persName>Jesus</persName>?  <said>He is the Son of God,
	    <lb/>who, pitying creatures, came into this world, and suf­ 
	    <lb/>fered death in their stead.</said>  Who is God?  <said>He is a 
	    <lb/>Being without beginning or end, who is not subject 
	    <lb/>to old age or death, but always is.</said>  I cannot tell how
	  <lb/>I felt at this moment. This was the first acknowledge­ 
	  <lb/>ment of an eternal God, that I had ever heard from 
	  <lb/>the lips of a <name>Burman</name>. I handed him a tract and
	  <lb/>catechism, both of which he instantly recognised, and
	  <lb/>read here and there, making occasional remarks to his 
	  <lb/>follower, such as, <said>This is the true God — this is the 
	    <lb/>right way,</said> &amp;c. I now tried to tell him some things 
	  <lb/>about God and Christ, and himself; but he did not
	  <lb/>listen with much attention, and seemed anxious only 
	  <lb/>to get another book. I had already told him two or 
	  <lb/>three times that I had finished no other book; but,
	  <lb/>that in two or three months, I would give him a larger 
	  <lb/>one, which I was now daily employed in translating.</p>
                <p><lb/><said>But,</said> replied he, <said>have you not a little of that book
	    <lb/>done, which you will graciously give me now?</said>  And 
	  <lb/>I, beginning to think that God's time was better than
	  <lb/>man's, folded and gave him the first two half sheets, 
		  <lb/>which contain the first five chapters of <title><persName>St. Matthew</persName></title>;
	  <lb/>on which he instantly rose, as if his business was all
	  <lb/>done; and having received an invitation to come
	  <lb/>again, took leave. Throughout his short stay, he ap­ 
	  <lb/>peared different from any <name>Burman</name> I have met with.

	  <lb/>He asked no questions about customs and manners,
	  <lb/>with which the <name>Burmans</name> teaze us exceedingly. He
	  <lb/>had no curiosity, and no desire for any thing, but
	  <lb/><said>more of this sort of writing.</said>  In fine, his conduct
	  <lb/>proved that he had something on his mind, and I
	  <lb/>cannot but hope that I shall have to write about him

	  <lb/>appear to be the only countries which can, at present,

	  <lb/><name>British</name> are fully occupied with <placeName>India</placeName>, <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and the
	  <lb/><placeName>South Sea Islands</placeName>. East of the British possessions in

	  <lb/>nations, the great empire of <placeName>China</placeName>, <placeName>Japan</placeName>, thence
	  <lb/>north, indefinitely, and southward, the numerous
	  <lb/><placeName>Malayan Isles</placeName>. With all these countries the <name>British</name> are 
	  <lb/>no more connected than the <name>Americans</name>. The <name>British</name>
	  <lb/>are under no greater obligations to evangelize them
	  <lb/>than the <name>Americans</name>. They are not nearer the <name>English</name>,
	  <lb/>in point of transportation, than the <name>Americans</name>. And,
	  <lb/>furthermore, throughout all these countries, the <name>British</name>
	  <lb/>are suspected and feared, but not the <name>Americans</name>.</p>
                <p><lb/>The idea that the Western continent belongs to the
		  <lb/><name>Americans</name>, and the Eastern continent to the <name>British</name>,
	  <lb/>however plausible at first sight, cannot bear a mo­
	  <lb/>ment's examination. I apprehend, that all the north­ 
		  <lb/>western <name>Indians</name>, and the inhabitants of those parts of
	  <lb/><placeName>South America</placeName>, which are accessible, will scarcely out­ 
	  <lb/>number the inhabitants of this single Empire of <name>Bur­

	      <lb/>my anguish was mitigated, my tears were dried, by 
	      <lb/>the consideration  that I there left many congenial souls, 
	      <lb/>who, though prevented accompanying me, would assist 
	      <lb/>me by their prayers, encourage and animate me by 
	      <lb/>their letters, and keep alive the missionary spark in 
	      <lb/>my soul, by their constant assurances that I was not 
	      <lb/>alone, but at all times aided and supported by them.</p>
          <p>

It is now four years that we have resided in this 
	    <lb/>country; and, though no <name>Burman</name> has renounced idola­ 
	      <lb/>try and embraced the religion of Christ, yet the seed 
	      <lb/>is beginning to be scattered, which may spring up and 
	      <lb/>bear fruit in some future time. <placeName>Burmah</placeName> presents a 
	      <lb/>field for vast, unbounded usefulness! But neither 
	      <lb/>revelation, nor the experience of ages, warrants us to 
	      <lb/>expect immediate success. What nation has changed 
	      <lb/>its gods in a day?  What nation, so far advanced in 
	      <lb/>civilization as the Burman, has renounced its system 
	      <lb/>of religion at the first mention of a new one?  We 
	      <lb/>are not to look for miracles; but we are warranted to

<mw type="pageNum">77</mw>

	  <lb/>expect the accomplishment of those ends, which God,
	  <lb/>in his wise providence, has connected with a steady,
	  <lb/>persevering use of means. We are firmly persuaded
	  <lb/>that the country of <placeName>Burmah</placeName> will eventually become
	  <lb/>Christian — that the way is now preparing, the seed
	  <lb/>sowing; but how long before the harvest will be ripe,
	  <lb/>we leave for God to determine.</p>
          <p><lb/>It has been <persName>Mr. Judson's</persName> object to get well
	  <lb/>grounded in the language, and to do some preparatory
	  <lb/>work, for the benefit of future missionaries before he
	  <lb/>made a formal disclosure of his design to the king.
	  <lb/>We have not, by any means, taken pains to keep our
	  <lb/>object secret. On the contrary, we have improved
	  <lb/>every opportunity to communicate religious truth to
	  <lb/>those <name>Burmans</name> who have visited at the mission house.
	  <lb/>This we have considered as the path of present duty.</p>
          <p><lb/>Since <persName>Mr. Hough's</persName> arrival, he has printed a tract
	  <lb/>of considerable length, being a view of the Christian
	  <lb/>religion, which <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> had previously composed;
	  <lb/>and also a small catechism for children, and <persName>St. Mat­
	    <lb/>thew's</persName> gospel. These are in circulation, and are well
	  <lb/>understood by those who read them. Many have
	  <lb/>called at the mission house, to inquire more particu­ 
	  <lb/>larly into the <mcr>new religion</mcr>. But we have frequently
	  <lb/>observed, in these inquirers, a fear lest others should
	  <lb/>discover their inclination to inquire. Sometimes, when
	  <lb/>two or three intimate friends have been seriously
	  <lb/>engaged in conversing on religious subjects, if others,
	  <lb/>with whom they were not acquainted, called at the
	  <lb/>same time, they would be silent, and take their leave.
	  <lb/>This makes us feel the importance of trying to obtain
	  <lb/>the patronage of government. In a few months,
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Judson</persName> will complete a dictionary of the Burman
	    
<pb n="78"/>

<mw type="pageNum">78</mw>

	  <lb/>language; after which, he will, perhaps, go up to
	  <lb/><placeName>Ava</placeName>, the residence of the king.</p>
          <p><lb/>If we were convinced of the importance of mis­
	    <lb/>sions before we left our native country, we now <mcr>see</mcr>
	    <lb/>and <mcr>feel</mcr> their importance, as well as their practica­
	    <lb/>bility! We could then picture to ourselves the miser­
	    <lb/>able situation of heathen nations; but we now see a 
	    <lb/>whole populous empire, rational and immortal like
	    <lb/>ourselves, sunk in the grossest idolatry; given up to
	    <lb/>follow the wicked inclinations of their depraved hearts,
	    <lb/>entirely destitute of any real principle, or the least
	    <lb/>spark of true benevolence. Let those who plead the
	    <lb/>native innocence and purity of heathen nations, visit
	    <lb/><placeName>Burmah</placeName>. The system of religion here has no power
	    <lb/>over the heart, or restraint on the passions. Though
	    <lb/>it forbids, on pain of many years' suffering in hell,
	    <lb/>theft, and falsehood, yet I presume to say, there is not
	    <lb/>a single <name>Burman</name> in the country, who, if he had a good
	    <lb/>opportunity, without danger of detection, would hesi­ 
	    <lb/>tate to do either. Though the religion inculcates
	    <lb/>benevolence, tenderness, forgiveness of injuries, and 
	    <lb/>love of enemies — though it forbids sensuality, love of
	    <lb/>pleasure, and attachment to worldly objects, yet it is
	    <lb/>destitute of power to produce the former, or subdue
	    <lb/>the latter, in its votaries. In short, the Burman sys­
	    <lb/>tem of religion is like an alabaster image, perfect and
	    <lb/>beautiful in all its parts, but destitute of life. Besides
	    <lb/>being destitute of life, it provides no atonement for 
	    <lb/>sin. Here, also, the gospel triumphs over this and 
	    <lb/>every other religion in the world. This is the grand  
	    <lb/>difference — this makes the gospel <said>good news</said> in­ 
	    <lb/>deed, to the heavy laden and sin-sick soul.</p>
          <p>

	    My dear <persName>Mary</persName>, how precious does Christ appear,

	    <lb/>when conversing with these <name>Burmans</name>, and how de­
	    <lb/>sirous is one to open their blind eyes, that they may 
	    <lb/>behold his preciousness! But this is the prerogative 
	    <lb/>of God alone; and if he has any dear children here, 
	    <lb/>any chosen ones, whose names are written in the 
	    <lb/><said>Lamb's book of life, from the foundation of the
	    <lb/>world,</said> he will open their eyes, he will show them his
	    <lb/>glory, he will compel them to come in.</p>
          <p>

How interested you would be, could you meet 
	    <lb/>with my little society of females, on the <name>Sabbath</name>.
	    <lb/>Interested, I say —  yes, you would be interested, if it 
	    <lb/>were only from this circumstance, that these poor 
	    <lb/>idolaters enjoy the means of grace, and sit under the 
	    <lb/>sound of the gospel. I have generally fifteen or 
	    <lb/>twenty. They are attentive while I read the Scrip­
	    <lb/>tures, and endeavour to teach them about God. One 
	    <lb/>of them told me, the other day, that she could not 
	    <lb/>think of giving up a religion which her parents, 
	    <lb/>grand-parents, &amp;c. &amp;c. had embraced, and accepting 
	    <lb/>a new one of which they had never heard. I asked  
	    <lb/>her if she wished to go to hell, because her progeni­ 
	    <lb/>tors had gone there?  She replied, If, with all her  
	    <lb/>offerings and good works on her head, (speaking in 
	    <lb/>their idiom,) she must go to hell, then let her go. I
	    <lb/>told her, if she went to hell, after having heard of the 
	    <lb/>Saviour, her very relations would contribute to tor­ 
	    <lb/>ment and upbraid her, for her rejection of that Saviour 
	    <lb/>of whom they had never heard, and that even she her­ 
	    <lb/>self would regret her folly when it was too late. If 
	    <lb/>I do, said she, I will then cry out to you to be my 
	    <lb/>intercessor with your God, who will certainly not  
	    <lb/>refuse you. Another told me, that she <emph>did</emph> believe in 
	    <lb/>Christ, and prayed to him every day. I asked her if 
   
<pb n="80"/>

	    <lb/>she also believed in <persName>G<choice><sic>ua</sic><corr>au</corr></choice>dama</persName>, and prayed to him. She 
	    <lb/>replied, she worshipped them both. I have several 
	    <lb/>times had my hopes and expectations raised, by the 
	    <lb/>apparent seriousness of several females, as <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> 
	    <lb/>has in regard to several men; but their goodness has 
	    <lb/>been like the morning cloud and early dew, which soon 
	    <lb/>pass away. Four or five children have committed the 
	    <lb/>catechism to memory, and often repeat it to each other.</p>

Five years have passed away, since I took the last 
	      <lb/>view of my dear native land; since I bid the last 
		      <lb/>farewell to our little <placeName>Bradford</placeName> circle. But the parting 
	      <lb/>pangs are not forgotten; the wounds which were then  
	      <lb/>made, often, to this day, open and bleed afresh. I 
	      <lb/>now realize  what we so often anticipated, the trials 
	      <lb/>and privations, the pleasures and enjoyments, incident 
	      <lb/>to the wife of a missionary among the heathen.</p>
          <p>

I now behold with my eyes that idolatry, infatua­ 
	      <lb/>tion, and delusion, the very recital of which has so 
	      <lb/>often affected the hearts, and excited the fervent 
	      <lb/>prayers of our little society, when surrounding the 
	      <lb/>social altar for prayer and praise, in our native town. 
	      <lb/>And I must say, <quote>my eye affecteth my heart;</quote> for I 
	      <lb/>cannot but weep and mourn over the deluded multi­ 
	      <lb/>tude who are this day collected in immense crowds, to 
	      <lb/>offer that homage and adoration to an idol, which is 
	      <lb/>due to God alone.</p>
          <p>

	      This is the season for the great feast of <persName>Gaudama</persName>. 
	      <lb/>It commenced yesterday, and is to continue for three 
	      <lb/>days. It is observed all over the country; but I pre­ 
	      <lb/>sume the multitude collected in this place is much  

<pb n="81"/>

	      <lb/>greater than at any other, excepting <placeName>Ava</placeName>. Priests and 
	      <lb/>people come in boats, from a great distance, to worship 
	      <lb/>at the pagoda in this place, which is supposed to con­ 
	      <lb/>tain a relic of <placeName>Gaudama</placeName>. The viceroy, on these days, 
	      <lb/>goes out in all the pomp and splendour possible, 
	      <lb/>dressed and ornamented with all his insignia of office, 
	      <lb/>attended by the members of government and the com­ 
	      <lb/>mon people. After kneeling and worshipping at the 
	      <lb/>pagoda, they generally spend the day in amusements, 
	      <lb/>such as boxing, dancing, singing, theatrical exhibi­ 
	      <lb/>tions, and fire-works. Most of the older people spend 
	      <lb/>the night at the pagoda, and listen to the instructions 
	      <lb/>of the priests.</p>
          <p>

Great and expensive offerings are made at this 
	      <lb/>season. One last year, presented by a member of 
	      <lb/>government, cost three thousand ticals, or twelve 
	      <lb/>hundred dollars. It was a kind of portable pagoda, 
	      <lb/>made of bamboo and paper, richly ornamented with 
	      <lb/>gold leaf and paintings. It was a hundred feet in 
	      <lb/>height, and the circumference of its base about fifty. 
	      <lb/>Half way up its height, was a man ludicrously dressed, 
	      <lb/>with a mask on his face, white wings on his shoulders, 
	      <lb/>and artificial finger nails, two inches in length, in the 
	      <lb/>posture of dancing. This offering was carried by 
	      <lb/>sixty men, preceded by a band of music, and followed 
	      <lb/>by the officer who made it, and his suite. Other offer­ 
	      <lb/>ings presented at this festival are various kinds of arti­ 
	      <lb/>ficial trees, the branches and twigs of which are filled 
	      <lb/>with cups, bowls, handkerchiefs, and garments of all 
	      <lb/>descriptions; these are given to the slaves attached to 
	      <lb/>the pagoda, who, the week following, have something 
	      <lb/>like a fair to dispose of their offerings.</p>
          <p>

The pagoda, to which such multitudes resort, is

	      <lb/>one of the largest and most splendid in the empire. 
	      <lb/>To give an accurate description of this noble edifice, 
	      <lb/>requires an abler pen than mine; and perhaps a better 
	      <lb/>one, of its construction and dimensions, cannot be 
	      <lb/>given, than that which has already been presented to 
	      <lb/>the public by <persName>Colonel Symes</persName>, of a similar pagoda at 
	      <lb/><placeName>Pegue</placeName>. The beauty and variety of its appendages, 
	      <lb/>however, are far superior. After having ascended the 
	      <lb/>flight of steps, a large gate opens, when a wild, fairy  
	      <lb/>scene is abruptly presented to view. It resembles 
	      <lb/>more the descriptions we sometimes have in novels, of 
	      <lb/>enchanted castles, or ancient abbeys in ruins, than any 
	      <lb/>thing we ever meet in real life. The ground is com­ 
	      <lb/>pletely covered with a variety of ludicrous objects, 
	      <lb/>which meet the eye in every direction, interspersed 
	      <lb/>with the banyan, cocoa-nut and toddy trees. Here 
	      <lb/>and there are large open buildings, containing huge 
	      <lb/>images of <persName>Gaudama</persName>; some in a sitting, some in a 
	      <lb/>sleeping position, surrounded by images of priests and 
	      <lb/>attendants, in the act of worship, or listening to his 
	      <lb/>instructions. Before the image of <persName>Gaudama</persName>, are 
	      <lb/>erected small altars, on which offerings of fruit, 
	      <lb/>flowers, &amp;c. are laid. Large images of elephants, 
	      <lb/>lions, angels and demons, together with a number of 
	      <lb/>indescribable objects, assist in filling the picturesque 
	      <lb/>scene.</p>
          <p>

The ground on which this pagoda is situated, com­ 
	      <lb/>mands a view of the surrounding country, which pre­ 
	      <lb/>sents one of the most beautiful landscapes in nature. 
	      <lb/>The polished spires of the pagodas, glistening among 
	      <lb/>the trees at a distance, appear like the steeples of 
	      <lb/>meeting-houses in our American sea-ports. The ver­ 
	      <lb/>dant appearance of the country, the hills and valleys,

	      <lb/>ponds and rivers, the banks of which are covered with 
	      <lb/>cattle, and fields of rice; each, in their turn, attract 
	      <lb/>the eye, and cause the beholder to exclaim, <quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Was this

	      <lb/>O, my friend! scenes like these, productive of feelings 
	      <lb/>so various and opposite, do, notwithstanding, fire the

	      <lb/>tians</name> in <placeName>America</placeName>, partly engaged in religion, and partly 
	    <lb/>in the world; but their <emph>whole souls</emph> seem engaged in 
	    <lb/>idolatry; they evidence at once that they believe what 
	    <lb/>they assert. Even at this moment, while writing, my
	    <lb/>ears are almost stunned with the noise and confusion
            <lb/>occasioned by preparations for fire-works, to be ex­
            <lb/>hibited at the approaching festival. Could you, my
 	    <lb/>dear sir, witness but once this annual feast; could you 
	    <lb/>behold the crowded streets, the splendid offerings, the 
	    <lb/>gay attire, and the enthusiasm of their devotions, you 
	    <lb/>would readily admit, that nothing short of an Almighty 
	    <lb/>arm, could break down these barriers, these strong bar­ 
	    <lb/>riers, and cause the introduction of the gospel. But even 
	    <lb/>these seasons, these momentary triumphs of <persName>Satan</persName>, are

	    <lb/>not destitute of advantages to the cause of Christ. We 
	    <lb/>have opportunities, by these means, of distributing tracts 
	    <lb/>and portions of scripture, among those who come from 
	    <lb/>distant towns and villages, where the name of Christ 
	    <lb/>is still unknown. The Spirit of God may water seed 
	    <lb/>sown in this way, and cause it to spring up, to the 
	    <lb/>eternal confusion of the adversary of souls, who in­ 
	    <lb/>duced their attendance on this festival with a different 
	    <lb/>object.</p>
                <p>

We still live in a quiet manner, unmolested by 
	    <lb/>government, or robbers. The viceroy's family treat 
	    <lb/>us with respect and affection, now and then sending 
	    <lb/>us an elephant, to accompany them in their excursions. 
	    <lb/>Her highness, the vicereine, professes a particular re­ 
	    <lb/>gard for me, and I, in return, have presented her with 
		  <lb/>a translation of <title><persName>St. Matthew's</persName> gospel</title>, a tract, and ca­ 
	    <lb/>techism, and have had two or three opportunities of 
	    <lb/>conversing with her privately on the subject of re­ 
	    <lb/>ligion. How much she reads in the former, or be­ 
	    <lb/>lieves in the latter, I am unable to say; but neither 
	    <lb/>produce any visible effects. She ordered the instruc­ 
	    <lb/>tress of one of her daughters, to give the catechism 
	    <lb/>to her child to commit to memory.</p>

	    <lb/>villages, situated on the <placeName>Syriam river</placeName> in the country

	    <lb/>and then on business by order of the viceroy, and 
	    <lb/>obliged to return immediately.</p>
                <p>

	    I asked him if he had become a disciple of <persName>Jesus
	      <lb/>Christ</persName>?  He replied, <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">I have not yet, but I am think­ 
	      <lb/>ing and reading in order to become one. I cannot yet 
	      <lb/>destroy my old mind; for when I see a handsome 
	      <lb/>patso, (a cloth the Burman men wear,) or a handsome 
	      <lb/>gownbown, (the handkerchief worn on the head,) I 
	      <lb/>still desire it. Tell the great teacher, when he re­ 
	      <lb/>turns, that I wish to see him, though I am not a dis­ 
	      <lb/>ciple of Christ.</said>  He requested the remaining part of 
		  <lb/><title><persName>St. Matthew's</persName> gospel</title>, also catechisms and tracts for 
	    <lb/>his followers. I gave all of his attendants tracts; on 
	    <lb/>which he said to them, <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Take and read them atten­ 
	      <lb/>tively, and when you have embraced the doctrines they 
	      <lb/>contain, come here and converse with the teacher.</said> 
	    <lb/>I asked the number of inhabitants in the villages he 
	    <lb/>governed, and whether he would collect them together 
	    <lb/>to hear the gospel, should <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> make him a 
	    <lb/>visit on his return. He said there were about a 
	    <lb/>thousand houses, and the inhabitants were <name>Talings</name>, 
	    <lb/>(natives of <placeName>Pegue</placeName>, who speak a language different 
	    <lb/>from the <name>Burmans</name>,) but he would receive a visit from 
	    <lb/><persName>Mr. Judson</persName> as a great favour, and would call his 
	    <lb/>people together to hear him preach. There was some­ 
	    <lb/>thing so interesting and encouraging in the appearance 
	    <lb/>of this <name>Burman</name>, so meek and unassuming, considering 
	    <lb/>the dignity of his office, that hopes are again raised 
	    <lb/>concerning him. But whether he will continue to 
	    <lb/>examine the Christian religion, and finally become a 
	    <lb/>true disciple, or the reverse, time alone will determine.</p>

            <quote rend="bestow( ( pre(“) ) (p) )">
              <p>

It is now four long years and a half, since we took 
	    <lb/>up our residence in this spiritually benighted land, and 
	    <lb/>to this day do we offer our thanks to God, for having 
	    <lb/>brought and continued us here. To this day can we 
	    <lb/>testify that God is good; that he is a faithful, cove­ 
	    <lb/>nant-keeping God, who is worthy of the entire trust 
	    <lb/>and confidence of all his creatures. Never, for a 
	    <lb/>moment, has he left us to feel, that our first views of 
	    <lb/>the practicability of missions, were visionary; conse­ 
	    <lb/>quently, we have been preserved from those distress­ 
	    <lb/>ing, agonizing feelings, resulting from regret and dis­ 
	    <lb/>appointment in a darling enterprise. On the contrary, 
	    <lb/>we feel that missions to the heathens are not only 
	    <lb/>practicable, but the very blood of their souls will be 
	    <lb/>required at the hand of those <name>Christians</name>, who neglect 
	    <lb/>to make exertions to send the gospel among them. 
	    <lb/><emph>This</emph> is all that is required of the Christian world. 
	    <lb/>God will not call us to an account for <emph>not converting</emph> 
	    <lb/>the heathen. This, this is the work he reserves for 
	    <lb/>himself. But he will call us to an account for <emph>not using
	      <lb/>the means</emph>; this part of the work he has assigned to 
	    <lb/>his creatures to perform. Neither have we any reason 
	    <lb/>to be discouraged, because the first communications 
	    <lb/>of Divine truth have not been efficacious. It would 
	    <lb/>be almost a miracle, for these <name>Burmans</name> to throw away 
	    <lb/>a system of religion which they have been accustomed 
	    <lb/>to consider sacred, from time immemorial, on the 
	    <lb/>very first intimation of its being false, or on the first 
	    <lb/>intelligence that there is another and a better. They 
	    <lb/>must have time to examine, to read our sacred writ­ 
	    <lb/>ings, and to see the effect our religion produces on its

	    <lb/>professors, before they will feel inclined to embrace 
	    <lb/>the humbling doctrines of the gospel. They do not 
	    <lb/>feel <emph>themselves</emph> in such a wretched, perishing situation, 
	    <lb/>as we view them, consequently they do not see the 
	    <lb/><emph>necessity</emph> of embracing the offers presented.</p>
              <p>

We hope our friends and patrons will not be dis­ 
	    <lb/>couraged, because no one of the <name>Burmans</name> who has 
	    <lb/>heard the gospel, has embraced it; but continue to 
	    <lb/>strengthen and encourage us by their prayers and com­ 
	    <lb/>munications, and in time, we doubt not, they, with us, 
	    <lb/>will reap an abundant harvest.</p>
              <p>

We are anxiously looking for the arrival of the 
	    <lb/>missionaries, who, we hope, have long since left 
	    <lb/><placeName>America</placeName>. God grant that they may prove true mis­ 
	    <lb/>sionaries of the cross, prepared and willing to suffer 
	    <lb/>whatever may await them.</p>
              <p>

We consider the circumstance, that other mis­ 
	    <lb/>sionaries should have their hearts turned toward the 
	    <lb/><placeName>Burman Empire</placeName>, as an indication of God to strengthen 
	    <lb/>and establish this mission, and a prelude of his more 
		  <lb/>merciful intentions, to turn the <name>Burmans</name> from idolatry, 
	    <lb/>to serve the living God.</p>
              <p><persName>Mr. Judson</persName> is absent, or he would write to <persName>Mr. C.</persName>
	    <lb/>You will readily imagine my situation to be very 
	    <lb/>lonely in his absence. Nothing but a sense of duty 
	    <lb/>could have induced me to consent to his departure.

	  <lb/>darkness of pagan ignorance; and then, again, how 
	  <lb/>easy it is for him to enable me to persevere, and that 
	  <lb/>he will answer prayers offered for blessings; I cannot 
	  <lb/>but receive, with the liveliest gratitude, the assurance 
	  <lb/>you give me, that I am remembered in the prayers of 
	  <lb/>my brethren at home; and I sometimes think their 
	  <lb/>prayers may be heard for me, when my own are 
	  <lb/>excluded.</p>

It seems you have entertained some hopes from a 
	  <lb/>contest, which existed some time ago, between the 
	  <lb/>king and priests of <placeName>Burmah</placeName>. That has terminated, 
	  <lb/>not to the disadvantage of the one, nor the advantage 
	  <lb/>of the other. The king persecuted them as long as 
	  <lb/>he pleased, and then let them alone; they now quietly 
	  <lb/>perform their functions, which consist principally in 
	  <lb/>committing to memory their religious books, and pa­ 
	  <lb/>trolling the streets to receive the willing offerings of 
	  <lb/>the people, which afford them subsistence. They, 
	  <lb/>with the religion of the country, appear to be now in 
	  <lb/>a prosperous state, though I believe the king is not 
	  <lb/>very friendly to either. Should he exterminate the 
	  <lb/>priesthood, I have no idea that the ministers of the 
	  <lb/>gospel would become a substitute; or, should he 
	  <lb/>abolish the present system of religion, that he would 
	  <lb/>do it in favour of <name>Christianity</name>. The ears of the 
	  <lb/>poor old man have never heard the joyful news, and 
	  <lb/>the law of nature requires that he should soon pass 
	  <lb/>into eternity. The heir apparent is, I understand, a 
	  <lb/>mild prince. His accession to the throne, on the 
	  <lb/>king's demise, will undoubtedly be attended with dif­ 
	  <lb/>ficulties, and perhaps tracked with blood. Should he 
	  <lb/>finally succeed, and the country remain at peace any 
	  <lb/>length of time, He, by whom kings rule, may in his

	  <lb/>providence open a wide door, which no man can shut, 
	  <lb/>for the admission of the word of life. It is also quite 
	  <lb/>as possible, that much affliction and trouble await us.</p>
          <p>

It is more than six months since I finished printing 
	    <lb/><title><persName>St. Matthew</persName></title>, and more than that since the tract was 
	  <lb/>put into circulation. To say that none read, none in­ 
	  <lb/>quire, would be wrong; many do both; and, we are 
	  <lb/>entitled to hope, because truth is in circulation. Since 
	    <lb/>printing <title><persName>St. Matthew</persName></title>, I have been studying the lan­ 
	  <lb/>guage, but have not yet been able to penetrate far 
	  <lb/>into it. I have but a glimpse of its genius and con­ 
	  <lb/>struction. The attainment of this language, I am 
	  <lb/>persuaded, is the labour of years; and I sometimes 
	  <lb/>think it folly for one past thirty years of age, to at­ 
	  <lb/>tempt it.</p>
          <p>

I was happy to hear, that the missionaries who 
	  <lb/>are now coming here are so young. I wish they 
	  <lb/>were five years younger: or rather, I wish some 
	  <lb/>pious, active boys, sixteen or seventeen years of age, 
	  <lb/>of unquestionable conversion, and willing to give 
	  <lb/>themselves up wholly to God, would come over here, 
	  <lb/>and begin upon the language. You may think this a 
	  <lb/>strange wish. I think so too; but it is not a hasty or 
	  <lb/>inconsiderate one.</p>

In the order of events, I must now, my dear Sir, 
	  <lb/>give you a particular description of that dark period, 
	  <lb/>when the Burman mission, surrounded undoubtedly 
	  <lb/>by invisible enemies, seemed on the very verge of 
	  <lb/>destruction. Three months of <persName>Mr. Judson's</persName> absence 
	  <lb/>had nearly expired, and we had begun to look for his 
	  <lb/>return, when a native boat arrived, twelve days from 
	  <lb/><placeName>Chittagong</placeName>, bringing the distressing intelligence that 
	  <lb/>neither <persName>Mr. J.</persName> nor the vessel had been heard of at that
    

<pb n="92"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E10v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">92</mw>
	  
	  <lb/>port. I should not have given so much credit to this 
	  <lb/>report, as to have allowed it to harass my feelings, 
	  <lb/>had it not been corroborated by communications from 
	  <lb/>my friends in <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, which arrived just at this 
	  <lb/>time. From the circumstance that the vessel had not 
	  <lb/>reached the port of destination, I knew not what con­ 
	  <lb/>clusion to draw. Hope, at times, suggested the idea, 
	  <lb/>that the ship's course might have been altered, that 
	  <lb/>she might yet be safe; but despondency more fre­ 
	  <lb/>quently strove to <emph>convince</emph> that all was lost. Thus 
	  <lb/>was I, for four months, in that agonizing state of 
	  <lb/>suspense, which is frequently more oppressive than 
	  <lb/>the most dreadful certainty.</p>
        <p>

Two or three days after the arrival of the above 
	  <lb/>intelligence, <persName>Mr. Hough</persName> received an order, couched 
	  <lb/>in the most menacing language, to appear immediately 
	  <lb/>at the court-house, to give an account of himself. 
	  <lb/>This, so unlike any message we had ever before re­ 
	  <lb/>ceived from government, spread consternation and 
	  <lb/>alarm among our teachers, domestics, and adherents; 
	  <lb/>some of whom followed <persName>Mr. Hough</persName> at a distance, and 
	  <lb/>heard the appalling words, from some of the petty 
	  <lb/>officers, that a royal order had arrived, for the banish­ 
	  <lb/>ment of all foreign teachers. As it was late when 
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Hough</persName> arrived at the court-house, he was merely 
	  <lb/>ordered to give security for his appearance, at an early 
	  <lb/>hour on the approaching day, when, to use their own 
	  <lb/>unfeeling language, <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">if he did not tell all the truth 
	    <lb/>relative to his situation in the country, they would 
	    <lb/>write with his heart's blood.</said></p>
        <p>

Our embarassments, at this period, were greatly 
	  <lb/>increased by the circumstance, that the viceroy and 
	  <lb/>his family, who had always been our steady friends, 

<pb n="93"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E11r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">93</mw>

	  <lb/>had been recently recalled to <placeName>Ava</placeName>; and the present 
	  <lb/>viceroy, with whom we had but a slight acquaintance, 
	  <lb/>had left his family at the capital. <persName>Mr. Hough</persName> was not 
	  <lb/>sufficiently acquainted with the language, to allow of 
	  <lb/>his appealing in person to the viceroy, and as it is not 
	  <lb/>customary for females to appear at <emph>his</emph> court, in the 
	  <lb/>absence of the vicereine, we had nothing before us, 
	  <lb/>but the gloomy prospect of being obliged to submit 
	  <lb/>to all those evils, in the power of petty officers to 
	  <lb/>inflict, upon those unprotected by higher authority.</p>
        <p>

	  The following days, <name>Friday</name> and <name>Saturday</name>, <persName>Mr. 
	    <lb/>Hough</persName> was detained at the court-house, and under the 
	  <lb/>necessity of answering through an interpreter, the 
	  <lb/>most trivial questions; such as, what were the names 
	  <lb/>of his parents, how many suits of clothes he had, &amp;c. 
	  <lb/>all which were written down in the most formal man­ 
	  <lb/>ner imaginable. The court would not allow him to 
	  <lb/>retire for any refreshment; and this, together with 
	  <lb/>several other petty grievances, convinced us that it 
	  <lb/>was their object to harrass and distress us, as much as 
	  <lb/>possible; feeling safe in the idea that circumstances 
	  <lb/>were such that we could not appeal to the viceroy. 
	  <lb/><name>Sunday</name> morning arrived, another message was re­ 
	  <lb/>ceived from the court-house, (the viceroy does not 
	  <lb/>usually attend those courts, as cases of importance are 
	  <lb/>submitted privately for his decision,) for <persName>Mr. Hough's</persName> 
	  <lb/>appearance, that the examination might be continued. 
	  <lb/>The court has now pushed the matter too far, and we 
	  <lb/>resolved to ascertain whether those orders for exami­ 
	  <lb/>nation emanated from the viceroy, or whether he was 
	  <lb/>entirely ignorant of the whole matter. My teacher, 
	  <lb/>coming in just at that time, drew up a respectful peti­ 
	  <lb/>tion, stating the grievances to which <persName>Mr. Hough</persName> had 

<pb n="94"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E11v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">94</mw>


	  <lb/>been subjected, and the present order for his appear­ 
	  <lb/>ing in public on our <emph>sacred day</emph> — and requesting that 
	  <lb/>it might be the pleasure of his highness that those 
	  <lb/>molestations should cease. <persName>Mr. Hough</persName> readily accom­ 
	  <lb/>panied me to the government-house; and when we 
	  <lb/>had reached the outer court, I caught the eye of the 
	  <lb/>viceroy, who sat surrounded by the officers of his 
	  <lb/>court, but who recognized me, and, in a very conde­ 
	  <lb/>scending manner, called me <said>to come in and make 
	    <lb/>known my request.</said>  I presented my petition to one 
	  <lb/>of the secretaries, who was immediately ordered to 
	  <lb/>read it; at the conclusion of which, the viceroy in­ 
	  <lb/>quired, in an austere manner, of the very officer who 
	  <lb/>had been most forward in making <persName>Mr. Hough's</persName> situa­ 
	  <lb/>tion unpleasant at the court-house, and who happened 
	  <lb/>now to be seated not far from the <quote>voice which issues 
	    <lb/>life of death,</quote> <said>Why the examination of this <emph>foreign 
	      <lb/>teacher</emph> had been thus prolonged?</said> — at the same time 
	  <lb/>giving a written order that <persName>Mr. Hough</persName> should not be 
	  <lb/>called on his <said>sacred day,</said> and that he should be 
	  <lb/>molested no more. The petty officers of government 
	  <lb/>now saw their plan defeated, which probably was, to 
	  <lb/>make <persName>Mr. Hough</persName> feel himself in their power, think­ 
	  <lb/>ing he would then offer them a large reward to be 
	  <lb/>liberated. We, however, ascertained the fact, that a 
	  <lb/>royal order had arrived, for the banishment of all the 
	  <lb/>Portuguese priests in the country (there were three 
	  <lb/>only). To ascertain who they were, the viceroy had 
	  <lb/>issued an order that all the foreign priests should be 
	  <lb/>summoned to the court-house, not intending that any 
	  <lb/>but the <name>Portuguese</name> should undergo an examination, 
	  <lb/>farther than to ascertain that they were not <name>Por­

        <p>About this time the cholera began to rage among 
	  <lb/>the native population. This disorder had never been 
	  <lb/>known in the Empire before, and the dreadful ravages 
	  <lb/>made in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName> filled every one with terror and 
	  <lb/>alarm. It was in the midst of the hottest season of 
	  <lb/>the year, and there was no prospect of the disorder 
	  <lb/>subsiding until the commencement of the rains. The 
	  <lb/>beating of the death drum, and other instruments used 
	  <lb/>at funerals, sounded all the day long, a melancholy 
	  <lb/>dirge in our ears, and, in emphatic language, said, 
	  <lb/><quote>Be ye also ready.</quote>  We had no reason for supposing 
	  <lb/>that we should escape this fatal disorder, more than 
	  <lb/>others; at the same time, we knew ourselves to be in 
	  <lb/>the hands of him who had said, <quote>A thousand shall 
	    <lb/>fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; 
	    <lb/>but it shall not come nigh thee.</quote>  And thus it proved; 
	  <lb/>for not an individual within our enclosure suffered 
	  <lb/>from the cholera, though our neighbours died around 
	  <lb/>us. The <name>Burmans</name> attempted to account for the origin 
	  <lb/>of this disease, by supposing that some evil spirits 
	  <lb/>had entered the city, and were continually traversing 
	  <lb/>the streets, and from pure maliciousness, destroying 
	  <lb/>the inhabitants. The natives resolved on endeavour­ 
	  <lb/>ing to dispossess them, by making a most tremendous  
	  <lb/>noise, which, in the opinion of a <name>Burman</name>, was suffi­ 
	  <lb/>cient to alarm evil spirits, however malicious or obsti­ 
	  <lb/>nate. The signal for commencement was given at 
	  <lb/>the court-house, by firing cannons; when immediately 
	  <lb/>every <name>Burman</name> in town began beating on his house 
	  <lb/>with clubs, or any thing which would make a noise. 
	  <lb/>No one ventured to remain inactive, as it had pre­ 
	  <lb/>viously been asserted, that the evil spirits would enter 
	  <lb/>the houses of those who made no noise. This was 

<pb n="96"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E12v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">96</mw> 

	  <lb/>continued for three successive nights; but notwith­ 
	  <lb/>standing the unheard-of uproar, the evil spirits re­ 
	  <lb/>fused to move, and the disorder continued to rage for 
	  <lb/>months afterwards.</p>
        <p>

Our trials and dangers were not a little increased at 
	  <lb/>this period, by a report in circulation, that difficulties 
	  <lb/>existed between the English and the Burman govern­ 
	  <lb/>ments; and that an attempt would be soon made by 
	  <lb/>the <name>English</name> to take the country. This report seemed 
	  <lb/>confirmed by the circumstance, that there had been 
	  <lb/>no arrivals from any English port for some months 
	  <lb/>past, and that the few remaining captains were making 
	  <lb/>every possible effort to hasten the departure of their 
	  <lb/>ships. Should actual hostilities commence, we were 
	  <lb/>well aware the removal of the mission, at least for a 
	  <lb/>time, would be the consequence. The only remaining 
	  <lb/>ship was now on the eve of departure, and unless we 
	  <lb/>embraced this opportunity for leaving the country, 
	  <lb/>there was nothing before us but dangers the most 
	  <lb/>appalling. For a particular account of the remaining 
	  <lb/>part of this distressing season, I must have recourse 
<lb/>to my journal, then transmitted to <placeName>America</placeName>.</p>

		  On the <date when="1818-07-05">5th of this month</date>, I embarked with <persName>Mr. 
	    <lb/>Hough</persName> and his family for <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, having previously

	  <lb/>in case of meeting him in <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, he might go on with 
	  <lb/>his Burman studies. But the teacher, fearing the diffi­

	  <lb/>and when on the point of putting our to sea, the cap­

	  <lb/>ous state, in consequence of having been improperly 
	  <lb/>loaded, and that she must be detained for a day or two 
	  <lb/>at the place in which she then lay. I immediately re­ 
	  <lb/>solved on giving up the voyage, and returning to town. 
	  <lb/>Accordingly the captain sent up a boat with me, and 
	  <lb/>engaged to forward my baggage the next day. I 
	  <lb/>reached town in the evening, spent the night at the 
	  <lb/>house of the only remaining <name>Englishman</name> in the place, 
	  <lb/>and to-day have come out to the mission-house, to the 
	  <lb/>great joy of all the <name>Burmans</name> left on our premises. 
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Hough</persName> and his family will proceed; and they 
	  <lb/>kindly and affectionately urge my return. I know I 
	  <lb/>am surrounded by dangers on every hand, and expect

	    <lb/>opportunity of very rare occurrence in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>.</p>
                <p>

Since that time, a series of unexpected providences 
	    <lb/>have befallen me, which, though uninteresting in de­ 
	    <lb/>tail, must be briefly mentioned, in order to account for 
	    <lb/>my present situation.</p>
                <p>

	    When we left <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, <date when="1817-12-25"><name>December</name> 25th</date>, we ex­ 
	    <lb/>pected a passage of ten or twelve days. At the expi­ 
	    <lb/>ration of a month, however, by reason of contrary 
	    <lb/>winds, and the unmanageableness of the ship, in the 
	    <lb/>difficult navigation along the coast, we found ourselves 
	    <lb/>still at a great distance from port; and the season 
	    <lb/>being so far advanced, as to deprive us of the hope of 
	    <lb/>more favourable winds, the captain and supercargo 
	    <lb/>agreed on a change of the ship's destination, and made 
	    <lb/>sail for <placeName>Madras</placeName>.</p>
                <p>

	    Previous to leaving the coast, we put into <placeName>Cheduba</placeName>, 
	    <lb/>a place under Burman government, for a supply of 
	    <lb/>provisions. I was unable to go ashore, but took the 
	    <lb/>opportunity of sending a tract by the boat. It hap­ 
	    <lb/>pened to be conveyed directly to the governor, and he 
	    <lb/>ordered it to be read in his presence. Soon after, when 
	    <lb/>our captain had an audience, the governor inquired 
	    <lb/>after the writer of the tract: who he was, and how 
	    <lb/>long he had been in the country. The captain evaded 
	    <lb/>some questions, for fear of detention, I suppose, and

	    <lb/>merely stated that the writer was a foreigner, who had 
	    <lb/>resided in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName> about four years.
<said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">No,</said> replied the 
	    <lb/>governor, <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">that is not to be credited. You cannot make

	      <lb/>learned to write the language so well. It must have 
	      <lb/>been written by some other person.</said>  The captain 
	    <lb/>related this to me on his return. I felt particularly 
	    <lb/>gratified by this testimony to the perspecuity of the 
	    <lb/>style, and thought it not unworthy of mentioning, 
	    <lb/>because it could not be suspected, as others which 
	    <lb/>had been made to me personally, of having been a 
	    <lb/>mere compliment.</p>
                <p>

	    The ship's destination was changed on the <date when="1818-01-26">26th
	      <lb/>of <name>January</name></date>. We retraced our course for a few days, 
	    <lb/>and then stood to the westward. It was with the most 
	    <lb/>bitter feelings, that I witnessed the entire failure of 
	    <lb/>my undertakings, and saw the summits of the moun­ 
	    <lb/>tains of <placeName>Arracan</placeName>, the last indexes of my country, 
	    <lb/>sinking in the horizon, and the ship stretching away 
	    <lb/>to a distant part of <placeName>India</placeName>, which I had no wish to 
	    <lb/>visit, and where I had no object to obtain. It was, 
	    <lb/>however, some mitigation of my disappointment, that 
		  <lb/>I should, in all probability, be able to return to <placeName>Ran­ 
	    <lb/>goon</placeName>, and resume my missionary business, much ear­ 
	    <lb/>lier than if I had visited <placeName>Chittagong</placeName>. But even the 
	    <lb/>consolation of this hope was not long allowed me. 
	    <lb/>We had, indeed, a quick passage across the bay; but, 
	    <lb/>on drawing near the <placeName>Coromandel coast</placeName>, the wind and 
	    <lb/>current combined to prevent our further progress, and 
	    <lb/>at the expiration of another month, having for a long 
	    <lb/>time subsisted on nothing scarcely but rice and water, 
	    <lb/>and being now reduced to very short allowance, we 
	    <lb/>concluded to make sail for <placeName>Masulipatam</placeName>, a port north   

<pb n="104"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">104</mw>

	    <lb/>of <placeName>Madras</placeName>, which we doubted not we should be able 
	    <lb/>to reach in a very few days. In this, again, we were 
	    <lb/>disappointed, and through the unmanageableness of 
	    <lb/>the ship, or the mismanagement of the captain, were 
	    <lb/>detained at sea nearly another month. During this 
	    <lb/>period, we were sometimes in great distress, deeming 
	    <lb/>ourselves very fortunate when able to get a bag of 
	    <lb/>rice, or a few buckets of water, from any native vessel 
	    <lb/>which happened to pass. Once we sent the long boat 
	    <lb/>to the shore, and obtained a considerable supply of 
	    <lb/>water, which was a great relief. But of rice we could 
	    <lb/>obtain no sufficient supply, and all other articles of 
	    <lb/>provision were quite out of the question.</p>
                <p>The low state to which I was at length reduced, 
	    <lb/>occasioned a partial return of the disorder of my head 
	    <lb/>and eyes, to which I was subject two years ago. This, 
	    <lb/>with other circumstances united, left me no other 
	    <lb/>source of consolation but resignation to the will of 
	    <lb/>God, and an unreserved surrender of all to his care; 
	    <lb/>and, praised be his name, I found more consolation 
	    <lb/>and happiness in communion with God, and in the en­ 
	    <lb/>joyments of religion, than I had ever found, in more 
	    <lb/>prosperous circumstances!</p>
                <p>Finally we did reach <placeName>Masulipatam</placeName>, and I left the 
	    <lb/>ship on the <date when="1818-03-18">18th of <name>March</name></date>, twelve weeks after em­ 
	    <lb/>barking at <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. I waited at <placeName>Masuly</placeName> a few days 
	    <lb/>until it was ascertained that the ship would unlade her 
	    <lb/>cargo, and remain several months. And as there was 
	    <lb/>no prospect that season of reaching <placeName>Madras</placeName> by sea, 
	    <lb/>the only port on the coast where I could hope to find 
	    <lb/>a vessel bound to <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, I was under the necessity 
	    <lb/>of taking a journey by land: distance about three 
	    <lb/>hundred miles. I accordingly hired a palanquin and 

<pb n="105"/>

<mw type="pageNum">105</mw>

	    <lb/>bearers, and arrived here on the <date when="1818-04-08">8th of <name>April</name></date>. My 
	    <lb/>first aim was of course, the beach, and my first in­ 
	    <lb/>quiry, a vessel bound to <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. But my chapter 
	    <lb/>of disappointment was not yet finished. No vessel 
	    <lb/>had sailed for <placeName>Rangoon</placeName> this year; and such, it was 
	    <lb/>understood, was the unsettled state of the Burman 
	    <lb/>country, that none would probably venture for some 
	    <lb/>time to come.</p>
                <p><lb/>Here I have remained ever since, under very trying 
	    <lb/>circumstances. I have scarcely heard from <placeName>Rangoon</placeName><lb/>since I left, or been able to transmit any intelligence
	    <lb/>thither, by a conveyance to be depended on. The 
	    <lb/>weakness of my eyes prevents my application to study, 
	    <lb/>or attempt at any exertion. I am making no progress 
	    <lb/>in missionary work. I am distressed by the appalling 
	    <lb/>recollection of the various business which was press­ 
	    <lb/>ing on me at <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, and which made me very re­ 
	    <lb/>luctant to leave home for the shortest time. Now, I 
	    <lb/>have been detained twice as long as I had anticipated, 
	    <lb/>and have, withal, wholly failed in my undertaking. 
	    <lb/>Where, my rebellious heart is ready to cry, where is 
	    <lb/>the wisdom of all this?  But it is wise, though blind­ 
	    <lb/>ness cannot apprehend. It is best, though unbelief 
	    <lb/>is disposed to murmur. Be still, my soul, and know

	    <lb/>affection from many dear friends, as rendered parting 
	    <lb/>with them very painful, though my detention in <placeName>Madras</placeName> 
	    <lb/>had, in other respects, been almost insupportable. 
		  <lb/>We anchored at the mouth of <placeName>Rangoon river</placeName>, on the 
	    <lb/><date when="--08-20">20th of <name>August</name></date>. The next morning, when the pilot 
	    <lb/>came on board, I was overwhelmed with the in­ 
	    <lb/>telligence, that, on account of the dangerous situation 
	    <lb/>of affairs, the mission had been broken up, and that 
	    <lb/><persName>Mr. Hough</persName> and his family, and <persName>Mrs. Judson</persName>, had taken 
	    <lb/>passage for <placeName>Bengal</placeName>. To my great relief, however, it 
	    <lb/>was added, that, before the ship left the river, <persName>Mrs. 
	      <lb/>Judson's</persName> reluctance to leave the place had so increased, 
	    <lb/>as to force her back to the mission-house alone; and 
	    <lb/>further, that the ship being found unfit for sea, was 
	    <lb/>still detained.</p>
                <p>

	    The examination which <persName>brother Hough</persName> sustained, 
	    <lb/>during my absence, and the persecution of the Roman 
	    <lb/>Catholic padres, have made us feel more deeply than 
	    <lb/>ever, the precarious situation of this mission, and the 
	    <lb/>necessity of proceeding with the utmost caution. It 
	    <lb/>was only through the favour of the viceroy, that the 
	    <lb/>padres were allowed to remain here, when they arrived 
	    <lb/>from <placeName>Ava</placeName>, under sentence of banishment. And it is 
	    <lb/>only through his mediation, and the influence of large 
	    <lb/>presents made to the king, that the order of banish­ 
	    <lb/>ments is reversed, if indeed it be reversed, a report not 
	    <lb/>yet confirmed. One malicious intimation to the king 
	    <lb/>would occasion our banishment; and banishment, as 
		  <lb/>the <name>Burmans</name> tell us, is no small thing, — being at­ 
	    <lb/>tended with confiscation of all property, and such 
	    <lb/>various abuses, as would make us deem ourselves 
	    <lb/>happy to escape with our lives.</p>
                <p>

Such a situation may appear somewhat alarming

	    <lb/>to a person accustomed to the liberty and safety of a 
	    <lb/>free government. But, let us remember, that it has 
	    <lb/>been the lot of the greater part of mankind to live 
	    <lb/>under a despotic government, devoid of all security 
	    <lb/>for life or property a single moment. Let us re­ 
	    <lb/>member, that the Son of God chose to become in­ 
	    <lb/>carnate under the most unprincipled and cruel despot 
	    <lb/>that ever reigned. And shall any disciple of Christ
	    <lb/>refuse to do a little service for his Saviour, under a 
	    <lb/>government where his Saviour would not have refused 
	    <lb/>to live and die for his soul?  God forbid. Yet faith is 
	    <lb/>sometimes weak — flesh and blood sometimes repine. 
	    <lb/>O, for grace to strengthen faith, to animate hope, to 
	    <lb/>elevate affection, to embolden the soul, to enable us to 
	    <lb/>look danger and death in the face! Still more, to be­ 
	    <lb/>hold, without repining, <emph>those most dear us</emph> suffering

                <p>

We feel encouraged by the thought, that many of

	  In four or five weeks, after the arrival of <persName>Mr. 
	    <lb/>Judson</persName>, we had another joyful meeting with mis­ 
	  <lb/>sionary friends, sent from our native country. The 
	  <lb/><persName>Rev. Messrs. Colman</persName> and <persName>Wheelock</persName>, for several years 
	  <lb/>previously to their leaving <placeName>America</placeName>, had thought and 
	  <lb/>felt much on the subject of missions, and could not 
	  <lb/>rest contented, to sit down as ministers of the gospel, 
	  <lb/>in their own country, while <quote>the wall of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> 
	    <lb/>lay waste,</quote> in a foreign land. They literally panted 

<pb n="108"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">108</mw> 

	  <lb/>to become the heralds of salvation, to those who were 
	  <lb/>in darkness, and the shadow of death; and though 
	  <lb/>their prospects of being early and happily settled, over 
	  <lb/>opulent congregations, were flattering, they relin­
	  <lb/>quished them all, and, at an early period, made known 
	  <lb/>their views and wishes to the <orgName>Board of Missions</orgName>. 
	  <lb/>Extracts from their letters, on this subject, to the 
	  <lb/>corresponding secretary, I cannot omit transcribing, 
	  <lb/>as they are so very descriptive of the spirit they ever 
	  <lb/>continued to exhibit until their lamented death.</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Colman</persName> wrote thus: <quote>Since I came to the 
	    <lb/>above conclusion, my mind has been unwavering. It 
	    <lb/>is true, mountains, at times, have arisen between my­ 
	    <lb/>self and the Eastern world. My way has been hedged 
	    <lb/>up by difficulties, which, to the eye of human reason, 
	    <lb/>might appear insurmountable. But duty has con­ 
	    <lb/>stantly appeared the same. Indeed, I esteem mis­ 
	    <lb/>sionary work, not only a duty for me to perform, but 
	    <lb/>a privilege for me to enjoy; a privilege which I value 
	    <lb/>more than the riches of the earth. Only give me the 
	    <lb/>rich satisfaction of holding up the torch of truth, in 
	    <lb/>the benighted regions of <placeName>Burmah</placeName>! This is the object 
	    <lb/>which lies nearest my heart; for this I can cheerfully 
	    <lb/>leave my native land, and the bosom of my beloved 
	    <lb/>friends. I pant to proclaim the gospel to those who 
	    <lb/>are ignorant of it; to present to their minds that firm 
	    <lb/>foundation, on which my own hopes of eternal happiness 
	    <lb/>are built. I took to <placeName>Burmah</placeName> as my home, and as the 
	    <lb/>field of my future toils. To the wretched inhabitants 
	    <lb/>of that empire I long to present the <name>Bible</name>, the fountain 
	    <lb/>of knowledge, and to direct their wandering steps to 
	    <lb/>the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls. Nor can I 
	    <lb/>refrain from cherishing the hope that my feeble   

<pb n="109"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F7r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">109</mw> 

	    <lb/>labours among them will be crowned with the bles­ 
	    <lb/>sing of heaven. Some, I trust, will be induced to 
	    <lb/>forsake the worship of idols, and to bow the knee to 
	    <lb/>Him on whose vesture and thigh is written <quote>King of 
	      <lb/>kings, and Lord of lords</quote>. Prompted, as I believe, by 
	    <lb/>a deep sense of the worth of souls, and by the com­ 
	    <lb/>mand of our blessed Saviour, who says, <quote>Go ye into 
	      <lb/>all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature;</quote> 
	    <lb/>and encouraged by his promise of constant assistance 
	    <lb/>and direction to his servants, I, voluntarily and joy­ 
	    <lb/>fully, offer myself to be your missionary to the <placeName>Bur­
	      <lb/>man empire</placeName>. May the Lord preside over your 
	    <lb/>deliberations, and grant me, if it can be consistent 
	    <lb/>with his holy will, the unspeakable happiness of pro­ 
	    <lb/>claiming the love of <persName>Jesus</persName> to the miserable heathen.</quote></p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Wheelock</persName> appears to have been inspired by the 
	  <lb/>same missionary zeal, and closes his application to the 
	  <lb/>Board with the following lines: — <quote>To you, honoured 
	    <lb/>fathers, is my mind directed, as to those, who, under 
	    <lb/>God, must decide my case. To you I offer, freely and 
	    <lb/>joyfully offer myself, to become your missionary, to 
	    <lb/>aid those already under your patronage, to turn the 
	    <lb/>poor <name>Burmans</name> <quote>from idols, to serve the living and 
	      <lb/>true God.</quote>  And, O! if it is consistent, that one so 
	    <lb/>unworthy and so unqualified as myself, should engage 
	    <lb/>in this glorious work, deny me not, I beseech you, the 
	    <lb/>unspeakable privilege; deny me not the fondest, the 
	    <lb/>most ardent desire of my soul, that can, in this world, 
	    <lb/>be gratified. To deny me this, would be to deprive 
	    <lb/>me of the greatest happiness which, in this world, I 
	    <lb/>can possibly enjoy. I would rather be a missionary of 
	    <lb/>the cross, than a king on a throne. Let the men of 
	    <lb/>this world possess its glittering toys; let the miser

<pb n="110"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F7v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">110</mw> 

	    <lb/>grasp his cankered gold; let the voluptuary enjoy his 
	    <lb/>sordid pleasures; let the ambitious ascend to the pin­ 
	    <lb/>nacle of earthly honour; but let me enjoy the sweet 
	    <lb/>satisfaction of directing the poor pagans to the <quote>Lamb 
	      <lb/>of God</quote>. I court no greater good; I desire no 
	    <lb/>greater joy; I seek no greater honour. To <placeName>Burmah</placeName> 
	    <lb/>would I go; in <placeName>Burmah</placeName> would I live; in <placeName>Burmah</placeName> 
	    <lb/>would I toil; in <placeName>Burmah</placeName> would I die; and in <placeName>Burmah</placeName> 
	    <lb/>would I be buried!</quote></p>
        <p>

These two young gentlemen, the one twenty-three, 
	  <lb/>and the other but twenty years of age, were readily 
	  <lb/>received by the Board, and soon ordained as mis­ 
	  <lb/>sionaries to the East. In <date when="1817-11"><name>November</name>, 1817</date>, they em­

	<p>During their passage to the East, these young mis­

	    <lb/>sure I inform you of your arrival in <placeName>Burmah</placeName>. Five 
	    <lb/>months we were on board the <name>Independence</name>, four in 
	    <lb/><placeName>Bengal</placeName>, and one upon our passage from <placeName>Calcutta</placeName> to 
	    <lb/>this port. Various circumstances conspired to make 
	    <lb/>the shores of this heathen land appear agreeable to

	    <lb/>us. We had long been in an unsettled state, and ex­ 
	    <lb/>posed either to the dangers of the ocean, or to the in­ 
	    <lb/>fluence of a sickly climate. It was delightful to find 
	    <lb/>ourselves at the end of our tedious journey, and safe 
	    <lb/>from all the perils through which we had passed. 
	    <lb/>But another consideration served much to animate us 
	    <lb/> — we had reached the field in which we were destined 
	    <lb/>to labour. Here we hoped to spend the remainder of 
	    <lb/>our days, to scatter the good seed of the kingdom, 
	    <lb/>and to see some plants of righteousness springing up, 
	    <lb/>and yielding fruit to the glory of God. When we 
	    <lb/>arrived at the landing-place, we found our beloved 
	    <lb/>brethren waiting to receive us. Our feelings, for a 
	    <lb/>short time, destroyed the power of utterance. We 
	    <lb/>could do no more than take each other by the hand. 
	    <lb/>In about an hour the ladies came on shore, when the 
	    <lb/>whole mission family met, and, by mutual expressions 
	    <lb/>of joy and love, attracted universal attention. From 
	    <lb/>the shore we were conducted to the king's godown, 
	    <lb/>where we were strictly searched. We then proceeded 
	    <lb/>to the mission-house. Our feelings were indescribable 
	    <lb/>when we stepped beneath its roof, and found ourselves 
	    <lb/>encircled by that dear company which we had desired 
	    <lb/>so long to enjoy. That was a season of rejoicing. 
	    <lb/>How swiftly and pleasantly the hours passed away! 
	    <lb/>How cheering and varied was the conversation! How 
	    <lb/>fervent were the prayers and thanksgivings to Almighty 
	    <lb/>God!</p>
                <p>

For more than a week we were assiduously em­ 
	    <lb/>ployed in getting our things through the custom­ 
	    <lb/>house. Our articles were strictly examined. The 
	    <lb/>most trifling of them did not escape minute investiga­ 
	    <lb/>tion. Having undergone this tedious operation, we

<pb n="114"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F9v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">114</mw> 


	    <lb/>were compelled by the custom of the country, to 
	    <lb/>make several presents to persons in authority. It is 
	    <lb/>admitted that the viceroy has the first claim. Feeling 
	    <lb/>the importance of securing his favour by every lawful 
	    <lb/>means, we thought the opportunity good to pay him 
	    <lb/>a visit, and, in presenting our gift, to request his pro­ 
	    <lb/>tection. We found him seated in an open house, 
	    <lb/>situated in the midst of a spacious garden. Before 
	    <lb/>him were a number of his officers, and a few persons 
	    <lb/>presenting petitions. Behind him, at a short distance, 
	    <lb/>were a group of artizans, of different occupations, 	
	    <lb/>whom he constantly employs. His excellency received  
	    <lb/>us in a very gracious manner, appeared much pleased 
	    <lb/>with our present, and gave us the assurance that we 
	    <lb/>should remain free from molestation beneath his  
	    <lb/>authority. Surely there is reason for gratitude, that 
	    <lb/>we are permitted to stay in this heathen land! Little 
	    <lb/>dependance, however, can be placed in the govern­ 
	    <lb/>ment. Things here are continually changing. The 
	    <lb/>lives and property of the people are at the arbitrary 
	    <lb/>disposal of a single individual. The whole country, 
	    <lb/>and all which it contains, are supposed to be his 
	    <lb/>property. Hence, he gratifies his inclination, without 
	    <lb/>the least restraint. While, therefore, we acknowledge 
	    <lb/>with gratitude the protection of earthly rulers, we 
	    <lb/>feel the necessity of putting all our confidence in the 
	    <lb/><persName>Lord Jehovah</persName>. He can either dispose them to favour 
	    <lb/>us, or defend us from their injustice and cruelty. 
	    <lb/>There is, certainly, no reason to fear, while we have 
	    <lb/>such a powerful Friend. It is true that, in conse­ 
	    <lb/>quence of several reports which reached us, we once 
	    <lb/>entertained some serious apprehensions respecting our 
	    <lb/>personal safety in <placeName>Burmah</placeName>; but, as we approached


<pb n="115"/>

<mw type="pageNum">115</mw>

	    <lb/>its shores, these apprehensions vanished; and, since 
	    <lb/>that time, we have felt as secure amidst these habita­ 
	    <lb/>tions of cruelty as though we were in a Christian 
	    <lb/>land, and enjoyed the protection of an equitable go­ 
	    <lb/>vernment.</p>
                <p>

Sickness and the want of a teacher have greatly 
	    <lb/>impeded my progress in the language. I had studied 
	    <lb/>but five days, when I was suddenly taken with an ex­ 
	    <lb/>pectoration of blood from my lungs. The discharge 
	    <lb/>was small, but it greatly reduced my strength. My 
	    <lb/>weakness was so great that I was compelled to re­ 
	    <lb/>linquish my studies, and almost entirely to abstain 
	    <lb/>from conversation. This was a severe trial. It caused 
	    <lb/>great searchings of heart. It led me seriously to 
	    <lb/>examine the motives which induced me to come to 
	    <lb/>this heathen land. For two months I was extremely 
	    <lb/>weak. But He who took away my health has, to a 
	    <lb/>considerable degree, restored it again. Once more I 
	    <lb/>have returned to my studies. By the assistance of a 
	    <lb/>teacher I have read the catechism, tract, and a few of 
		  <lb/>the first chapters of <title><persName>St. Matthew</persName></title>. I have copied 
	    <lb/><persName>brother Judson's</persName> grammar, and half of his dictionary. 
	    <lb/>The latter I hope to finish in two or three months. 
	    <lb/>With real pleasure I look forward to the time when I 
	    <lb/>shall obtain a knowledge of this difficult language. 
<lb/><persName>Brother Judson</persName> has performed a mighty task. He has 
	    <lb/>now the great satisfaction of preaching to the poor 
	    <lb/>heathen the words of eternal life. Hitherto he has 
	    <lb/>principally confined his exertions to those who visit 
	    <lb/>him; but soon his labours will be more public. We 
	    <lb/>have recently purchased a small piece of land, adjoin­ 
	    <lb/>ing the mission premised, on which a place of worship 
		  <lb/>is now erecting. Here <persName>brother Judson</persName> intends to 

<pb n="116"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F10v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">116</mw> 

	    <lb/>spend the principal part of his time. Among other 
	    <lb/>considerations, I will mention two which induced us 
	    <lb/>to adopt this plan. We concluded that this method of 
	    <lb/>communicating divine truth, would be least calculated 
	    <lb/>to offend the <quote>powers which be.</quote>  And, as the neces­ 
	    <lb/>sity of preaching the gospel is acknowledged, it is 
	    <lb/>best also, if possible, to pursue that course which will 
	    <lb/>not excite the suspicions of a cruel and despotic 
	    <lb/>government. The secluded situation of the house 
	    <lb/>which we now occupy, had considerable influence 
	    <lb/>upon our minds. It is situated upon no public road, 
	    <lb/>and is almost entirely concealed from the view of 
	    <lb/>passengers by lofty trees. This we conceive to be an 
	    <lb/>important reason why so few inquire concerning the 
	    <lb/>gospel. The house which is now building stands 
	    <lb/>upon one of the roads which lead to the great pa­ 
	    <lb/>goda. The passing there is immense, especially on 
	    <lb/>worship days. We trust our American friends  will 
	    <lb/>pray that from the house which we devote to the 
	    <lb/>service of God, streams of salvation may flow to all 
	    <lb/>the surrounding country.</p>

Hitherto preparations only had been making. Now, 
	  <lb/>the most essential part of a missionary's work was 
	  <lb/>actually commenced: I mean the public preaching of 
	  <lb/>of the gospel. We had frequently been cast down, but 
	  <lb/>were not destroyed; we had been dejected, but not 
	  <lb/>forsaken; and now we saw the way gradually opening 
	  <lb/>for the promulgation of the gospel, while a variety of 
	  <lb/>circumstances combined to convince us, that God would 
	  <lb/>yet make it manifest, that he had not, thus far, conti­ 
	  <lb/>nued the mission for nought.</p>
        <p>

Our mission family, from two, had been increased 
	  <lb/>to six. (<persName>Mr</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Hough</persName> had embarked for <placeName>Ben­ 
	  <lb/>gal</placeName>.)  An unusual spirit of prayer and supplication 
	  <lb/>evidently existed among us, and it seemed the inquiry 
	  <lb/>of every individual, <said>What can, what shall we do, for 
	    <lb/>the conversion of the <name>Burmans</name>?</said>  And though our 
	  <lb/>newly arrived friends could not speak the language, 
	  <lb/>they were continually encouraging those of us who 
	  <lb/>could, and spent much time in prayer for them.</p>
        <p>

	  The <name>Zayat</name>, the Burman name for a place for public 
	  <lb/>worship, was erected. Centuries had rolled away, 
	  <lb/>millions of <name>Burmans</name> had been ushered into eternity, 
	  <lb/>and God, the Creator of the universe, had never before
	  <lb/>seen an altar erected in <placeName>Burmah</placeName> for Himself; had 
	  <lb/>never before heard the voice of prayer and praise as­ 
	  <lb/>cend in the Burman language. You, my dear Sir, 
	  <lb/>who have now become so intimately acquainted with 
	  <lb/>the circumstances of the mission, and have so minutely 
	  <lb/>followed us for the last six years, can easily imagine 
	  <lb/>the impulse and excitement produced by the preceding 
	  <lb/>consideration. From this time, <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> transmitted 
	  <lb/>to the corresponding Secretary, in the form of a jour­ 
	  <lb/>nal, every thing that occurred, of any interest; from

	  <lb/>duals of the mission family, you will perceive the ori­ 
	  <lb/>gin and progress of the first Christian church ever 
	  <lb/>established in the <placeName>Burman empire</placeName>: and though, in 
	  <lb/>point of numbers, the success has not bee splendid, 
	  <lb/>you will, I doubt not exclaim with us, <quote>What hath

<persName>Mr. Judson</persName> wrote thus:—<quote>Some 
	    <lb/>months have elapsed, since I had the opportunity of ad­ 
	    <lb/>dressing the Board. During this time, I have been em­ 
	    <lb/>ployed in reading <name>Burman</name>, holding conversations on re­ 
	    <lb/>ligion, writing some things preparatory to a more public 
	    <lb/>communication of the gospel, and superintending the 
	    <lb/>erection of a <name>Zayat</name>, a place of public resort. Since 
	    <lb/>brother <persName>Hough</persName> left <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, the remaining families are 
	    <lb/>so small as to be able to find accommodation, though 
	    <lb/>rather crowded, in the mission-house, and we conclud­ 
	    <lb/>ed to defer building another, and to appropriate a 
	    <lb/>small part of the sum remitted by you for that pur­ 
	    <lb/>pose (about two hundred dollars), to the erection of 
	    <lb/>a public place on one of the principal roads leading 
	    <lb/>from the city to the great pagoda. There it is our 
	    <lb/>intention, as fast as we are able to converse intel­ 
	    <lb/>ligibly, to spend a considerable part of our time; and, 
	    <lb/>if we find the attempt practicable under this govern­ 
	    <lb/>ment, to have stated public worship. We succeeded, 
	    <lb/>after much difficulty and delay, in purchasing a small 
	    <lb/>piece of ground, adjoining the mission premises, and 
	    <lb/>at the same time, opening on the public road; the 
	    <lb/>building is slowly going forward, and we hope will 
	    <lb/>be ready to receive company in about a month. The 
	    <lb/>measure seems, at present very promising, though it 
	    <lb/>may eventuate in our banishment from the country.

	    <lb/>It will, at least, draw us out of our present retired 
	    <lb/>and almost invisible situation, bring us into public 
	    <lb/>view, and make us accessible to the multitudes who 
	    <lb/>pass and repass on business and worship. O that it 
	    <lb/>may prove a <placeName>Bethel</placeName>, a house of prayer and praise!</quote></p>

          <p>There are several persons of whom we cherish 
	    <lb/>some hope; but our hopes have been so frequently

	    <lb/>There is certainly a considerable number, whose sen­

	    <lb/>say that I have ever met with a single person, on whose 
	    <lb/>mind were discoverable the <emph>special</emph> operations of the 
	    <lb/>Holy Spirit. The little number of inquirers is fre­ 
	    <lb/>quently diminished by removal to other parts of the 
	    <lb/>country, by death, or by a sudden alarm from govern­ 
	    <lb/>ment; and again enlarged by new acquaintances. 
	    <lb/>Thus a little light is, we hope, gradually spreading

	    <lb/>several poor heathen, wholly ignorant of their God 
	    <lb/>and Saviour, and, in a short time, enrich their minds 
	    <lb/>with precious truths, which with the Divine blessing, 
	    <lb/>are sufficient to save their souls. This is a privilege

	    <lb/>and conversations. But I hope, though with fear and

	    <lb/><placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, as I expected; and still earlier, had I not 
	    <lb/>been under a government, where I thought it prudent 
	    <lb/>to gain a considerable acquaintance with the language, 
	    <lb/>before commencing public operations, lest I should be 
	    <lb/>unable properly to vindicate my conduct, when called 
	    <lb/>to a judicial account.</p>
                <p>

The congregation to day consisted of fifteen per­ 
	    <lb/>sons only, besides children. Much disorder and inat­ 
	    <lb/>tention prevailed, most of them not having been accus­ 
	    <lb/>tomed to attend Burman worship. May the Lord 
	    <lb/>grant his blessing on attempts made in great weakness, 
	    <lb/>and under great disadvantages; and all the glory will 
		  <lb/>be His!</p>

                <p rend="break(no)first-indent(0)">This evening I went, for the second 
	    <lb/>time, to hear a popular Burman preacher. On our 
		  <lb/>arrival, we found a <name>Zayat</name>, in the precincts of one of
	    <lb/>the most celebrated pagodas, lighted up, and the floor 
	    <lb/>spread with mats. In the centre was a frame raised 
	    <lb/>about eighteen inches from the ground, where the 
	    <lb/>preacher on his arrival, seated himself. He appeared 
	    <lb/>to be about forty-five years old, of very pleasant coun­ 
	    <lb/>tenance, and harmonious speech. He was once a 
	    <lb/>priest, but is now a layman. The people, as they 
	    <lb/>came in, seated themselves on the mats, the men on 
	    <lb/>one side of the house, and the women on the other. 
	    <lb/>It was an undistinguished day, and the congregation 
	    <lb/>was very small, not more than one hundred. When 
	    <lb/>we entered, some said, <said>There come some wild fo­ 
	      <lb/>reigners;</said>  but when we sat down properly, and took 

<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">G</mw>

	    <lb/>off our shoes, they began to say, <said>No, they are not 
	      <lb/>wild; they are civilized.</said>  Some recognized me, and 
	    <lb/>said to one another, <said>It is the English teacher;</said> a 
	    <lb/>name by which I am commonly known. The preacher 
	    <lb/>soon took notice of us, entered into some conversation, 
	    <lb/>invited us to visit him, and so on; but on learning 
	    <lb/>that I was a missionary, or, in their idiom, a religion­ 
	    <lb/>making teacher, his countenance fell, and he said no 
	    <lb/>more. The people being now convened, one appointed 
	    <lb/>for the purpose, called three times for silence and at­ 
	    <lb/>tention. Each person then took the flowers and leaves 
	    <lb/>which had been previously distributed, and placing 
	    <lb/>them between his fingers, raised them to his head, and 
	    <lb/>in that respectful posture remained motionless, until
	    <lb/>the service was closed. This ceremony we of course 
	    <lb/>declined. When all things were properly adjusted, 
	    <lb/>the preacher closed his eyes, and commenced the ex­ 
	    <lb/>ercise, which consisted in repeating a portion from the 
	    <lb/>Burman sacred writings. His subject was the con­ 
	    <lb/>version of the two prime disciples of <persName>Gaudama</persName>, and 
	    <lb/>their subsequent promotion and glory. His oratory I 
	    <lb/>found to be entirely different from all that we call 
	    <lb/>oratory. At first, he seemed dull and monotonous; but 
	    <lb/>presently, his soft mellifluent tones won their way into 
	    <lb/>the heart, and lulled the soul into that state of calm­ 
	    <lb/>ness and serenity, which, to a Burman mind, somewhat 
	    <lb/>resembles the boasted perfection of their saints of old. 
	    <lb/>His discourse continued about half an hour; and at 
	    <lb/>the close, the whole assembly burst out into a short 
	    <lb/>prayer, after which, all rose and retired. This man 
	    <lb/>exhibits twice every evening, in different places. In­ 
	    <lb/>deed he is the only popular lay preacher in the place. 
	    <lb/>As for the priests, they preach on special occasions

In the forenoon the members of the mission family

          <p>Your affectionate letter of <date when="1818-01-27"><name>January</name> 27, 1818</date>, I 
	    <lb/>received on the arrival of our new missionary asso­

	    <lb/>which sailed for <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, but ill health prevented my

	    <lb/>which this mission passed during the last year. The 
	    <lb/>bright prospect which animated us just before <persName>Mr.
	      <lb/>Judson's</persName> departure for <placeName>Chittagong</placeName>, passed away in a 
	    <lb/>moment, and was succeeded by an apparently im­ 
	    <lb/>penetrable cloud. The arrival of the brethren <persName>C.</persName> and 
	    <lb/><persName>W.</persName> greatly rejoiced us, and caused us to feel that this 
	    <lb/>mission was still an object of the care of Providence. 
	    <lb/>But our rejoicings were quite checked by their both 
	    <lb/>being taken with bleeding at the lungs, and other 
<lb/>symptoms of debility. <persName>Brother Coleman</persName> has been gra­ 
	    <lb/>dually recovering, and is able to apply closely to the 
	    <lb/>study of the language, though he is still so weak at 
	    <lb/>the lungs as to be hardly heard when leading in prayer: 
	    <lb/>but brother <persName>Wheelock</persName> has been growing weaker, has 
	    <lb/>a violent cough, and every symptom of a fixed con­ 
	    <lb/>sumption. We have now given up all hope of his re­ 
	    <lb/>covery. We consider <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Col<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice>man</persName> a valuable 
	    <lb/>acquisition to the mission, enjoy much in their society, 
	    <lb/>and exceedingly regret that the present weak state of 
	    <lb/>his lungs forbids our expecting much from his public 
	    <lb/>labours for a length of time.</p>
          <p>

	    Since <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> has commenced public preaching 
	    <lb/>in the <name>Zayat</name>, I have begun again to have my female 
	    <lb/>meetings, which were given up, in consequence of 
	    <lb/>the scattered state of the <name>Burmans</name> around us, at the 
	    <lb/>time of our government difficulties. I attend with 
	    <lb/>them every <name>Wednesday</name> evening at seven o'clock, as 
	    <lb/>they are more at leisure in the evening than any other 
	    <lb/>time. My last meeting was very animating and the 
	    <lb/>appearance of the females (thirteen in number, all 
	    <lb/>young married women) very encouraging. Some of 
	    <lb/>them very inquisitive, and after spending two hours 
	    <lb/>seemed loth to go. One said, she appeared to herself 

<pb n="127"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">127</mw> 

	    <lb/>like a blind person just beginning to see. And another 
	    <lb/>said, she believed in Christ, prayed to him daily, and 
	    <lb/>asked what else was necessary to make her a real dis­ 
	    <lb/>ciple of Christ. I told her she must not only <emph>say</emph> that 
	    <lb/>she believed in Christ, but must believe with all her 
	    <lb/>heart. She again asked what were some of the evi­ 
	    <lb/>dences of believing with the heart. I told her the 
	    <lb/>manner of life would be changed; but one of the best 
	    <lb/>evidences she could obtain would be, when others 
	    <lb/>came to quarrel with her and use abusive language, if, 
	    <lb/>so far from retaliating, she felt a disposition to bear 
	    <lb/>with, to pity, and to pray for them. The Burman wo­ 
	    <lb/>men are particularly given to quarrelling, and to refrain 
	    <lb/>from it would be a most decided evidence of a change 
	    <lb/>of heart. But, my dear <persName>Mrs. S――</persName>, we have no rea­ 
	    <lb/>son to expect that the adversary of souls will let us 
	    <lb/>long go on quietly in our exertions to undermine his 
	    <lb/>kingdom here. Will he not make every possible exer­ 
	    <lb/>tion for the destruction of this infant cause?  Yes; 
	    <lb/>but though he rage, he can go no farther than the 
	    <lb/>length of his chain, which is held in the right hand of 
	    <lb/>Him, who loves his church, who keeps it as the apple 
	    <lb/>of his eye, and who, if any of his elect are among this 
	    <lb/>idolatrous people, will keep them from the destructive 
	    <lb/>influence of inferior power. <said>What though the hea­ 
	      <lb/>then rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? 
	      <lb/>What though the kings of the earth set themselves, 
	      <lb/>and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord 
	      <lb/>and his cause?  He that sitteth in the heavens shall 
	      <lb/>laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision. He 
	      <lb/>will set his son upon his holy hill, he will give the 
	      <lb/>heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of 
	      <lb/>the earth for his possession.</said>  These precious promises

	      <lb/>have everlasting strength,</quote> that He will yet look on us

Accompanying is a Siamese catechism, which I

	    <lb/>of the Siamese books into <name>English</name>, and would send it 
	    <lb/>to you if it was not so bulky and so much labour to 
	    <lb/>copy. It is an account of the incarnation of one of 
	    <lb/>their deities, when he existed in the form of a great 
	    <lb/>elephant! The perusal of it, I dare say, would afford 
	    <lb/>you much amusement, as well as excite your commi­

                      <p rend="break(no)first-indent(0)">The greater part of my time 
	    <lb/>for the last six months has been occupied in studying 
			  <lb/>and transcribing, in alphabetical arrangement, the <name>Pali 
	    <lb/>Abigdan</name>, or dictionary of the Pali language, affixing to 
	    <lb/>the Pali terms the interpretation in <name>Burman</name>, and again 
	    <lb/>transferring the Burman words to a dictionary, <name>Bur­ 
	      <lb/>man</name> and <name>English</name>. With the close of the year I have 
	    <lb/>brought this tedious work to a close; and find, that 
	    <lb/>the number of Pali words collected, amounts to about 
	    <lb/>four thousand. It has grieved me to spend so much 
			  <lb/>time on the <name>Pali</name>; but the constant occurrence of Pali 
	    <lb/>terms in every Burman book, made it absolutely 
	    <lb/>necessary.</p>
                      <p rend="pre()">The two languages are entirely distinct. The <name>Bur­ 
	    <lb/>man</name> is a language <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="la">sui generis</foreign>, peculiar to itself. It is 
	    <lb/>true we cannot know what affinity it has to some of 
	    <lb/>the Indo-Chinese languages, that are yet uninvesti­ 
	    <lb/>gated; but it is essentially different from the <name>Sung­ 
	    <lb/>skrit</name>, the parent of almost all the languages in <placeName>India</placeName> 
	    <lb/>Proper, and indeed from every language that has yet 
			  <lb/>come under the cognizance of <name>Europeans</name>.</p>
                      <p>	    The <name>Pali</name>, on the other hand, is a dialect of the 
	    <lb/><name>Sungskrit</name>, and was introduced into this country with 
	    <lb/>the religion of <name>Boodh</name>. This personage, whose pro­ 
			  <lb/>per name is <persName>G<choice><sic>ua</sic><corr>au</corr></choice>dama</persName>, appeared in
<placeName>Hindostan</placeName>, about 
	    <lb/>two thousand three hundred years ago, and gave a 
	    <lb/>new form and dress to the old transmigration system,

	    <lb/>which, in some shape or other, has existed time im­ 
	    <lb/>memorial. The <name>Brahmans</name>, in the mean time, dressed 
	    <lb/>up the system after their fashion; and these two mo­ 
	    <lb/>difications, <name>Brahmanism</name> and <name>Boodhism</name>, struggled for 
			  <lb/>the ascendency. At length, the family of <persName>G<choice><sic>ua</sic><corr>au</corr></choice>dama</persName>, 
	    <lb/>which had held the sovereignty of <placeName>India</placeName>, was de­ 
	    <lb/>throned, his religion was denounced, and his disciples 
	    <lb/>took refuge in <placeName>Ceylon</placeName> and the neighbouring countries. 
	    <lb/>In that island, about five hundred years after the de­ 
	    <lb/>cease and supposed annihilation of their teacher or 
	    <lb/>deity, they composed their sacred writings, in that 
	    <lb/>dialect of the <name>Sungskrit</name> which had obtained in <placeName>Cey­ 
	      <lb/>lon</placeName>; thence, they were conveyed, by sea, to the Indo­ 
		<lb/>Chinese nations. <name>Boodhism</name>, however, had gained 
	    <lb/>footing in <placeName>Burmah</placeName>, before the arrival of the sacred 
			  <lb/>books from <placeName>Ceylon</placeName>. It is commonly maintained, that 
	    <lb/>it was introduced by his emissaries before his death.</p>
                      <p>It is obvious, that the introduction of a new reli­ 
	    <lb/>gion, and new sacred writings, must have great effect 
	    <lb/>on the language of a people. And, accordingly, (not 
	    <lb/>to speak of the influence which the <name>Pali</name> has had on 
	    <lb/>the general construction of the Burman language,) a 
	    <lb/>considerable number of words in common use, and a 
	    <lb/>very great proportion of theological terms, are of <name>Pali</name> 
	    <lb/>origin. Thus, though the Pali is now a dead lan­ 
	    <lb/>guage, cultivated by the learned only, some knowledge 
	    <lb/>of it is indispensable to one who would acquire a per­ 
	    <lb/>fect knowledge of the <name>Burman</name>, and especially to a 
	    <lb/>missionary, who intends to translate the Scriptures, 
	    <lb/>and who ought, therefore, above all others, to be per­ 
	    <lb/>fectly acquainted with the terms he employs.</p>
                      <p>With these views, I was desirous of laying a little 
	    <lb/>foundation for such further improvements in the lan­

	      <lb/>the Burman religion, and of the truth of the Chris­ 
	      <lb/>tian. I cannot possibly penetrate their motives. 
	      <lb/>Whether, after several visits, they meet with some 
	      <lb/>threatening suggestion, that awakens their fears of 
	      <lb/>persecution; or whether, at a certain stage in their 
	      <lb/>inquiries, they get such an insight into the gospel, as

                <p>	  In my last, I mentioned <persName>Mr. Judson's</persName> com­

	  <lb/>braced the Christian religion, and given good evidence

	  <lb/>event, this single trophy of victorious grace, has filled 
	  <lb/>our hearts with sensations hardly to be conceived by 
	  <lb/><name>Christians</name> in Christian countries. This circumstance 
	  <lb/>has convinced us, that God can and does operate on

	  <lb/>makes his own truths, his own word, the instrument 
	  <lb/>of operation. It serves also to encourage us to hope

	  <lb/>and pitied men that he suffered death in their stead. 
	  <lb/>My mind is sore on account of the sins I have com­ 
	  <lb/>mitted during the whole of my life, particularly in 
	  <lb/>worshipping a false god. Our religion, pure as it 
	  <lb/>may be, does not purify the minds of those who be­ 
	  <lb/>lieve it—it cannot restrain from sin. But the religion 
	  <lb/>of <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> makes the mind pure. His disciples 
	  <lb/>desire not to grieve him by sinning. In our religion 
	  <lb/>there is no way to escape the punishment due to sin; 
	  <lb/>but, according to the religion of Christ, he himself 
	  <lb/>has died in order to deliver his disciples. I wish all 
	  <lb/>the <name>Burmans</name> would become his disciples; then we 
	  <lb/>should meet together as you do in your country; 
	  <lb/>then we should be all happy together in heaven. How 
	  <lb/>great are my thanks to <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> for sending 
	  <lb/>teachers to this country, and how great are my thanks 
	  <lb/>to the teachers for coming! Had they never come 
	  <lb/>and built that <name>Zayat</name>, I should never have heard of 
	  <lb/>Christ and the true God. I mourn that so much of 
	  <lb/>my life passed away before I heard of this religion. 
	  <lb/>How much I have lost!</quote>  It is peculiarly interesting 
	  <lb/>to see with what eagerness he drinks in the truths 
	  <lb/>from the Scriptures. A few days ago I was reading 
	  <lb/>with him Christ's sermon on the mount. He was 
	  <lb/>deeply impressed, and unusually solemn. <quote>These 
	    <lb/>words (said he) take hold on my very heart; they 
	    <lb/>make me tremble. Here God commands us to do 
	    <lb/>every thing that is good in secret, not to be seen of 
		    <lb/>men. How unlike our religion is this! When <name>Bur­ 
	    <lb/>mans</name> make offerings to the pagodas, they make a 
	    <lb/>great noise with drums and musical instruments, that 
	    <lb/>others may see how good they are. But this religion

	  <lb/>for yourselves treasures, &amp;c. he said, <quote>What words 
	    <lb/>are these! It does not mean that we shall take the 
	    <lb/>silver and gold from this world and carry them to

	  <lb/>opportunity to know more of him before he received

	    <lb/>of the report of the officers of yesterday, I went to the 
	    <lb/>government-house, intending to have a personal in­ 
	    <lb/>terview with the viceroy. After waiting two hours in 
	    <lb/>the levee hall, he made his appearance, and, on recog­ 
	    <lb/>nizing me, immediately inquired about the press and 
	    <lb/>types. I told him my story, and when he understood 
	    <lb/>that I was ignorant of the art of printing, he appeared 
	    <lb/>satisfied to let the matter rest. In the course of the few 
	    <lb/>words which passed between us, he said, that he wish­ 
	    <lb/>ed to get several Burman books printed. He seemed to 
	    <lb/>be more kindly disposed towards me than formerly; 
	    <lb/>but it seems impossible to introduce the subject of 
	    <lb/>religion in his presence, surrounded, as he always is, 
	    <lb/>with a crowd of courtiers and secretaries, petitioners, 
	    <lb/>and lawyers.</p>

	    <lb/>noon till quite dark. We conversed incessantly the 
	    <lb/>whole time; but I fear that no real impression is 
	    <lb/>made on his proud sceptical heart. He, however, 
	    <lb/>promised to pray to the eternal God, through <persName>Jesus 
	      <lb/>Christ</persName>, and appeared, at times, to be in deep thought. 
	    <lb/>He is a man of very superior argumentative powers. His

	    <lb/>were all gone, he conversed with some feeling; owned

	    <lb/>chosen people. His exercises have been of a much 
	    <lb/>stronger character than those of the others, and he 
	    <lb/>expresses himself in the most decided manner. He 
	    <lb/>desires to become a disciple in profession, as well as 
	    <lb/>in heart, and declares his readiness to suffer per­ 
	    <lb/>secution and death for the love of Christ. When I

	    <lb/>mand, and their own spiritual welfare; we felt that

	      <lb/>love; and we know that the Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, the 
	      <lb/>Divine Son, endured on account of all his disciples, 
	      <lb/>sufferings and death, even severe sufferings on a cross, 
	      <lb/>in their stead. On account of our sins, we were like 
	      <lb/>persons laden with a very heavy burden. On account 
	      <lb/>of our many sins, we found no deliverance, no place 
	      <lb/>of refuge, and our minds were distressed. In this 
	      <lb/>state remaining, the two teachers produced the sacred 
	      <lb/>system from the Scriptures, and we became informed 
	      <lb/>of the existence of the one God; and of the facts, 
	      <lb/>that the Divine Son, the Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, redeemed 
	      <lb/>with his sacred life all who love and trust in him, and 
	      <lb/>in order to save his disciples from hell suffered death 
	      <lb/>in their stead. Now we know, that we have sinned 
	      <lb/>against the sacred One, and we know, assuredly, that 
	      <lb/>if we become the disciples of the Divine Son, the 
	      <lb/>Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, we shall be saved from the hell 
	      <lb/>which we deserve. We desire to become disciples, 
	      <lb/>and with the two teachers, like children born of the 
	      <lb/>same mother, to worship the true God, and observe 
	      <lb/>the true religion.</p>

	      <lb/>or day, or hour. We, therefore, venture to beg of the

	      <lb/>ject of religion, very unfavourable to our missionary

	      <lb/>been more engaged than ever, in building pagodas,

	      <lb/>ligion, being determined to embrace nothing, but 
	      <lb/>what he found unobjectionable and impregnable. 
	      <lb/><said>What (said he), do you think that I would pay you 
		<lb/>the least attention, if I found you could not answer 
		<lb/>all my questions, and solve all my difficulties?</said>  He 
	      <lb/>then proceeded to say, that he really believed in God, 
	      <lb/>his Son <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, the atonement, &amp;c. Said I 
	      <lb/>(knowing his deistical weakness), <said>Do you believe all 
		    <lb/>that is contained in the book of <title><persName>St. Matthew</persName></title>, that I 
		<lb/>have given you?  In particular, do you believe that
		<lb/>the Son of God died on a cross?</said> <said>Ah(replied he),
		<lb/>you have caught me now. I believe that he suffered 
		<lb/>death; but I cannot admit that he suffered the shame­ 
		<lb/>ful death of the cross.</said>  <said>Therefore (said I), you are 
		<lb/>not a disciple of Christ. A true disciple inquires not 
		<lb/>whether a fact is agreeable to his own reason, but 
		<lb/>whether it is in the book. His pride has yielded to 
		<lb/>the Divine testimony. Teacher, your pride is still 
		<lb/>unbroken. Break down your pride, and yield to the 
		<lb/>word of God.</said>  He stopt, and thought. <said>As you 
		<lb/>utter these words (said he), I see my error: I have 
		<lb/>been trusting in my own reason, not in the word of 
		<lb/>God.</said>  Some interruption now occurred. When we 
	      <lb/>were again alone, he said, <said>This day is different from 
		<lb/>all the days on which I have visited you. I see my 
		<lb/>error in trusting in my own reason; and I now believe 
		<lb/>the crucifixion of Christ, because it is contained in 
		<lb/>the Scripture.</said>  Some time after, speaking of the un­ 
	      <lb/>certainty of life, he said, he thought he should not be 
	      <lb/>lost, though he died suddenly. Why?  <said>Because I 
		<lb/>love <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>.</said>  Do you really love him?  <said>No 
		<lb/>one that really knows him, can help loving him.</said>  And 
	      <lb/>so he departed.</p>

	    <lb/>hear them read their lessons, and am now going to 
	    <lb/>spend the remaining hour, while the Burman teacher 
	    <lb/>looks over them, in writing to you. How curious 
	    <lb/>would the sounds, kwa kwaa, kwe kwee, kwo, kwoo, 
	    <lb/>&amp;c. which are now ringing in my ears, sound in yours! 
	    <lb/>Yet, uncouth as they would appear to you, or as they 
	    <lb/>did, at first, to me, they have now become musical, 
	    <lb/>and when considered as introductory to an acquaint­

	    <lb/>pleasant sensations. But, in order that you may see 
	    <lb/>me, just as I am situated, I will be a little particular 
	    <lb/>in describing the school. The <name>Zayat</name>, in which it is 
	    <lb/>kept, is situated thirty or forty rods from the mission­ 
	    <lb/>house, and in dimensions is twenty-seven by eighteen 
	    <lb/>feet. It is raised four feet from the ground, and is 
	    <lb/>divided into three parts. The first division is laid en­

	    <lb/>tirely open to the road, without doors, windows, or a 
	    <lb/>partition in the front side, and takes up a third part of 
	    <lb/>the whole building. It is made of bamboo and thatch, 
	    <lb/>and is the place where <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> sits all the day 
	    <lb/>long, and says to the passers by, <said>Ho! every one 
	      <lb/>that thirsteth,</said> &amp;c. The next, and middle division, is 
	    <lb/>a large airy room, with four doors and four windows, 
	    <lb/>opening in opposite directions, made entirely of boards, 
	    <lb/>and is white-washed, to dinstinguish it from the other 
	    <lb/><placeName>Zayats</placeName> around us.</p>
                <p>	    In this room, we have public worship in <name>Burman</name> 
	    <lb/>on the <name>Sabbath</name>; and, in the middle of it I am now 
	    <lb/>situated at my writing-table, while six of the male 
	    <lb/>scholars are at one end, each with his torch and black 
	    <lb/>board, over which he is industriously bending, and 
	    <lb/>emitting the sounds above described. The third, and 
	    <lb/>last division, is only an entry way, which opens into 
	    <lb/>the garden, leading to the mission-house.</p>
                <p>In this apartment all the women are seated, with 
	    <lb/>their lights and black boards, much in the same po­ 
	    <lb/>sition and employment as the men. The black boards on 
	    <lb/>which all the <name>Burmans</name> learn to read and write, answer 
	    <lb/>the same purpose as our slates. They are about a yard 
	    <lb/>in length, made black with charcoal and the juice of a 
	    <lb/>leaf, and letters are clearly imprinted with a species of 
	    <lb/>white stone, a little similar to our slate pencils. A lesson 
	    <lb/>is written out on this board by an instructor, and when 
	    <lb/>a scholar is perfect master of it, it is erased, and a 
	    <lb/>new one written. The <name>Burmans</name> are truly systematic 
	    <lb/>in their elementary instructions, and a scholar is not 
	    <lb/>considered qualified to read without spelling, until he 
	    <lb/>has a perfect knowledge if all the various combina­ 
	    <lb/>tions of the letters.</p>

                <p rend="break(no)first-indent(0)">When I wrote the above, I intended 
	    <lb/>writing a little every evening; but my time has been 
	    <lb/>so completely occupied, during this last month, together 
	    <lb/>with the increasing weakness of my eyes, that I have 
	    <lb/>not found an hour's leisure, until this evening. Our 
	    <lb/>school is getting on well, though in number it has 
	    <lb/>diminished rather than increased. Two of the scholars, 
	    <lb/>who began with their letters, are now reading without 
	    <lb/>spelling; and it is a truth, which affords no little 
	    <lb/>satisfaction, that their knowledge of letters is first 
	    <lb/>employed in reading a catechism, concerning the 
	    <lb/>eternal God, and his Son <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, of whom they 
	    <lb/>never heard, till they met with us. Thus they will 
	    <lb/>insensibly obtain ideas of their Creator, and ever, in 
	    <lb/>after life, associate the ideas of religion and reading. 
	    <lb/>We begin to see the word of God taking effect around 
	    <lb/>us. The <name>Burmans</name> <emph>now</emph> believe that we have come 
	    <lb/>here to do them good, and seek their advantage. Dur­ 
	    <lb/>ing four or five years, they supposed, notwithstand­ 
	    <lb/>ing our assertions to the contrary, that we had come 
	    <lb/>here merely to obtain their wisdom, and to return to 
	    <lb/>our native country, to communicate it to others. But 
	    <lb/>seeing, after we had acquired their language, that 
	    <lb/>instead of returning, we built a place for public wor­ 
	    <lb/>ship, in which <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> spends all his time in preach­ 
	    <lb/>ing the new religion, they changed their opinion; 
	    <lb/>and some of them acknowledge that it must be a sin­ 
	    <lb/>gular religion, and one worthy of attention, to pro­ 
	    <lb/>duce such effects. Three <name>Burmans</name> now give good 
	    <lb/>evidence of being real <name>Christians</name>, though only one has 
	    <lb/>been baptized. Two or three others give us much 
	    <lb/>encouragement, and we hope will prove to be real 
	    <lb/><name>Christians</name>. <persName>Moung Nau</persName>, I mentioned, in my last

	    <lb/>letter, as being the first Burman convert. <persName>Moung 
	      <lb/>Thahlah</persName> has been serious for a long time, and has, of 
	    <lb/>late, given us reason to hope that he is a true <name>Chris­ 
	      <lb/>tian</name>. He is an amiable young man, and considerably 
	    <lb/>superior to the common <name>Burmans</name>. The love of 
	    <lb/>Christ, in dying for sinners, appears to have deeply 
	    <lb/>impressed his mind, and he speaks of it with much 
	    <lb/>feeling. He says, <said>The love of Christ is no common 
		    <lb/>love. Besides <persName>Jesus</persName>, I see no way of salvation.</said>  He 
	    <lb/>has a clear and distinct understanding of the way of 
	    <lb/>salvation by Christ, reads the Testament much, and 
	    <lb/>unties with us, daily, in family worship, which is con­ 
	    <lb/>ducted both in <name>English</name> and <name>Burman</name>. It is very ani­ 
	    <lb/>mating to see the solemnity of these two <name>Burmans</name>, 
	    <lb/>when they come to worship; and we often feel, that if 
	    <lb/>we see no further success, we are amply recompensed 
	    <lb/>for the years of darkness and anxiety, which we have 
	    <lb/>passed here.</p>
                <p><persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Colman</persName> are still with us; the only 
	    <lb/>two, out of the six, who have joined us since we 
	    <lb/>have lived in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. We are very happy in their 
	    <lb/>society. They are entirely devoted to the work of 
	    <lb/>the mission, and make every thing subservient to its 
	    <lb/>promotion and prosperity. They apply closely to the 
	    <lb/>study of the language, in which they have made great 
	    <lb/>proficiency. We esteem it a peculiar favour in Pro­ 
	    <lb/>vidence, that our only remaining associates, and, 
	    <lb/>indeed, our only society in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, should, in 
	    <lb/>every respect, be of the right stamp. Our mission, 
	    <lb/>on the whole, is in a more prosperous state than 
	    <lb/>we have hardly dared to hope it ever would be, 
	    <lb/>under this capricious government. We trust a 
	    <lb/>little vine is here planted, which is so enclosed and

	    <lb/>to prevent its destruction by the wild beasts of the 
	    <lb/>forest.</p>
                <p>We have two or three interesting inquirers, who, 
	    <lb/>we hope, will finally be brought to a saving knowledge 
	    <lb/>of the truth. But we want more labourers, who are 
	    <lb/>already qualified to enter on this work. <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> 
	    <lb/>not only finds his hands full, but abundantly more 
	    <lb/>employment than he is able to perform. His eyes and 
	    <lb/>head, of late, have been considerably affected, which 
	    <lb/>prevents his going on with the translation of the 
	    <lb/>Scriptures as he intended.</p>

                <p rend="break(no)first-indent(0)">We have had the inexpressible 
	    <lb/>pleasure of witnessing the baptism of two <name>Burmans</name>, 
	    <lb/>since my last date, who gave good evidence of being 
	    <lb/>true <name>Christians</name>. One is <persName>Moung Thahlah</persName>, whom I 
	    <lb/>have mentioned above, and the other is the oldest 
	    <lb/>member of the school, by <persName>Moung Byaay</persName>. He 
	    <lb/>has been indefatigable in learning to read, though the 
	    <lb/>only spare time he had was in the evening, after he 
	    <lb/>had been working hard through the day. The first 
	    <lb/>thing he began to read, without spelling, was the 
	    <lb/>catechism, which he committed to memory as he 
	    <lb/>read. He soon began to inquire more particularly 
	    <lb/>concerning the religion of Christ, and manifested an 
	    <lb/>ardent desire to become a true disciple. We trust his 
	    <lb/>inquiries have issued in a saving knowledge of the 
	    <lb/>truth. The two last mentioned disciples were bap­ 
	    <lb/>tized rather privately, on account of the general
	    <lb/>alarm which has prevailed of late among our ac­ 
	    <lb/>quaintance. But, instead of wondering that they 
	    <lb/>were desirous of being baptized in private, we felt 
	    <lb/>that it was a strong evidence in their favour, that 

<pb n="176"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">176</mw>


	    <lb/>they should desire baptism at all, under existing cir­ 
	    <lb/>cumstances.</p>
                <p>Our three Burman converts now have a prayer­ 
	    <lb/>meeting among themselves, every <name>Sabbath</name> evening, 
	    <lb/>besides uniting with <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> twice in a week, 
	    <lb/>and with us all every day in family worship. 
	    <lb/>Their appearance is so different from common 
	    <lb/><name>Burmans</name> that we are led to exclaim, <said>What hath God 
	      <lb/>wrought!</said></p>
                <p><persName>Mr. Judson</persName> has written to the Board a particular 
	    <lb/>account of the persecuting spirit, which has, of late, 
	    <lb/>been manifested. We feel more for our converts than 
	    <lb/>we do for ourselves, as they would be the first to feel 
	    <lb/>the effects of a tyrannical, despotic government.</p>
                <p>Situated as we now are, you will readily imagine 
	    <lb/>we feel the necessity of committing ourselves and this 
	    <lb/>infant church into the hands of our heavenly Father, 
	    <lb/>and of waiting his guidance and direction. The ad­ 
	    <lb/>versary of souls could not patiently see us going on 
	    <lb/>prosperously, without making a struggle to overthrow 
	    <lb/>us. But how much he will be able to effect, is known 
	    <lb/>only to Him, who is our guardian and protector, and 
	    <lb/>who will restrain the remainder of that wrath, which 
	    <lb/>will not redound to his own glory.</p>
                <p>We have lately been obliged to shut up the <name>Zayat</name> 
	    <lb/>altogether, and all our inquirers have forsaken us, 
	    <lb/>except one, a very learned man, who still visits us, 
	    <lb/>though rather privately. A spirit of persecution has 
	    <lb/>begun to manifest itself, and so alarmed all our ac­ 
	    <lb/>quaintance, that they have quite discontinued their 
	    <lb/>visits. This falling off at the <name>Zayat</name> has determined 
	    <lb/><persName>Mr. Judson</persName> to make the only and last attempt, that of 
	    <lb/>presenting a memorial to the young king. We are

<pb n="177"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">177</mw>

	    <lb/>now all engaged in making preparations for the jour­ 
	    <lb/>ney. <persName>Brother Colman</persName> accompanies <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>. <persName>Mrs. 
	      <lb/>Colman</persName> and myself remain in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. I felt very 
	    <lb/>desirous of going, as the lady of the old viceroy, who 
	    <lb/>is my particular friend, is now at <placeName>Ava</placeName>, and would 
	    <lb/>give me a very favourable reception. Her husband is 
	    <lb/>next in rank to the king, and has the management of 
	    <lb/>all the affairs of the kingdom. But <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> 
	    <lb/>thinks it too hazardous an undertaking, as no foreign

	    <lb/>What will be the result of this expedition, we leave 
	    <lb/>for God to determine, on whom <mcr>alone</mcr> we <mcr>depend</mcr>, and 
	    <lb/>to whom <mcr>alone</mcr> we <mcr>look</mcr> for success. If he is now

	    <lb/>has work to do for us elsewhere, we desire to sub­ 
	    <lb/>mit, and acquiesce in his sovereign will. It is now an

	    <lb/>A temporary deck of bamboos is laid throughout, and 
	    <lb/>on the hinder part of the boat, the sides are raised 
	    <lb/>with thin boards, and a covering of thatch and mats 
	    <lb/>tied on, so as to form two low rooms, in which we 
	    <lb/>can just sit, and lie down. Our company consists of 
	    <lb/>sixteen, besides ourselves—ten rowmen—a steersman 
	    <lb/>—a headman, whose name is inserted in our passport, 
	    <lb/>and who, therefore, derives a little authority from

	    <lb/>of view; when we considered also, that there ought 
	    <lb/>to be a congruity between the present and our character, 
	    <lb/>we selected that book, which we hope to be allowed 
	    <lb/>to translate under his patronage—the <mcr rend="slant(upright)case(allcaps)">Bible</mcr>, in six 
	    <lb/>volumes, covered with gold leaf, in Burman style,

	    <lb/>after the boat, until a projecting point shut <placeName>Rangoon</placeName> 
	    <lb/>and all its scenes from our view. When shall we re­ 
	    <lb/>double this little point?  Through what shall we 
	    <lb/>pass, ere the scene now snatched away be re-present­

	    <lb/>however it may terminate, is unavoidably fraught with 
	    <lb/>consequences momentous and solemn, beyond all con­ 
	    <lb/>ception. We are penetrating into the heart of one of 
	    <lb/>the great kingdoms of the world, to make a formal 
	    <lb/>offer of the gospel to a despotic monarch, and through 
	    <lb/>him, to the millions of his subjects. May the Lord

<lb/>the motley scene. All conspired to suggest those

<lb/>though not comparable to such ruins as those of <placeName>Pal­

<lb/><persName>Anan-ra-tha-men-zan</persName>, disseminated the doctrines of
<lb/>atheism, and taught his disciples to pant after annihi­
<lb/>lation, as the supreme good. Some of the ruins before
<lb/>our eyes, were probably the remains of pagodas de­
<lb/>signed by himself. We looked back on the centuries
<lb/>of darkness that are passed. We look forward, and
<lb/>Christian hope would fain brighten the prospect.—
<lb/>Perhaps we stand on the dividing line of the empires
<lb/>of darkness and light. O, shade of <persName>Shen Ah-rah-han</persName>!
<lb/>weep o'er thy falling fanes; retire from the scenes of 
<lb/>thy past greatness. But thou smilest at my feeble
<lb/>voice. Linger then, thy little remaining day. A voice
<lb/>mightier than mine, a still small voice, will ere long
<lb/>sweep away every vestige of thy dominion. The
<lb/>churches of <persName>Jesus</persName> will soon supplant these idolatrous
<lb/>monuments, and the changing of the devotees of <name>Boodh</name>
<lb/>will die away before the Christian hymn of praise.</p>

<lb/>called on <persName>Mr. G.</persName>, late collector of <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, and on
<lb/><persName>Mr. R.</persName>, who was formerly collector, but is now out of
<lb/>favour. Thence we entered the city, passed the
<lb/>palace, and repaired to the house of <persName>Mya-day-men</persName>,
<lb/>former viceroy of <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, now one of the public
			  <lb/>ministers of state (<foreign xml:lang="my">Woon-gyee</foreign>). We gave him a
<lb/>valuable present, and another of less value to his wife,
<lb/> the lady who formerly treated <persName>Mrs. Judson</persName> with so
<lb/>much politeness. They both received us very kindly,
<lb/>and appeared to interest themselves in our success.
<lb/>We however did not disclose our precise object; but
<lb/>only petitioned leave to behold the golden face. Upon
<lb/>this his highness committed our business to <persName>Moung
<lb/>Yo</persName>, one of his favourite officers, and directed him to
<lb/>introduce us to <persName>Moung Zah</persName>, one of the private mi­
<lb/>nisters of state (<foreign xml:lang="my">A-twen-woon</foreign>), with the necessary
			  <lb/>orders. This particular favour of <persName>Mya-day-men</persName> pre­
<lb/>vents the necessity of our petitioning and feeling all
<lb/>the public ministers off state, and procuring formal
<lb/>permission from the high court of the empire.</p>
                      <p>
In the evening, <persName>Moung Yo</persName>, who lives near our
<lb/>boat, called on us, to say that he would conduct us
<lb/>to-morrow. We lie down in sleepless anxiety. To-
<lb/>morrow's dawn will usher in the most eventful day of
<lb/>our lives. To-morrow's eve will close on the bloom
<lb/>or the blight of our fondest hopes. Yet it is con­
<lb/>soling to commit this business into the hands of our
<lb/>heavenly Father,—to feel that the work is His, not
<lb/>ours; that the heart of the monarch, before whom we
<lb/>are to appear, is under the controul of Omnipotence;
<lb/>and that the event will be ordered in the manner most
<lb/>conducive to the divine glory and the greatest good.
<lb/>God may, for the wisest purposes, suffer our hopes to
<pb n="185"/>

<mw type="pageNum">185</mw>
<lb/>be disappointed; and if so, why should short-sighted,

                      <p rend="break(no)first-indent(0)">We left the boat, and put ourselves
<lb/>under the conduct of <persName>Moung Yo</persName>. He carried us first
<lb/>to <persName>Mya-day-men</persName>, as a matter of form; and there we
<lb/>learnt, that the emperor had been privately apprized
<lb/>of our arrival, and said, <said>Let them be introduced.</said>
<lb/>We therefore proceeded to the palace. At the outer
<lb/>gate, we were detained a long time, until the various
<lb/>officers were satisfied that we had a right to enter;
<lb/>after which we deposited a present for the private mi­
<lb/>nister of state, <persName>Moung Zah</persName>, and were ushered into
<lb/>his apartments in the palace-yard. He received us
<lb/>very pleasantly, and ordered us to sit before several
<lb/>governors and petty kings, who were waiting at his
<lb/>levee. We here, for the first time, disclosed our cha­
<lb/>racter and object—told him that we were missionaries,
<lb/>or <quote>propagators of religion;</quote> that we wished to ap­
<lb/>pear before the emperor, and present our sacred books,
<lb/>accompanied with a petition. He took the petition
<lb/>into his hand, looked over about half of it, and then
<lb/>familiarly asked several questions about our God and
<lb/>our religion, to which we replied. Just at this crisis,
<lb/>some one announced that the golden foot was about to
<lb/>advance; on which the minister hastily rose up, and
<lb/>put on his robes of state, saying, that he must seize
<lb/>the moment to present us to the emperor. We now
<lb/>found, that we had unwittingly fallen on an unpropitious
<lb/>time, it being the day of the celebration of the late
<lb/>victory over the <name>Cassays</name>, and the very hour when his
<lb/>majesty was coming forth to witness the display made
<lb/>on the occasion. When the minister was dressed, he
<pb n="186"/>
<milestone n="I9v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">186</mw>
<lb/>just said, <said>How can you propagate religion in this
<lb/>empire? But come along.</said> Our hearts sunk at these
<lb/>inauspicious words. He conducted us through various
<lb/>splendour and parade, until we ascended a flight of
<lb/>stairs, and entered a most magnificent hall. He di­
<lb/>rected us where to sit, and took his place on one
<lb/>side; the present was placed on the other, and <persName>Moung
<lb/>Yo</persName>, and another officer of <persName>Mya-day-men</persName>, sat a little
<lb/>behind. The scene to which we were now introduced
<lb/>really surpassed our expectation. The spacious extent
<lb/>of the hall, and the number and magnitude of the pillars,
<lb/>the height of the dome, the whole completely covered
<lb/>with gold, presented a most grand and imposing spec­
<lb/>tacle. Very few were present, and those evidently
<lb/>great officers of state. Our situation prevented us
<lb/>from seeing the further avenue of the hall; but the
<lb/>end, where we sat, opened into the parade, which the
<lb/>emperor was about to inspect. We remained above
<lb/>five minutes, when every one put himself into the
<lb/>most respectful attitude, and <persName>Moung Yo</persName> whispered,
<lb/>that his majesty had entered. We looked through the
<lb/>hall, as far as the pillars would allow, and presently
<lb/>caught sight of this modern <persName>Ahasuerus</persName>. He came
<lb/>forward, unattended—in solitary grandeur, exhibiting
<lb/>the proud gait and majesty of an eastern monarch.
<lb/>His dress was rich, but not distinctive; and he carried
<lb/>in his hand the gold-sheathed sword, which seems to
<lb/>have taken the place of the sceptre of ancient times.
<lb/>But it was his high aspect and commanding eye that
<lb/>chiefly rivetted our attention. He strided on. Every
<lb/>head, excepting ours, was now in the dust. We re­
<lb/>mained kneeling, our hands folded, our eyes fixed on
<lb/>the monarch. When he drew near, we caught his at­
<pb n="187"/><milestone n="I10r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">187</mw>
<lb/>tention. He stopped, partly turned towards us—<said>Who
<lb/>are these?</said> <said>The teachers, great king,</said> I replied.
<lb/><said>What, you speak <name>Burman</name>—the priests that I heard
<lb/>of last night?</said> <said>When did you arrive?</said> <said>Are you
<lb/>teachers of religion?</said> <said>Are you like the Portugese
<lb/>Priest?</said> <said>Are you married?</said> <said>Why do you dress so?</said>
<lb/>These, and some other similar questions, we answered;
<lb/>when he appeared to be pleased with us, and sat down
<lb/> on an elevated seat, his hand resting on the hilt of his
<lb/>sword, and his eyes intently fixed on us. <persName>Moung Zah</persName>
<lb/>now began to read the petition and it ran thus:—</p>
                      <p>
                        <quote>The American teachers present themselves to re­
<lb/>ceive the favour of the excellent king, the sovereign
<lb/>of land and sea. Hearing that, on account of the
<lb/>greatness of the royal power, the royal country was
<lb/>in a quiet and prosperous state, we arrived at the town
<lb/>of <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, within the royal dominions, and having
<lb/>obtained leave of the governor of that town, to come
<lb/>up and behold the golden face, we have ascended, and
<lb/>reached the bottom of the golden feet. In the great
<lb/>country of <placeName>America</placeName>, we sustain the character of teach­
<lb/>ers and explainers of the contents of the sacred Scrip­
<lb/>tures of our religion. And since i<choice><sic>s</sic><corr>t</corr></choice> is contained in
<lb/>those Scriptures, that, if we pass to other countries,
<lb/>and preach and propagate religion, great good will result, and both those who teach, and those who re­
<lb/>ceive the religion, will be freed from future punish­
<lb/>ment, and enjoy, without decay or death, the eternal
<lb/>felicity of heaven,—that royal permission be given,
<lb/>that we, taking refuge in the royal power, may preach
<lb/>our religion in these dominions, and that those who
<lb/>are pleased with our preaching, and wish to listen to
<pb n="188"/>
<milestone n="I10v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">188</mw>
<lb/>and be guided by it, whether foreigners or <name>Burmans</name>,
<lb/>may be exempt from government molestation, they
<lb/>present themselves to receive the favour of the ex­
<lb/>cellent king, the sovereign of land and sea.</quote>
                      </p>
                      <p>
The emperor heard this petition, and stretched
<lb/>out his hand. <persName>Moung Zah</persName> crawled forward and pre­
<lb/>sented it. His majesty began at the top, and delibe­
<lb/>rately read it through. In the mean time, I gave
<lb/><persName>Moung Zah</persName> an abridged copy of the tract, in which
<lb/>every offensive sentence was corrected, and the whole
<lb/>put into the handsomest style and dress possible.
<lb/>After the emperor had perused the petition, he handed
<lb/>it back without saying a word, and took the tract.
<lb/>Our hearts now rose to God for a display of his grace.
<lb/><said>O, have mercy on <placeName>Burmah</placeName>! Have mercy on her
<lb/>king!</said> But, alas! the time was not yet come. He
<lb/>held the tract long enough to read the two first sen­
<lb/>tences, which assert that there is one eternal God,
<lb/>who is independent of the incidents of mortality, and
<lb/>that beside him, there is no God; and then, with an
<lb/>air of indifference, perhaps disdain, he dashed it down
<lb/>to the ground! <persName>Moung Zah</persName> stooped forward, picked
<lb/>it up, and handed it to us. <persName>Moung Yo</persName> made a slight
<lb/>attempt to save us, by unfolding one of the volumes
<lb/>which composed our present, and displaying its beau­
<lb/>ty; but his majesty took no notice. Our fate was
<lb/>decided. After a few moments, <persName>Moung Zah</persName> interpreted
<lb/>his royal master's will, in the following terms: <said>In
<lb/>regard to the objects of your petition, his majesty
<lb/>gives no order. In regard to your sacred books, his
<lb/>majesty has no use for them, take them away.</said></p>
                      <p>
Something was now said about brother <persName>Colman's</persName>
<pb n="189"/>
<milestone n="I11r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">189</mw>
<lb/>skill in medicine; upon which the emperor once more
<lb/>opened his mouth, and said, <said>Let them proceed to the
<lb/>residence of my physician, the Portuguese priest;
<lb/>let him examine whether they can be useful to me
<lb/>in that line, and report accordingly.</said> He then rose
<lb/>from his seat, strided on to the end of the hall, and
<lb/>there, after having dashed to the ground the first in­
<lb/>telligence that he had ever received of the eternal
<lb/>God, his Maker, his Preserver, his Judge, he threw
<lb/>himself down on a cushion, and lay listening to the
<lb/>music, and gazing at the parade spread out before him.</p>
                      <p>
As for us and our present, we were hurried away,
<lb/>without much ceremony. We passed out of the pa­
<lb/>lace gates with much more facility than we entered,
<lb/>and were conducted first to the house of <persName>Mya-day-men</persName>.
<lb/>There his officer reported our reception; but in as
<lb/>favourable terms as possible; and as his highness was
<lb/>not apprized of our precise object, our repulse ap­
<lb/>peared probably to him, not so decisive as we knew it
<lb/>to be. We were next conducted two miles, through
<lb/>the sun and dust of the streets of <placeName>Ava</placeName>, to the residence
<lb/>of the Portuguese priest. He very speedily ascer­
<lb/>tained that we were in possession of no wonderful
<lb/>secret, which would secure the emperor from all dis­
<lb/>ease, and make him live for ever; and we were accord­
<lb/>ingly allowed to take leave of the reverend Inquisitor,
<lb/>and retreat to our boat.</p>
                      <p>
At this stage of the business, notwithstanding the
<lb/>decided repulse we had received, we still cherished
<lb/>some hope of ultimately gaining our point. We re­
<lb/>gretted that a sudden interruption had prevented our
<lb/>explaining our objects to <persName>Moung Zah</persName>, in that familiar
<lb/>and confidential manner which we had intended; and
<pb n="190"/>
<milestone n="I11v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">190</mw>
<lb/>we detemined, therefore to make another attempt
<lb/>upon him in private.</p>

                      <p rend="break(no)first-indent(0)">Early in the morning we had the
<lb/>pleasure of seeing our friend, <persName>Mr. G.</persName>, coming to our
<lb/>boat. It may not be amiss to mention, that he is the
<lb/>collector who was chiefly instrumental in relieving us
<lb/>from the exorbitant demand, which, a few months ago
<lb/>was made upon us in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. He now told us that
<lb/>he had heard of our repulse, but would not have us
<lb/>give up all hope; that he was perfectly acquainted
<lb/>with <persName>Moung Zah</persName>, and would accompany us to his
<lb/>house, a little before sunset, at an hour when he was
<lb/>accessible. This precisely accorded with our inten­
<lb/>tions.</p>
                      <p>
In the afternoon, therefore, we called on <persName>Mr. G.</persName>.
<lb/>and he went with us into the city. On the way, we
<lb/>paid a visit to the wife of the present vieceroy of <placeName>Ran­
<lb/>goon</placeName>, whose eldest son is married to the only daugh­
<lb/>ter of the present emperor. We carried a present,
<lb/>and were, of course, kindly recceived.</p>
                      <p>
Thence we went to the house of <persName>Moung Zah</persName>,
<lb/>some way beyond the palace. He received us with
<lb/>great coldness and reserve. The conversation which
<lb/>we carried on, chiefly through <persName>Mr. G.</persName>, it is unnecessary
<lb/>to detail. Suffice it to say that we ascertained, beyond
<lb/>a doubt, that the policy of the Burman government,
<lb/>in regard to the toleration of any foreign religion, is
<lb/>precisely the same with the <name>Chinese</name>:that it is quite
<lb/>out of the question, whether any of the subjects of the
<lb/>emperor, who embrace a religion different from his
<lb/>own, will be exempt from punishment; and that we,
<lb/>in presenting a petition to that effect, had been guilty
<lb/>of a most egregious blunder, an unpardonable offence.
<pb n="191"/>
<milestone n="I12r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">191</mw>
<lb/><persName>Mr. G.</persName> urged every argument that we suggested, and
<lb/>some others. He finally stated, that if we obtained
<lb/>the royal favour, other foreigners would come and
<lb/>settle in the mpire, and trade would be greatly bene­
<lb/>fited. This argument alone seemed to have any effect
<lb/>on the mind of the minister; and looking out from
<lb/>the cloud which covered his face, he vouchsafed to
<lb/>say, that if we would wait some time, he would en­
<lb/>deavour to speak to his majesty about us. From this
<lb/>remark it was impossible to derive any encouragement,
<lb/>and having nothing further to urge, we left <persName>Mr. G.</persName>,
<lb/>and bowing down to the ground, took leave of this
<lb/>great minister of state, who under the emperor, guides
<lb/>the movements of the whole empire.</p>
                      <p>
It was now evening. We had four miles to walk
<lb/>by moon light. Two of our disciples only followed
<lb/>us. They had pressed as near as they ventured to the
<lb/>door of the hall of audience, and listened to words
<lb/>which sealed the extinction of their hopes and ours.
<lb/>For some time we spoke not.

<lb/>And, as our first parents took their solitary way
<lb/>through <placeName>Eden</placeName>, hand in hand, so we took our way
<lb/>through this great city, which, to our late imagination,
<lb/>seemed another <placeName>Eden</placeName>; but now, through the magic
<lb/>touch of disappointment, seemed blasted and withered,
<lb/>as if smitten by the fatal influence of the cherubic
<lb/>sword.</p>
                      <p>
Arrived at the boat, we threw ourselves down
<pb n="192"/>

<mw type="pageNum">192</mw>
<lb/>completely exhausted in body and mind. For three
<lb/>days we had walked eight miles a day, most of the
<lb/>way in the heat of the sun, which, even at this season,
<lb/>in the interior of these countries, is exceedingly op­
<lb/>pressive; and the result of our travels and toils has
<lb/>been—the wisest and best possible—a result, which if
<lb/>we could see the end from the beginning, would call
<lb/>forth our highest praise. O, slow of heart to believe
<lb/>and trust in the overruling agency of our own
<lb/>Almighty Saviour!</p>

                      <p>
I now thought of one more expedient; and

<lb/>down, I handed it to <persName>Mr. G</persName>. This is a brief view of

<lb/>mised to do his best.</p>
                      <p>
Before leaving us, he communicated the im­
<lb/>portant intelligence, that the emperor, flushed with
<lb/>his late victory over the <name>Cassays</name>, had determined on
<lb/>war with <placeName>Siam</placeName>, and intended, next fall, to march in
<lb/>person to <placeName>Pegue</placeName>, below <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, and there establish

                      <p>
After <persName>Mr. G.</persName> left us, we went to visit <persName>Mr. R</persName>.
<lb/>We were formerly acquainted with him in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>;
<lb/>and he would now have assisted us, had he not been
<lb/>out of the favour of the new emperor. We related
<lb/>all our proceedings, and the disappointment of our
<lb/>hopes. I knew it would be so, replied he, when you
<lb/>first called on me; but I was not willing to dis­
<lb/>courage you from making trial for yourselves. He
<lb/>then related the following story, with the substance
<lb/>of which we were previously acquainted:</p>
                      <p>
About fifteen years ago, the <rs type="properAdjective">Roman Catholic</rs>
<lb/>priests converted to their faith a Burman teacher of
<lb/>talents and distinction. They took great pains to
<lb/>indoctrinate him thoroughly in their religion, and
<lb/>entertained great hope of his usefulness in their cause.
<lb/>After his return from <placeName>Rome</placeName>, whither they had sent
<lb/>him to complete his Christian education, he was
<lb/>accused by his nephew, a clerk in the high court of
<lb/>the empire, of having renounced the established
<lb/>religion. The emperor, who, it must be remembered,
<lb/>was far from approving the religion of <name>Boodh</name>,
<lb/>ordered that he should be compelled to recant. The
<lb/>nephew seized his uncle, cast him into prison and
<mw rend="align(center)" type="sig">K</mw>
<pb n="194"/>
<milestone n="K1v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">194</mw>
<lb/>fetters, caused him to be beat and treated unmerci­
<lb/>fully; and at length had recourse to the torture of the
<lb/>iron mall. With this instrument he was gradually
<lb/>beaten, from the ends of his feet up to his breast,
<lb/>until his body was little else but one livid wound.
<lb/><persName>Mr. R.</persName> was one of those that stood by and gave
<lb/>money to the executioners, to induce them to strike
<lb/>gently. At every blow, the sufferer pronounced the
<lb/>name of Christ; and declared, afterwards, that he
<lb/>felt but little or no pain. When he was at the point
<lb/>of death, under the hands of his tormentors, some
<lb/>persons, who pitied his case, went to the emperor,
<lb/>with a statement, that he was a madman, and knew
<lb/>not what he was about; on which the emperor gave
<lb/>orders for his release. The <name>Portuguese</name> took him
<lb/>away, concealed him until he was able to move, and
<lb/>sent him privately in a boat to <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, and thence
<lb/>by ship to <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, where he finished his days. Since
<lb/>then, the Roman priests, of whom there are only four
<lb/>in the country, have done nothing in the way of pro­
<lb/>selyting, but confined their labours to their own
<lb/>flocks, which are composed of the descendants of
<lb/>foreigners. The man who accused his uncle, is now

<lb/>had gone off, we called on <persName>Mr. G</persName>. He informed us
<lb/>that the tract had been presented to <persName>Moung Zah</persName>, and
<lb/>read in his presence. After listening to the whole of
<lb/>it, instead of throwing it down, or even returning it,
<lb/>he committed it to one of his people to keep, saying

<lb/>moned before the emperor. His majesty, among other
<lb/>things, inquired about the foreign teachers. <persName>Mr.G.</persName>
<lb/>told him our country, our character, and our object.
<lb/>The emperor observed that the Portuguese priest had
<lb/>told him very different things; particularly, that
<lb/>we were a sect of <name>Zandees</name> (a race very obnoxious to
<lb/>former emperors). <persName>Mr. G.</persName> endeavoured to vindicate
<lb/>our character; but the emperor appeared quite averse
<lb/>to hearing any thing in our favour. What, said he,
<lb/>laughing, they have come, presuming to convert us to
<lb/>their religion! Let them leave our capital. We have
<lb/>no desire to receive their instructions. Perhaps they

This suggestion to <persName>Mr. G.</persName> occupied our thoughts

<lb/>more rapid than our ascent. Here, to our great sur­
<lb/>prise, we met with the teacher, <persName>Moung Shway-gnong</persName>.
<lb/>He had come up from <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, a few days ago, to
<lb/>visit an old acquaintance, who was dangerously ill;
<lb/>expects to return shortly; would gladly go with us,
<lb/>if we could wait a day or two. We stated to him all
<lb/>our adventures at court, the distressing result of the
<lb/>expedition, and the present danger of propagating or
<lb/>professing the religion of Christ, and wound off with
<lb/>the story of the iron mall. He appeared to be less
<lb/>affected and intimidated by the relation than we could
<lb/>have expected. Indeed, his language was rather too
<lb/>high for the occasion. I therefore told him that it
<lb/>was not for him that we were concerned, but for those
<lb/>who had become disciples of Christ. When they were
<lb/>accused and persecuted, they could not worship at the
<lb/>pagodas, or recant before the Mangen teacher. He
<lb/>felt the force of the reflection, and tried to explain his
<lb/>past conduct. <said>Say nothing,</said> said I; <said>one thing you
<lb/>know to be true, that, when formerly accused, if you
<lb/>had not, in some way or other, satisfied the mind of
<lb/>the Mangen teacher, your life would not now be re­
<lb/>maining in your body.</said> <said>Then,</said> said he, <said>if I must
<lb/>die, I shall die in a good cause. I know it is the cause
<lb/>of truth.</said> He then repeated, with considerable em­
<lb/>phasis, the most prominent points of his present faith,
<lb/>as follows:—<said>I believe in the Eternal God, in his Son
<lb/><persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, in the atonement which Christ has made,
<lb/>and in the writings of the apostles, as the true and
<pb n="198"/>
<milestone n="K3v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">198</mw>
<lb/>only word of God.</said> <said>Perhaps,</said> continued he, <said>you
<lb/>may not remember, that during one of my last visits,
<lb/>you told me, that I was trusting in my own under­
<lb/>standing, rather than in the Divine word. From that
<lb/>time I have seen my error, and endeavour to re­
<lb/>nounce it. You explained to me also the evil of wor­
<lb/>shipping at pagodas, though I told you, that my heart
<lb/>did not partake in the worship. Since you left <placeName>Ran­
<lb/>goon</placeName>, I have not lifted up my folded hands before a
<lb/>pagoda. It is true, I sometimes follow the crowd, on
<lb/>days of worship, in order to avoid persecution; but I
<lb/>walk up one side of the pagoda, and walk down the
<lb/>other. Now, you say, that I am not a disciple. What
<lb/>lack I yet?</said> I was now satisfied that he had made a
<lb/>little advance since our last interview, which required
<lb/>a corresponding advance on my side. I replied, there­
<lb/>fore, <said>Teacher, you may be a disciple of Christ in
<lb/>heart, but you are not a full disciple. You have not
<lb/>faith and resolution enough to keep all the commands
<lb/>of Christ, particularly that which requires you to be
<lb/>baptized, though in the face of persecution and death.
<lb/>Consider the words of <persName>Jesus</persName>, just before he returned
<lb/>to heaven, <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">He that believeth, and is baptized, shall
<lb/>be saved.</said></said> He received this communication in pro­
<lb/>found silence, and with that air, which I have observed
<lb/>to come upon him, when he takes a thing into serious
<lb/>consideration. Soon after, I hinted our intention of
<lb/>leaving <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, since the emperor had virtually pro­
<lb/>hibited the propagation of the Christian religion, and
<lb/>no <name>Burman</name>, under such circumstances, would dare to
<lb/>investigate, much less to embrace it. This intelligence
<lb/>evidently aroused him, and showed us that we had more
<lb/>interest in his heart than we thought. <said>Say not so,</said>
<pb n="199"/>
<milestone n="K4r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">199</mw>
<lb/>said he, <said rend="post()">there are some who will investigate, notwith­
<lb/>standing; and rather than have you quit <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, I
<lb/>will go myself to the Mangen teacher, and have a
<lb/>public dispute. I know I can silence him. I know
<lb/>the truth is on my side.</said> <said>Ah,</said> said I, <said>you may have
<lb/>a tongue to silence him, but he has a pair of fetters
<lb/>and an iron mall to subdue you! Remember that.</said> This
<lb/>was the substance of our conversation, though much more prolix; and he left us about 9 o'clock at night.</p>
                      <p>This interview furnished matter for conversation
<lb/>till past midnight, and kept us awake much of the re­
<lb/>mainder of the night. Perhaps, on arriving in <placeName>Ran­
<lb/>goon</placeName>, we shall find the disciples firm, and some others
<lb/>seriously inquiring. Perhaps we shall discover some
<lb/>appearances of a movement of the Divine Spirit. Per­
<lb/>haps the <persName>Lord Jesus</persName> has a few chosen ones, whom he
<lb/>intends to call in, under the most unpropitious and
<lb/>forbidding circumstances. Perhaps he intends to
<lb/>show, that it is not by might, nor by power, but by
<lb/>his Spirit. In a word, perhaps, in the last extremity,
<lb/>God will help us. Ought we, then, hastily to forsake
<lb/>the place? Ought we to desert those of the disciples
<lb/>that we cannot take with us, and some others, for
<lb/>whom Christ died, in such an interesting crisis of their
<lb/>fate? Would it be rashness to endeavour to trust in
<lb/>God, and maintain the post, though disallowed by
<lb/>government, and exposed to persecution? But, again,
<lb/>can we bear to see our dear disciples in prison, in fet­
<lb/>ters, under torture? Can we stand by them, and
<lb/>encourage them to bear patiently the rage of their
<lb/>persecutors? Are we willing to participate with them?
<lb/>Though the spirit may be sometimes almost willing,
<lb/>is not the flesh too weak?</p>

                      <p>Pondering on such topics as these, a little ray of
<lb/>hope seemed to shine out of the darkness of our de­
<lb/>spair. But it was not like the soft beam of the moon,
<lb/>which kindly shines on the path of the benighted pil­
<lb/>grim, and guides him to a place of shelter. It was
<lb/>rather like the angry gleam of lightning, which, while
<lb/>for a moment it illumines the landscape around, dis­
<lb/>closes the black magazines of heaven's artillery, and
<lb/>threatens death to the unwary gazer.</p>

<lb/>have a full understanding of the dangers of their pre­
<lb/>sent condition, and the reasons of our intended depar­
<lb/>ture from <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. We expected, that after being
<lb/>destitute of all the means of grace for some time, and
<lb/>after seeing their teachers driven away from the pre­
<lb/>sence of their monarch in disgrace, they would be­
<lb/>come cold in their affections, and have but little

<lb/>to persecution. We thought, that if one out of the

<lb/>sonably hope for. But how delightfully were we dis­
<lb/>appointed! They all, to a man, appeared immoveably
<lb/>the same, yea, rather advanced in zeal and energy.
<lb/>They vied with each other, in trying to explain away
<lb/>difficulties, and to convince us that the cause was not
<lb/>yet quite desperate. <said>But whither are the teachers
<lb/>going?</said> was, of course, an anxious inquiry. We told
<lb/>them, that it was our intention never to desert <placeName>Bur­

<lb/>a time, those parts of the empire which are imme­

<lb/>country, lying between <placeName>Bengal</placeName> and <placeName>Arrakan</placeName>, which,
<lb/>though under the government of <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, is chiefly in­
<lb/>habited by <name>Arrakanese</name>, who speak a language similar
<lb/>to the <name>Burman</name>, the district being really a part of <placeName>Arra­
<lb/>kan</placeName>, one component part of the present Burman
<lb/>empire; that formerly a teacher from <placeName>Bengal</placeName> (<persName>De
<lb/>Bruyn</persName>) lived at <placeName>Chittagong</placeName>, the principal town in that
<lb/>district, and baptized several converts, who, at his
<lb/>death, were left destitute of all instruction to the pre­
<lb/>sent time; and that, in view of these considerations,
<lb/>it was our purpose to proceed thither, in hope of find­
			  <lb/>ing that toleration which was denied us in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>.
<lb/>We then asked them severally what they would do?
<lb/><persName>Moung Nau</persName> had previously told us that he would fol­
<lb/>low us to any part of the world. He was only afraid
<lb/>that he should be a burden to us; for, not being ac­
<lb/>quainted with another language, he might not be able
			  <lb/>to get his living in a st<choice><sic/><corr>r</corr></choice>ange land. <said>As for me,</said> said
<lb/><persName>Moung Thahlah</persName>, <said>I go where preaching is to be had.</said>
<lb/><persName>Moung Byaay</persName> was silent and thoughtful. At last he
<lb/>said, that as no Burman woman is allowed to leave
<lb/>the country, he could not, on account of his wife, fol­
<lb/>low the teachers; but (continued, he, with some pa­
<lb/>thos), if I must be left here alone, I shall remain per­
<lb/>forming the duties of <persName>Jesus Christ's</persName> religion; no other
<lb/>shall I think of. This interview with the disciples

<lb/>petition that you will not leave <placeName>Rangoon</placeName> at present.</said>
<lb/><said>I think,</said> replied I, <said>that it is useless to remain under

<lb/>we cannot have public worship; no <name>Burman</name> will dare
<lb/>to examine this religion; and if none examine, none
<lb/>can be expected to embrace it.</said> <said>Teacher,</said> said he,
<lb/><said>my mind is distressed; I can neither eat nor sleep,
<lb/>since I find you are going away. I have been around
<lb/>among those who live near us, and I find some who are
<lb/>even now examining the new religion. <persName>Brother
<lb/>Myat-yah</persName> is one of them, and he unites with me in my
<lb/>petitions. (Here <persName>Myat-yah</persName> assented that it was so.)
<lb/>Do stay with us a few months. Do stay till there are
<lb/>eight or ten disciples. Then appoint one to be the teacher
<lb/>of the rest; I shall not be concerned about the event;
<lb/>though you should leave the country; the religion will
<lb/>spread of itself. The emperor himself cannot stop it.
<lb/>But if you go now, and take the two disciples that can
<lb/>follow, I shall be left alone. I cannot baptize those
<lb/>who may wish to embrace this religion. What can I
<lb/>do?</said> <persName>Moung Nau</persName> came in, and expressed himself in
<lb/>a similar way. He thought, that several would yet
<lb/>become disciples, notwithstanding all opposition, and
<lb/>that it was best for us to stay a while. We could not
<lb/>restrain our tears at hearing all this; and we told them,
<lb/>that as we lived only for the promotion of the cause of
<lb/>Christ among the <name>Burmans</name>, if there was any prospect
<lb/>of success in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, we had no desire to go to ano­

<lb/>pleasant man, who came to live in our yard just before
<lb/>we went to <placeName>Ava</placeName>, accompanied <persName>Moung Myat-yah</persName> to the
<lb/>usual evening worship. When we were about breaking
<lb/>up, <persName>Moung Thalah</persName> began conversation, by saying,
<lb/><said>Teacher, your intention of going away, has filled us
<lb/>all with trouble. Is it good to forsake us thus? Not­
<lb/>withstanding present difficulties and dangers, it is to
<lb/>be remembered, that this work is not yours or ours, but
<lb/>the work of God. If he give light, the religion will
<lb/>spread. Nothing can impede it.</said> After conversing
<lb/>some time, I found that <persName>Moung Louk</persName>, another inhabi­
<lb/>tant of the yard, had been listening without. Accord­
<lb/>ingly, he was invited to take his seat with the inquirers.
<lb/><persName>Moung Byaay</persName> now began to be in earnest, his arm was
<lb/>elevated, and his eyes brightened. <said>Let us all,</said> said
<lb/>he, <said rend="post()">make an effort. As for me, I will pray. Only
<lb/>leave a little church of ten, with a teacher se tover
<lb/>them, and I shall be fully satisfied.</said> <persName>Moung Nau</persName> took
<lb/>a very active part in the conversation. The three new
<lb/>ones said nothing, except that they were desirous of
<lb/>considering the religion of Christ. Neither of them
<lb/>however, was willing to admit, that as yet, he believed
<lb/>any thing.</p>
                      <p>We felt that it was impossible for us <emph>all</emph> to leave
<lb/>these people, in these interesting circumstances; and,
<lb/>at the same time, we felt it very important that <placeName>Chitta­
<lb/>gong</placeName> should not be neglected. Under these circum­
<lb/>stances we came to the conclusion, that <persName>Brother Col­
<lb/>man</persName> should proceed immediately to <placeName>Chittagong</placeName>, collect
<lb/>the Arrakanese converts, and form a station, to which
<lb/>new missionaries from the Board might at first repair,
<lb/>and to which I might ultimately flee, with those of the

<lb/>disciples that could leave the country, when we found

<lb/>I should remain in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, until the state of things
<lb/>became thus desperate, and then endeavour to join
<lb/><persName>brother C.</persName> in <placeName>Chittagong</placeName>; but that if, contrary to our

<lb/>He had considered (he said) my last words, that one
<lb/>must believe and be baptized, in order to be a full
<lb/>disciple; it was his desire to be such; and he wanted
<lb/>to know what outward rules, in particular, he must ob­
<lb/>serve, in case he should become a professor. I told
<lb/>him, that the disciples of Christ, after baptism, were
<lb/>associated together; that they assembled every Lord's
<lb/>day for worship; and that, from time to time, they
<lb/>received the sacrament of bread and wine. I then
<lb/>warned him of the danger of self-deception, and of
<lb/>the persecution to which disciples were exposed in this
<lb/>country, and advised him to reconsider the matter
<lb/>most thoroughly, before he made a definite request for

<lb/>have been with me several hours; but the interview
<lb/>has afforded very little encouragement. The former
<lb/>said but little on his own account—appearing chiefly
<lb/>desirous of convincing and persuading his friend, that
<lb/>he might gain (as I secretly suspected), some com­
<lb/>panion of his own rank in life, before he embraced the
<lb/>new religion. The latter acted on the defensive, and
<lb/>spent all his time in raising objections. He was ready
<lb/>to admit, that the atheistic system of the <name>Boodhists</name> was
<lb/>not tenable; but endeavoured to fortify himself on a
<lb/>middle system, between that and the <name>Christian</name>; the
<pb n="206"/>
<milestone n="K7v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">206</mw>
<lb/>very system in which <persName>Moung Shway-gnong</persName> formerly
<lb/>rested, and which for distinction's sake, may be fitly
<lb/>termed the semi-atheistic. Its fundamental doctrine is,
<lb/>that Divine wisdom, not concentrated in an existing
<lb/>spirit, or embodied in any form, but diffused throughout
<lb/>the universe, and partaken in different degrees by
<lb/>various intelligences, and in a very high degree by the
<lb/><name>Boodhs</name>, is the true and only God. This poor system,
<lb/>which is evidently guilty of suicide, <persName>Oo Yan</persName> made
<lb/>every possible effort to keep alive; but I really think,
<lb/>that, in his own mind, he felt the case to be hopeless.
<lb/>His mode of reasoning, however, is soft, insinuating,
<lb/>and acute; and so adroitly did he act his part, that
<lb/><persName>Moung Shway-gnong</persName>, with his strong arm, and I, with

<lb/>former stayed later than the others, and attended
<lb/>evening worship. I asked him, whether there was
<lb/>any point in the Christian system, on which he had
<lb/>not obtained satisfaction. He replied that he was not
<lb/>yet satisfied as to the propriety of God's appointing
<lb/>one particular day in the week, for assembling
<lb/>together, in distinction from all other days. I saw,
<lb/>at once, why he had always been so remiss in attend­
<lb/>ing worship on the Lord's day; and I therefore pro­
<lb/>ceeded to state the nature of positive commands, and
<lb/>their peculiar excellence, as the best test of obedience;
<lb/>that it was evidently beneficial for the disciples of
<lb/>Christ to assemble sometimes; that God, in appoint­
<lb/>ing that such an assembly should be held at least one
<lb/>day in seven, must be supposed to be guided by
<pb n="207"/><milestone n="K8r" unit="sig"/><mw type="pageNum">207</mw>
<lb/>wisdom, infinitely transcending that of the man; that
<lb/>if the disciples of Christ are to meet once at least
<lb/>in seven days, it is evidently best to have the day of
<lb/>meeting designated, in order to secure their general
<lb/>union and concert; and that the first day of the week
<lb/>had at least this claim to preference, that it was the
<lb/>day on which our Saviour rose from the dead. I
<lb/>descanted on these points to his apparent satisfaction;
<lb/>but let us see whether he will come next Lord's
<lb/>day.</p>

<lb/>the necessity of assembling on the Lord's day.
<lb/>Found that the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's
<lb/>supper are, in his mind, liable to similar objections.
<lb/>Forsook, therefore, all human reasoning, and rested
<lb/>the merits of the case on the bare authority of Christ:
<lb/><quote>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command
<lb/>you.</quote> Notwithstanding the remains of his deistical
<lb/>spirit, however, I obtained, during this visit, more
<lb/>satisfactory evidence of his real conversion, than ever
<lb/>before. He said, that he knew nothing of an eternally
<lb/>existing God, before he met with me; that, on
<lb/>hearing that doctrine, he instantly believed it; but
<lb/>that it was a long time before he closed with Christ.
<lb/>Can you recollect the time? said I. Not precisely, he
<lb/>replied; but it was during a visit, when you dis­
<lb/>coursed concerning the Trinity, the Divine sonship of
<pb n="208"/><milestone n="K8v" unit="sig"/><mw type="pageNum">208</mw>
<lb/><persName>Jesus</persName>, and the great sufferings which he, though truly

<lb/>sudden, unexpected, and lamented death of this valu­

<lb/>tended with circumstances of mercy. <persName>Mr. Colman</persName>
<lb/>was permitted to live, until he had given to the Chris­

In <placeName>Chittagong</placeName> he might have lived comfortably in
<lb/>civilized Christian society, under the protection of the
<lb/>English government, and been usefully employed in
<lb/>missionary avocations. But in imitation of the Re­
<lb/>deemer, and prompted by feelings of compassion for im­
<lb/>mortal souls, he chose his residence in a native village,
<lb/>where he was surrounded by poverty, ignorance, and
<lb/>delusion, and where too, he fell a martyr to his zeal!<anchor xml:id="a07" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n07"/></p>

        <p>Happy <persName>Colman</persName>! The few short years he was al­
<lb/>lowed to labour on mission ground were faithfully im­

<lb/>whom he doubtless heard these transporting words:

                <p rend="first-indent(0)break(no)">Your letter of <date when="1821-08-28"><name>August</name><lb/>28th, 1821</date>, was duly received. While reading the
<lb/>account which it contains of the death of <persName>Mr. H.
<lb/>Pearce</persName>, I little suspected it would so speedily fall to
<lb/>my lot to communicate to you intelligence of a similar
<lb/>nature. Alas! it is my painful duty to mention a
<lb/>death, in which you are more deeply interested than
<lb/>in that of the above, and which, should you not have
<lb/>previously heard of it, will awaken in your bosom the
<lb/>tenderest sorrow. Your affectionate son, the amiable
<lb/>and dearly beloved companion of my joys and sorrows,
<lb/>is no more! How trying and mysterious are the dis­
<lb/>pensations of Providence! On the arrival of your
<lb/>letter, which was the <date when="1822-06-08">8th of <name>June</name></date>, <persName>Mr. C.</persName> was well,
<lb/>and enjoyed an unusual flow of spirits. He was
<lb/>warmly engaged in the cause of his Divine Master,
<lb/>and his life, to human appearance, was never more
<lb/>necessary. But, just at this interesting period, Infinite
<lb/>Wisdom saw fit to remove him. On the <date when="1822-06-28">28th of <name>June</name></date>
<lb/>he was attacked by an intermittent fever. He took
<pb n="213"/><milestone n="K11r" unit="sig"/><mw type="pageNum">213</mw>
<lb/>such medicines as are commonly used in similar cases.
<lb/>They produced a good effect; and such were the fa­
<lb/>vourable symptoms of his disease, and so slight his
<lb/>sufferings during the first five days, that neither of us
<lb/>apprehended the least danger. On the sixth day,
<lb/>however, he suddenly grew worse, and early in the
<lb/>evening the fever came on in a more alarming manner
<lb/>than it had done at any preceding time. I gave him
<lb/>some medicine, which considerably abated its violence.
<lb/>He became quite composed, and after speaking a few
<lb/>words to me, fell into a gentle sleep. I remained by
<lb/>him in a state of great anxiety, but still thought there
<lb/>was every appearance of his having a comfortable
<lb/>night, and I determined, as I saw his disorder increas­
<lb/>ing so fast, that should we both be spared until the
<lb/>next day, I would remove with him to <placeName>Chittagong</placeName>,
<lb/>hoping that a change of air might prove beneficial.
<lb/>But, alas! he was not permitted to behold the light of
<lb/>another sun. After remaining composed for a short
<lb/>time, I had the disappointment to perceive that he
<lb/>grew extremely restless. I awoke him; and, oh!
<lb/>what agony of mind I felt, when I found that delirium
<lb/>had made its approach! It was then about eleven
<lb/>o'clock. After this, the fever increased in a rapid and
<lb/>violent manner, and rendered ineffectual every effort
<lb/>which I made to save a life <emph>so dear to me</emph>. His suffer­
<lb/>ings were very extreme, until towards the close, when
<lb/>it pleased God to lessen their severity. Although
<lb/>unable to speak, yet he seemed entirely delivered from
<lb/>pain, and breathed his last without a groan or struggle.</p>
                <p>
I am sensible, my dear mother, that this event
<lb/>will be peculiarly trying to you. I am sure it has left
<lb/>me most disconsolate and afflicted. It has indeed
<pb n="214"/>
<milestone n="K11v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">214</mw>
<lb/>been almost too much for my feeble nature to sustain.
<lb/>But, however severe  our sufferings, let us rest satisfied
<lb/>that the event has been ordered by unerring wisdom.
<lb/>If God condescends to number the hairs of our head,
<lb/>and to take notice of even the sparrow which falleth
<lb/>to the ground, certainly he is not indifferent to those
<lb/>events which relate to the prosperity of his own
<lb/>kingdom. God knew perfectly well what would be
<lb/>the result of our going to <name>Cox's Bazar</name>. It was ac­
<lb/>cording to his holy will that there <persName>Mr. C.</persName> should be
<lb/>visited with sickness, and that sickness should
<lb/>terminate in death. May we therefore be enabled to
<lb/>exercise that submission which is pleasing in his sight,
<lb/>and to say, with an afflicted saint of old, <quote>Though he
<lb/>slay me, yet will I trust in him!</quote></p>
                <p>
Let it also be our consolation, that the dear sub­
<lb/>ject of this letter was fully prepared for heaven, and
<lb/>that his happy spirit, now released from this world of
<lb/>sin and suffering, is enjoying the company of angels
<lb/>and glorified beings, and drinking full draughts of
<lb/>bliss from that river of pleasure which flows at the
<lb/>right hand of God and the Lamb. He did not put off
<lb/>the concerns of eternity until confined to a sick bed.
<lb/>No: while blest with health, and in the full possession
<lb/>of his rational powers, he made it his business to
<lb/>prepare for a dying hour. During the last eighteen
<lb/>months of his life, his mind was unusually solemn,
<lb/>and seemed to be under a strong presentiment that he
<lb/>should be early removed from this world. Frequently,
<lb/>when under the influence of these impressions, he
<lb/>has conversed in the most solemn and impressive
<lb/>manner respecting his own dissolution. One of these
<lb/>seasons, in particular, is deeply engraven on my me­
<pb n="215"/>
<milestone n="K12r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">215</mw>
<lb/>mory. Coming one day from his place of retirement,
<lb/>he seated himself by me, and when a placid and hea­
<lb/>venly air, conversed with me concerning an early se­
<lb/>paration, and intreated me to prepare my mind for
<lb/>such an event, as he fully believed his time on earth
<lb/>was short. He remarked, the prospect of death was
<lb/>animating, and that he had not a desire to live, but for
<lb/>my sake, and that of the poor heathen. You may
<lb/>well imagine, my dear mother, that the subject was
<lb/>then painful to my feelings; but it now affords me
<lb/>great satisfaction to reflect on these seasons. I believe
<lb/>that God was then preparing him for exactly the sudden
<lb/>death that awaited him, and for a state of heavenly
<lb/>existence.</p>
                <p>
I rejoice that you are surrounded by Christian
<lb/>friends, who will feel it their privilege to sympathize
<lb/>with you on this melancholy occasion. And may God,
<lb/>of his infinite mercy, pour into your bosom the balm
<lb/>of heavenly consolation, conduct you safely through
<lb/>this vale of tears, and at last, may we both have a
<lb/>happy re-union with our beloved friend in that world
<lb/>where distracting sorrows and separations are un­
<lb/>known!</p>

<lb/>occurred to him, that it might be proper to ask per­
<lb/>mission or license so to do. Not that he aspired to
<lb/>set up as a teacher; far from that; but he wanted to
<lb/>feel, that, in communicating the gospel, he was pro­
<lb/>ceeding in a regular, authorized manner. He thought
<lb/>that if two or three disciples could be raised in each
<lb/>of the large towns, it would much facilitate our ope­
<lb/>rations. He was sure that at least one in ten of his
<lb/>relations and friends, on hearing his story, could not
<lb/>help embracing the new religion. I secretly exulted
<lb/>at hearing his proposal, so evidently the result of
<lb/>Christian principle, and exhorted him to constant self-
<lb/>examination and prayer, as the means of discovering

<lb/>sence of just a month. He was soon followed by <persName>Oo

<lb/>with me; all appear hopeful. The teacher remained,
<lb/>as usual, after the others had left, and thereby afforded
<lb/>me an opportunity for private conversation. He ad­
<lb/>mitted that all his objections to positive commands
<lb/>were removed; and that it was his desire to be a full
<lb/>disciple; but when urged closely on the subject, he
<lb/>intimated that his wife and friends were opposed to
<lb/>his taking any decided step; and that if he did, he
<lb/>was, moreover, exposed to imminent danger of perse­
<lb/>cution and death. He mentioned these things with so
<lb/>much feeling, and such evident consciousness of sim­

<lb/>is, thy strength shall be,</said> and proposed the example
<lb/>of the apostles and martyrs, the glory of suffering for
<lb/>Christ, &amp;c. But the thought of the iron mall, and a

<lb/>tongue. We parted with much solemnity, understand­

<lb/>with the character of an infinitely holy, wise, and
<lb/>powerful God? He at length obtained such satisfac­
<lb/>tion, that he could not restrain laughing, from pure
<lb/>mental delight, and kept recurring to the subject, and
<lb/>repeating my remarks to those around him. He was
<lb/>accompanied, as usual, by his two friends, <persName>Moung
<lb/>Thay-ay</persName> and <persName>Moung Myat-lah</persName>, husband of <persName>Mah Men-
<lb/>lay</persName>. With these came also one <persName>Moung Yo</persName>, a disciple
<lb/>of <persName>Moung Shway-gnong</persName>, a poor man, but a sharp rea­
<lb/>soner. He was, or pretended to be, on the semi-
<lb/>atheistic plan. See <ref type="goTo" target="#a09"><date when="1820-03-10"><name rend="slant(italic)">March</name> 10th</date></ref>.
                 After ascertaining
<lb/>his precise ground, I used an argument, which, in a
<lb/>late combat with <persName>Oo Yan</persName>, I found quite invincible.
<lb/>It is simply this: <said>No mind, no wisdom—temporary
<lb/>mind, temporary wisdom—eternal mind, eternal wis­
<lb/>dom.</said> Now, as all the semi-atheists firmly believe in
<lb/>eternal wisdom, this concise statement sweeps, with

<lb/>irresistible sway, through the very joints and marrow
<lb/>of their system. And though it may to others seem
<lb/>rather simple and inconclusive; to one acquainted
<lb/>with Burman reasoning, its effect is uniformly deci­
<lb/>sive. No sooner is this short sentence uttered, than
<lb/>one significantly nods his head, as if to say, There you
<lb/>have it. Another cries out the oponent, You are
<lb/>undone, destroyed. Another says, Talk about wisdom;
<lb/>where else will you find it? The disputant himself,
<lb/>who was perhaps preparing a learned  speech about the
<lb/>excellence and efficacy and eternity of wisdom, quite
<lb/>disconcerted by this unexpected onset, sits looking at
<lb/>the wreck of his system, and wondering at the simple
<lb/>means which has spread such ruin around him; pre­
<lb/>sently he looks up (for the <name>Burmans</name> are frequently
<lb/>candid), and says, Your words are very appropriate.
<lb/>And perhaps his next question is, How can I become a
<lb/>disciple of the God you worship? All the visitors to-
<lb/>day, and indeed all the semi-atheists, are despisers of
<lb/><name>Gaudama</name>, and the established religion of the land.

This morning they came up in much trouble.
<lb/>They stated, that as they had fully embraced the
<lb/>Christian religion in their hearts, they could not re­
<lb/>main easy without being baptized, according to the
<lb/>command of Christ; that no man could tell whether
<lb/>I should ever return or not; and that it was their
<lb/>earnest petition, if I could possibly find time, and
<lb/>thought them worthy of the ordinance, that I would
<lb/>administer it to them before I went away. They did
<lb/>not wish me to go out to the usual place, as that was
<lb/>at some distance, but would be baptized in a small
<lb/>pond near the mission-house. <persName>Moung Gway</persName> said,
<lb/>that though he was very ignorant, he knew enough of
<lb/>this religion to love it sincerely, and to trust in Christ
<lb/>for salvation from all his sins. I re-examined them
<lb/>both, stated to them the great danger of professing a
<lb/>foreign religion, &amp;c. and on their urging their request,
<lb/>I told them I would baptize them in the evening.</p>
                <p>Was obliged to be out all the afternoon, getting
<lb/>our things aboard the ship, as we expect to move
<lb/>down the river to-morrow morning. At night bap­

<lb/>the close, <persName>Moung Shway-gnong</persName>, as if to bring things
<lb/>to a crisis, addressed me thus: <said>My lord teacher,
<lb/>there are now several of us present, who have long
<lb/>considered this religion. I hope that we are all be­
<lb/>lievers in <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>.</said> 
<said rend="pre()post()">I am afraid,</said> replied I, <said rend="pre()post()">to say
<lb/>that; however, it is easily ascertained; and let me
<lb/>begin with you, teacher. I have heretofore thought
<lb/>that you fully believed in the eternal God; but I have
<lb/>had some doubt whether you fully believed in the Son
<lb/>of God, and the atonement he has made.</said> <said>I assure you,</said>
<lb/>he replied, <said>that I am as fully persuaded of the latter
<lb/>as the former.</said> <said rend="pre()post()">Do you believe then,</said> I continued,
<lb/><said rend="pre()post()">that none but the disciples of Christ will be saved from
<lb/>sin and hell?</said> <said>None but his disciples.</said> <said rend="pre()post()">How then
<lb/>can you remain, without taking the oath of allegiance
<lb/>to <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, and becoming his full disciple, in body
<lb/>and soul?</said> <said>It is my earnest desire to do so, by re­
<lb/>ceiving baptism; and for the very purpose of express­
<lb/>ing that desire, I have come here to-day.</said> <said rend="pre()post()">You say,
<lb/>you are desirous of receiving baptism, may I ask, <emph>when</emph>
<lb/>you desire to receive it?</said> <said>At any time you will please
<lb/>to give it. Now—this moment, if you please.</said> <said rend="pre()post()">Do
<lb/>you wish to receive baptism in public or in private?</said>
<pb n="229"/>
<milestone n="L7r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">229</mw>
<lb/><said>I will receive it at any time, and in any circumstances
<lb/>that you please to direct.</said> I then said—<said rend="pre()post()">Teacher, I am
<lb/>satisfied, from your conversation, this forenoon, that
<lb/>you are a true disciple; and I reply, therefore, that I
<lb/>am as desirous of giving you baptism, as you are of
<lb/>receiving it.</said> This conversation had a great effect on
<lb/>all present. The disciples rejoiced; the rest were
<lb/>astonished; for though they have long thought that
<lb/>he believed the Christian religion, they could not
<lb/>think that such a man could easily be brought to
<lb/>profess it, and suffer himself to be put under the
<lb/>water by a foreigner. I then turned to <persName>Moung Thah-
<lb/>ay</persName>, one of the Nan-dau-gong people, who, I hope, is
<lb/>a true believer.—<said rend="pre()post()">Are you willing to take the oath of
<lb/>allegiance to <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>?</said> <said>If the teacher, <persName>Moung
<lb/>Shway-gnong</persName>, consents,</said> replied he, <said>why should I
<lb/>hesitate?</said> <said rend="pre()post()">And if he does not consent, what then?</said>
<lb/><said>I must wait a little longer.</said> <said rend="pre()post()">Stand by,</said> said I, <said rend="pre()post()">you
<lb/>trust in <persName>Moung Shway-gnong</persName>, rather than in <persName>Jesus
<lb/>Christ</persName>. You are not worthy of being baptized.</said> <persName>Moung
<lb/>Myat-lah</persName>, on being similarly interrogated, wished to
<lb/>consider a little longer. <persName>Oo Yan</persName> was still further from
<lb/>committing himself. Of the women present, I inter­
<lb/>rogated <persName>Mah Men-lay</persName> only. She had evidently a con­
<lb/>siderable struggle in her mind, probably on account of
<lb/>her husband's having just declined. At length, she
<lb/>said, if I thought it suitable for her to be baptized,
<lb/>she was desirous of receiving the ordinance. I told
<lb/>her, that her reply was not satisfactory. I could not
<lb/>consent to baptize any one, who could possibly remain
<lb/>easy without being baptized, and then I related the
<lb/>story of the two last disciples; after which the party
<lb/>broke up.</p>

<lb/>made his appearance; I again asked him whether he

<lb/>and he again left it to my decision: on which I advised

<lb/>the day—his deportment solemn—his conversation
<lb/>spiritual. Just at night, I called in two or three of
<lb/>the disciples, read the account of the baptism of the
<lb/>eunuch, made the baptismal prayer, and then pro­

<lb/>without obeying. I shall not be able to sleep this

<lb/>We had just finished, when, about nine o'clock, <persName>Mah

<lb/>to be baptized. The disciples present assented with­

<lb/>her, having been long satisfied that she had received
<lb/>the grace of Christ; and, it being very late, I led her
<lb/>out to the pond, near the house, by lantern light, and

<lb/>After I had prayed, <persName>Moung Thahlah</persName> and <persName>Moung Shway-

<lb/>came in, so that we had quite a house full. At noon
<lb/>we set out for the river, followed by near a hundred
<lb/>people, the women crying aloud, in the Burman man­
<lb/>ner, and almost all deeply affected. When we entered
<lb/>the boat,, I called the teacher and <persName>Mah Men-lay</persName>, and a
<lb/>few others, to go with us to the ship, which lay at
<lb/>some distance in the river. The rest remained on the

<lb/>her unfavourable symptoms have been all aggravated;
<lb/>and this morning, we received in writing the definitive
<lb/>opinion of <persName>Dr. Chalmers</persName>, that her disorder is a chro­

                <p>Have spent the past week in get­
<lb/>ting our things in order, and receiving visits from the
<lb/>disciples and inquirers. Yesterday, <persName>Moung Gway</persName>, the
<lb/>only one of the baptized whom we had not seen, re­
<lb/>turned from the woods, on hearing of our arrival; and
<lb/>I am now able to record (and I do it with the most
<lb/>heartfelt satisfaction and grateful praise to the pre­
<lb/>serving Saviour), that, though they have, for the space
<lb/>of six months, been almost destitute of the means of
<lb/>grace, and those who lived in our yard have been dis­
<lb/>persed, and forced, through fear of heavy extortion
<lb/>and oppression from petty officers of government, to
<lb/>fly into the woods, or take refuge under some govern­

<lb/>ment person who could protect them; yet not one of
<lb/>them has dishonoured his profession, but all remain
<lb/>firm in their faith and attachment to the cause, I do
<lb/>not, however, perceive that any of them have made
<lb/>the least advance in any respect whatever; nor was
<lb/>this to be expected, as they have not even enjoyed the
<lb/>privilege of meeting for worship.</p>
                <p rend="pre(“)break(yes)first-indent(1)">The same remarks are to be made concerning the
<lb/>four <placeName>Nan-dau-gong</placeName> people, companions of <persName>Mah Men-
<lb/>lay</persName>, who appeared to be hopefully pious before we left.
<lb/>The doctor <persName>Oo Yan</persName>, with whom we did not feel so
<lb/>well satisfied, has been with me repeatedly; and, in
<lb/>the last interview, gave good reason to hope that he
<lb/>also is a true convert. He seems at length to have
<lb/>obtained light and satisfaction on the two difficult
<lb/>points which have so long perplexed him; namely,
<lb/>the doctrine of vicarious atonement, and the possi­
<lb/>bility of being a disciple of Christ by keeping the
<lb/>two commands of grace: Repent and Believe; without
<lb/>perfectly keeping the two immutable commands of
<lb/>merit—Love God entirely, and Love others as your­
<lb/>self. O, how interesting is it to see (you can almost
<lb/>see it with your eyes) the light of truth dawning upon
<lb/>a precious soul, hitherto groping in darkness! If
<lb/><persName>Oo Yan</persName> prove a true convert, he will be a most pre­
<lb/>cious acquisition to our cause, next to <persName>Moung Shway-
<lb/>gnong</persName>. He is a man of talents and respectability.
<lb/>His words are as smooth as oil, as sweet as honey,
<lb/>and as sharp as a razor.</p>
                <p rend="pre(“)break(yes)first-indent(1)">In respect to <persName>Mah Baike</persName>, she has given way to her
<lb/>violent temper, and involved her husband in debt;
<lb/>and though she now professes to repent and desire
<lb/>baptism, and though we have some hope that she is
<pb n="238"/>
<milestone n="L11v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">238</mw>
<lb/>not destitute of grace, and we feel obliged at present to
<lb/>put her away from us, as a <quote>wicked person.</quote></p>
                <p rend="pre(“)break(yes)first-indent(1)">The most important event (and that relates of
<lb/>course to <persName>Moung Shway-gnong</persName>), remains to be men­
<lb/>tioned. It will be remembered that he was accused
<lb/>before the former viceroy, of being a heretic, and that
<lb/>the simple reply, <said>Inquire further,</said> spread dismay
<lb/>among us all, and was one occasion of our visit to
<lb/><placeName>Ava</placeName>. Soon after <persName>Mya-day-men</persName> assumed the govern­
<lb/>ment of this province, all the priests and officers of
<lb/>the village where <persName>Moung Shway-gnong</persName> lives, entered
<lb/>into a conspiracy to destroy him. They held daily
<lb/>consultations, and assumed a tone of triumph; while
<lb/>poor <persName>Moung Shway-gnong's</persName> courage began to flag;
<lb/>and, though he does not like to own it, he thought he
<lb/>must fly for his life. At length, one of the conspiracy,
<lb/>a member of the supreme court, went into the pre­
<lb/>sence of the viceroy, and, in order to sound his disp­
<lb/>sition, complained that the teacher, <persName>Moung Shway-
<lb/>gnong</persName>, was making every endeavour to turn the
<lb/>priest's rice-pot bottom upwards. <said rend="slant(italic)">What consequence?</said>
<lb/>said the viceroy: <said rend="slant(italic)">Let the priests turn it back again.</said>
<lb/>This sentence was enough; the hopes of the conspiracy
<lb/>were blasted; and all the disciples felt that they were
<lb/>sure of toleration under <persName>Mya-day-men</persName>. But this
<lb/>administration will not probably continue many
<lb/>months.</p>
                <p rend="pre(“)break(yes)first-indent(1)">In the course of the week I forwarded a letter to
<lb/><persName>Mr. Lansago</persName> (Who left this place for <placeName>Ava</placeName>, above a
<lb/>month ago), informing him of my return, and begging
<lb/>him to endeavour to efface the unfavourable impres­

<lb/>priest made on the mind of the emperor.</p>

                <p>The <placeName>Nan-dau-gong</placeName> people have

<lb/><persName>Mah Men-lay</persName> has, of her own accord, proposed to
<lb/>open a school in the precincts of her house, to teach
<lb/>the girls and boys of the village to read; in conse­
<lb/>quence of which, the latter will not be under the ne­
<lb/>cessity of going to the Burman priests for education,
<lb/>as usual. When we found that she had really made a

<lb/>females in <placeName>America</placeName> would, doubtless, defray the ex­
<lb/>penses of the undertaking, and make some compen­

<lb/>there are one or two words which your servant does

<lb/>I had the happiness to be enabled, for about twenty
<lb/>minutes, to lay blow after blow upon his sceptical
<lb/>head, with such effect, that he kept falling and fall­
<lb/>ing; and though he made several desperate efforts
<lb/>to get up, he found himself at last prostrate on the
<lb/>ground, unable to stir. <persName>Moung Shway-gnong</persName>, who
<lb/>had been an attentive listener, was extremely de­
<lb/>lighted to see his enemy so well punished; for this
<lb/><persName>Moung Long</persName> had sorely harassed him in times past.
<lb/>The poor man was not, however in the least angry
<lb/>at his discomfiture; but, in the true spirit of his
<lb/>school, said, that though he had heard much of me,
<lb/>the reality far exceeded the report. Afterwards he

<lb/>secured. Had we encountered no difficulties, and

<lb/>we should have been warmly attached to the in­

<lb/>another attempt, with greater probability of success,
<lb/>was made to destroy the teacher, <persName>Moung Shway-

<lb/>to the viceroy, in which <persName>Moung Shway-gnong</persName> was ac­
<lb/>cused of having embraced sentiments, which aimed at

<lb/>dicial to the existing authorities. The viceroy replied,
<lb/>that if their assertions were true, <persName>Moung S<choice><sic/><corr>h</corr></choice>way-gnong</persName>
<lb/>was deserving of death. The teacher and his friends
<lb/>had closely watched the proceedings of the accusers,
<lb/>and took measures accordingly; and, as soon as he
<lb/>ascertained that the viceroy uttered an encouraging
<lb/>word to his persecutors, he procured a boat, embarked
<lb/>his family, secretly fled to the mission-house, to dis­
<lb/>close to <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> his situation, and, after furnishing
<lb/>himself with tracts and portions of Scripture, pro­
<lb/>ceeded up the river to <placeName>Shway-doung</placeName>, a town about a
<lb/>hundred miles from <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. From the last ac­
<lb/>counts, he was busily employed in disseminating his
<lb/>heretical sentiments, and had excited much commo­
<lb/>tion among the inhabitants of that place. Thus it
<lb/>was, as in the days of the apostles, when the disciples
<lb/>of Christ were persecuted, <quote>they that were scattered
<lb/>abroad went everywhere preaching the word.</quote> <persName>Moung
<lb/>Shway-gnong's</persName> easy and rapid escape, may appear

<lb/>hours of suffering elapsed, before medicine took effect.
<lb/>This, with the quantity of opium and laudanum admi­
<lb/>nistered deprived me of the little remaining strength
<lb/>which the fever left me, and I am now scarcely able
<lb/>to hold a pen. It is singular that last rainy season I
<lb/>was subject to these same diseases, though in different
<lb/>order; and I ascribe it to the ascendancy which the
<lb/>climate of <placeName>Rangoon</placeName> is obtaining over my constitution.
<lb/>If it be the will of God, I feel desirous of living to

                <p>For several months past I
<lb/>have been so engrossed in the translation, that I have
<lb/>not solicited company so much as formerly, nor found
<lb/>time to mention the noticeable events of a missionary
<lb/>nature, that have occasionally transpired, especially as
<lb/>they have passed away without much permanent result.
<lb/>Within a few weeks, however, there have been several
<lb/>circumstances of such an encouraging kind, as induces
<lb/>me to mention them in connexion. The first that
<lb/>excited our attention was the case of <persName>Men-oo</persName> a blind
<lb/>girl, resident in our yard, under the medical care of
<lb/><persName>brother Price</persName>. She received her first ideas of religion
<lb/>from <persName>Moung Shway-bay</persName>, and after attending evening
<lb/>worship a few times, appeared to have her heart
<lb/>opened to Divine truth. About the same time,
<lb/><persName>Moung Myat-lay</persName> received some new excitement, that
<lb/>induced him and his neighbour, <persName>Moung Thah-ay</persName>, to
<lb/>recommence attending public worship, which they
<lb/>have not done since <persName>Moung Shway-gnong's</persName> persecution
<lb/>and flight. They are both, we hope, true <name>Christians</name>,
<pb n="260"/>
<milestone n="M10v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">260</mw>
<lb/>but have not yet obtained sufficient light and courage
<lb/>to profess religion. The case of <persName>May Mee</persName> is some­
<lb/>what similar. She is an old woman—a disciple of
<lb/><persName>Moung Shway-gnong</persName>—formerly acquainted with
<lb/><persName>Mrs. J.</persName>, but apparently unsusceptible of any impres­
<lb/>sions. It is now two or three months since she com­
<lb/>menced visiting us, and listening with uncommon
<lb/>attention to religious conver<choice><sic/><corr>s</corr></choice>ation. At len<choice><sic/><corr>g</corr></choice>th she began
<lb/>to attend public worship regularly; and, during the
<lb/>last interview, she manifested much of that deep
<lb/>solemnity, which has uniformly characterized the
<lb/>newly converted. Last in order, but not least in
<lb/>interest, is the case of <persName>Mah Doke</persName>. She is a relation
<lb/>and inmate of the <placeName>Nan-dau-gong</placeName> sisters, and her
<lb/>name sometimes occurs in the journal about two years
<lb/>ago, in connexion with theirs. She was once equally
<lb/>forward with <persName>Mah Myat-lay</persName>; but subsequently lost
<lb/>her impressions, and remained quite stupid, till within
<lb/>a few weeks, during which time she has been more
<lb/>frequent in her visits, and more serious and attentive.
<lb/>Last <name>Sunday</name> she requested baptism; and to-day she
<lb/>has undergone a particular examination, to the great
<lb/>satisfaction of us all. Add to these circumstances,
<lb/>that <persName>Moung Shway-gnong</persName> has lately returned from the
<lb/>interior, on a visit, and concluded to stay a while with
<lb/>us partly as teacher to <persName>brother Price</persName>. He was
<lb/>evidently grown in religious experience; his conver­
<lb/>sation is more spiritual, and he seems more attached
<lb/>than ever to us and the cause.</p>

<lb/>been an <name>anti-boodhist</name> all his life: but having, from

<lb/>last person to consider and embrace a new religion.
<lb/>He obtained some ideas of God from <persName>Moung Shway-
<lb/>gnong</persName>, but not sufficient to induce him to visit us
<lb/>before to-day. Our conversation related chiefly to the
<lb/>law of God, and the nature and evil of sin, points to
<lb/>which he was entirely ignorant. He professed to
<lb/>believe and acquiesce in what he heard; but I fear
<lb/>that his feelings are at variance with his professions.</p>

<lb/>worship. And accordingly, I count myself to have
<lb/>lost all, under the elements of the world, and through
<lb/>the grace of the faith of Christ only, to have gained
<lb/>the spiritual graces and rewards pertaining to eternity,
<lb/>which cannot be lost. Therefore, I have no ground
<lb/>for boasting, pride, passion, and self-exaltation. And
<lb/>without desiring the praise of men, or seeking my
<lb/>own will, I wish to do the will of God the Father.
<lb/>The members of the body, dead in trespasses and sins,

<lb/>displeasing to God, I desire to make instruments of
<lb/>righteousness, not following the will of the flesh.
<lb/>Worldly desire and heavenly desire being contrary,
<lb/>the one to the other, and the desire of visible things
<lb/>counteracting the desire of invisible things, I am as a
<lb/>dead man. However, He quickens the dead. He
<lb/>awakens those that sleep. He lifts up those that fall.
<lb/>He opens blind eyes. He perforates deaf ears. He
<lb/>lights a lamp in the great house of darkness. He re­
<lb/>lieves the wretched. He feeds the hungry. The
<lb/>words of such a benefactor, if we reject, we must die
<lb/>for ever, and come to everlasting destruction. Which
<lb/>circumstance considering, and meditating also on
<lb/>sickness, old age, and death, incident to the present
<lb/>state of mutability, I kneel and prostrate myself, and
<lb/>pray before God, the Father of the Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>,
<lb/>who has made atonement for our sins, and make me
<lb/>holy, and give me a repenting, believing, and loving
<lb/>mind.</p>
                <p>Formerly I trusted in my own merits, but now,
<lb/>through the preaching and instruction of teacher
<lb/><persName>Yoodthan</persName>, I trust in the merit of the Lord <persName>Jesus
<lb/>Christ</persName>. The teacher, therefore, is the tree; we are
<lb/>the blossoms and fruit. He has laboured to partake
<lb/>of the fruit, and now the tree begins to bear. The
<lb/>bread of life he has given, and we eat. The water
<lb/>from the brook which flows from the top of <placeName>Mount
<lb/>Calvary</placeName>, for the cleansing of all filth, he has brought,
<lb/>and made us bathe and drink. The bread of which
<lb/>we eat, will yet ferment and rise. The water which
<lb/>we drink and bathe in, is the water of an unfailing
<lb/>spring; and many will yet drink and bathe therein.

<lb/>Then all things will be regenerated and changed. Now
<lb/>we are strangers and pilgrims; and it is my desire,
<lb/>without adhering to the things of this world, but long­
<lb/>ng for my native abode, to consider and inquire, how
<lb/>long I must labour here; to whom I ought to show
<lb/>the light which I have obtained; when I ought to put
<lb/>it up, and when disclose it.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of this country of <placeName>Burmah</placeName>, being
<lb/>in the evil practice of forbidden lust, erroneous wor­
<lb/>ship, and false speech, deride the religion of Christ.
<lb/>However, that we may bear patiently derision, and
<lb/>persecution, and death, for the sake of the Lord <persName>Jesus
<lb/>Christ</persName>, pray for us. I do thus pray. For, elder bro­
<lb/>ther, I have to bear the threatening of my own bro­
<lb/>ther, and my brother-in-law, who say, <quote>We will beat,
<lb/>and bruise, and pound you; we will bring you into
<lb/>great difficulty; you associate with false people; you
<lb/>keep a false religion; and you speak false words.</quote>
<lb/>However, their false religion is the religion of death.
<lb/>The doctrine of the cross is the religion of life, of
<lb/>love, of faith. I am a servant of faith. Formerly I
<lb/>was a servant of <persName>Satan</persName>. Now I am a servant of Christ.
<lb/>And a good servant cannot but follow his master.
<lb/>Moreover, the divine promises must be accomplished.</p>
                <p>In this country of <placeName>Burmah</placeName>, are many strayed sheep.
<lb/>Teacher <persName>Yoodthan</persName>, pitying them, has come to gather
<lb/>them together, and to feed them in love. Some will
<lb/>not listen, but run away. Some do listen and adhere
<lb/>to him; and that our numbers may increase, we meet
<lb/>together, and pray to the great Proprietor of the
<lb/>sheep.</p>
                <p>Thus I, <persName>Moung Shway-bay</persName>, a disciple of teacher

<lb/>an account of myself since I last wrote, as you are so
<lb/>kind as to express so much pleasure in reading my
<lb/>little narratives. On the <date when="1822-06-22">22nd <name>June</name> last</date>, with a joyful
<lb/>heart, I left my native shores for <placeName>India</placeName>, followed by
<lb/>the prayers of thousands, who were collected on the
<lb/>wharf to witness our departure. In a fine new ship,
<lb/>a large airy cabin, with a kind obliging captain, I
<lb/>found myself most pleasantly situated, and under the
<lb/>direction of our heavenly Father, the winds and waves
<lb/>were propitious, for we reached the sand heads in the
<lb/><placeName>Bay of Bengal</placeName> in a hundred and five days from <placeName>Bos­
<lb/>ton</placeName>. During our voyage, I had the happiness of wit<choice><sic/><corr>­</corr></choice>
<lb/>nessing a most decided change in the captain, who, for
<lb/>two months previously to our arrival at <placeName>Calcutta</placeName>,
<lb/>devoted his whole time to the subject of religion,
<lb/>and is resolved, on his return passage, to conduct
<lb/>worship himself among his sailors on the <name>Sabbath</name>.</p>
        <p>On my arrival in <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, you will readily imagine
<lb/>my first inquiries were to ascertain what intelligence
<lb/>had been received from <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>, and what prospects
<lb/>of my speedy departure. The information received
<lb/>from the former was animating and encouraging; but
<lb/>respecting the latter, sad indeed, as it was expected
<lb/>that no ship would sail for several months, as very
<lb/>serious difficulties existed between the Burman and
<lb/>British Governments. For several days my mind was
<lb/>in a state of constant anxiety, but was instantaneously
<lb/>relieved, by noticing a paragraph in the paper, adver­
<lb/>tising a ship for <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. I immediately engaged
<lb/>my passage, and after a month's residence in the kind
<lb/>and hospitable family of the Rev. <persName>Mr. Thomason</persName>, I
<lb/>embarked for <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>, where I safely arrived in nine­
<lb/>teen days.</p>

        <milestone n="N4v" unit="sig"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">272</mw>
        <p>I dare not attempt to describe my feelings as the
<lb/>ship advanced towards the Burman coast. It was late
<lb/>in the evening when the vessel anchored; but the first
<lb/>object which caught my eye, as the boat rowed to­
<lb/>ward the shore, was <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>. From long expec­
<lb/>tation and disappointment, he had acquired such an
<lb/>habitual sadness and dejection of spirit, that it required
<lb/>all my exertion to disperse it, and make him <persName>Mr. J.</persName>
<lb/>again. He had not heard a word from me for thirteen
<lb/>months, (owing to the failure of my letters) and the
<lb/>very day I arrived, he had in despair yielded all hope
<lb/>of my existence! I soon had the happiness of meeting
<lb/><persName>Mah Men-lay</persName>, <persName>Moung Sh<choice><sic>aw</sic><corr>wa</corr></choice>y-bay</persName>, and others who are
<lb/>still an honour to their profession. <persName>Mah Myat-lay</persName>,
<lb/>the second female who was baptized, died in the tri­
<lb/>umphs of hope a few months ago. She longed for the
<lb/>hour of her release, and assured those who stood
<lb/>around her that she would soon be in the presence of
<lb/>Christ. Is not this one instance of the power of di­
<lb/>vine grace more than a compensation for all our days
<lb/>of darkness and distress, formerly spent in preparation
<lb/>for our work?</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Judson</persName> has his boats in readiness to proceed to
<lb/><placeName>Ava</placeName>, and to-morrow we go on board. He has ob­
<lb/>tained considerable favour from high officers in Go­
<lb/>vernment, and thinks our prospects at <placeName>Ava</placeName> very en­
<lb/>couraging. The king's own brother, a very powerful
<lb/>prince, has his attention excited by the Christian
<lb/>religion, and has lately written a very kind, affectionate
<lb/>letter to <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>, requesting his speedy return to
<lb/><placeName>Ava</placeName>, and to bring with him all the <seg xml:id="a11" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n11">sacred books</seg>. A
<lb/>foreign female has never yet been introduced to the
<pb n="273"/>
<milestone n="N5r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">273</mw>
<lb/>Burman Court, consequently much curiosity is excited
<lb/>by the expectation of my arrival. May the God of
<lb/>Heaven be our protector, and give us that wisdom
<lb/>which is profitable to direct. I feel, my dear friend,
<lb/>that I am about to begin anew my missionary work,
<lb/>and need more grace, more resolution, and more spi­
<lb/>rituality of feeling than ever before. We shall be
<lb/>surrounded by despotism and idolatry, but the God of
<lb/><persName>Jacob</persName> is our hope, and in his hands we are as safe as
<lb/>in our own loved <placeName>America</placeName>. He has evidently pointed
<lb/>out to us the path of duty, and shall we fear to follow
<lb/>where he leads? It is easy for God to open the heart
<lb/>of the King and Queen, and make them a nursing
<lb/>father and mother to the little church in <placeName>Burmah</placeName>. We
<lb/>cannot hope and expect too much from God. He has
<lb/>commanded us to open our mouths wide, and he will
<lb/>fill them.</p>
        <p>You shall hear from me on my arrival at the capital,
<lb/>for I am resolved to keep you acquainted with all our
<lb/>steps. I write this in great haste, being surrounded
<lb/>by women and children, who are waiting their final
<lb/>instructions. My schools will commence at <placeName>Ava</placeName>; my
<lb/>hopes respecting them are very sanguine. I am much
<lb/>gratified by your remarks relative to <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">The History of

<lb/>than your friend <persName>Ann</persName> and her beloved <persName>Judson</persName>. It is
<lb/>one of those bright days peculiar to an Indian clime;
<lb/>the cool refreshing breezes from the mountains with
<lb/>which we are now encircled, while they unite with
<lb/>the influence of the sun to produce a most delightful
<lb/>temperature of air, invigorate our frames, and exhili­
<lb/>rate our spirits; the verdure and variety of scenery
<lb/>exhibited on the banks of this noble river, every
<lb/>where interspersed with native villages, and peasants'
<lb/>tents, all conspire to increase those pleasant sensations
<lb/>which our peculiar situation and circumstances are
<lb/>calculated to excite. Our boat is so curiously con­
<lb/>structed, and so unlike every thing in your civilized
<lb/>part of the world, that I hardly know in what lan­
<lb/>guage to give a description so as to present it clearly
<lb/>to your view: it is a rude, uncouth thing, and could
<lb/>you behold it floating down the <placeName>river Thames</placeName>, you
<lb/>might imagine that some ingenious fisherman had
<lb/>attached a pair of wings to his little hut, and was
<lb/>conveying it on a boat to your great metropolis, to
<lb/>gratify the curious gaze of the idle multitude. It is
<lb/>fifty feet in length and seven in width. Our rooms or
<lb/>cabins, two in number, are built on the top, the boat
<lb/>being too shallow to admit any thing of the kind
<lb/>within, and constructed it in the form of a Burman
<lb/>house, with a sloping roof. The rooms extend half
<lb/>the length of the boat, the one we occupy is made of
<lb/>rough boards, with a thatched roof, the other (occu­
<pb n="276"/>

<lb/>pied by the servants) of bamboo and mats. The
<lb/>wings are formed by the extension of the floor on
<lb/>each side, which makes a passage for the boatmen,
<lb/>without entering our rooms. This heavy unwieldy
<lb/>thing is urged forward almost entirely by manual
<lb/>force, and is either drawn with ropes by the boatmen
<lb/>walking on the banks, or pushed by long poles. But
<lb/>so strong is the current at this season, and the wind
<lb/>always against us, that our progress is slow indeed.
<lb/>Yet in the midst of these inconveniences and priva­
<lb/>tions, we are happy, because the object we have in
<lb/>view will bear examination. Were we thus penetrating
<lb/>into the heart of this heathen empire for the purpose
<lb/>of accumulating property, or gaining honour or renown,
<lb/>from our fellow-creatures, it would not be an object
<lb/>sufficient to support our minds under present circum­
<lb/>stances, in anticipation of future evils. But we
<lb/>are assured that we are in the service of Him who
<lb/>governs the world, who has said to his disciples, <quote>Go
<lb/>into all the world,</quote> &amp;c.; and this is our support, and
<lb/>the reward of all our exertions, <quote>Lo, I am with you
<lb/><emph>always</emph>, even to the end of the world.</quote> Not a hair of
<lb/>our head can be injured, but with the permission of
<lb/>Him whose precious name we would make known to
<lb/>these unenlightened heathen. Yes, my dear friend,
<lb/>the consideration of the object we have in view, and
<lb/>the brightening prospects relative to ultimate success,
<lb/>fill us with joy, and make us happy, though in this
<lb/>rude, solitary boat, far, far away from all christian so­
<lb/>ciety, and no individual associate besides ourselves.
<lb/>Our faithful <persName>Moung Ing</persName> is the only native <name>Christian</name>

<lb/>or town, one calls to another to come quick and look,
<lb/>when the women and children run out of their houses
<lb/>and follow us till we enter the boat. Some will run
<lb/>several rods before us, in order to have a fair view as
<lb/>we approach them. If we happen to stop under the
<lb/>shade of a banyan, as is frequently the case, all the
<lb/>old men and women in the village are called and
<lb/>brought to see what their eyes never before beheld.
<lb/>But on such occasions we never experience any thing
<lb/>like insult or disrespect; on the contrary, the excla­
<lb/>mation is, <quote xml:lang="my">Ha-ba-byce,</quote> how handsome they are,
<lb/>how modest their dress, not even their hands are
<lb/>visible. We seldom let them know we understand
<lb/>their language, as our stay is not sufficiently long to
<lb/>enter on religious subjects. In one instance, however,
<lb/>the boat being a long time in doubling a point of land
<lb/>which we had walked over, and the multitude being
<lb/>assembled as usual, <persName>Mr. J.</persName> introduced the subject of
<lb/>religion, when all were immediately silent and atten­
<lb/>tive. Two or three white-headed heathen who were
<lb/>present, encouraged it by asking pertinent questions.
<lb/>A decent looking man, who appeared to be the school-
<lb/>master of the village, coming into the circle just at
<lb/>this time, <persName>Mr. J.</persName> handed him a tract, and requested
<lb/>him to read aloud. The subject of the tract was an
<lb/>account of the existence, perfections, and require­
<lb/>ments of the eternal God, our lost state by nature,
<lb/>and redemption through Christ. When he had pro­
<lb/>ceeded half way through, he stopped, and exclaimed
<lb/>to the multitude, that these were great subjects, that
<lb/>such a writing was worthy to be copied, and requested
<pb n="279"/>
<milestone n="N8r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">279</mw>
<lb/><persName>Mr. J.</persName> to remain while he copied it. He was informed
<lb/>that he might keep the tract, on condition that he
<lb/>constantly read it to his neighbours. Many joined in
<lb/>the petition that we would pass the remainder of the
<lb/>day and night in the village; but our boat coming up,
<lb/>we were obliged to leave them, not however until we
<lb/>had sent up many secret petitions that the Holy Spirit
<lb/>might bless that single tract to the salvation of many
<lb/>of the dark, ignorant souls. A few days ago we had
<lb/>an especial cause of gratitude to God for his preserv­
<lb/>ing care, when in imminent danger. In passing
<lb/>through one of the strong rapids, with which this
<lb/>river abounds, the rudder struck the bottom, which
<lb/>turned the boat immediately across the current, and
<lb/>laid her on her side. It being a cold morning our
<lb/>door was shut, and the boat being on her side, it was
<lb/>some moments before we could get it open, which
<lb/>circumstance for a short time occasioned us to feel all
<lb/>the horrors of shipwreck. Every thing outside of the
<lb/>cabins, such as rice, cooking utensils, and the boat­
<lb/>men's mats, were all afloat. The steersman, how­
<lb/>ever, had presence of mind enough to cut the rudder
<lb/>from the boat, which enabled the boatmen to raise
<lb/>her from her side, and after drawing her to the shore,
<lb/>and repairing her rudder, we proceeded on our way,
<lb/>feeling more than ever our dependance on God, and
<lb/>the importance of having our minds at all times
<lb/>stayed on him. Our fears have been considerably ex­
<lb/>cited for a few days past, on beholding the martial
<lb/>movements of the country. We understand that the
<lb/>Emperor is determined on war with the <name>English</name>, and
<lb/>has ordered an army to proceed with all possible dis­
<lb/>patch to <placeName>Arrakan</placeName>. Yesterday we passed the head­
<pb n="280"/>
<milestone n="N8v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">280</mw>
<lb/>quarters of the troops, and war-boats are continually
<lb/>passing us. We know not what effect this war will
<lb/>have upon our mission, or how much our own lives
<lb/>will be endangered from the suspicion that we are
<lb/><name>English</name>. But we always have this consolation, that
<lb/>God reigns, and that the greatest, as well as the
<lb/>smallest events are under his direction.</p>

<lb/>on the point of going to <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, and has kindly offered
<lb/>to take letters. We arrived in safety at this city
<lb/>twenty days ago, after a pleasant trip of six weeks; we
<lb/>had not a house to cover our heads on our arrival, nor
<lb/>could we procure one which was sufficient to shelter
<lb/>us from the burning rays of the sun. We were there­
<lb/>fore obliged to remain in our boat until we could
<lb/>build: you will, I am sure, smile, when I tell you that
<lb/>we built a house, and moved into it, in just a fort­
<lb/>night from our arrival; it consists of three rooms
<lb/>and a verandah, delightfully situated on the bank of
<lb/>the river. The ground was given last year to <persName>Mr. J.</persName>
<lb/>by the king, and is considered our own. The house we
<lb/>now inhabit is designed for the school-house for my
<lb/>girls, as soon as we can get another built for our own
<lb/>use. The school has already commenced with three
<lb/>little girls, whose shrill voices are now ringing in my
<lb/>ears, while they read their lessons: they are fine
<lb/>children, and improve as fast in reading and sewing as
<lb/>any children in the world. I doubt not the school
<lb/>will rapidly increase, as soon as we have time to look
<lb/>around and make a selection. The Emperor, on ac­
<lb/>count of the present war with the <name>English</name>, is rather
<pb n="281"/>
<milestone n="N9r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">281</mw>
<lb/>prejudiced against foreigners, consequently <persName>Mr. J.'s</persName>
<lb/>reception at court was rather cool. I have not yet
<lb/>been at the palace, as the king and all the royal family
		  <lb/>went to <placeName>Umera-poora</placeName>, in a day after our arrival,
<lb/>where they remain until the completion of the new
<lb/>palace in the city, when they will take possession in
<lb/>usual form, and <placeName>Ava</placeName> will in future be their residence.
<lb/>My old friend, the lady of the viceroy of <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>,
<lb/>came to see me as soon as she heard of my arrival,
<lb/>and has promised to introduce me at court on the re­
<lb/>turn of the royal family. Her husband died during
<lb/>my absence, and with his death all her power and
<lb/>distinctions cease. She is a well-informed, sensible
<lb/>woman, and there is much more hope of her attending
<lb/>to the subject of religion in her private situation, than
<lb/>when she was in public life. In a day or two after
<lb/>our arrival, <persName>Mr. J.</persName> introduced me to <persName>Prince M.</persName> and
<lb/>his Princess; they treated us with the greatest kind­
<lb/>ness. The Princess took me into her inner apart­
<lb/>ments, made me a handsome present, and invited me
<lb/>to visit her frequently, and ordered her cart to be
<lb/>prepared to convey me home. <persName>Prince M.</persName> is intel­
<lb/>ligent, desirous of obtaining foreign information, and
<lb/>has for some time been examining the Christian re­
<lb/>ligion! Oh! that a merciful God would enlighten
<lb/>his mind, and make him a real disciple of the blessed
<lb/>Redeemer. I hope to gain some influence over the
<lb/>Princess, and induce her to read the <rs type="title">New Testament</rs>,
<lb/>which is now in her own language. She is surrounded
<lb/>at all times by twenty or thirty females, and who
<lb/>knows but religious conversation may be blessed to
<lb/>them, though the Princess herself should never be
<lb/>benefited. We have here an uncommon field for use­

<lb/>fulness, and if we may be only allowed to remain,
<lb/>there is no doubt but much good would be done. My
<lb/>health has been much improved during my voyages,
<lb/>and I begin to hope that I may last yet some years;
<lb/>but we are, in a literal sense, alone. We have not
<lb/>half the means of obtaining intelligence from our
<lb/>friends as when in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>; and as for society, it is
<lb/>so far out of the question, that we hardly think of
<lb/>mentioning it. <persName>Dr. Price</persName> is our only missionary asso­
<lb/>ciate; but he has married a native wife, and lives the
<lb/>other side of the river. <persName>Mr. J.</persName> preaches every Sab­
<lb/>bath in the Doctor's house, where he has something
<lb/>of a congregation. We also have worship in <name>Burman</name>
<lb/>every evening in our own house, so that a faint ray
<lb/>of light is beginning to appear in this dark city.</p>
              <p>Remember me most affectionately to ſ, whose
<lb/>likeness is now hanging before me, and is almost the
<lb/>only ornament in our little house. Pray kindly write
<lb/>a line to <persName>Miss H.</persName>, of <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>, and inform her that
<lb/>the box of articles she forwarded arrived just as I

<lb/>also that I intend writing to her very soon. Do not

<lb/>to write to you, after an interval of two years. Yes,
<lb/>two years of suffering and privation; the very recol­
<lb/>lection of which often chills our feelings, and sickens
<lb/>our hearts. Though unbelief has often prompted us
<lb/>to say, that our afflictions were greater than we could
<lb/>bear or deserved; yet our better feelings have triumph­
<lb/>ed in the sovereign government of God, assured that
<lb/>He would do all things well; and, if his pleasure,
<lb/>could easily lessen our sufferings. Nor have we been
<lb/>disappointed in our hopes; for, in his own time and
<lb/>way, we have been extricated from all our difficulties,
<lb/>and are now safe and happy under British protection.</p>
        <p>Knowing your interest in the Burman mission, and
<lb/>assured of personal sympathy and regard, I will en­
<lb/>deavour, in my usual way, to give you a general rela­
<lb/>tion of events for the last two years.</p>
        <p>In my last to you, I mentioned that every thing had
<lb/>a warlike appearance. The Burman government,
<lb/>however, had no idea that the <name>English</name> were in earnest
<lb/>in their communications, consequently, they heard
<lb/>the report that <placeName>Rangoon</placeName> was taken with surprise and
<lb/>amazement. No preparations had been made at that
<lb/>port for the reception of <emph>strangers</emph>, and even the Vice­
<lb/>roy was absent. An army was immediately raised,
<lb/>and ordered to march, under the command of <persName>Kyer-
<lb/>woon-gee</persName> (<persName>Kee-woongee</persName>), who was to be joined on his
<lb/>way down by <persName>Sekayah-woon-gyee</persName>, having been re­
<lb/>cently appointed Viceroy of <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>. The only fear
<lb/>and anxiety which the King and Government then
	  <lb/>manifested or expressed was, that the <name>English</name> at
<lb/><placeName>Rangoon</placeName> should hear of their approach, and, preci­
<lb/>pitately leaving the country, deprive the Burmese
<lb/>grandees of the pleasure of employing in their service

<lb/>as slaves, a few of the <quote>white strangers.</quote> <said>Send to
<lb/>me,</said> said one of the ladies of a <foreign xml:lang="my">Woon-gyee</foreign>, <said>four
<lb/><foreign xml:lang="my">kala-pyoos</foreign>, (white strangers,) to manage the affairs of
<lb/>my household, as I hear they are trustworthy.</said> <said>And
<lb/>to me,</said> said a gay young sprig of the palace, <said>six
<lb/>stout men to row my boat.</said> The army, in their
<lb/>gayest attire, danced and sung down the river, but few,
<lb/>if any, ever danced back again; and the <foreign xml:lang="my">Kyee-woon-
<lb/>gyee</foreign> found other commissions to execute than those
<lb/>just given him. As soon as the first force was de­
<lb/>spatched, the Government had leisure to look around,
<lb/>and inquire into the cause of <placeName>Rangoon's</placeName> being taken,
<lb/>and the probable instruments of the arrival of those
<lb/>strangers. It was at once concluded that spies were
<lb/>in the country, who had communicated the state of
<lb/>things, and invited the foreigners over: and who so
<lb/>likely to be spies, as the three <name>Englishmen</name>, <persName>Rogers</persName><choice><sic/><corr>,</corr></choice>
<lb/><persName>Gouger</persName>, and <persName>Laird</persName>, who, under the garb of merchants,
<lb/>had plotted so much evil? They were all three ac­
<lb/>cordingly arrested, and put in confinement. We now
<lb/>began, more than ever, to tremble for ourselves, and
<lb/>lived in the hourly expectation of some dreadful
<lb/>scene. In examining the accounts of <persName>Mr. Gouger</persName>, it
<lb/>was found that <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> and <persName>Dr. Price</persName> had taken
<lb/>money of him, which circumstance, to the uninformed
<lb/>mind of a <name>Burman</name>, was sufficient evidence that they
<lb/>also were spies, and in the employ of the English
<lb/>Government, as they received their supplies from an
<lb/><name>Englishman</name>. The King had before been advised to
<lb/>put the missionaries in confinement, but his reply had
<lb/>been, <quote>They are <emph>true men</emph>, let them remain.</quote> He was
<lb/>now, however, informed of the above-mentioned cir­
<lb/>cumstance, and, in an angry tone, issued an order for
<pb n="285"/>
<milestone n="N11r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">285</mw>
<lb/>the immediate arrest of <persName>Dr. Price</persName> and <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>.
<lb/>And now commenced a series of oppressive acts, which
<lb/>we should before have thought human nature in­
<lb/>capable of committing.</p>
        <p>On the <date when="1824-06-08">8th of <name>June</name></date>, a city writer, at the head of a
<lb/>dozen savages, with <mcr>one</mcr>, whose marked face denoted
<lb/>him an executioner, rushed into the house, and de­
<lb/>manded <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>. <said>You are called by the King,</said>
<lb/>said the writer, (a mode of expression, when about to
<lb/>execute the King's orders,) and instantly the small cord
<lb/>was produced by the spotted face, who roughly seized
<lb/><persName>Mr. J.</persName>, threw him on the floor, and tied his arms be­
<lb/>hind him. The scene was now dreadful. The little
<lb/>children were screaming with fear; the <name>Burmans</name> in
<lb/>our employ running here and there, endeavouring
<lb/>to escape from the hands of those unfeeling wretches;
<lb/>and the Bengal servants, mute with amazement and
<lb/>horror at the situation in which they saw their master.
<lb/>I offered money to the executioner, and entreated him
<lb/>to untie <persName>Mr. J.</persName>, but in vain were my tears or entreaties:
<lb/>they led him away, I knew not where; and I was left
<lb/>guarded by ten men, who had received strict orders to
<lb/>confine me close, and let no one go in or out. I retired
<lb/>to my room, and attempted to pour out my soul to
<lb/>Him, who, for our sakes, was bound and led away for
<lb/>execution; and, even in that dreadful moment, I ex­
<lb/>perienced a degree of consolation hardly to be ex­
<lb/>pected. But this employment was of short duration.
<lb/>The magistrate of that part of <placeName>Ava</placeName> in which we lived,
<lb/>was in the verandah, continually calling me to come
<lb/>out, and submit to his examination. Supposing that
<lb/>all our letters and writings would be examined, and
<lb/>feeling conscious of having noted down every oc­
<pb n="286"/>
<milestone n="N11v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">286</mw>
<lb/>currence since my arrival in <placeName>Ava</placeName>, I instantly destroyed
<lb/>every thing of the kind, having no time to make a
<lb/>selection; and then went out to receive the officer.
<lb/>This writer was ordered to write down my name, age,
<lb/>and country, the names of my four little Burman girls,
<lb/>and those of the two Bengalee servants, then pro­
<lb/>nounced us <emph>all</emph> as slaves of the King, and again ordered
<lb/>the guard to watch me closely; and departed. It was
<lb/>now near evening. With what anxiety I waited the
<lb/>return of our faithful <persName>Moung Ing</persName>, who had followed
<lb/><persName>Mr. Judson</persName> at a short distance, to see what became of
<lb/>him! I had then no doubt but I could procure the
<lb/>release of <persName>Mr. J.</persName>, (if he had not been executed,) by
<lb/>getting a petition presented to the Queen. But I was
<lb/>also a prisoner, and could not move out of the house.
<lb/>After dark, <persName>Moung Ing</persName> returned with the intelligence,
<lb/>that he saw <persName>Mr. J.</persName> conducted to the court house,
<lb/>thence to the death prison, the gates of which were
<lb/>closed, and he saw no more. What a night was now
<lb/>before me! The uncertainty of <persName>Mr. Judson's</persName> fate,
<lb/>my own unprotected situation, and the savage conduct
<lb/>of the ten <name>Burmans</name>, all conspired to make it the <emph>most
<lb/>dreadful</emph> night I had ever passed. I barred the doors,
<lb/>and retired with the four Burman children into the
<lb/>inner room. The guard were constantly ordering me
<lb/>to unbar the doors, and come out, as they could not
<lb/>be assured of my safety, if I remained within. They
<lb/>next threatened to go and inform the magistrate that
<lb/>I had secreted myself, and that they must not be blamed
<lb/>if I made my escape. Finding themselves unsuc­
<lb/>cessful in their demands, they took the two servants,
<lb/>and made their feet fast in the stocks. As I apparently
<lb/>took no notice of this, they ordered the stocks to be
<pb n="287"/>
<milestone n="N12r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">287</mw>
<lb/>raised, which makes the situation of the person con­
<lb/>fined extremely painful. This I could not bear to see,
<lb/>and promised them all a present in the morning, if
<lb/>they would release the servants.</p>
        <p>The next morning I sent <persName>Moung Ing</persName> with a piece
<lb/>of silver, in order to gain admittance to the prison, to
<lb/>ascertain the real state of <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>. He soon re­
<lb/>turned with the information, that <persName>Mr. J.</persName>, and <persName>Dr. P.</persName>,
<lb/>and the three <name>Englishmen</name>, were all confined in the
<lb/><mcr>inner prison</mcr>, each with three pair of iron fetters, and
<lb/>fastened to a long pole. My only concern now was,
<lb/>how to get to the governor of the city, who has the
<lb/>entire direction of prison affairs, in order to obtain,
<lb/>at least, a mitigation of the sufferings of the mis­
<lb/>sionaries. I sent a request to the governor to allow
<lb/>me to visit him with a <mcr>present</mcr>. The next day I re­
<lb/>ceived an order, which was most readily obeyed, to
<lb/>visit him. My present gained me a favourable recep­
<lb/>tion, and after listening attentively to my relation of
<lb/>the brutal manner of <persName>Mr. J.'s</persName> arrest, and his present
<lb/>horrid situation, he manifested considerable feeling,
<lb/>severely reprimanded the writer, who allowed such
<lb/>treatment, and then assured me he would make the
<lb/>situation of the teachers more comfortable. He told
<lb/>me, however, that I must consult with his head writer,
	  <lb/>respecting the <mcr>means</mcr>, and immed<choice><sic/><corr>i</corr></choice>ately called and
<lb/>introduced him to me. I shuddered to look at the
<lb/>creature, for a more forbidding countenance was never
<lb/>before seen. All the evil passions of human nature
<lb/>seemed to have united in forming his face, and each
<lb/>seemed to be be striving to gain the ascendancy. I found
<lb/>to my sorrow, that, under the Governor, he had much
<lb/>to do with the prison, and had power to make us suffer
<pb n="288"/>
<milestone n="N12v" unit="sig"/><mw type="pageNum">287</mw>
<lb/>much. He took me aside, told me, if I wished to
<lb/>make the situation of the Missionaries more tolerable, 
<lb/>I must bring him two hundred tickals, and two pieces
<lb/>of fine cloth, on the reception of which, he would
<lb/>release <persName>Dr. Price</persName> and <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> from the
<lb/>pole, and put them in another building, where
<lb/>I should be allowed to send them pillows
<lb/>and mats to sleep on, and their daily food. At the same
<lb/>time, I obtained an order from the governor for an
<lb/>interview with <persName>Mr. J.</persName>, and, for the first time in my
<lb/>life, looked into the interior of a Burman prison. The
<lb/>wretched and ghastly appearance of the Missionaries
<lb/>produced feelings indescribable, and forbad a moment's
<lb/>hesitation in producing the sum demanded for tem­
<lb/>porary relief. <persName>Mr. J.</persName> was allowed to hobble to the
<lb/>door of the prison, and after five minutes conversation,
<lb/>I was ordered to depart, by a voice and manner to
<lb/>which I had been unaccustomed, and which convinced
<lb/>me, that those underlings felt that we were entirely in
<lb/>their power. Our house was two miles from the
<lb/>prison; and knowing that nothing could be done
<lb/>without money, I had provided myself with a con­
<lb/>siderable sum in the morning, which enabled me to
<lb/>pay the two hundred tickals without delay, and the
<lb/>same evening had the consolation of hearing that <persName>Mr.
<lb/>J.</persName> and <persName>Dr. P.</persName> were in a <mcr>better prison</mcr> than I had found
<lb/>them. My next object was to get a petition presented
<lb/>to the Queen, the brother of whom is by far the most
<lb/>powerful man in the empire. Our situation as
<lb/>prisoners, rendered a personal interview with the
<lb/>Queen impossible: I was obliged, therefore to address
<lb/>her through the medium of her brother's wife, who,
<lb/>as are all the relations of the Queen, is of low origin,
<pb n="289"/>
<milestone n="O1r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">289</mw>
<lb/>and consequently proud, haughty, and ambitious. I had
<lb/>visited her in better days, and received distinguished
<lb/>marks of her favour. But now the scene was
<lb/>changed, <persName>Mr. J.</persName> was in irons, and I in distress, which
<lb/>were reasons sufficient for a friged reception. I took
<lb/>with me a valuable present, con<choice><sic/><corr>s</corr></choice>isting of a gold-
<lb/>wrought mantle, and other little trappings. Her
<lb/>Ladyship was lolling in state, and hardly deigned to
<lb/>raise her eyes, on my entrance into her splendid hall.
<lb/>I took my seat, not at a respectful distance, nor at
<lb/>her bidding, but as near as I could well approach,
<lb/>that she might not loose a syllable of what I had to
<lb/>communicate. I waited not for the question usually
<lb/>asked, <quote>What do you want?</quote> grief made me bold—I
<lb/>at once began a relation of our wrongs. I stated to
<lb/>her that <persName>Dr. Price</persName> and <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> were <name>Americans</name>,
<lb/>that they were ministers of religion, that they had
<lb/>nothing to do with war or politics, and that she well
<lb/>knew that even their residence in <placeName>Ava</placeName> was in consequence
<lb/>of the King's command. In vain I strove to work on
<lb/>her hardened feelings, by requesting her to imagine
<lb/>herself in my situation, a stranger in a foreign land,
<lb/>and deprived of the protection of an only friend, who,
<lb/>without any alledged crime, was thrown into prison
<lb/>and fetters. She unfolded the present, and coolly said,
<lb/><said>Your case is not singular, the other white prisoners
<lb/>suffer equally with your husband; I will, however,
<lb/>present your petition to her Majesty, the Queen:
<lb/>come again to-morrow.</said> I went from her with a
<lb/>little hope, and faint as it was, I endeavoured to com­
<lb/>municate the same to <persName>Mr. J.</persName>, but my admittance was
<lb/>strictly forbidden by the writer to whom I had given two
<lb/>hundred tickals, and to whom we, in future, gave the

<lb/>name of <persName rend="slant(italic)">shark</persName>. The next morning I saw three of the
<lb/>King's officers pass, and was informed they had gone
<lb/>to take possession of <persName>Mr. Gouger's</persName> property, and that
<lb/>on the morrow <emph>our</emph> house would be searched. I spent
<lb/>the day, therefore, in making preparations to receive
<lb/>them, arranging and secreting as many articles as
<lb/>possible, knowing that we should be in a state of
<lb/>starvation unless some of our property could be pre­
<lb/>served. I again endeavoured to gain ad<choice><sic>d</sic><corr/></choice>mittance to
<lb/><persName>Mr. Judson</persName>, but was refused. The three officers who
<lb/>had taken possession, the day before, of <persName>Mr. Gouger's</persName>
<lb/>property, now came to take an account of ours.
<lb/>Among the three was one named <persName>Koung-tong-myoo-
<lb/>tsa</persName>, who seemed to take an interest in my forlorn
<lb/>situation, and who prevented the others from taking
<lb/>many articles, which were afterwards, during our long
<lb/>trial, of the greatest use. They first demanded my
<lb/>silver, gold, and jewels. I replied, <quote>That gold I had
<lb/>none, jewels I had never worn since my residence in
<lb/>their country, but here was the key of the trunk which
<lb/>contained the silver, open and look for themselves.</quote>
<lb/>They seemd pleased with my offering them the key,
<lb/>requested I would open the trunk, and that only one
<lb/>person should be allowed to enter my inner-room to
<lb/>take an account of the property. And here justice
<lb/>obliges me to say, that the conduct of these Burman
<lb/>officers in this transaction, was more humane and
<lb/>civilized than any other we witnessed while in <placeName>Ava</placeName>. The
<lb/>silver was weighed and laid aside. <said>Have you no
<lb/>more?</said> asked one of them. <said>Search for yourselves,</said>
<lb/>replied I, <said>the house is at your disposal.</said>—<said>Have
<lb/>you not deposited money and jewels in the hands of
<lb/>others?</said>—<said>I have no friends in this country: with

<milestone n="O2r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">291</mw>
<lb/>whom should I deposit treasure?</said>—<said>Where is your
<lb/>watch?</said> I produced an old one of Mr. <persName>J.'s</persName> which had
<lb/>been out of use for a long time, but which answered
<lb/>their purpose just as well, and was the means of pre­
<lb/>serving a good one I had then about me. <said>Where
	    <lb/>are your goods, your pieces of muslin, hand<choice><sic/><corr>k</corr></choice>erchiefs,
<lb/>&amp;c.</said>—<said><persName>Mr. Judson</persName> is no merchant, he neither buys nor
<lb/>sells, but subsists on the free offerings of the disciples of
<lb/>Christ, who collected the money you have just
<lb/>taken to build a church for the preaching of the Gospel.
<lb/>Is it suitable to take the property of a <foreign xml:lang="my">Pongyee</foreign>?</said>
<lb/>(priest). <said>It is contrary to our wishes,</said> said <persName>Koung-
<lb/>tong</persName>, <said>but we act in obedience to the King's com­
<lb/>mand.</said> Our trunks of wearing apparel were then
<lb/>examined. I begged they would not take them, as
<lb/>they could be of no use to the King, but to us they
<lb/>were invaluable. They said a list only should be
<lb/>taken, and presented to his Majesty, when, if he gave
<lb/>no further order, they should remain. They did the
<lb/>same with regard to the books, medicine, and most of
<lb/>the furniture, and on presenting the list to the King,
<lb/>he gave an order that these articles should not be
<lb/>taken at present. These gentlemen, however, took
<lb/>everything new or curious, and whatever to them
<lb/>seemed valuable. When they had finished, I gave
<lb/>them tea, and begged the royal treasurer to intercede
<lb/>for the release of <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>. After their departure,
<lb/>I had an opportunity of going again to the queen's
<lb/>sister-in-law, who informed me that she had presented
<lb/>my petition to the Queen, and that her reply was
<lb/><quote rend="slant(italic)">He is not to be executed, let him remain where he is.</quote> I
<lb/>felt now ready to sink down in despair, as there was
<lb/>no hope of <persName>Mr. J.'s</persName> release from any other quarter;

<lb/>but a recollection of the judge in the parable, who,
<lb/>though he feared not God, nor regarded man, was
<lb/>moved by the importunities of a widow, induced me
<lb/>to resolve to continue my visits, until the object was
<lb/>obtained. But here, also, I was disappointed; for
<lb/>after my entreating her many times to use her influ­
<lb/>ence in obtaining the release of the Missionaries, she
<lb/>became so irritated at my perseverance, that she re­
<lb/>fused to answer my questions, and told me by her
<lb/>looks and motions, that it would be dangerous to make
<lb/>any further effort.</p>
        <p>I find, my dear Sir, in being thus particular, my
<lb/>letter will be stretched to an immoderate length, and
<lb/>must therefore be more general. Suffice it to say,
<lb/>that for the next seven months, hardly a day passed
<lb/>in which I did not visit some one member of Govern­
<lb/>ment, in order to interest their feelings on our behalf.
<lb/>The King's mother, sisters, and brother, each in their
<lb/>turn, exerted their influence in our favour, but so great
<lb/>was their fear of the Queen, that neither of them
<lb/>ventured to make a direct application to his Majesty.
<lb/>And although my various efforts were useless as to their
<lb/>grand object, yet the hopes they excited kept our minds
<lb/>from sinking, and enabled us to endure our long im­
<lb/>prisonment better than we otherwise could have done.
<lb/>The last person to whom I applied, was the celebrated
<lb/><persName>Bundoolah</persName>, must previous to his departure for <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>.
<lb/>He had gained some advantage over the native soldiers,
<lb/>at <placeName>Arracan</placeName>, two hundred of whom he had sent as pri­
<lb/>soners to <placeName>Ava</placeName>; this, together with the circumstance
<lb/>of his having obtained two or three thousand English
<lb/>muskets, gained him a most favourable reception at
<lb/>court, and every honour, in the power of the king to
<pb n="293"/>
<milestone n="O3r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">293</mw>
<lb/>bestow, was heaped upon him. He daily presided at
	  <lb/>the <placeName>Lhoot-dau</placeName>, had the entire management of affairs,
<lb/>and, in fact, was the <emph>real king</emph> of the country. With
<lb/>fear and trembling I presented to him a written peti­
<lb/>tion for the liberation of <persName>Dr. Price</persName> and <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>.
<lb/>He listened to the petition attentively, made some
<lb/>inquiries relative to our coming to <placeName>Ava</placeName>, and then said
<lb/>he would reflect on the subject; <said>Come again to-
<lb/>morrow.</said> My hopes were now more sanguine than
<lb/>ever, but the morrow dashed them all, when the proud
<lb/><persName>Bundoolah</persName> uttered, <said>I shall soon return from <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>,
<lb/>when I will release the teachers, with all the other
<lb/>prisoners.</said> The war was now prosecuted with all the
<lb/>energy of which the <name>Burmans</name> are capable; their ex­
<lb/>pectations of complete victory were high, for their
<lb/>general was invincible, and the glory of their king
<lb/>would accompany their armies. The government
<lb/>talked loudly of taking <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, when they had driven
<lb/>the <emph>presumptuous creatures</emph> from their own territories,
<lb/>and of destroying from the earth every white-faced
<lb/>stranger. So great was their hatred to the very ap
<lb/>pearance of a foreigner, that I frequently trembled
<lb/>when walking the streets; and that I might not im­
<lb/>mediately be recognized as a stranger, and sometimes
<lb/>gain admittance into <persName>Mr. J.'s</persName> prison, I adopted the
<lb/>Burman dress altogether. Extortion and oppression
<lb/>had now become so familiar to us, that we daily ex­
<lb/>pected their appearance in some new garb or other.
<lb/>Sometimes, for ten days together, I was not allowed
<lb/>to see <persName>Mr. J.</persName>, and even then could gain admittance
<lb/>only after dark, when I was obliged to return to our
<lb/>house, two miles, without an attendant. But the
<lb/>means we invented for communication, were such as
<pb n="294"/>
<milestone n="O3v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">294</mw>
<lb/>necessity alone could have suggested. At first I wrote
<lb/>to him on a flat cake, baked for the purpose, and
<lb/>buried it in a bowl of rice; and in return, he commu­
<lb/>nicated his situation on a piece of tile, on which, when
<lb/>wet with water, the writing became invisible, but
<lb/>when dried, perfectly legible. But after some months'
<lb/>experience in the <emph>art</emph> of <emph>deception</emph>, we found the most
<lb/>convenient, as well as safest mode of writing, was to
<lb/>roll up a sheet of paper, and put it in the long nose of
<lb/>a coffee-pot, in which I sent his tea. These circum­
<lb/>stances may appear trivial, but they also serve to show
<lb/>to what straits and shifts we were driven. It would have
<lb/>been a crime of the highest nature to be found making
<lb/>communications to a prisoner, however nearly related.</p>
        <p><persName>Bundoolah</persName> departed from <placeName>Ava</placeName>, in all the pomp
<lb/>and splendor imaginable, commanding an army of
<lb/>between forty and fifty thousand men, and was to
<lb/>join the <persName>Prince Thar-yar-wa-dee</persName>, who had marched
<lb/>some months before, at the head of an equal number.
<lb/>The two or three first reports of the <mcr>invincible general</mcr>
<lb/>were of the most flattering nature, and were joyfully
<lb/>received by the firing of cannon. Now <quote><placeName>Rangoon</placeName><lb/>was surrounded by the Burman troops,</quote> then, <quote>the
<lb/>fort on the pagoda was taken,</quote> and <quote>guns and ammu­
<lb/>nition sufficient for the Burman army, should the war
<lb/>continue ever so long:</quote> and next <quote>his Majesty might
<lb/>expect to hear, that not a white face remained in
<lb/><placeName>Rangoon</placeName>.</quote> But no such report ever came, the can­
<lb/>nons ceased to fire on the arrival of a boat, and
<lb/>soon it was whispered about that the <name>Burmans</name>
<lb/>were defeated, thousands of them killed, among
<lb/>whom were many officers; and that <persName>Bundoolah</persName> and
<lb/>the few that remained had <emph>fled</emph> to <placeName>Danooboo</placeName>! O,
<pb n="295"/>
<milestone n="O4r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">295</mw>
<lb/>with what anxiety did <emph>we</emph> listen for the report that
<lb/><quote>the <name>English</name> are advancing;</quote> for in the arrival of the
<lb/>foreign troops consisted our only hope of deliverance
<lb/>from the hands of these savages. The war now <mcr>lagged</mcr>
<lb/>on heavily on the part of the <name>Burmans</name>; and though
<lb/>the King and Government continued to supply <persName>Bun­
<lb/>doolah</persName> with what he required, yet their confidence in
<lb/>him was shaken, and their hopes far from sanguine.
<lb/>The news at length came that the English army was
<lb/>advancing, and that it was within twenty miles of
<lb/><placeName>Danooboo</placeName>. The town was all confusion, and the
<lb/>Queen began to send away to a more secure place, her
<lb/>immense treasure of gold, silver, &amp;c. It was now the
<lb/><date when="1825-03-01">first of <name>March</name></date>, the commencement of the hot season,
<lb/>which in <placeName>Ava</placeName> is peculiarly severe. The white pri­
<lb/>soners were all put inside of the common prison, in
<lb/>five pair of irons each, where they were so crowded
<lb/>with Burman thieves and robbers, that they had not
<lb/>sufficient room to lie down. There were at the time
<lb/>near a hundred prisoners all in one room, without a
<lb/>window or hole for the admittance of air, and the
<lb/>door kept closed. I again applied to the Governor of
<lb/>the city to allow the Missionaries to be removed to
<lb/>their former place, or at least to let them remain
<lb/>outside of the door, during the day. I offered him
<lb/>money, and promised to reward him handsomely when
<lb/>in my power, but all in vain. The old man shed tears
<lb/>at my distress, said it was not in his power to comply
<lb/>with my request, for his orders were from a high
<lb/>quarter; that he had even been commanded to execute
<lb/>all the white prisoners in private, and to keep them in
<lb/>close confinement was as little as he could do. He
<lb/>ordered, however, that they should be allowed to go
<pb n="296"/>
<milestone n="O4v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">296</mw>
<lb/>outside of the door to eat their rice, and when inside,
<lb/>to be placed as near the door as possible. I was af­
<lb/>terwards informed from good authority, that the
<lb/>Queen's brother, <persName>Men-tha-gyee</persName>, had ordered the go­
<lb/>vernor to destroy the kalars; but that the governor,
<lb/>fearing they might be required by the King, dared not
<lb/>obey the command. The situation of the white pri­
<lb/>soners was now wretched in the extreme. The heat
<lb/>during the day was dreadful indeed, the confined air
<lb/>deprived them of an inclination for food, and their
<lb/>whole appearance exhibited more the appearance of
<lb/>the dead than the living. I daily visited the governor,
<lb/>and continued to entreat him to pity the foreigners.
<lb/>Sometimes he appeared to feel for us, and seemed half
<lb/>inclined to listen to my request. But the fear of <persName>Men-
<lb/>tha-gyee</persName> doubtless prevented. It was now reported
<lb/>that the foreign troops had reached <placeName>Danooboo</placeName>, and
<lb/>whispered about that <persName>Bundoolah</persName> was dead! No one at
<lb/>first ventured to say it openly, but the report was soon
<lb/>conveyed officially to his Majesty, who was mute with
<lb/>disappointment, while the Queen smote her breast, and
<lb/>exclaimed, <quote>Ama, ama!</quote> What was to be done now?
<lb/>Where could another general be found? and from what
	  <lb/>quarter could troops be raised? The Prince and <foreign xml:lang="my">Woon-
<lb/>gyees</foreign> at the Burman camp had intimated the necessity
<lb/>of making peace; but this was too humiliating to be
<lb/>thought of for a moment: <quote>What,</quote> said one of the
<lb/>Woon-gyees at court, <quote>shall we allow it to be re­
<lb/>corded in a future history of the country, that our
<lb/>glorious King made peace with strangers, and gave
<lb/>them part of his territory? No, we will all die first.</quote>
<lb/>The Pagan Woon-gyee, who had been in disgrace for
<lb/>some time, and had even been in prison in three pair of
<pb n="297"/>
<milestone n="O5r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">297</mw>
<lb/>fetters, now thought it a good opportunity to retrieve
<lb/>his character and regain his influence. He petitioned
<lb/>his Majesty to allow him to go at the head of a new
<lb/>army, and positively assured the King, that he could
<lb/>conquer the <name>English</name>, and drive them from <placeName>Burmah</placeName>.
<lb/>He was immediately raised to the highest rank, and
<lb/>all power committed to him. His first object was to
<lb/>manifest his inveterate hatred to every foreigner; and
<lb/>those who had for eleven months escaped confinement
<lb/>now fell into his merciless hands, and were thrown
<lb/>into prison. Among the number was <persName>Mr. Lansago</persName>, a
<lb/>Spanish gentleman, who had for twenty years been
<lb/>high in the King's favour, and had done all in his
<lb/>power to alleviate the sufferings of the foreign pri­
<lb/>soners; but he was now among them. <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>
<lb/>had now been in close confinement, and in five pair of
<lb/>fetters for a month, and with anguish indescribable I
<lb/>saw him sinking under the weight of suffering. He
<lb/>was taken with a high fever. My distress and en­
<lb/>treaties now prevailed with the governor of the city,
<lb/>to give a written order, to remove <persName>Mr. J.</persName> from the
<lb/>common prison into a little bamboo room, six feet
<lb/>long and four wide. I also obtained an order for
<lb/>liberty to give him medicine and visit him whenever I
<lb/>wished. I had removed into the governor's compound,
<lb/>and was living in a bamboo house, w<choice><sic/><corr>h</corr></choice>ere the themo­
<lb/>meter daily rose to 106; but thought myself happily
<lb/>situated to be near the prison, and allowed to visit <persName>Mr.
<lb/>J.</persName>, who began now to hope he should recover from the
<lb/>fever, as his situation was so much better than before.</p>
        <p>But new and dreadful trials were yet before us. I
<lb/>had gone in one morning to give <persName>Mr. J.</persName> his breakfast,
<lb/>and intended spending a few hours as usual, when the
<mw rend="align(center)" type="sig">O5</mw>
<pb n="298"/>
<milestone n="O5v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">298</mw>
<lb/>governor in great haste sent for me. I was agreeably
<lb/>disappointed, on appearing before him, to find he had
<lb/>nothing in particular to communicate, and that he was
<lb/>uncommonly kind and obliging. He had detained me
<lb/>a long time, when a servant came in hastily and whis­
<lb/>pered, that the foreign prisoners had all been taken
<lb/>out, and he knew not where they were carried. With­
<lb/>out speaking to the governor, I ran down the stairs
<lb/>into the street, hoping to catch a sight of them, but
<lb/>they were beyond the reach of my eye. I enquired of
<lb/>all I met, which way the white prisoners were gone,
<lb/>but no one knew. I returned again to the governor,
<lb/>who declared he was perfectly ignorant of their fate,
<lb/>and that he did not know of their being taken out of
<lb/>prison till a few moments before. This was all false,
<lb/>as he had evidently been detaining me to prevent my
<lb/>witnessing the scene that was to follow. He also
<lb/>said, with a meaning countenance, <said>You can do no
<lb/>more for your husband,—take care of yourself.</said> This
<lb/>was a day never to be forgotten. I retired to my little
<lb/>bamboo house, and endeavoured to obtain comfort
<lb/>from the only true source; but my mind was in such
<lb/>a distracted state, that I could not steadily reflect on
<lb/>any thing. This one thought occupied my mind to
<lb/>the exclusion of every other, that I had seen <persName>Mr. Jud­
<lb/>son</persName> for the last time, and that he was probably now in
<lb/>a state of extreme suffering. In the evening I heard
	  <lb/>the prisoners were sent to <placeName>Umerapoorah</placeName>, but what was
<lb/>to be their fate was not yet known. The next day I
<lb/>obtained a pass from Government to follow <persName>Mr. Jud­
<lb/>son</persName> with my little <persName>Maria</persName>, who was then only three
<lb/>months old, and, with one Bengalee servant, set out
<lb/>on my journey. We reached the government house
<pb n="299"/>
<milestone n="O6r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">299</mw>
<lb/>at <placeName>Umerapoorah</placeName>, and were informed, the prisoners had
<lb/>been sent off two hours before, to <placeName>Oung-pen-lay</placeName>, (a
<lb/>place similar to <persName>Botany Bay</persName>,) whither I immediately
<lb/>followed. I found <persName>Mr. J.</persName> in a most wretched state.
<lb/>He had been dragged out of his little room the day
<lb/>before, his shoes, hat, and clothes, excepting shirt and
<lb/>pantaloons, been taken from him, and in his feeble
<lb/>state of health, and in the hottest part of the day,
<lb/>been literally driven ten miles with a rope tied round
<lb/>his waist. His feet were torn in such a manner, that
<lb/>for six weeks he was unable to stand. He was nearly
<lb/>exhausted with pain and fatigue, when a servant of
<lb/><persName>Mr. G.'s</persName>, who had followed his master, took from his
<lb/>head his turban, and gave part of it to <persName>Mr. J.</persName>, who
<lb/>hastily wrapped it about his feet, which enabled him
<lb/>to proceed without sinking. He and <persName>Dr. Price</persName> were
<lb/>now chained together, and, with the other prisoners,
<lb/>put inside of a small wood prison almost gone to decay.
<lb/>We afterwards were informed that the Pagan Woon
<lb/>had sent the foreigners to this place with a design to
<lb/>sacrifice them, in order to ensure success in his con­
<lb/>templated expedition. But the King, suspecting him
<lb/>of treasonable intentions, caused him to be executed
<lb/>before he had time to accomplish his designs. I ob­
<lb/>tained a little room from one of the jailors, where I
<lb/>passed six months of constant and severe suffering,
<lb/>without any mitigation. <persName>Mr. J.</persName> was much more com­
<lb/>fortably situated than when in the city prison, as he
<lb/>had only one pair of fetters, and, when recovered from
<lb/>his fever and wounds, was allowed to walk in the
<lb/>prison enclosure. But I was deprived of every single
<lb/>convenience, and my health, which had enabled me to
<lb/>bear severe trials hitherto, now began to fail me. I
<pb n="300"/>
<milestone n="O6v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">300</mw>
<lb/>was taken with one of the country disorders, and for
<lb/>two months unable to go to <persName>Mr. J.'s</persName> prison. Our
<lb/>little <persName>Maria</persName>, who had just recovered from the small-
<lb/>pox, was near starving to death, as I could neither ob­
<lb/>tain a nurse nor a drop of milk in the village. But our
<lb/>merciful Father preserved us all through these dread­
<lb/>ful scenes, and at the expiration of six months an or­
<lb/>der arrived for the release of <persName>Mr. J.</persName>, and I was allowed
<lb/>to return to our house in town. The King was much
<lb/>in want of an interpreter, and from selfish motives had
<lb/>given orders for the release of <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>, who was
<lb/>immediately conducted to the Burmese camp, then at
<lb/><placeName>Ma-lown</placeName>, where he remained six weeks, translating
<lb/>for his Majesty. He was then sent back to <placeName>Ava</placeName>, and<choice><sic>-</sic><corr/></choice>
<lb/>as a reward for his services, ordered back to the <placeName>Oung-
<lb/>pen-la</placeName> prison. But before the order could be executed,
<lb/>I sent <persName>Moung Ing</persName> (being myself unable to move, hav­
<lb/>ing been ill with the typhus fever in <persName>Mr. J.'s</persName> absence,
<lb/>in which I lost my reason, and was senseless several
<lb/>days) to <persName>Koung-tong</persName>, who was now high in office,
<lb/>and had for a long time manifested a disposition to
<lb/>help us, and begged he would intercede for <persName>Mr. J.</persName>,
<lb/>and prevent his being sent again to prison. <persName>Koung-
<lb/>tong</persName> complied with my request, offered to become
<lb/>security for <persName>Mr. J.</persName>, and took him to his house, where
<lb/>he was kept a prisoner at large nearly two months
<lb/>longer. The British troops were now so rapidly ad­
<lb/>vancing, that the King and Government felt the neces­
<lb/>sity of taking some measures to prevent their arrival
<lb/>at the capital. They had before several times refused
<lb/>to listen to the terms which <persName>Sir Archibald Campbell</persName>
<lb/>had offered, but they now saw there was no other hope
<lb/>for the preservation of their golden city. <persName>Mr. J.</persName> was
<pb n="301"/>
<milestone n="O7r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">301</mw>
<lb/>daily called to the palace, his opinion requested in all
<lb/>their proceedings, and the Government finally en­
<lb/>treated him to go as their Ambassador to the English
<lb/>camp. This he entirely declined, but advised their
<lb/>sending <persName>Dr. Price</persName>, who had no objection to going.
<lb/><persName>Dr. P.</persName> being unsuccessful in his mission, on his return
<lb/><persName>Mr. J.</persName> was taken by force and sent with him again.
<lb/><persName>Sir Archibald</persName> had, before this, demanded us, together
<lb/>with the other foreign prisoners, but the King had
<lb/>refused, saying, <quote>They are my people,—let them
<lb/>remain.</quote> We did not then venture to express a wish
<lb/>to leave the country, fearing we should be immediately
<lb/>sent to prison. <persName>Mr. J.</persName> communicated our real situa­
<lb/>tion to the General, who, with all the feelings of a
<lb/>British officer, now demanded us in a way that his
<lb/>Majesty dared not refuse; and on the <date when="1826-02-21">21st of <name>February</name></date>,
<lb/>after an imprisonment of nearly two years, we took
<lb/>our leave of the golden city and all its magnificence,
<lb/>and turned our faces towards the British camp, then
<lb/>within forty miles of <placeName>Ava</placeName>. No one can conceive our
<lb/>joy when we had safely passed the Burman camp, for
<lb/>then we felt indeed that we were once more free, and
<lb/>out of the power of those <quote>whose tender mercies
<lb/>are cruel.</quote> The British General received us with all
<lb/>that kindness and hospitality for which your country­
<lb/>men are so far famed, provided us with every comfort
<lb/>during a fortnight's residence at the camp, and kindly
<lb/>sent us on to <placeName>Rangoon</placeName> in this gun-boat. We deeply
<lb/>feel the kindness of <persName>Sir Archibald Campbell</persName>, for,
<lb/>under the direction of Providence, he has been the
<lb/>means of delivering us from the iron grasp of the
<lb/><name>Burmans</name>. May God reward him an hundred fold,
<lb/>and prepare him for the future enjoyment of Heaven!</p>

                <p>To-day the king noticed me for the first
<lb/>time, though I have appeared before him nearly every
<lb/>day since our arrival. After making some enquiries,
<lb/>as usual, about <persName>brother Price</persName>, he added, <said>And you in
<lb/>black, what are you? a medical man, too?</said> <said>Not a
<lb/>medical man, but a teacher of religion, your majesty.</said>
<lb/>He proceeded to make a few enquiries about my re­
<lb/>ligion, and then put the alarming question, whether
<pb n="304"/>
<milestone n="O8v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">304</mw>
<lb/>any had embraced it. I evaded by saying, <said>Not here.</said>
<lb/>He persisted, <said>Are there any in <placeName>Rangoon</placeName>?</said> <said>There
<lb/>are a few.</said> <said>Are they foreigners?</said> I trembled for the
<lb/>consequences of an answer, which might involve the
<lb/>little church in ruin; but the truth must be sacrificed,
<lb/>or the consequences hazarded, and I therefore replied,
<lb/><said>There are some foreigners and some <name>Burmans</name>.</said> He
<lb/>remained silent a few moments, but presently shewed that he was not displeased, by asking a great variety of
<lb/>questions on religion, and geography, and astronomy,
<lb/>some of which were answered in such a satisfactory
<lb/>manner, as to occasion a general expression of appro­
<lb/>bation in all the court present. After his majesty
<lb/>retired a <foreign xml:lang="my">than-dau-tsen</foreign> (a royal secretary) entered into
<lb/>conversation, and allowed me to expatiate on several
<lb/>topics of the Christian religion, in my usual way. And
<lb/>all this took place in the hearing of the very man,
<lb/>now an <foreign xml:lang="my">at-wen-woon</foreign>, who, many years ago, caused his
<lb/>uncle to be tortured almost to death under the iron
<lb/>mall, for renouncing <name>Boodhism</name>, and embracing the
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Roman Catholic</rs> religion! Thanks be to God, for the
<lb/>encouragement of this day. The monarch of the
<lb/>empire has distinctly understood that some of his sub­
<lb/>jects have embraced the Christian religion, and his
<lb/>wrath has been restrained. Let us then hope, that as
<lb/>he becomes more acquainted with the excellence of
<lb/>the religion, he will be more and more willing that his
<lb/>subjects should embrace it.</p>

<lb/>procure a situation on which I might build a house, I
<lb/>had one noticeable interview with the king. <persName>Brother
<lb/>Price</persName> and two English gentlemen were present. The
<lb/>king appeared to be attracted by our number, and
<lb/>came towards us; but his conversation was directed
<lb/>chiefly to me. He again enquired about the <name>Burmans</name>
<lb/>who had embraced my religion. <said>Are they real <persName>Bur­
<lb/>mans</persName>? Do they dress like <name>Burmans</name>?</said> &amp;c. I had
<lb/>occasion to remark, that I preached every <name>Sunday</name>,
<lb/><said>What! in <name>Burman</name>?</said> Yes. <said>Let us hear how you
<lb/>preach.</said> I hesitated. An <foreign xml:lang="my">at-wen-woon</foreign> repeated the
<lb/>order. I began with a form of worship which first
<lb/>ascribes glory to God, and then declares the commands
<lb/>of the law of the gospel; after which I stopt. <said>Go
<lb/>on,</said> said another <foreign xml:lang="my">at-wen-woon</foreign>. The whole court was
<lb/>profoundly silent. I proceeded with a few sentences,
<lb/>declarative of the perfections of God, when his ma­
<lb/>jesty's curiousity was satisfied, and he interrupted me.
<lb/>In the course of subsequent conversation, he asked
		  <lb/>what I had to say of <persName>G<choice><sic>ua</sic><corr>au</corr></choice>dama</persName>? I replied that we all
<lb/>knew he was the son of <persName>King Thog-dau-dah-nah</persName>; that
<lb/>we regarded him as a wise man and a great teacher,
<lb/>but did not call him God. <said>That is right,</said> said
<lb/><persName>Moung K. N.</persName> (an <foreign xml:lang="my">at-wen-woon</foreign> who has not hitherto
<lb/>appeared very friendly to me,) as he proceeded to relate

<mw type="pageNum">311</mw>
<lb/>the substance of a long communication which I lately
<lb/>made to him in the privy-council room about God and
<lb/>Christ, &amp;c. And this he did in a very clear and satis­
<lb/>factory manner. <persName>Moung Zah</persName>, encouraged by all
<lb/>this, really began to take the side of God, before his
<lb/>majesty, and said, <said>Nearly all the world, your majesty,
<lb/>believe in an eternal God; all, except <placeName>Burmah</placeName> and
<lb/><placeName>Siam</placeName>, these little spots!</said> His majesty remained silent;
<lb/>and after some desultory inquiries he abruptly rose
<lb/>and retired.</p>

                <p>To-day I informed the king that it was

<lb/><foreign xml:lang="my">at-wen-woon</foreign> <persName>Moung Zah</persName>, inquired, <said>Will you both
<lb/>go, or will the doctor remain?</said> I said that he would
<lb/>remain. <persName>Brother Price</persName> made some remark on the
<lb/>approaching hot season, and the inconvenience of our
<lb/>present situation: on which <persName>Moung Zah</persName>, inferring
<lb/>that it was on account of the climate that I was about

<lb/>municated as much truth respectively as they could;

<lb/>he seemed to have reflected much on the subject, and
<lb/>to have become quite settled and inflexible in his con­

<lb/>at his house, lying down surrounded by forty or fifty
<lb/>of his people. I pressed forward into the foremost
<lb/>rank, and placed myself in a proper attitude. After a
<lb/>while his eye fell upon me, and I held up a small bottle
<lb/>of eau de luce, and desired to present it. One of his
<lb/>officers carried it to him. He happened to be much
<lb/>pleased with it, and sat upright—<said>What kind of a
<lb/>house do you intend to build?</said> I told him, but added,
<lb/><said>I have no place to build on, my lord.</said> He remained

<lb/>on the subject of religion. After some conversation,
<lb/>he desired a specimen of my mode of worship and

                <p>My dear Brother,—It has pleased the Great Ruler
<lb/>of the skies to bring us into the immediate presence
<lb/>of the king of <placeName>Burmah</placeName>. Just one year from my reach­
<lb/>ing <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, I was introduced into the palace of the
<lb/>great emperor, and informed that I must make his
<lb/>capital my place of residence. This is an event for
<lb/>which we have longed and prayed, as calculated to
<lb/>give stability to the mission in a land like this, where
<lb/>all are respected according to the notice bestowed on
<lb/>them by the king. Whether our anxious anticipations
<lb/>will be realized, is known only to Him on whose
<lb/>business we came, and who, we trust, has sent us
<lb/>hither for good. Our reception was gratifying. We
<lb/>were obliged to submit to no ceremony. As soon as
<lb/>the king was informed of our arrival, a royal order
<lb/>was issued for our immediate introduction. As we
<lb/>entered, with the impatience of a despotic prince, he
<lb/>called to know which was the doctor. We were
<lb/>taken into an open court, and seated on a bamboo
<lb/>floor, about ten feet from the chair of the monarch.
<lb/><said>They are from the western continent,</said> was the first
<lb/>remark; after which, one great man delivered his
<lb/>account to us. He then interrogated me as to my
<lb/>skill in curing eyes, cutting out wens, setting broken
<lb/>arms and legs, besides other things to which my skilL
<lb/>did not extend. Our medicines were then called for,
<lb/>and all my stock inspected. The surgical cases were
<lb/>much admired. After looking at mine, the king sent
<lb/>for his own; one case of which being unlike mine, he
<lb/>immediately gave it into my hands to use. This I
<pb n="315"/>
<milestone n="P2r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">315</mw>
<lb/>considered as equivalent to fixing me here for life.
<lb/>After my galvanic pile had amused the king and his
<lb/>courtiers for an hour, we were dismissed with an order
<lb/>to look out a place we liked, and he would build a
<lb/>house for us. An order was also given to look up all
<lb/>the diseased people, and have my decision upon them.</p>
                <p>The king is a man of small stature, very straight;
<lb/>steps with a natural air of superiority, but has not the
<lb/>least appearance of it in conversation. On the con­
<lb/>trary, he is always pleasant and good humoured, so
<lb/>far as I have yet seen him. He wears a red finely
<lb/>striped silk cloth from his waist to his knees, and a
<lb/>blue and white handkerchief on his head. He has
<lb/>apparently the good of his people, as well as the glory
<lb/>of his kingdom at heart; and is encouraging foreign
<lb/>merchants, and especially artisans, to settle in his
<lb/>capital. A watchmaker at this moment could obtain
<lb/>any favour he should please to ask. The same might
<lb/>be vouched for a chair-maker, or cabinet-maker, &amp;c.
<lb/>as the king has wisdom enough to prefer foreign
<lb/>manufacturers , when he sees their superiority to his
<lb/>own. On the subject of religion, he appears, like all
<lb/>his people, devoted to his idols. But he has never yet
<lb/>persecuted for religion's sake! O that he might yet be
<lb/>brought to know and love the supreme God! <mcr>Seven­
<lb/>teen millions of people, mad on their idols, demand the
<lb/>active sympathy of a Christian people.</mcr></p>

        <p>In another communication, the following passage
<lb/>occurs:—<quote>About the middle of <date when="--04"><name>April</name> last</date>, <persName>Dr.
 P.</persName>
<lb/>performed the operation for a cataract on both the
<lb/>eyes of a Burman woman, who had been blind two or
<lb/>three years. Soon after the experiment she could, by
<lb/>the aid of spectacles, see to read distinctly. The fact
<pb n="316"/>
<milestone n="P2v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">316</mw>
<lb/>excited so great a curiosity, that the house in which
<lb/>the doctor resided, was thronged by visitors with dis­
<lb/>eased eyes. So great was the concourse, that they
<lb/>were obliged to bar the doors of their house, that they
<lb/>might study, or eat, without interruption. With the
<lb/>advice of <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>, <persName>Dr. Price</persName> has hired two or three
<lb/>native converts to assist him in the performance for
<lb/>good cataracts, and all easy surgical operations. By
<lb/>the assistance of these men, whom he considers faith­
<lb/>ful, he occupies two or three hours in a day in attending
<lb/>to the cases presented. The governor's wife has
<lb/>sent for the doctor twice; and he is strongly inclined
<lb/>to the hope that God will grant <persName>Mr. Judson</persName> and him­
<lb/>self the favour of the rulers of this land.</quote></p>
        <p>These hopes were of course disappointed, in con­
<lb/>sequence of the war that subsequently broke out; and
<lb/>the extreme sufferings of the missionaries are detailed
<lb/>in <persName>Mrs. Judson's</persName> XVIIth Letter.</p>
        <p>The last information received respecting <persName>Mr. Judson</persName>,
<lb/>is, that he was present at the laying of the foundation of
<lb/>a new town, to be named <placeName>Amherst-town</placeName>, in <placeName>Martaban</placeName>,
<lb/>one of the provinces ceded to the <name>British</name>, and that he
<lb/>had been engaged in offering up a public prayer on
<lb/>that occasion. He had determined to accompany <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Crawford</persName>, the envoy, to the court of <placeName>Ava</placeName>, as inter­
	  <lb/>preter and translator. It is added, that <persName>Mrs. Judson</persName>
<lb/>and he are likely, eventually, to take up their residence
<lb/>in that place, whither many of the <name>Burmans</name> are resort­
<lb/>ing, there to prosecute, under the protection of the
<lb/>British government, their work of Christian bene­
<lb/>volence.</p>
