<lb/>account for their having been collected into a
<lb/>Volume, by relating a tale of domestic sorrow,
<lb/>which would sadden the humane, and weary
<lb/>the attention of the indifferent Reader. The
<lb/>poetical attempts now offered to the protec­
<lb/>tion of the Public were, however, all written
<lb/>previous to the circumstances which may excuse
<lb/>the form of their publication, and while Hope,
<lb/>and the frequent gratification of the social feel­
<lb/>ing, among persons of taste and vivacity, gave
<lb/>wings to the fancy, and buoyancy to the mind.

        <p><lb/>The feelings of gratitude for the generous
<lb/>patronage which this little Book has already re­
<lb/>ceived, are too deeply felt and too intimately
<lb/>connected with a recent affliction, to allow of
<lb/>the ornaments of verse.

<lb/>to the undertaking, it may perhaps be admitted
