          <p rend="first-indent(1)"><hi rend="">This</hi> Legendary Tale is taken from the translation of an
	    <lb/>Irish MS; it relates to a Chieftain of <placeName>Monaghan</placeName>, named
	    <lb/><persName>McMahown</persName>, who seemed to have been the terror of the neigh­
<lb/>bouring Counties.
</p>
          <p rend="first-indent(1)">Amongst his many usurpations was that of the Castle of
	    <lb/><placeName>St. Donaught</placeName>, situated on the confines of <placeName>Lough Earne</placeName>,
	    <lb/>County of <placeName>Fermanagh</placeName>,belonging to a neighbouring Chief;
	    <lb/>while that Chieftain and his friend <persName>Roderick</persName> were bravely
	    <lb/>defending their country against foreign invaders, <persName>Mchown</persName>
<lb/>assailed that Fortress, took it by surprise, and seized the
	    <lb/><persName>Lady Donalfraide</persName>, with whon he was enamoured, but by
<lb/>whom he had been rejected; her only alternative now was,
<lb/>either to become his Bride—or remain his Prisoner—she pre­
<lb/>ferred the latter.
</p>
          <p rend="first-indent(1)">Upon this incident the following little Legend appears to
<lb/>have been founded;  the Scene lies partly in the County of

	    <lb/>the <placeName>Isle of Wight</placeName> abounds, the Land-slip at <placeName>Pitlands</placeName>, <placeName>Under-
<lb/>Cliff</placeName>, stands pre-eminent, embracing a considerable extent of
<lb/>the Sea Coast on the South-side of the Island.  The Ground
<lb/>has, it is evident, from time to time given way.  The Land­
<lb/>slip in question, however, took place about eleven years since,
<lb/>and of course presents a most interesting appearance to the
<lb/>curious.
</p>
          <p>The lapse which began with a great Founder, from the base
	    <lb/>of the Cliff, immediately under <placeName>St. Catharine's</placeName>, kept gliding
<lb/>down, and at last rushed on with such violence as to change the
<lb/>surface on the ground, so that the whole is at present as if it
<lb/>had been convulsed and scattered about by an Earthquake.</p>
          <p rend="indent(1)">In this partial convulsion of Nature, a Cottage, which stood
<lb/>near the declivity, was precipitated forward towards the Sea
<lb/>with the moving mass of earth, and overwhelmed.  From these
<lb/>combined circumstances the following little <mcr rend="slant(smallcaps)">Poem</mcr> originated.

          <p><persName rend="case(allcaps)">Pliny</persName> has transmitted to us the history of the Maid of

	    <ref xml:id="er14" type="error" target="#ec14"><persName>Dibutadis</persName></ref>, a potter of
<placeName>Sicyon</placeName>, who
	    <lb/>first formed likenesses at <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, but was indebted to his
<lb/>Daughter for the invention!—The girl being in love with a
<lb/>young man, who was going from her into some remote country,
<lb/>traced with a pencil, made of charcoal, the lines of his face,
<lb/>from the reflection of his shadow upon a wall, by lamp-light;
<lb/>her Father filling up the lines with clay, formed a bust, and
<lb/>hardened it in the fire with the rest of his earthen ware.  Athe­
<lb/>nagoras, the Athenian philosopher, gives a similar account of
<lb/>this curious and interesting anecdote, adding the circumstance,
<lb/>that the youth was <emph>sleeping</emph> when the likeness was taken from
<lb/>his shadow.  The same writer, who lived in the second century
<lb/>of the Christian æra, informs us, that this monument of ancient
	    <lb/>art was extant at <placeName>Corinth</placeName> in his time; though <persName>Pliny</persName> seems to
<lb/>insinuate, that it did not survive the taking of that city by
	    <lb/><persName>Mummius</persName>.  In the poesies of <persName>Fontenelle</persName> there is an epistle
	    <lb/>from the Maid of <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, whom the author calls <persName>Dibutadis</persName>,
	    <lb/>to her imaginary lover <persName>Polemon</persName>.  She descrivbes her work in the

          <head>To the Reader.</head>
          <p><hi rend="">The</hi> Author here feels herself called upon to apologize to
<lb/>the English reader, for the locality of the few following Poems;
	    <lb/>but as so many of the Irish now reside in <placeName>England</placeName>, she hopes
<lb/>that that circumstance will sufficiently plead her excuse; and
<lb/>that although they may have for a tine deserted—they have not
<lb/>become completely indifferent to their Native Land—Surely they
<lb/>must feel themselves interested for their National Music!  to
<lb/>which these Poems allude—and which is still kept up by the
	    <lb/>Society at <placeName>Belfast</placeName>; though the Author is sorry to say the
	    <lb/><mcr rend="slant(italic)">Metropolis</mcr> of <placeName>Ireland</placeName> could not boast of equal <mcr rend="slant(italic)">Patriotism</mcr>.
</p>
          <p>It is more than probable that in half a Century their Music
<lb/>woudl have been so neglected, or mixed up in modern com—
<lb/>positions, as to have been sunk for ever in the deep Stream
	    <lb/>of Time, had not <persName>Carolan</persName> in time stepped forward and rescued
<lb/>many of their most valuable National Airs.  Possibly to his
<lb/>example we owe the reclaiming those delightful medodies so

	    <lb/>tian religion was established in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>—they light them on
	    <lb/>Midsummer Eve, the Vigil of <persName>St. John</persName>, their favourite Saint,
<lb/>thus blending idolatry with the Christian religion.
</p>
          <p>Possibly those who are unacquainted with the customs of
	    <lb/><placeName>Ireland</placeName>, may wish to be informed of the ceremonies of the
	    <lb/><name>Beil-tinne</name>, as practised even at this day, by the lower orders.
</p>
          <p>Where can we find a stronger light to pierce through
<lb/>the dark veil of antiquity, than in the customs of a nation,
<lb/>by which we may discover their origin, from the analogy
<lb/>which they bear to other Countries?
</p>
          <p>The <name>Irish</name> are very expert in carrying fire from immense
<lb/>distances.  Is not this habit a strong presumption in favour
	    <lb/>of the opinion of our best Antiquarians, that <placeName>Ireland</placeName> was
<lb/>early inhabited by a Scythic Colony?</p>

          <p>We know that the religion professed by <persName>Bactria</persName>, and per­
	    <lb/>haps of the neighbouring countries, was that of <persName>Zoroaster</persName>—
	    <lb/>who taught his followers to worship <persName>Mithra</persName>, or the
<lb/>Sun, for their God, and to light fires in honour of him,
<lb/>kindled from a ray of that luminary.  Different Temples
<lb/>were erected, where the fire was continually kept burn­
	    <lb/>ing.  Might not the round Towers of <placeName>Ireland</placeName> which have
<lb/>given rise to so many strange conjectures, have been
<lb/>erected for the same purposes?
</p>
          <p>I hazard this conjecture, for as yet, with regard to them,
<lb/>nothing certain has been determined, and all still remains
<lb/>enveloped in the mists of obscurity!
</p>
          <p>It was the duty of the Priests to watch their fire
<lb/>Temples night and day, to prevent the pure flame from ex­
<lb/>piring—but if by any unforeseen accident, this event
<lb/>deemed so unfortunate, was to happen, they were obliged to
<lb/>relight it from that holy Temple whose fire had been kindled
	    <lb/>by a ray from the Sun; and so sacred, according to <persName>Pri­
	      <lb/>deaux</persName>, (<bibl>See <author><persName>Prideaux's</persName></author> Connections</bibl>) did they hold this
 fire,
<lb/>that the Priests were not permitted, while carrying it, to pre­
<lb/>vent its being extinguished, by their breath, or by any other
<lb/>means, than that of the breath of Heaven.
</p>
          <p>The Irish Peasantry are at this day very expert in carry­
<lb/>ing fire, either of coal or charcoal, to great distance, by
<lb/>means of a damp whisp of straw or hay; in doing this,
<lb/>when the fire appears to be nearly extinguished, they lay
<lb/>the whisp which contains the fire upon the ground, in some
<lb/>spot where there is a current of air; when they take it up
<pb n="182"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Aa3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">182</mw>
<lb/>again, they are observed to whirl it round with considera­
<lb/>ble velocity, but never to blow upon it with their breath.
</p>
          <p>It is customary on the first of <name>May</name> and Midsummer Eve,
	    <lb/>for the <name>Irish</name> to light bone-fires, round which they dance in
<lb/>groupes, and many of the most active or most superstitious
<lb/>leap nimbly over them, imagining that by this strange cere­
<lb/>mony, they insure to themselves good fortune during the
	    <lb/>year.  In some parts of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, the youth of both sexes
<lb/>form a kind of figure dance, whirling round at the same
<lb/>time lighted brands or furze, smeared with pitch, which
<lb/>flame like torches—which reminds us of the sacrifices and
<lb/>funeral dances of the Ancients to appease the infernal
<lb/>Deities:  these customs must no doubt be of very ancient
<lb/>date, and long antecedent to the Christian æra.
</p>
          <p>I hope the reader will excuse one more note which
<lb/>seems undoubtedly to strengthen this opinion.

            <quote><persName>Moloch</persName>, it is certain, was the principal Idol of the

<lb/>by way of lustration and purification as they called it—and
