<lb/>public, under a circumſtance which has
<lb/>given my mind the moſt exquiſite uneaſineſs.
<lb/>On the morning after the firſt repreſentation,
<lb/>it was obſerved by the papers that there had
<lb/>been perſons preſent at the Theatre the pre­
<lb/>ceding evening, who went there <emph>determined</emph> to
<lb/>diſapprove at all events. From ſuch a de­
<lb/>termination it is hard indeed to eſcape! And
<lb/>the oppoſition intended, was juſtified it ſeems,
<lb/>by the indecency of ſome of the expreſſions.
<lb/>—From ſuch a charge I feel it impoſſible to
<lb/>defend myſelf; for againſt an imputation like
<lb/>this, even <emph>vindication</emph> becomes diſgraceful!

        <p rend="first-indent(1)"><lb/>As I was not at the Theatre, I ſhould have
<lb/>had ſome difficulty in underſtanding at what
<lb/>paſſages the objections were levelled, had not
<lb/>one of the papers recorded them, with many
<lb/>cruel remarks. The particulars which were
<lb/>thus pointed out, will, I truſt, be a ſufficient
<lb/>apology for themſelves. In the following
<lb/>pages they are <emph>all</emph> reſtored; that the public
<lb/><emph rend="case(allcaps)">at large</emph> may have the power to adjudge
<lb/>me, as well as that ſmall part of it, confined
<lb/>within the walls of a Theatre.
</p>
        <p rend="first-indent(1)"><lb/>Theſe paſſages have not been reſtored from
<lb/>any pertinacious opinion of their beauty—
<lb/>for other expreſſions might have conveyed my
<lb/>intention as well; but had I allowed one line
<lb/>to ſtand as altered for the ſtage, what might
<lb/>not that reprobated line have been ſuppoſed
<lb/>to expreſs? I ſhrink from the idea! And
<lb/>therefore moſt ſolemnly aver, that the Comedy,
<lb/>as now printed, contains <emph rend="case(allcaps)">every word</emph> which
<lb/>was oppoſed the firſt night, from the ſuſpicion
<lb/>of indelicacy; hoping their <emph>obvious</emph> meaning
<lb/>only will be attended to, without the coarſe
<lb/>ingenuity of ſtrained explanations; which

<lb/>to ſurround my talk of dramatic writing, with
<lb/>as many difficulties as poſſible.
</p>
        <p rend="first-indent(1)"><lb/>A celebrated Critic, more attended to for
<lb/>the diſcrimination and learning which appear
<lb/>in his ſtrictures, than for their <emph>lenity</emph>; in his

<lb/>lowing.

<persName rend="slant(upright)">Mrs. Cowley</persName> gets poſſeſſion of
<lb/>the ſpirit and turn of a character, ſhe
<lb/>ſpeaks the language of <emph>that</emph> character better
<lb/>than <emph>any</emph> of her dramatic cotemporaries.</said>
        </p>
        <p rend="first-indent(1)"><lb/>This, I confeſs, I hold to be very high
<lb/>praiſe; and it is to this very praiſe, which
<lb/>my cotemporaries reſolve I ſhall have no
<lb/>claim. They will allow me, indeed, to draw
<lb/>ſtrong character, but it muſt be without
<lb/>ſpeaking its language. I may give vulgar or
<lb/>low bred perſons, but they muſt converſe in
<lb/>a ſtile of elegance. I may deſign the coarſeſt
<lb/>manners, or the moſt diſguſting folly, but its
<lb/>expreſſions must not deviate from the line of

<pb n="vi"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="A3v"/>

<lb/>politeneſs. Surely it would be as juſt to exact
<lb/>from the Artiſts who are painting the Gallery
<lb/>of <persName>Shakeſpeare</persName>, that they ſhould compleat
<lb/>their deſigns without the uſe of light and
<lb/>ſhade.
</p>
        <p rend="first-indent(1)"><lb/>It cannot be the <emph>Poet's</emph> mind, which the
<lb/>public deſire to trace, in dramatic repreſenta­
<lb/>tion; but the mind of the <emph>characters</emph>, and
<lb/>the truth of their colouring. Yet in my caſe
<lb/>it ſeems reſolved that the point to be con­
<lb/>ſidered, is not whether that <mcr>dotard</mcr>, or that
<lb/><mcr>pretender</mcr>, or that <mcr>coquet</mcr>, would ſo have given
<lb/>their feelings, but whether <persName rend="slant(italic)"><hi rend="slant(upright)">Mrs.</hi> Cowley</persName>
<lb/>ought ſo to have expreſſed herſelf.
</p>
        <p rend="first-indent(1)"><lb/>This is a criterion which happily no author
<lb/>is ſubjected to, but thoſe of the drama.
<lb/>The Noveliſt may uſe the boldeſt tints;—
<lb/>ſeizing Nature for her guide, ſhe may dart
<lb/>through every rank of ſociety, drag forth
<lb/>not only the accompliſhed, but the ignorant,
<lb/>the coarſe, and the vulgar-rich; diſplay them
<lb/>in their ſtrongeſt colours, and ſnatch immor­
<lb/>tality both for them, and for herſelf! I, on

<lb/>the contrary, feel encompaſſed with chains
<lb/>when I write, which check me in my hap­
<lb/>pieſt flights, and force me continually to re­
<lb/>flect, not, whether <emph>this is juſt</emph>? but, whether
<lb/><emph>this is ſafe</emph>?
</p>
        <p rend="first-indent(1)"><lb/>Theſe are vain regrets, which I hope my
<lb/>readers will pardon me, for having a moment
<lb/>indulged. I now haſten to that part of the
<lb/>Comedy which will be found in the following
<lb/>ſheets, as <mcr>altered</mcr> for the ſecond repreſentation.
</p>
        <p rend="first-indent(1)"><lb/>The idea of the buſineſs which concerns
<lb/><persName rend="slant(upright)">Antonia</persName>, <persName rend="slant(upright)">Henry</persName>, and
<persName rend="slant(upright)">Gaſper</persName> was preſented
<lb/>to me in an obſolete Comedy; the work of
<lb/>a poet of the drama, once highly celebrated.
<lb/>I ſay the <mcr>idea</mcr>, for when it is known that in
<lb/>the original the ſcene lay amongſt traders in
<lb/>the city of <placeName>London</placeName>—and thoſe traders of the
<lb/>loweſt and moſt deteſtable manners, it will
<lb/>be conceived at once, that in removing it to
<lb/><placeName>Portugal</placeName>, and fixing the characters amongſt
<lb/>the nobility, it was hardly poſſible to carry
<lb/>with me <mcr>more</mcr> than the idea. The circum­
<lb/>ſtance which moſt particularly intereſted me;

<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">and</mw>
<pb n="viii"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="A4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">[␣viii␣]</mw>
<lb/>and fixed itſelf in my mind, was that of
<lb/>ſnatching a young woman from a hateful
<lb/>marriage, the moment before that marriage
<lb/>became valid—that is to ſay, after the cere­
<lb/>mony. This very circumſtance to which the
<lb/>Comedy owes its exiſtence, was that, which
<lb/>ſome of the audience found diſcordant to
<lb/>their feelings. An event which had in the
<lb/>laſt century been ſtampt with the higheſt
<lb/>applauſe, (tho' ſurrounded by many repulſive
<lb/>circumſtances) was found in this, to be ill­
<lb/>conceived. I did not, however, diſpute the
<lb/>deciſion of my Critics,—and the marriage
<lb/>has been in courſe diſſolved.
</p>
        <p rend="first-indent(1)"><lb/>The manner in which the Comedy has
<lb/>ſince been received, gives room to ſuppoſe
<lb/>that the alteration is approved. It has ſtruggled
<lb/>with many oppreſſive circumſtances: the
<lb/>chaſm in the performance, occaſioned by the
<lb/>repeated illneſs of <persName>Mr. Parſons</persName>, was ſufficient
<lb/>to have ſunk it;—but neither that, nor the
<lb/>ſterile month of <name>December</name>, always <mcr>againſt</mcr>
<lb/>the Theatres, has prevented its being diſ­
<lb/>tinguiſhed by many brilliant and crouded

<lb/>nights. I now reſign it to the cloſet, where
<lb/>without the aid of fine acting, or the faſci­

<lb/>force from the pen which compoſed it, it
