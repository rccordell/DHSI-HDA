	  <p>Apropos――This reminds me of the metrical
	    <lb/>romance writer, <persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Walter Scott</persName>, who has recently
	    <lb/>taken upon himself the dull, but rapid means of
	    <lb/><emph>adding</emph> to <emph>the weight</emph> of his purse,――that of Editor­
	    <lb/>ship.  To be an Editor, a man must possess judg­
	    <lb/>ment and patience. If he has genius, he becomes, in
	    <lb/>my opinion, superior to the dull business of compar­
	    <pb xml:id="hypb01" corresp="#docb01"/>
	    <lb/>ing and arranging; and indeed I do not think a man
	    <lb/>of genius can fetter his mind to it. It is for this
	    <lb/>reason alone I suspect that the good <persName>Walter</persName> has em­
	    <lb/>ployed <seg xml:id="a0131" corresp="#n0131" rend="post(*)">agents</seg> in the 
	    execution of <bibl rend="pre(“)post(”)case(smallcaps)"><title>The Works of
		<lb/><persName>Dryden</persName>, complete,</title> edited by <author><persName>Walter Scott</persName></author>;</bibl>
	    <lb/>and I really look upon him as a literary tyrant, who
	    <lb/>employs unworthy agents in the execution of his
	    <lb/>ambitious and interested designs. The good <persName>Wal­
	      <lb/>ter</persName>'s reputation was at <quote rend="slant(italic)">blood heat,</quote> previous to the
	    <lb/>publication of this work; but it fell, and rapidly too,
	    <lb/>to <quote rend="slant(italic)">temperate,</quote> shortly after its appearance. It is
	    <lb/>indeed but a very <emph>mediocre</emph> performance.</p>
	  <p>The conduct of this literati reminds me of the
	    <lb/>arts which <persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Sertorius</persName> made use of to gull the Barba­
	    <lb/>rians. It may be remembered with how small a force
	    <lb/>he resisted, and sometimes repulsed, the legions of
	    <lb/><placeName>Rome</placeName>: but, however fortunate, and however great,
	    <lb/>however devoted the Barbarians might be to him,
	    <lb/>he found it necessary to avail himself of their igno­
	    <lb/>rance and superstition, in the prosecution of his
	    <lb/>designs. His agent, for this purpose, was a beautiful
	    <lb/>white hind, which he informed them was sent by the
	    <lb/>Gods. The delight I have felt on reading <title rend="pre(“)post(”)case(smallcaps)">The

	      <lb/>wrote this celebrated tale at an age, when

	      <lb/>dulged, by pursuing the tales of chivalry,
	      <lb/>of superstition, and of faëry of our own

            <p>This gentleman censures <persName>Mr. Lewis</persName>'s

	      <lb/>which each of them (all originals in their

            <p>The eldest brother, <persName>Mr. Ralph Mar­
		<lb/>sham</persName>, was left in possession of a small
	      <lb/>paternal estate, comfortable, because clear
	      <lb/>and unincumbered; but income-tax, pro­
	      <lb/>perty-tax, and land-tax, had rendered him
	      <lb/>less rich than in the days of his youth:
	      <lb/>and a most valuable farm being attached
	      <lb/>to his estate, he resolved to superintend it
	      <lb/>himself, and indeed to work on it with the
	      <lb/>same indefatigable toil which his labourers
	      <lb/>bestowed upon it, in order to ensure to
	      <lb/>themselves the excellent and plentiful cheer,
	      <lb/>together with the ample wages which <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Marsham</persName> allowed them.</p>

	      <lb/>of land; and the master's watchful eyes,
	      <lb/>and even his assistance united, will not
	      <lb/>avail much, if he is not a thorough judge
	      <lb/>of that profession which is universally al­
	      <lb/>lowed to be the most happy and indepen­
	      <lb/>dent of any in the world.</p>
            <p>But <persName>Ralph</persName> derived one advantage by
	      <lb/>his perseverance; he made labour easy and
	      <lb/>habitual to him, by boldly inuring him­
	      <lb/>self to it; and continual and heavy losses,
	      <lb/>blights in his corn, diseases in his cattle,
	      <lb/>and the frauds of his serving-men, soon
	      <lb/>reduced him to that state which rendered
	      <lb/>exertion on his own part, and unwearied
	      <lb/>employment about his farm, an indispen­
	      <lb/>sible obligation.</p>
            <p>He was endowed with a solidity of un­
	      <lb/>derstanding, good, honest principles, but
	      <lb/>was rather a kind of every-day character;
	      <lb/>and was chiefly guided both in the pursuits
	      <lb/>of his studies, and all his most important
	      <lb/>actions, by mere matter of fact.</p>
            <p><persName>Charles</persName>, the second brother, had been

            <p>An early introduction into the world's
	      <lb/>grand theatre had given, to a prepossessing
	      <lb/>person, an ease of manners, and a certain
	      <lb/>address, which marked the gentleman in
	      <lb/>every movement, and which the society of
	      <lb/>the army alone is capable of imparting to
	      <lb/>the well-born officer: the heart of <persName>Charles</persName>
	      <lb/>was warm, and might with truth be said,
	      <lb/>to be seated in its right place—but his head
	      <lb/>approached to that temperature which is
	      <lb/>generally known by the appellation of <term>hot;</term>
	      <lb/>which heat often led him astray: his tem­
	      <lb/>per and his expressions were both hasty,
	      <lb/>and in the latter he thought no epithet too
	      <lb/>energetic to evince his indignation against
	      <lb/>the person who had offended him: but the
	      <lb/>principles of revenge and resentment only
	      <lb/>played upon his <emph>lip</emph>, they never entered his
	      <lb/>generous and excellent <emph>heart!</emph></p>

	      <lb/>woe, either real or fictitious, always sur­
	      <lb/>charged his heart, and caused the tender
	      <lb/>overflow to glisten in his eye.</p>
            <p><persName>Edward</persName>, the youngest, had just attain­
	      <lb/>ed his forty-second year; he was bred to
	      <lb/>the church, and <mcr>enjoyed</mcr> a curacy of <measure><emph>fifty
		  <lb/>pounds per annum!</emph></measure> He had been for
	      <lb/>some years a widower, and was the father
	      <lb/>of two daughters, the surviving children
	      <lb/>of five, by an unportioned, amiable, and
	      <lb/>by him, ever-lamented wife.</p>
            <p>As he had a right honourable young
	      <lb/>rector, who hated the church most cor­
	      <lb/>dially, except by those emoluments it
	      <lb/>brought him, through a considerable li­
	      <lb/>ving; and who rapaciously seized on every
	      <lb/>perquisite that his poor curate in the coun­
	      <lb/>try might have enjoyed, under one more
	      <lb/>kind and beneficent; <persName>Edward</persName>, except for
	      <lb/>the bounty of honest <persName>Ralph</persName>, would have

            <p>To those who were not acquainted with
	      <lb/><persName>Edward</persName>'s real character, there appeared a
	      <lb/>moroseness about him, which was repel­
	      <lb/>lant in the extreme: his manners were cy­
	      <lb/>nical, and his sentences in general short and
	      <lb/>severe: having in his infancy received a
	      <lb/>most severe castigation, through the per­
	      <lb/>fidy and duplicity of a schoolfellow, whom
	      <lb/>the generosity of his heart forbade him to
	      <lb/>betray, he had taken such an abhorrence
	      <lb/>to the vice of lying, that he thought no
	      <lb/>punishment too severe for the offence; and
	      <lb/>no outward terms that language can be­
	      <lb/>stow, strong enough to express his indig­
	      <lb/>nation at so despicable a vice. <said>I can

            <p>The fascination of habit is not easily
	      <lb/>done away; and the arrival of the post­

	      <lb/>said <persName>Edward</persName>, <said>is another lying business!
		<lb/>two days ago there was a current report,
		<lb/>that the republican reformist, the old crony
		<lb/>and defender of <persName>Colonel Despard</persName>, had been
		<lb/>killed in a duel! and here, this day, I find
		<lb/>it asserted to have been a mere fabrica­

            <p><said>Come, come,</said> said <persName>Ralph</persName>, <said>a truce

	      <lb/>the volume, whose enthusiastic expressions
	      <lb/>had so much displeased him, into the fire.</p>
            <p>This caused an hearty laugh from

	      <lb/>cynical <persName>Edward</persName> relaxed a little on the oc­
	      <lb/>casion.</p>
            <p><persName>Ralph</persName> did not appear a <emph>merry</emph> man, but
	      <lb/>there was a certain humour in his actions,

	      <lb/>diverted only, when performed or spoken

	      <lb/>in another they would have been flat, nor
	      <lb/>could the record of them afford amuse­
	      <lb/>ment.</p>
            <p><persName>Charles</persName>, like the famous <persName>Will Honey­

	      <lb/>shrewdness and quickness about him: <persName>Ed­

	      <lb/>solid sense, untainted religion, virtue, and
	      <lb/>honesty: and though <persName>Ralph</persName> was the blunt
	      <lb/>farmer, <persName>Charles</persName> tutored but little, except
	      <lb/>in the field of valour, and <persName>Edward</persName> often
	      <lb/>apparently the snarling philosopher, yet
	      <lb/>they all inherited those unshaken principles
	      <lb/>of the mind and heart, on which sure basis

            <p><persName>Mary</persName>, the eldest of the <persName>Reverend Mr.

	      <lb/>ditional attraction from a long, dark eye­

	      <lb/><soCalled><rs type="properAdjective">Grecian</rs></soCalled>; but it was well formed, and no

	      <lb/>that is the present fashion of the day;
	      <lb/>though we have not yet heard of any

            <p>The mouth of <persName>Mary</persName> vied in colour with

	      <lb/>in competition with ivory: her form was

	      <lb/>and of a plumpness approaching to <foreign xml:lang="fr">em­

	      <lb/>and her ear so perfectly correct, that her

	      <lb/>but as all the brothers judged that it
	      <lb/>would be only an ornamental part of educa­
	      <lb/>tion, which she would in her present and
	      <lb/>future sphere of life never have occasion

	      <lb/>the delightful warblings of her wild notes,
	      <lb/>with which she often charmed their hours
	      <lb/>of rural leisure.</p>
            <p><persName>Margaret</persName>, or as we shall sometimes have
	      <lb/>occasion to call her, <persName>Margaritta</persName>, was one
	      <lb/>year younger than her sister; her stature
	      <lb/>might rather be called short than tall, and
	      <lb/>not very well proportioned; for her shoul­
	      <lb/>ders were exceeding broad, which defect
	      <lb/>she always dignified by saying she had

	      <lb/>of appeal to heaven: her forehead was
	      <lb/>much seamed by the small-pox; the rest
	      <lb/>of her face had pretty well escaped that
	      <lb/>rueful malady; and her small rosy mouth
	      <lb/>resembled that of her sister, only with this
	      <lb/>difference; <persName>Mary</persName> looked best when she
	      <lb/>spoke or smiled, <persName>Margaret</persName> looked best
	      <lb/>with her mouth close shut; for having one

	      <lb/>the hard claw of a fine rock lobster for the
	      <lb/>fish itself, in her attempts to masticate it
	      <lb/>she unfortunately broke two of her front
	      <lb/>teeth, which gave her rather an unpleasant

            <p>These defects in her person, her health

            <p>The effects of this reading, on a mind
	      <lb/>easily softened and naturally weak, is al­

	      <lb/>to amuse an hour, and never suffered it to

            <p><persName>Margaret</persName>, in spite of all her father's in­

	      <lb/>languishing under a severe parent's cruel
	      <lb/>rigidity; while her benefactor, her kind
	      <lb/><persName>uncle Ralph</persName>, she looked upon as little
	      <lb/>better than a mere brute; toward her <persName>uncle
		<lb/>Charles</persName> she wavered in her affections, and

	      <lb/>would drop a tear, with the ready shilling

		<lb/>Charles</persName> was the only soul in the family

	      <lb/>Oh! she detests the very sight of <persName>uncle

	      <lb/>through fields of slaughter, or reside in a

	      <lb/>oh! what would she not give could she

	      <lb/>hangs over her head, she says, and she is
	      <lb/>the most miserable of created beings.</p>
            <p>The heroine of a romance, she knows,

            <p>The heart of the lively <persName>Mary</persName>, though

            <p>His complexion, like that of many of

            <p>The first of these gentlemen, <persName>Sir Charles

	      <lb/>and his lady.</p>

	      <lb/>loved as his own child.</p>
            <p>The humble friend was a <persName>Mrs. Kennedy</persName>,

            <p>Though <persName>Mrs. Kennedy</persName> was possessed of

	      <lb/>in the expression of her thoughts which

	      <lb/>wonder where he was: to indulge a pretty

	      <lb/>she has, in the confined metre of poetry,
	      <lb/>rendered her meaning wholly unintelligible.</p>
            <p>Her general conduct was rather of the
	      <lb/>artful kind; and she knew well how to
	      <lb/>preserve her rich and titled friends; and

            <p><persName>The Right Honorable Rector</persName>'s cha­

            <p><persName>Lady Caroline Leslie</persName> was the very life of
	      <lb/>fashion, and gave in to every species of
	      <lb/><mcr>tonish</mcr> dissipation; but gambling was her
	      <lb/>prevailing fault: she would have been
	      <lb/>handsome, had not the continual vigils of
	      <lb/>deep play rendered her complexion too sal­
	      <lb/>low, and her eyes too hollow for any art to
	      <lb/>restore to their native hue and lustre: she
	      <lb/>was not averse to gallantry, and so ready
	      <lb/>to assist it in another, that she has even
	      <lb/>facilitated the elopement of a sister from

	      <lb/>from taking any part herself in the annals

            <p><persName>Lady Isabella Emerson</persName> was like her
	      <lb/>sister, a great votary of fashion, but de­
	      <lb/>tested play, except that kind of play which

	      <lb/>modern <mcr>quiz</mcr> and daily <mcr>hoax</mcr> were calculated
	      <lb/>to give to her mischievous abilities.</p>
            <p>Like <persName>Margaritta</persName>, she was very fond of
	      <lb/>modern publications, but her studies were
	      <lb/>of a different kind, and all consisted of
	      <lb/>false systems: the deluding sophistry of

	      <lb/>whose language she was well acquainted,
	      <lb/>and whose dangerous and delusive princi­
	      <lb/>ples she imbibed; from whose fascinating
	      <lb/>descriptions she found vice stripped of its
	      <lb/>hideous appearance, and wearing an angel's
	      <lb/>form; while for her lighter reading she
	      <lb/>perused the loose sentiments contained in
	      <lb/>the <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> novels of <title rend="pre()post()slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">Fablaus; Le Fils

	      <lb/>The effects of such studies on a mind like
	      <lb/>that of <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>'s may well be con­
	      <lb/>ceived; marriage she held in utter contempt,
	      <lb/>openly expatiated on the folly of all the
	      <lb/>outward ceremonies of religion, and was a
	      <lb/>very pretty female atheist.<anchor xml:id="a026" corresp="#n026" rend="pre(*)"/></p>

            <p><persName>Sir Charles Sefton</persName>, her admirer, who was

		<lb/>thirty</mcr>, took all possible pains to con­
	      <lb/>ceal his real age from the quick eyes of his
	      <lb/>shrewd and penetrating mistress: he had
	      <lb/>been so much the martyr to the various
	      <lb/>vices of fashion, that he looked more than
	      <lb/>fifty-five; but his family and connexions

	      <lb/>and he was therefore looked upon by the
	      <lb/>friends of <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> as a most desir­
	      <lb/>able match; and her youth, beauty, and
	      <lb/>vivacity, made this whimsical <mcr>beau</mcr> ima­
	      <lb/>gine himself to be deeply in love: he really
	      <lb/>idolized her for her love of ridicule, so
	      <lb/>prevalent in his own nature; and pictured
	      <lb/>to himself the happy hours they should
	      <lb/>pass together, in mutually laughing at the
	      <lb/>whole circle of their friends and acquaint­
	      <lb/>ance; while his consummate vanity would
	      <lb/>not suffer him to see, that <emph>he</emph> chiefly was
	      <lb/>the decided mark at which <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>

            <p><persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName> was a worthy

	      <lb/>his heir, provided the tenor of his conduct
	      <lb/>was such as this excellent uncle could ap­

	      <lb/>should leave his own large fortune to better

            <p><persName>Sir Edward</persName>'s character was of a pe­
	      <lb/>culiar kind, in this our day: he was the
	      <lb/>friend of every worthy man! to such, how­
	      <lb/>ever ungifted by birth, honours or riches,
	      <lb/>in the midst of the most splendid company,
	      <lb/>were the thoughts of his heart laid open,
	      <lb/>and his conversation alone directed: it was
	      <lb/>a painful sacrifice indeed, to a noble na­
	      <lb/>ture like his, to accompany the thoughtless
	      <lb/>and unprincipled set of beings he now was
	      <lb/>found amongst; but his too accommodat­
	      <lb/>ing nephew had intangled himself with
	      <lb/>them; and as he had so united his fate to
	      <lb/>that of young <persName>Harrington</persName>, <persName>Sir Edward</persName> re­
	      <lb/>solved to watch over, and prevent, if pos­
	      <lb/>sible, the fatal contagion of example over
	      <lb/>too easy a nature.</p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Harrington</persName>, in person was manly
	      <lb/>and elegant, his manners polite and sweetly
	      <lb/>fascinating, his heart benevolent, and his
	      <lb/>well cultivated understanding naturally
	      <lb/>excellent; but his principles were wavering
	      <pb n="51"/><milestone unit="sig" n="D2r"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">51</mw><lb/>and inconstant: he loved and courted
	      <lb/>fashion in every form; but the nightly
	      <lb/>admonitions and reflections of his pillow
	      <lb/>often severely reprehended the conduct of
	      <lb/>the day. Devoted to the sex, he thought
	      <lb/>no sacrifice too great for the indulgence of
	      <lb/>all their little foibles or inclinations, how­
	      <lb/>ever glaring or capricious. Though he
	      <lb/>was by no means fond of play, yet he was
	      <lb/>ensnared by the fine person and polite
	      <lb/>manners of <persName>Lady Caroline</persName>, to lose to her
	      <lb/>immense sums, and sit for whole nights
	      <lb/>as if <emph>nailed</emph> to her card-table; captivated

	      <lb/>dressed her in a strain of ardour in which
	      <lb/>his heart had no share.</p>
            <p>Early instructed in the purest principles
	      <lb/>of virtue and religion, he once paid un­

	      <lb/>struggled through life with difficulty, and

	      <lb/>would have shuddered at the bare idea of

	      <lb/>and even <emph>affectionate</emph> friendship between

            <p>He had therefore often felt much alarm,

	      <lb/>softer sentiment, the innocent, blooming,
	      <lb/>and lovely <persName>Mary</persName>, and contrasted her with
	      <lb/>the gay, unfeeling and unprincipled wife of
	      <lb/>his bosom; and if the conquest over her
	      <lb/>mind and person was not attended with too
	      <lb/>much difficulty, it was his settled determi­
	      <lb/>nation to establish her in elegant lodgings,
	      <lb/>endow her with a comfortable settlement,
	      <lb/>and leave her—when he was weary of her!
	      <lb/>For the other girl, he used to tell his family
	      <lb/>he thought her confounded ugly, and a ro­
	      <lb/>mantic fool; but to be too particular in
	      <lb/>his attentions to one sister, while he totally
	      <lb/>neglected the other, would be to shew him­

            <p>And who would indeed think it was one

            <p>But <persName>Charles</persName> had been himself a hand­
	      <lb/>some fellow, and was so sensitive to the
	      <lb/>power of beauty in the softer sex, that this

            <p><persName>Margaret</persName> was captivated immediately;

            <p>She twisted the drapery of her long

	      <lb/>occupied by the nieces. <said>My sweet in­

	      <lb/>how much the form and face of the then
	      <lb/>promising <persName>Mary</persName> was improved, and that
	      <lb/>she was in full possession of that fascina­

	      <lb/>expression, which would decidedly give her
	      <lb/>a preference with all the males wherever
	      <lb/>she appeared.</p>
            <p><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> was sure to be admired;

	      <lb/>countenance, she had been thought ill-na­

	      <lb/>timidly lifted them again; and while she
	      <lb/>endeavoured to express, by her eyes, every
	      <lb/>thing that was sweet and lovely, she gave
	      <lb/>them a turn very much like that defect

	      <lb/>shewed the ruins of her mouth, and <persName>Lady

            <p><persName>Lady Caroline</persName> looked at her diminutive

	      <lb/>be realised amongst such a splendid circle.

	      <lb/>is chastened by the still and tranquil plea­

	      <lb/>on which she had ascended to the apart­
	      <lb/>ment of <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, and was soon made
	      <lb/>sensible of her mistake, as she took her
	      <lb/>way with <persName>Frederic</persName> to that leading to the
	      <lb/>drawing-room; on which flight of stairs,
	      <lb/>having descended a few steps, <persName>Lady Isa­
		<lb/>bella</persName> now accosted her, in a voice almost
	      <lb/>unintelligible from rage and jealousy—
	      <lb/><said>Is your sister, <persName>Miss Marsham</persName>, coming
		<lb/>up, or no?</said></p>
            <p><said>I have not yet seen her, my lady,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mary</persName>, with the most tranquil inno­

	      <lb/>she banged the door of her apartment with
	      <lb/>violence, and threw herself on an ottomane
	      <lb/>in all the agony of jealousy.</p>
            <p>Several minutes had elapsed, each of
	      <lb/>which had seemed an age to the wretched
	      <lb/><persName>Isabella</persName>, since <persName>Mary</persName> left her—she had de­

	      <lb/><persName>Harrington</persName> in his dressing-gown, the pow­
	      <lb/>der only half wiped from his face, his feet
	      <lb/>in slippers, his animated and expressive
	      <lb/>eyes fixed on the countenance of <persName>Mary</persName>, who
	      <lb/>regarded him with more than common com­
	      <lb/>placency. <said>Shall such a little rustic wretch
		<lb/>as that,</said> thought she, <said>dare to enter the lists
		<lb/>with me, and contend for the heart of the
		<lb/>charming <persName>Frederic</persName>? Never—no, never,
		<lb/>without feeling the weight of my severest
		<lb/>vengeance.</said></p>
            <p>During these reflections of the lady,
	      <lb/><persName>Harrington</persName> had nearly reached the draw­
	      <lb/>ing-room door, towards which he waved

	      <lb/>sigh, secretly thought he had left her too
	      <lb/>soon.</p>
            <p><persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, her cheeks glowing with
	      <lb/>agitation, and her heart palpitating with
	      <lb/>various emotions, reclined on her ottomane,

	      <lb/>in the company of <persName>Frederic</persName>, and looking
	      <lb/>more charmingly attractive than she had
	      <lb/>thought her capable of: but the <foreign xml:lang="fr">deshabille</foreign>
	      <lb/>of <persName>Harrington</persName> was a mystery she could not

	      <lb/>she, <said>these country girls are so full of in­

		<lb/>that no doubt this seemingly accidental

		<lb/>as a rival competitor with that obscure
		<lb/>little creature? No, never! From this

	      <lb/>she had received from her ladyship, en­

	      <lb/>silently shed, as she affected to look out of
	      <lb/>a window ever since, what she thought,
	      <lb/>the caprice of quality had deprived her
	      <lb/>of the fair <persName>Isabella</persName>'s affections, and had
	      <lb/>given her sister the preference.</p>
            <p>The negligent posture of the afflicted
	      <lb/>lady, the <rs type="properAdjective">Turkish</rs> <foreign xml:lang="fr">lit de repos</foreign> on which

	      <lb/>a <rs type="properAdjective">Turkish</rs> harem; and falling on her knees,
	      <lb/>she was about to prostrate her face to the
	      <lb/>ground, when <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, raising her
	      <lb/>up, said, <said>My sweet, dear girl, what is
		<lb/>the matter? Why these tears? Are you,

		<lb/>gentle and susceptible heart feel the pangs
		<lb/>of unrequited love?</said></p>
            <p><persName>Margaret</persName> now recollected where she was,
	      <lb/>and said, <said>Is it possible, that the beauti­
		<lb/>ful <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> can sigh for any one in
		<lb/>vain? Such, my dear lady, I trust is not

		<lb/>me with your friendship and promised con­
		<lb/>fidence: alas! I dreaded lest my sister had
		<lb/>stepped in to rival me in the place I hold
		<lb/>in your affections.</said>—<said>Never, my dear
		<lb/>girl,</said> replied <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, with violence
	      <lb/>and energy; <said>Oh! sit down, and I will
		<lb/>tell you all.</said>—But the first dinner-bell
	      <lb/>ringing, delayed the important confidence
	      <lb/>for the present; and <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> flying to
	      <lb/>her toilette, found, from the glow on her
	      <lb/>cheeks, that she must rub off all her <mcr>rouge</mcr>,
	      <lb/>if she did not wish to appear as vulgarly
	      <lb/>red as a country milk-maid. This did not
	      <lb/>well accord with the romantic ideas of
	      <lb/><persName>Margaret</persName>; all the heroines she had ever
	      <lb/>read of, were indebted to nature alone for
	      <lb/>their <mcr>miraculous beauty</mcr>; however, she
	      <lb/>knew but little of fashionable life, and
	      <lb/>thought every thing that was practised by

            <p>When the two ladies entered the draw­

	      <lb/>anxious eyes, and found <emph>one</emph> of the dinner­
	      <lb/>party was yet wanting; this was the culprit
	      <lb/><persName>Harrington</persName>: and she now, with all the

	      <lb/>she appeared not even to know that her be­

	      <lb/>she threw herself into a kind of recess,

	      <lb/>offered a vacant place: <persName>Sir Charles Sefton</persName>
	      <lb/>half rose to occupy it, but she almost
	      <lb/>killed him by a frown, and sent her en­
	      <lb/>quiring eye towards the door, where yet
	      <lb/>stood the timid <persName>Margaret</persName>; but the poor
	      <lb/>girl was totally unnoticed by her, for her
	      <lb/>eye sought <persName>Harrington</persName> only, and <persName>Margaret</persName>
	      <lb/>durst not take courage to cross the apart­

            <p><persName>Sir Charles</persName> rose immediately: <said>Lovely

	      <lb/><said>permit me to hand you to a seat;</said> and
	      <lb/>placing himself behind her chair, he poured
	      <lb/>forth such a volley of hyperbolical, ridi­
	      <lb/>culous compliments, that had not the mind
	      <lb/>of <persName>Margaritta</persName> been weak in the extreme,
	      <lb/>she must have been convinced that the
	      <lb/>noble Baronet was only diverting himself
	      <lb/>at her expence: in the mean time all the
	      <lb/>gaity of <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> seemed to return at
	      <lb/>the mischievous sport; but whenever she
	      <lb/>cast her eyes on <persName>Mary</persName>, and beheld how
	      <lb/>captivating she looked, anger and envy
	      <lb/>clouded her features; and it was severally
	      <lb/>remarked, either inwardly, or by the
	      <lb/>different <mcr>duos</mcr> round the room, to each
	      <lb/>other, how very ill <persName>Lady Isabella Emerson</persName>
	      <lb/>looked!</p>

            <p>With a grace and ease peculiar to him­

	      <lb/>tempted to take the vacant seat by the side
	      <lb/>of <persName>Mary</persName>, who was placed by <persName>Lady Wring­
		<lb/>ham</persName> on a <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">sofa pour trois;</foreign> but,

		<lb/>the aid of Omnipotence: these serious in­

		<lb/>are quite sufficient for a work which is only

		<lb/>to her?</said>—<said>Not I, indeed,</said> said the morti­
	      <lb/>fied and much-nettled <persName>Mrs. Kennedy</persName>, who
	      <lb/>had formerly received from the quizzing
	      <lb/><persName>Sir Charles</persName> a copious dose of flattery, but
	      <lb/>having thrown out hints to <persName>Margaret</persName> that
	      <lb/>he suspected her of witchcraft, he found
	      <lb/>he must flatter no one but that credulous
	      <lb/>girl for the remainder of the day, who
	      <lb/>trembled every time <persName>Mrs. Kennedy</persName> ap­
	      <lb/>proached her, for fear she should cast some
	      <lb/>spell around her.</p>
            <p><said>When you speak of the influence of

            <p><said>I am not very competent to give my

		<lb/>sham</persName>, <said>but I must say, that I think <persName>Mrs.

		<lb/>ing; and there is many a learned fool who

		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">99</mw>
		<lb/>pens his <emph>dry</emph> and <emph>obscure</emph> lines, which no
		<lb/>one has patience to read through; while the
		<lb/>merit of an author, in my opinion, must be
		<lb/>in knowing how to make use of those di­
		<lb/>vine gifts of natural judgment and fine
		<lb/>ideas of the soul, which all the logic and
		<lb/>learning of the schools can never bestow;
		<lb/>but if a woman unites to these great un­
		<lb/>acquired talents, a fine person, then she is
		<lb/>always envied by her own sex, especially
		<lb/>by the deformed and ugly.</said> And at the

	      <lb/>eyes on <persName>Mrs. Kennedy</persName>.</p>
            <p><persName>Charles</persName> had one defect in his demeanour,
	      <lb/>which was, that when provoked, he was
	      <lb/>apt to be personal: the conversation was
	      <lb/>getting rather acrid, but was sweetened by
	      <lb/>the ringing of the last dinner-bell; and
	      <lb/>each gentleman taking a lady by the hand
	      <lb/>to conduct her to the dining-parlour, the
	      <lb/>Rector seized that of <persName>Mary</persName>, drew her
	      <lb/>back, that they might be the last of the
	      <lb/>party, and pressed the hand he held, unseen,
	      <lb/>with ardour to his lips, before he quitted it,

	      <lb/>then seated her beside himself at the table:
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Wringham</persName> was disappointed, tossed
	      <lb/>her head, and audibly uttered a <said>well, in­
		<lb/>deed!—for my part——.</said> However, the
	      <lb/>excellent cheer with which the table a­
	      <lb/>bounded, soon restored the lady's good
	      <lb/>humour, and by the ample credit she did
	      <lb/>to it, she proved her appetite to be as com­
	      <lb/>plaisant at six o'clock as at three. Little
	      <lb/><persName>Sir John</persName> put on his spectacles, and never
	      <lb/>took his eyes off his plate till he had dis­
	      <lb/>patched all he was helped to.</p>
            <p><persName>Edward</persName>, doomed to the side of <persName>Mrs.
		<lb/>Kennedy</persName>, supported with her, during the
	      <lb/>intervals of eating, a pedantic conversation:
	      <lb/>the lady's discourse consisted of quotations
	      <lb/>from <persName>Johnson</persName> and other learned authors;
	      <lb/>she enlarged also, in turn, on the rapacity
	      <lb/>of booksellers, the justness of the Critical
	      <lb/>Reviewers, and the <rs type="properAdjective" rend="slant(italic)">Esopian</rs> title of author,
	      <lb/>seemed literally tacked to her <emph>back</emph>.</p>
            <p><persName>Sir Charles Sefton</persName>, seated opposite to
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, contemplated her beauty
	      <lb/>with infinite satisfaction, while he poured
	      <pb n="101"/><milestone unit="sig" n="F3r"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">101</mw><lb/>the soft nonsense into the listening ear of
	      <lb/><persName>Margaret</persName>, which he wished to address to
	      <lb/>her ladyship. <persName>Harrington</persName> <emph>looked</emph> all that
	      <lb/>could express admiration and the soft senti­
	      <lb/>ments of a rising passion, whenever he
	      <lb/>glanced towards <persName>Mary</persName>; but the deceived
	      <lb/><persName>Isabella</persName> triumphed over her, and thought
	      <lb/>that by his unremitting attentions and fine
	      <lb/>speeches to herself, that <emph>she</emph> was the sole
	      <lb/>mistress of his affections.</p>
            <p>The Rector took but little <emph>public</emph> notice
	      <lb/>of <persName>Mary</persName>, but now and then <emph>stole</emph> an amor­
	      <lb/>ous whisper, while he gently pressed his
	      <lb/>knee against her's: her bashful embarrass­
	      <lb/>ment heightened her attractions; and <persName>Har­
		<lb/>rington</persName> made a sad digression from the
	      <lb/>rules of attentive politeness, by not hearing
	      <lb/>the dashing <persName>Lady Caroline</persName> challenge him
	      <lb/>to take a glass of <name>Madeira</name> with her; for,
	      <lb/>totally deaf to her ladyship, he bent for­
	      <lb/>ward and requested <persName>Miss Marsham</persName> to ho­
	      <lb/>nour him by taking one with him.</p>
            <p>Seated on each side of <persName>Lady Caroline</persName> were
	      <lb/><persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName> and honest <persName>Ralph</persName>,

	      <lb/>while <persName>Charles</persName> was again in the comfortless
	      <lb/>situation of being placed by the illiterate
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Wringham</persName>: however, his fair part­
	      <lb/>ner on the other side of him, <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>,
	      <lb/>made him some amends by her polite at­
	      <lb/>tentions, her sprightly <foreign xml:lang="fr">jeu d'esprits</foreign>, and
	      <lb/>all the fascination of highly-polished man­
	      <lb/>ners; nor could <persName>Charles</persName> resist the tempta­
	      <lb/>tion of her arch wit, but joined with her
	      <lb/>in silently <mcr>quizzing</mcr> the <foreign xml:lang="fr">ci-devant</foreign> laundress.</p>
            <p>The ladies retired soon after dinner to
	      <lb/>receive the numerous guests who had come
	      <lb/>from the village of <placeName>Eglantine</placeName> and its vari­
	      <lb/>ous environs, for about the compass of ten
	      <lb/>miles, and bade fair to make up a tolerable

	      <lb/>mised very shortly to join the female party
	      <lb/>at their coffee.</p>
            <p><persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName> drew his seat
	      <lb/>near the worthy Curate, and placing <persName>Ralph</persName>

	      <lb/>who thought of no other <persName>Miss Marsham</persName>
	      <lb/>than <persName>Mary</persName>, devoutly kissed the glass as he
	      <lb/>raised it to his lip. <said>I'll be shot,</said> says
	      <lb/>the Rector, who was now well flushed
	      <lb/>with wine, <said>if I do not fill an additional
		<lb/>bumper to the health of the eldest <persName>Miss
		  <lb/>Marsham</persName> in particular;</said> and rising, he
	      <lb/>cried aloud,—<said>To <persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Mary</persName>! huzza!—to
		<lb/><persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Mary</persName>! with three cheers!</said> <said>Pardon
		<lb/>me, sir,</said> said <persName>Frederic Harrington</persName>, gravely,
	      <lb/><said>the name of <persName>Miss Marsham</persName>, though it
		<lb/>may excite homage, yet should never be
		<lb/>toasted with such bacchanalian applause.</said>
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Leslie</persName>, who had that morning bor­
	      <lb/>rowed a good round sum of the good-na­
	      <lb/>tured <persName>Frederic</persName>, sat down again, saying,

            <p><persName>Edward</persName> forced a smile, and bowing,

		<lb/>rington</persName>, gave a turn to a conversation
	      <lb/>which was becoming painful to him, by
	      <lb/>introducing his favourite subject of poli­
	      <lb/>tics.</p>
            <p>In <persName>Sir Edward</persName> he found the stanch pa­
	      <lb/>triot, blended with the ardent and zealous
	      <lb/>servant of the throne; keenly alive both to
	      <lb/>the interests of his country and his sove­
	      <lb/>reign; the strenuous supporter of darling
	      <lb/>liberty, <placeName>Britain</placeName>'s peculiar privilege, but
	      <lb/>one of faction's bitterest and most impla­
	      <lb/>cable foes: the tear of philanthropy glis­
	      <lb/>tened in the worthy Baronet's eye, as he
	      <lb/>proposed for a toast—that virtuous senator
	      <lb/>who had so nobly stepped forward in par­
	      <lb/>liament for the relief of insolvent debtors;
	      <lb/>had unbarred, through his generous exer­
	      <lb/>tions, the doors of their prisons, and re­
	      <lb/>stored the long confined husband to the
	      <lb/>arms of an affectionate wife, and many a
	      <lb/>father to his afflicted children!</p>
            <p><persName>Charles</persName> was engaged with the Rector in
	      <lb/>listening to the most flattering promises of
	      <lb/>military promotion; the disposition of

	      <lb/><persName>Charles</persName> was sanguine, and he believed all
	      <lb/>his noble patron uttered. <persName>Sir Charles Sef­
		<lb/>ton</persName> and <persName>Ralph</persName> were two to one against <persName>Sir
		<lb/>John Wringham</persName>, in favour of the former
	      <lb/>being a man of more consequence, and a
	      <lb/>more useful member of society than the
	      <lb/>lawyer; whilst the little man contended,
	      <lb/>that without the protection of the law the
	      <lb/>farms would soon be destroyed, however
	      <lb/>wealthy, and the rich property seized on
	      <lb/>by whoever should choose to lay hands on
	      <lb/>them, and that, without law, might would
	      <lb/>be sure to overcome right.</p>
            <p><persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName> paid no atten­
	      <lb/>tion to their arguments, but frequently
	      <lb/>eyed the <persName>Honourable and Reverend Theo­
		<lb/>dore Leslie</persName> with contempt, and listened to
	      <lb/>what he was convinced were the most egre­
	      <lb/>gious falsehoods; for the situations which
	      <lb/>he promised to ensure to <persName>Charles</persName>, <persName>Sir Ed­
		<lb/>ward</persName> knew had been long given away, and
	      <lb/>that this the Rector knew also as well as
	      <lb/>himself. On the proposed toast, however,
	      <lb/>being repeated, <persName>Mr. Leslie</persName> said, <said>Oh!

		<lb/>aye, I was so engaged with my worthy ve­
		<lb/>teran here, that I did not attend to you, <persName>Sir

		<lb/>tuous Baronet; and come, now for my
		<lb/>toast,—<persName>Colonel Wardle</persName>!</said> A general si­
	      <lb/>lence prevailed, and an unanimous resolu­
	      <lb/>tion seemed to be formed not to do honour
	      <lb/>to the toast, which was first boldly de­
	      <lb/>clared by <persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName>; <persName>Sir
		<lb/>Charles Sefton</persName>, however, and little <persName>Sir
		<lb/>John Wringham</persName>, drank it; the latter,
	      <lb/>like a cunning lawyer, saying, that what­

	      <lb/>another, he ought never to object to such
	      <lb/>toasts as the master of the house pleased to

		<lb/>and also to the <mcr>public defender</mcr> of a woman
		<lb/>of a <emph>certain</emph> description, which defenders
		<lb/>are vulgarly called <term>bullies:</term> no, gentlemen,

		<lb/>tempt:</said> and seeing his nephew raise his
	      <lb/>glass to his lips, he added, <said>If <persName>Frederic</persName>
		<lb/>drinks that toast, I cast him off for ever!</said></p>
            <p><said>Pardon me, sir,</said> said <persName>Frederic</persName>, <said>not
		<lb/>even you should make me retract a senti­
		<lb/>ment which my inward conscience approves
		<lb/>and assures me is right; and I solemnly
		<lb/>declare, that not even you should <emph>compel</emph>
		<lb/>me to drink it; and I pressed the sparkling

            <p><said>I was in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>,</said> said <persName>Sir Edward</persName>,

            <p><persName>Sir Edward</persName> seeing the reverend pillar of
	      <lb/>the church not very steady, proposed that
	      <lb/>they should all repair to the drawing-room
	      <lb/>and join the ladies; but in this he was ab­
	      <lb/>solutely over-ruled by the Rector, who in­
	      <lb/>sisted on their taking one more bottle, and
	      <lb/>then they would all adjourn together.</p>
            <p>There have been instances of a man
	      <lb/>drinking himself sober; and one of the
	      <lb/>kind appeared now exemplified in <persName>Mr.

	      <lb/>up stairs, and partook of the coffee handed
	      <lb/>round to the ladies with all the elegant
	      <lb/>ease of a man of fashion; and though his

	      <lb/>ladies, though very gay, were by no means

            <p>A turn in the gardens was carelessly pro­

	      <lb/>arrayed in the dress of the ancient <name>Druids</name>!
	      <lb/><persName>Mary</persName> was enchanted with a scene so novel
	      <lb/>and tasteful, and <persName>Margaret</persName> now saw rea­

	      <lb/>to our two country girls, except by <persName>Mar­

            <p>Soft music was heard at a distance: <persName>Mary</persName>,
	      <lb/>no critical <emph>amateur</emph>, but an untaught en­
	      <lb/>thusiast, was all ear; lost in the sweet
	      <lb/>reverie which the melodious strains inspired,
	      <lb/>she suffered herself to be taken by the hand
	      <lb/>and led towards the place whence the
	      <lb/>sounds proceeded; she soon became sen­
	      <lb/>sible of her situation, and dreaded to turn
	      <lb/>her head, convinced in her own mind she
	      <lb/>should behold the libertine Rector, when
	      <lb/>a voice addressed her, full of magic sweet­
	      <lb/>ness, saying, <said>Again am I made happy,

            <p><said>Indeed, sir,</said> replied <persName>Mary</persName>, <said>my

	      <lb/>curtsey; when <persName>Frederic</persName>, hastily, though
	      <lb/>respectfully, taking hold of her robe, said,
	      <lb/><said>Oh! <persName>Miss Marsham</persName>, leave me not thus;
		<lb/>I sought you out to explain a conduct to
		<lb/>you, which I am obliged this night to pre­
		<lb/>serve, and which gives real anguish to my
		<lb/>feelings: I am forbidden to—to pay any

	      <lb/>interrupted the half-offended <persName>Mary</persName>, <said>could

		<lb/>be of any consequence to me? The little
		<lb/>instruction I have had in dancing, will
		<lb/>make me rather desirous of declining it
		<lb/>among so polished and scientific a circle;
		<lb/>and whoever, sir, chooses to restrict <emph>you</emph>,
		<lb/>has, no doubt, justifiable motives; nor can
		<lb/>your neglect of me require any apology, as
		<lb/>it is a matter of indifference to me.</said> At
	      <lb/>this last sentence, uttered with an aching
	      <lb/>heart, she hastily quitted him, and turned
	      <lb/>down a shadowy walk, which was only

	      <lb/>partially lighted, to hide her vexation. <said>It
		<lb/>is,</said> thought she, <said>the proud <persName>Sir Edward</persName>,
		<lb/>his uncle, who has put these restrictions upon
		<lb/>him; yet how deceitful are appearances!
		<lb/>with how much benevolence, with how

		<lb/>much paternal kindness did he look upon
		<lb/>me! His smiles bespoke approbation,
		<lb/>gentleness, and every thing that was bene­
		<lb/>ficent and amiable, each time he chanced to
		<lb/>meet my eyes: oh! world of fashion and
		<lb/>deceit, how much I have seen of you, in
		<lb/>only the space of a few hours!</said></p>
            <p>She now heard a mingled tumult of
	      <lb/>voices, and beheld through the trees the
	      <lb/>well-dressed crowd moving in various
	      <lb/>directions; the rockets and fiery serpents
	      <lb/>whizzed in the air; and as she stopped to
	      <lb/>gaze at the breaking splendour of the for­
	      <lb/>mer, she felt herself suddenly clasped round
	      <lb/>the waist, and embraced with energy and
	      <lb/>rudeness, by the <persName>Honourable and Reverend

            <p>With a strength almost supernatural,

	      <lb/>engaged herself from his hold, ran like a
	      <lb/>frightened fawn along the walk, till she
	      <lb/>reached a roomy alcove at the farthest end;
	      <lb/>unknowing where she went, she was hastily
	      <lb/>about to enter it, when the soft sighs of a
	      <lb/>female met her ear, mingled with the fol­
	      <lb/>lowing words: <said>Oh! <persName>Harrington</persName>, you
		<lb/>are too dangerous; oh! let us leave this
		<lb/>alluring spot; come with me, I intreat you,
		<lb/>this instant, to see the fire-works; what
		<lb/>will be thought of our absence?</said>—<said>Cruel

            <p>Shocked, abashed at what she heard,
	      <lb/>poor <persName>Mary</persName> knew not how to act; but the
	      <lb/>pursuing footsteps of the Rector made her
	      <lb/>resolve to enter the harbour; and oh!

            <p><persName>Mary</persName> was not one of the fainting kind,
	      <lb/>but her severe agitation, the conviction of
	      <lb/><persName>Harrington</persName>'s being a libertine, the person
	      <lb/>who laid her arbitrary restraints upon him,
	      <lb/>now before her, caused an ashy paleness to
	      <lb/>overspread her countenance: shocked at
	      <lb/>her death-like appearance, <persName>Harrington</persName>, in
	      <lb/>spite of <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, flew to her aid;
	      <lb/>at the same time franticly exclaiming, <said>For
		<lb/>God's sake, <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, if you have
		<lb/>your <foreign xml:lang="fr">vinaigrette</foreign> in your pocket, give it
		<lb/>me to relieve this charming girl; do you

            <p><said>Do you think, sir,</said> said <persName>Lady Isa­

		<lb/>which I dare say will be of more service to
		<lb/>a country girl than <emph>aromatic vinegar!</emph></said></p>
            <p><persName>Frederic</persName> pressed the trembling <persName>Mary</persName> to

	      <lb/>insisted on his leaving her immediately, as
	      <lb/>she felt quite recovered: he fell on his
	      <lb/>knees before her, pressed her hand to his
	      <lb/>lips, and exclaimed, <said>Oh! how can I
		<lb/>ever regain the good opinion of <persName>Miss Mar­
		  <lb/>sham</persName>?</said>—<said><emph>My</emph> opinion, sir,</said> said <persName>Mary</persName>,
	      <lb/>with dignity, <said>is of very little conse­
		<lb/>quence to any one; and as to your <emph>regain­
		  <lb/>ing</emph> mine, I surely, sir, have not known
		<lb/>you long enough to form <emph>any</emph> of you; but
		<lb/>if you would wish me to think you <emph>oblig­
		  <lb/>ing</emph>, I desire you will quit me <emph>instantly</emph>, or
		<lb/>suffer me to depart: the termination of this
		<lb/>walk, I see, leads to another which is
		<lb/>crowded with company, and them I shall
		<lb/>join, as I see my father and uncles are
		<lb/>among them.</said></p>
            <p>The confused <persName>Harrington</persName>, not a little
	      <lb/>mortified, suffered her to depart, and men­
	      <lb/>tally cursed his stars, that had suffered
	      <lb/>his licentiousness to reach the ear of purity,
	      <lb/>and had implanted, perhaps, aversion in
	      <lb/>the breast of that woman (who though

	      <lb/>he was most ambitious should think of him
	      <lb/>favourably.</p>
            <p>It has been before remarked, that the
	      <lb/>bewitching <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> had made a
	      <lb/>temporary kind of conquest over the <emph>senses</emph>,
	      <lb/>and had shaken the <emph>principles</emph> of <persName>Frederic
		<lb/>Harrington</persName>; over his <emph>heart</emph> and <emph>mind</emph> she
	      <lb/>had no claim. Elevated with champaign,
	      <lb/>and tied for the whole day and evening at

	      <lb/>the opportunities she <emph>carelessly</emph> and almost

	      <lb/>which the pure and spotless <persName>Mary</persName> had,
	      <lb/>undesignedly witnessed. The free-thinking
	      <lb/><persName>Isabella</persName>, however, by no means felt obliged
	      <lb/>at thus being rescued from the destruction
	      <lb/>of one mad moment; yet though her prin­
	      <lb/>ciples were dissolute, she had refinement in
	      <lb/>her love, and must possess the heart as
	      <lb/>well as the person of her lover: her good
	      <lb/>sense soon shewed her, as conviction flashed
	      <lb/>on her mind, that the inclination of <persName>Har­
		<lb/>rington</persName> towards her, was little more than
	      <lb/>sensual; the haste in which he quitted her

	      <lb/>tice.</p>
            <p>The fireworks over, the party were sum­

	      <lb/>habited as <persName>Terpsichore</persName>, she tripped with

	      <lb/>guests, and they entered a spacious saloon,

            <p><persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, entirely mistress of her­

	      <lb/>attachments, how deep were the impressions
	      <lb/>made by virtue and goodness, though

	      <lb/>mily, by a marriage with <persName>Sir Charles
		<lb/>Sefton</persName>, had been much shunned by all

	      <lb/>with <persName>Mary</persName>, raising his expectations to the
	      <lb/>height of happiness, and then destroying

            <p>Bewitched by her syren arts, <persName>Harring­

	      <lb/>saying aloud, <said>Will <persName>Miss Marsham</persName> allow
		<lb/>me the honour of waiting on her at sup­

            <p><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> accepted all the pointed
	      <lb/>attentions of <persName>Major Raymond</persName>, and did not
	      <lb/>so much as once turn her eyes towards the
	      <lb/>mortified <persName>Frederic</persName>: but <persName>Lady Caroline</persName> said
	      <lb/>to him, <said><persName>Harrington</persName>, sit by me; here, I

	      <lb/><said>The <emph>commands</emph> of your ladyship are to
		<lb/>me <emph>laws</emph>, which I am happy to obey,</said>
	      <lb/>said <persName>Harrington</persName>, with forced politeness;
	      <lb/>and attending her after the supper was

	      <lb/>of the company to re-commence their
	      <lb/>dancing.</p>
            <p><persName>Mary</persName> danced no more, but was gratified
	      <lb/>by the pleasing attention of <persName>Sir Edward
		<lb/>Harrington</persName>, with whom she supported a
	      <lb/>sensible and interesting conversation; and
	      <lb/>the Baronet felt for <persName>Mary</persName> all the tender
	      <lb/>warmth of paternal friendship.</p>
            <p>Just after the clock had struck four, a
	      <lb/>violent bustle was heard in the card-room:
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Caroline</persName> was in violent hysterics;
	      <lb/><persName>Harrington</persName>, pale, and in evident distress of
	      <lb/>mind, supported her in his arms: some of
	      <lb/>the party appeared to sneer, and one lady
	      <lb/>seemed, in a determined manner, to insist on
	      <lb/>payment.</p>
            <p>With this lady, a female gambler of
	      <lb/>quality, who had come down to her
	      <lb/>country seat, a few miles off, and had this
	      <lb/>evening accepted the invitation of the <name>Les­
		<lb/>lies</name>, <persName>Harrington</persName> had imprudently entered
	      <lb/>into a gallant kind of partnership at the
	      <lb/><foreign xml:lang="fr">vingt-un</foreign> table, and <persName>Lady Caroline</persName>, in the

	      <lb/>true spirit of play, had delighted in laying
	      <lb/>enormous bets of beating two against one:
	      <lb/>at length she had gambled away infinitely
	      <lb/>more than she was able to pay; <persName>Harring­
		<lb/>ton</persName> would willingly have excused her
	      <lb/>all, but the partnership he had entered
	      <lb/>into, besides the little money he had left,
	      <lb/>from the preposterous loan he had made
	      <lb/>in the morning, rendered it impracti­
	      <lb/>cable.</p>
            <p>The <persName>Reverend Mr. Leslie</persName>, however,
	      <lb/>with the aid of the indignant <persName>Sir Edward
		<lb/>Harrington</persName>, restored a momentary comfort
	      <lb/>to the mind of her ladyship; but the look
	      <lb/><persName>Sir Edward</persName> gave his nephew, seemed to
	      <lb/>pierce him to the heart, while that of
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Leslie</persName>, to his wife, was no less re­
	      <lb/>plete with wrath; but for that she cared
	      <lb/>but little.</p>
            <p>The festivity of the scene being now
	      <lb/>much clouded, and the morning sun hav­
	      <lb/>ing shot its bright rays on both natural
	      <lb/>and artificial beauty, <persName>Lady Caroline</persName> re­

	      <lb/>tired, and each party seemed desirous of
	      <lb/>departing.</p>
            <p><persName>Harrington</persName> was missing at the same time
	      <lb/>as her ladyship; and <persName>Mary</persName>, who was
	      <lb/>doomed to be a spectator of all that could
	      <lb/>agonize her feelings, beheld, as she passed
	      <lb/>through a suite of rooms to fetch her
	      <lb/>shawl from the apartment in which she
	      <lb/>had left it, from a door which stood
	      <lb/>half open, <persName>Harrington</persName> on his knees before
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Caroline Leslie</persName>!</p>
            <p>He was pressing her extended hand to
	      <lb/>his bosom, and these words distinctly met
	      <lb/>her ear, as <persName>Lady Caroline</persName> bent towards
	      <lb/>him, <said>Oh! too persuasive <persName>Harrington</persName>,
		<lb/>you have conquered!</said></p>
            <p><persName>Mary</persName> had heard enough, not only to
	      <lb/>be convinced of the licentiousness, but
	      <lb/>the baseness of <persName>Frederic</persName>'s principles; she
	      <lb/>saw but too plain, that he was now un­
	      <lb/>generous enough to take advantage of the
	      <lb/>pecuniary distresses of the wife and the

            <p>And now it was <persName>Mary</persName>'s turn to be most
	      <lb/>wakeful; in vain she darkened the room,
	      <lb/>in vain she drew the curtains as close as

	      <lb/>her, soon sunk into a profound repose,
	      <lb/>from which she did not awake till two in

		<lb/>never give her any thing, for kindness to

		<lb/>But you still continue her patroness, and

            <p>Situated at about forty miles distance
	      <lb/>from <placeName>London</placeName>, in the country of <placeName>Essex</placeName>, stood
	      <lb/><name>Eglantine farm-house</name>, the property of <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Ralph Marsham</persName>: the mansion was a very
	      <lb/>ancient edifice, was lofty, spacious, and
	      <lb/>consisted of a great variety of apartments;
	      <lb/>some of the large ones on the upper story
	      <lb/>had been chiefly appropriated to store­
	      <lb/>rooms for oats, straw, and the winter fruits
	      <lb/>of walnuts, apples, pears, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the summer, when the stores were ex­
	      <lb/>hausted, the keys were generally left in the
	      <lb/>doors of these rooms till they were again
	      <lb/>replenished.</p>
            <p>What the farm-house had been formerly,
	      <lb/>was a matter of doubt; some thought it
	      <lb/>had been one of the palaces belonging to
	      <lb/>one or other of those kings who reigned
	      <lb/>after the conquest; while others, with
	      <lb/>more probability, believed it to have been,
	      <lb/>for many generations, a large inn: it came
	      <lb/>into the family of the <name>Marshams</name> by being
	      <lb/>purchased by the grandfather of the present
	      <lb/>three brothers.</p>

            <p>In several rooms there were, however,
	      <lb/>strong <mcr>marks</mcr> of <mcr>antiquity;</mcr> and in many
	      <lb/>places it was <emph>proved</emph>; in spite of the
	      <lb/>strength of the building, by their frequent
	      <lb/>want of repairs. In two or three of the
	      <lb/>apartments, were rudely-carved and clumsy
	      <lb/>figures of shields, in a kind of <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="it">basso-relievo</foreign>
	      <lb/>on the painted wainscoat; and over several
	      <lb/>of the chimney-pieces were arched niches,
	      <lb/>in which were crosses, old <rs type="properAdjective">Romish</rs> bishops
	      <lb/>with their crosiers;—friars, some headless,
	      <lb/>some armless, with mutilated rosaries.</p>
            <p><persName>Margaret</persName> was sure her uncle's dwelling
	      <lb/>had been a formidable castle, and that it
	      <lb/>was also haunted; for, one night, some
	      <lb/>friends having arrived from <placeName>London</placeName>, she
	      <lb/>was obliged to give up the chamber in
	      <lb/>which her sister and herself reposed, and
	      <lb/>sleep in one directly under one of the store­
	      <lb/>rooms; from whence she heard noises re­
	      <lb/>sembling the galloping of horses without
	      <lb/>shoes, accompanied with dreadful moan­
	      <lb/>ings; which proceeded from no other cause
	      <lb/>than what is very common in such old
	      <pb n="140"/>

	      <lb/>houses, which was an army of rats, who
	      <lb/>had encamped there, and were scampering
	      <lb/>over her head, and essaying to escape from
	      <lb/>a terrier which <persName>Mr. Marsham</persName> kept for the
	      <lb/>sole purpose of destroying such hostile
	      <lb/>enemies to his grain and fruit: while the
	      <lb/>moans she heard were from a cat, who hav­
	      <lb/>ing found her way thither, was swearing at
	      <lb/>the terrier, to prevent his approaching her.</p>
            <p>But <persName>Margaret</persName> was fully convinced that
	      <lb/>the noises she heard proceeded from the
	      <lb/>perturbed spirit of some one on whom some
	      <lb/>fatal deed had been perpetrated; perhaps
	      <lb/>the spirit of some of her noble and warlike
	      <lb/>ancestors stalked about to <quote>render night
		<lb/>hideous:</quote> and as she always read of her
	      <lb/>favourite heroines despising fear, and in­
	      <lb/>vestigating minutely all that bore the ap­
	      <lb/>pearance of mystery, she resolved, some
	      <lb/>day, when her father and uncles would not
	      <lb/>be likely to interrupt her, she would begin
	      <lb/>her search, and address the immaterial and

	      <lb/>able to find, in some hitherto concealed re­

	      <lb/>of her guilty nurse, and all the direful
	      <lb/>scene of her iniquity would be proclaimed
	      <lb/>to the astonished inhabitants of the farm­
	      <lb/>house.</p>
            <p>As the brothers had some miles to go,
	      <lb/>they departed early; and <persName>Mary</persName> and <persName>Mar­

	      <lb/>had not sat long together before they re­

	      <lb/>to pass the day with them, as <name>Messrs. Mar­

	      <lb/>refused to accept; but at the same time,

	      <lb/>who knew that <persName>Margaret</persName>'s chief delight
	      <lb/>was to sit alone for hours, poring over a
	      <lb/>romance, feared this was now the cause of

	      <lb/>treated her to go with her, with all the

	      <lb/>she could not possibly think of going with­

            <p><persName>Margaret</persName>, however, told her, if possible,
	      <lb/>she would follow time enough for dinner;
	      <lb/>but desired her sister to tell their friends
	      <lb/>not to wait a moment, for she would be
	      <lb/>sure to be there very early in the afternoon;
	      <lb/>and <persName>Mary</persName> finding all she could say useless
	      <lb/>to her obstinate sister, hastened to the
	      <lb/>dwelling of her friend, <persName>Miss Ringwood</persName>.</p>
            <p><persName>Lucy Ringwood</persName> and <persName>Mary Marsham</persName>
	      <lb/>might justly be styled congenial souls: in
	      <lb/>person, <persName>Lucy</persName> was more pleasing than pretty,
	      <lb/>yet there was something about her so ir­
	      <lb/>resistible, that she was perpetually making
	      <lb/>conquests; though, with all her mind's
	      <lb/>perfections, there was such an <foreign xml:lang="fr">etourderie</foreign>
	      <lb/>about her, that she never long retained the
	      <lb/>hearts of her numerous captives.</p>
            <p>She had been left an orphan early, and
	      <lb/>was now the darling <foreign xml:lang="fr">protegée</foreign> of a rich
	      <lb/>maiden aunt, her mother's only sister; who,

	      <lb/>often, not to say, sometimes <emph>unjustly</emph>, im­
	      <lb/>puted to that proscribed class of ladies.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Susanna Bradbury</persName> laughed with all
	      <lb/>the hearty glee of seventeen, and enjoyed a
	      <lb/>free jest, and a neat pointed philippic,
	      <lb/>against prudery, with a pleased vivacity,
	      <lb/>devoid of all envy, and replete with admi­
	      <lb/>ration of the witty person's talents who
	      <lb/>might have composed it. Her conversa­
	      <lb/>tion was free and unrestrained, full of
	      <lb/>good sense and cheerfulness, and she loved
	      <lb/>and admired the young and handsome.
	      <lb/>Yet in her figure, the quizzing buck has
	      <lb/>set her down, the moment he beheld her, as
	      <lb/>a fair object for sport; but <persName>Mrs. Susan</persName> has
	      <lb/>soon made him repent the onset, by the
	      <lb/>keenness and brilliancy of her repartees,
	      <lb/>which, though free from all illnatured
	      <lb/>severity, have been so full of point, that
	      <lb/>he has wished he had let her alone.</p>
            <p>Her company and conversation were ever
	      <lb/>considered a treat by the young, the lively,
	      <lb/>and sensible: she had a fine and retentive
	      <lb/>memory, a well cultivated understanding,

	      <lb/>a fund of anecdote and ready wit, and with
	      <lb/>those select friends, where she knew she
	      <lb/>was safe, she shewed herself a most excel­
	      <lb/>lent mimic.</p>
            <p>Her form was tall and spare; her face
	      <lb/>had been very pretty, and still bore the
	      <lb/>visible remains of its powers of pleasing;
	      <lb/>her grey locks, which she took no pains to
	      <lb/>conceal or disguise, peeped from beneath
	      <lb/>her fine black laced hood; her long taper
	      <lb/>waist, pointed before with a diamond stay­
	      <lb/>hook, her stiff rich silk gown and quilted
	      <lb/>satin petticoat, under a clear-starched
	      <lb/>apron, and her paste shoe-buckles, in her
	      <lb/>satin shoes, truly characterised an old maid
	      <lb/>in the very beginning of the last century.</p>
            <p>She loved <persName>Mary</persName> with the same affection
	      <lb/>she did her <persName>Lucy</persName>, and a more happy or
	      <lb/>more merry trio never sat down to dinner,
	      <lb/>than they, on this eventful day.</p>
            <p>Yes, the day was <emph>eventful</emph> to the heroine,
	      <lb/><persName>Margaret</persName>: in order that nothing should
	      <lb/>hinder her in the execution of the impor­
	      <lb/>tant task she had set herself, she dressed

	      <lb/>herself in readiness to go out in the even­
	      <lb/>ing, before she began her investigations.</p>
            <p>She knew <persName>Mrs. Susanna Bradbury</persName> loved
	      <lb/>neatness; she therefore arrayed herself in
	      <lb/>clean and fine white muslin: she had very
	      <lb/>indifferent hair, of a dull and dirtyish light
	      <lb/>brown colour. Having been too sleepy to
	      <lb/>curl it the night before, it hung about in
	      <lb/>a stringy kind of disorder over her face,
	      <lb/>and she injudiciously put over it, in that
	      <lb/>state, a wreath of white roses. Thus
	      <lb/>equipped, with a deep sigh, she began to
	      <lb/>ascend the old worm-eaten staircase, which
	      <lb/>led to the upper store-rooms. Whoever
	      <lb/>has seen the stairs at the <name>Castle Inn</name>, at
	      <lb/><placeName>Kingston</placeName>, may form an idea of the nu­
	      <lb/>merous, short-ascending and broken steps
	      <lb/>which <persName>Margaret</persName> now went up; and large
	      <lb/>balls of wood, similar to what we see at
	      <lb/>the above-mentioned inn, were likewise
	      <lb/>placed as ornaments on the balustrades of
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Marsham</persName>'s staircase; these she re­

	      <lb/>of her warlike ancestors; and she then,
	      <lb/>with a reflection on the years and ages that
	      <lb/>had passed since those brave heroes had
	      <lb/>mingled with their native-dust, proceeded

            <p>She entered the apple-chamber, where a

		<lb/>if un were to attempt to go down it.</said> <persName>Mar­
		<lb/>garet</persName> waved her hand, impatient for his
	      <lb/>departure, being fully resolved, after such
	      <lb/>a prohibition, at all events to descend the
	      <lb/>ruined flight of stairs.</p>
            <p>She stepped down several without dan­

	      <lb/>with a rusty iron bolt, half dropping from
	      <lb/>the staple: breathless with the ideas of ad­
	      <lb/>venture and romantic peril, heated with
	      <lb/>the phantoms of her imagination, she
	      <lb/>sprang forward and tore her hand with the
	      <lb/>shattered remains of the bolt.</p>
            <p>The door, which hung but by one hinge,
	      <lb/>she could only open by so small a degree,
	      <lb/>that she found she could not obtain an en­

	      <lb/>damp of the walls, made her resolve, even
	      <lb/>if it should be with the hazard of her life,
	      <lb/>to gain admittance: in her efforts to squeeze
	      <lb/>herself through, she rent her new and best

	      <lb/>bottom, and dreadfully scratched her arms
	      <lb/>and face against the broken and rusty iron

	      <lb/>ful idea, that it would soon precipitate her
	      <lb/>into some hideous cavern: she heard the

            <p>How shocked was the poor girl when

	      <lb/>The bruises under her eyes portended a

            <p>The respectable <persName>Mr. Rouveau</persName> was emi­

	      <lb/>infidelity, and be the victim to her false
	      <lb/>and dangerous opinions. While she knew,
	      <lb/>also, that <persName>Lady Caroline</persName>, with all her pre­
	      <lb/>tended correctness, clasped to her bosom
	      <lb/>the divorced wife, and the well-known

            <p>A suspicion shot across the mind of <persName>Sir

            <p>Where not even the severest censor could

	      <lb/>solemnly vowed when he was again at
	      <lb/>liberty, never to enter the state again: and,
	      <lb/>even had he been so inclined, he had too
	      <lb/>much real wisdom and prudence than to

            <p><said>Sir,</said> said <persName>Edward</persName> gravely, <said>my

	      <lb/>over <persName>Margaret</persName>'s chair, <said>is only, by such
		<lb/>pointed ridicule, affronting <emph>her</emph> under­
		<lb/>standing, and rendering <emph>himself</emph> despica­
		<lb/>ble!</said></p>
            <p><persName>Sir Charles</persName> bit his lips, and felt too
	      <lb/>much mortified to dare look up to <persName>Mar­
		<lb/>garet</persName>; who was casting up her eyes, and
	      <lb/>giving him every meaning glance which
	      <lb/>might serve to express the hard rigidity of
	      <lb/>her father: while the Rector sighed, and
	      <lb/>still hung down his head. <persName>Sir Charles</persName> en­
	      <lb/>deavoured to stammer out something of

	      <lb/><mcr>peculiar fascinations</mcr>, and that beauty was
	      <lb/>all <mcr>in idea</mcr>, that which pleased <emph>one</emph> taste,
	      <lb/>might not <emph>another</emph>, with all the <foreign xml:lang="la">et-ceteras</foreign>
	      <lb/>of common-place stuff adopted on similar
	      <lb/>occasions.</p>
            <p>The Rector relieved him, by saying, as
	      <lb/>he addressed himself particularly to <persName>Ralph</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>Come, I assure you, my good sir, it is
		<lb/>rather an interested motive, which makes
		<lb/>me request the favour of your company:
		<lb/>I have a pond, well stocked with carp and
		<lb/>tench, but I think it wants dragging, will
		<lb/>you lend me two of your men on <name>Wednes­
		  <lb/>day</name>, and let them come early; we'll have
		<lb/>a carp feast, and be as snug and merry as
		<lb/>possible.</said> He then with all the ease of a
	      <lb/>man who knows how to be at home every
	      <lb/>where, walked to the sideboard and helped
	      <lb/>himself to a glass of ale.</p>
            <p>It gave our farm-house inhabitants,
	      <lb/>together with the worthy Curate, much
	      <lb/>consequence in the country, to be so par­
	      <lb/>ticularly noticed by the Rector and his noble
	      <lb/>family; and they all consented to go, if

	      <lb/><persName>Margaret</persName> was well enough. The Rector,
	      <lb/>who was the last to quit the parlour, pur­
	      <lb/>posely dropped his glove: <mcr>matter of fact</mcr>
	      <lb/><persName>Ralph</persName>, who thought it not possible for a
	      <lb/>clergyman, a man married too, and to a
	      <lb/>fine young woman, to make love to <emph>his</emph>
	      <lb/>niece, said, <said><persName>Mary</persName>, my dear, give <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Leslie</persName> his glove.</said> <persName>Mary</persName> picked it up, and
	      <lb/>said, <said>Sir, you have dropped your glove.</said>
	      <lb/>He affected not to hear, and <persName>Mary</persName> had to
	      <lb/>follow him into the hall; where he said,
	      <lb/>as he took the glove from her, <said>Oh!
		<lb/><persName>Miss Marsham</persName>, forgive my rudeness last
		<lb/><name>Thursday</name> night! Forgive the effects of
		<lb/>inebriety, and honour me by only reading
		<lb/>that paper,</said> and hastily putting a small
	      <lb/>note into her hand, he darted out of the
	      <lb/>house.</p>
            <p><persName>Mary</persName> may be accused of imprudence,
	      <lb/>because she before kept to herself the Rec­
	      <lb/>tor's libertine behaviour, and also that she
	      <lb/>instantly consigned to her pocket the afore­
	      <lb/>said note, and sat down again to table,
	      <lb/>though not without confusion, yet with all

	      <lb/>the composure she could assume. But
	      <lb/><persName>Mary</persName> by such conduct shewed <emph>exemplary</emph>
	      <lb/>prudence: she knew the Rector had it in
	      <lb/>his power, should her father offend him,
	      <lb/>not only to deprive him of his countenance,
	      <lb/>but of his present situation as curate of
	      <lb/><placeName>Eglantine</placeName>; and she knew her parent would
	      <lb/>not tamely see his daughter insulted, with­
	      <lb/>out offending the insultor; and also, that
	      <lb/>her uncle <persName>Charles</persName>, warm in his temper to
	      <lb/>a degree of rashness, would annihilate the
	      <lb/>being who should dare to take an impro­
	      <lb/>per liberty with <emph>either</emph> of his nieces, <emph>par­
		<lb/>ticularly</emph> with his favourite <persName>Mary</persName>. She
	      <lb/>knew also that every virtuous woman has
	      <lb/>an impenetrable shield, in the correctness
	      <lb/>of her own conduct, and without the pa­
	      <lb/>rade of outrageous chastity, <persName>Mary</persName> was
	      <lb/>purity and prudence personified.</p>
            <p>After dinner she retired to her chamber,
	      <lb/>and fastening the door, perused the follow­
	      <lb/>ing lines with great satisfaction, ignorant

            <p><persName>Mary</persName>, with great taste, pinned a veil on

            <p>Alas! the sisters found, on their arrival

            <p><persName>Sir Charles Sefton</persName> was gone on a fishing

	      <lb/>had promised herself an hundred pounds;
	      <lb/><persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName>, always amiable,
	      <lb/>always steadily cheerful, as usual; the
	      <lb/>Rector, softly insinuating to <persName>Mary</persName>, and
	      <lb/>kindly civil to all his guests; <persName>Ralph</persName>, plain
	      <lb/>and honest, with now and then a dry joke

            <p><persName>Sir Charles</persName> was apt, and had a good

            <p><persName>Lady Caroline</persName> kept musing on <foreign xml:lang="fr">pic repic</foreign>
	      <lb/>and <foreign xml:lang="fr">capot</foreign>, the four honours, the grand

	      <lb/>gaming-table!</p>
            <p><persName>Margaret</persName>'s anxious eyes were frequently
	      <lb/>turned towards the entrance: every minute
	      <lb/>appeared to her an age, that kept <persName>Sir

	      <lb/>to his mirror! At length she heard foot­
	      <lb/>steps, which she felt assured were those of
	      <lb/>a man; but they appeared too heavy for
	      <lb/>those of her devoted Knight, and she feared

	      <lb/>she ventured to peep out at the flowery
	      <lb/>arch which opened into this fragrant

            <p>Thence she beheld, breathing hard and
	      <lb/>fanning herself with her pocket-handker­
	      <lb/>chief, the delectable <persName>Lady Wringham</persName>;
	      <lb/>who, entering the arbour, exclaimed, <said>Dear
		<lb/>me, how <emph>hot</emph> it is!</said> The ladies rose, and
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Caroline</persName> gave her a distant curtesy.
	      <lb/><said>Well! my lady,</said> said <persName>lady Wringham</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>what does your ladyship think? <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Leslie</persName> came, you know, on <name>Monday</name>, to <distinct>ax</distinct>
		<lb/>us to dinner:</said>—<said>Did he?</said> said <persName>Lady

		<lb/>did not your ladyship know that?</said>—<said>No,</said>
	      <lb/>said <persName>Lady Caroline</persName>, with the utmost <foreign xml:lang="fr">sang
		<lb/>froid</foreign>, as she sat picking a rose to pieces:
	      <lb/><said>Well, <mcr>howsoever</mcr>,</said> continues <persName>Lady Wring­
		<lb/>ham</persName>, <said>we could not come, 'cause we ex­
		<lb/>pected a gentleman from <placeName>London</placeName>; but
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Leslie</persName> would not let <mcr>me</mcr> rest, and
		<lb/>there he comes just now, this <distinct>a'ternoon</distinct>,

		<lb/>may say, from my company; he said I
		<lb/>must come and sup with you, and he would
		<lb/>hardly let me stay to make my <distinct>'pologies</distinct>.</said></p>
            <p>The polite <persName>Lady Caroline</persName> forced herself
	      <lb/>to say, <said>We are very glad of your com­
		<lb/>pany, <persName>Lady Wringham</persName>, and we hope <persName>Sir
		  <lb/>John</persName> will bring his friend with him.</said>
	      <lb/><said>La! I don't know,</said> said <persName>Lady Wring­
		<lb/>ham</persName>, <said><persName>Mr. Leslie</persName> said, <distinct>as how</distinct>, if he
		<lb/>had but <emph>me</emph>, he did not care;</said> and she
	      <lb/>gave a girlish giggle.</p>
            <p><persName>Lady Caroline</persName> looked at <persName>Mrs. Kennedy</persName>,
	      <lb/>and gave a shrug and a sneer, not unseen
	      <lb/>by <persName>Lady Wringham</persName>, who giving <persName>Mary</persName> a
	      <lb/>jog with her elbow, said in a whisper,
	      <lb/><said>I'll be hang'd if she isn't jealous!</said>
	      <lb/>The sentence did not quite escape <persName>Lady
		<lb/>Caroline</persName>; poor <persName>Mary</persName> was embarrassed at
	      <lb/>perceiving it; while the high dame of
	      <lb/>quality regarded them both with scorn.
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Wringham</persName>, was, however, in high
	      <lb/>spirits, and nothing seemed to embarass <emph>her</emph>.</p>

		<lb/>is not a lord!</said></p>
            <p><said>Because,</said> replied <persName>Lady Caroline</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>my husband's near relation, the Mar­
		<lb/>quis, is yet living; besides, if he was not,
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Leslie</persName> is not the first to inherit the
		<lb/>title: now, for instance, if <persName>Sir John Wring­
		  <lb/>ham</persName> had brothers or nephews, would not
		<lb/>your eldest son be <persName>Sir John</persName>, after his
		<lb/>father's death, before them?</said></p>
            <p><said>Yes, yes, my lady, I know all that;
		<lb/>but then, as you are called my lady, why
		<lb/>is not he called my lord?</said>—<said>Because,</said>
	      <lb/>replied <persName>Lady Caroline</persName>, <said>I am a lady in
		<lb/>my own right; my father was an earl; I
		<lb/>therefore still retain my maiden title of
		<lb/><persName>Lady Caroline</persName>, though I have altered my
		<lb/>surname to <persName>Leslie</persName>.</said>—<said>Well then, I say,</said>

            <p>None of the ladies could forbear a smile;

	      <lb/>the explanation she had given her so little
	      <lb/>comprehended, that she said with some
	      <lb/>degree of sarcastic spite, <said>Why, <persName>Lady
		  <lb/>Wringham</persName>, a woman never can exalt a
		<lb/>man to her dignity, but I am sure <emph>you</emph> very
		<lb/>well know that a man of title and fortune
		<lb/>can raise a woman to the rank of <emph>lady</emph>,
		<lb/>though she might be in a <emph>very</emph> low situa­
		<lb/>tion <emph>indeed</emph>, before he rendered both <emph>him­

		<lb/>tioned marriage.</said> The Baronet's lady
	      <lb/>had understanding enough, however, per­
	      <lb/>fectly to take in the full sense of her lady­
	      <lb/>ship's pointed speech; and a silence com­

		<lb/>Harrington</persName>. And now various sentiments
	      <lb/>shot like lightning across the breasts of the
	      <lb/>inmates of the bower. A deep blush mutu­

	      <lb/>though glad to see her ladyship, <persName>Margaret</persName>
	      <lb/>was disappointed that her valiant and
	      <lb/>constant Knight was so long in arranging
	      <lb/>his dress, and did not yet make his appear­
	      <lb/>ance. A gleam of comfort entered the
	      <lb/>bosom of <persName>Lady Caroline</persName>, when she reflected
	      <lb/>that she should be able, with the assistance
	      <lb/>of her obliging <persName>Harrington</persName>, to make an
	      <lb/>excellent whist party. <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> had
	      <lb/>hoped that some of the fine things that
	      <lb/><persName>Frederic</persName> had said to her, as he drove her
	      <lb/>home in his uncle's curricle, had their
	      <lb/>origin in truth; she was, therefore, in too
	      <lb/>good a humour, to be given much that
	      <lb/>evening to her natural propensity of <mcr>quiz­
		<lb/>zing;</mcr> and, passing <persName>Margaret</persName> with a slight
	      <lb/><said>how d'ye,</said> and a still slighter one to
	      <lb/><persName>Mary</persName>, she sat herself down by her <persName>Kennedy</persName>,
	      <lb/>as she called her, and restored, by her
	      <lb/>charming conversation and condescending
	      <lb/>familiarity, some degree of alacrity to that
	      <lb/>lady's depressed spirits.</p>

	      <lb/>was returned, <persName>Sir Charles Sefton</persName>, though

	      <lb/>he took more pains with his person, dis­
	      <lb/>patched the arrangement of his figure as
	      <lb/>quick as possible; and highly perfumed
	      <lb/>with <foreign xml:lang="fr">esprit de rose</foreign>, dressed most becom­
	      <lb/>ingly, and animated with the unexpected
	      <lb/>joy of finding her he idolized returned
	      <lb/>so soon, his glass reflected to his imagina­
	      <lb/>tion, what indeed he did <emph>almost</emph> look,—a
	      <lb/><emph>little bit</emph>, a <emph>very, very</emph> little bit of—<mcr>an
		<lb/><name>Adonis</name>!</mcr></p>
            <p><persName>Margaret</persName>'s heart fluttered as he entered
	      <lb/>the arbour, but, alas! advancing to <persName>Lady
		<lb/>Isabella</persName>, he seemed not even to see <quote rend="slant(italic)">the

	      <lb/>intreated in a loud, though tender whisper,
	      <lb/>that her ladyship would not risk a health
	      <lb/>so precious to him, by remaining any longer
	      <lb/>in the night air.</p>
            <p>All the gentlemen were now seen ap­

	      <lb/>rich and dashing wife of such a man:
	      <lb/>but she had also another more powerful
	      <lb/>motive for holding out to him every hope,
	      <lb/>at the present hour,—she thought herself
	      <lb/>sure of <persName>Frederic Harrington</persName>'s heart, and
	      <lb/>she was determined to prove it, by exciting
	      <lb/>his jealousy: she therefore engrossed <persName>Sir
		<lb/>Charles</persName> entirely to herself, and took no
	      <lb/>notice whatever of either the friend she
	      <lb/>had before hailed by the appellation of

            <p>The officious Rector escorted <persName>Lady

	      <lb/>changed it to a cassino: she lost there

            <p><persName>Lady Caroline</persName>, who never knew when to

	      <lb/>till near one o'clock, when, after the Rector

            <p><persName>Mrs. Kennedy</persName> had a talent of telling
	      <lb/>fortunes, by a pack of cards, and that in

	      <lb/>out of the common track; and, like the

		<lb/>Well, I declare I never had any faith in

            <p>When <persName>Mrs. Kennedy</persName> came to tell the
	      <lb/>future fate of the two girls, she had no
	      <lb/>interest in flattering <emph>them</emph>, and she was
	      <lb/>guided only by the different appearances
	      <lb/>of clubs, hearts, diamonds, and spades, as
	      <lb/>they chanced to follow each other, or be
	      <lb/>mingled together; and she told their for­
	      <lb/>tunes, as she had been taught to prognos­
	      <lb/>ticate, from the different succession of the
	      <lb/>cards alone, without deviation from those

	      <lb/>mistaken, for he was the very lowest of
	      <lb/>the low-born: that a very rich and great
	      <lb/>with the most playful and good-humoured
	      <lb/>man, much older than herself, would fall
	      <lb/>in love with her; but she must take care
	      <lb/>of him, for he had evil designs aginst her.
	      <lb/><persName>Margaret</persName> eagerly asked, if she had yet
	      <lb/>seen him? <persName>Mrs. Kennedy</persName> said, her cards
	      <lb/>did not tell; but if she had, he was not
	      <lb/>yet in love with her.</p>
            <p>To <persName>Mary</persName>, she told, that she was a little
	      <lb/>given to jealousy, but that she had no
	      <lb/>cause, for a young gentleman loved her
	      <lb/>beyond all the girls he had ever seen; and
	      <lb/>that at last they would certainly be united;
	      <lb/>but they would meet with a great many
	      <lb/>troubles and obstacles at first: that she
	      <lb/>would find, or had already found this gen­
	      <lb/>tleman rather too free in his moral princi­
	      <lb/>ples; but that he was only led astray by
	      <lb/>fashion, and rather an extravagant turn of
	      <lb/>mind; he would soon love her, and her
	      <lb/>good conduct and prudence would restore

	      <lb/>over her infatuated lover, as well as any
	      <lb/>high bred lady of birth and fashion could
	      <lb/>possibly have done; and seeing herself sure

	      <lb/>my Lady affected to be quite enamoured
	      <lb/>of the <distinct>rual</distinct> scenes about this charming
	      <lb/>village.</p>
            <p>Here the young gentleman grew strong
	      <lb/>and hearty: the prolific lady added four
	      <lb/>more children, two boys and two girls to
	      <lb/>the family; and with those that were old
	      <lb/>enough, she strutted to church, like an old

	      <lb/>her.</p>
            <p>The <emph>eighth</emph> child, <persName>Mr. Leslie</persName> had the

	      <lb/>time she had a child made a <name>christian</name>; for
	      <lb/>she liked to <said>do things <emph>like themselves!</emph></said></p>
            <p>She spared no expence in the articles of

	      <lb/>as for common beggars, <said>they were such a
		<lb/>set of <distinct>wagabones</distinct>, that they ought to be
		<lb/>whipped at the cart's tail.</said></p>
            <p>When first she married, she had a little
	      <lb/>diffidence of herself, and held her tongue;
	      <lb/>but her equipage, her husband's rank and
	      <lb/>wealth, procured her numerous acquaint­
	      <lb/>ance; she met with many ignorant people
	      <lb/>among her betters; they said all that came
	      <lb/>uppermost: she was therefore resolved in
	      <lb/>her turn to dash forward, and be as easy
	      <lb/>and as unreserved as the best of them! and
	      <lb/>if any chose to laugh at her, she would

            <p>Her profusion, which was mistaken for
	      <lb/>carelessness about money, and knowing she

            <p><persName>Lady Wringham</persName> at this time was grown

            <p>She was uncommonly proud and arrogant

	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Susan</persName> took no notice of her silly re­

	      <lb/>visited them before, except one or twice
	      <lb/>in a year: she said, she believed they were

            <p><persName>Sir John</persName> was something of an original

	      <lb/>a mere non-entity, particularly in the pre­

	      <lb/>with absolute sway――when he did even dare
	      <lb/>to reflect, he wondered at himself that she
	      <lb/>could ever charm him so much, to give
	      <lb/>up the reins to her management as he had
	      <lb/>done—but then, how many dear children
	      <lb/>she had brought! <emph>doubly</emph> dear, for they

	      <lb/>which, when the affections attaching them­

	      <lb/>dren <said>of his age,</said> did <persName>Sir John</persName> centre

	      <lb/>dandling the smaller ones on his knee;
	      <lb/>playing with them at <term>see-saw</term>, and sing­
	      <lb/>ing to them all the babies' songs, and re­
	      <lb/>citing the old nurse's tales, which he had

	      <lb/>of the country, and the unruly children
	      <lb/>have escaped him, and been, perhaps, in
	      <lb/>the apparent danger of being run over by

	      <lb/>fied him, by saying, <said>Do, my pretty dear,
		<lb/>go back to <emph>grandpapa</emph>, when he calls you.</said></p>
            <p>Now, though there was not such a <emph>vio­

            <p>She flew to her old resource of incredible
	      <lb/>romance; and read till she almost made her­
	      <lb/>self sick and blind. <persName>Mary</persName> felt the power of
	      <lb/>love; and she was sure also that her love was
	      <lb/>hopeless; could she ever raise <emph>her</emph> thoughts
	      <lb/>to the nephew of <persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName>?
	      <lb/>doomed by birth, wealth, and fashion, to
	      <lb/>figure only in the great world! Impossible.
	      <lb/>The rose fled from her cheek, and though

	      <lb/>follow all her former occupations, yet her
	      <lb/>spirits sunk, and her father and uncle saw,
	      <lb/>with much anxiety, this, the loveliest blos­
	      <lb/>som which adorned the house and garden
	      <lb/>of <name>Eglantine Farm</name>, drooping and fading
	      <lb/>daily before their eyes: <persName>Mary</persName>, whose cheer­
	      <lb/>ful vivacity, whose continual gaiety in­
	      <lb/>spired them all with gladness, now smiled
	      <lb/>but faintly, and that smile was evidently
	      <lb/>forced.</p>
            <p><persName>Edward</persName>, the most affectionate of fathers,

	      <lb/>in the presence of <persName>Margaret</persName>, who was now
	      <lb/>as pale as a ghost, she looked better.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the girls were both in­

	      <lb/>compelled only to drink asses' milk; to take
	      <lb/>every thing good and strengthening, in or­

	      <lb/>seated only in the heart and the imagina­

	      <lb/>assailed; and though the flight of the ar­

	      <lb/>stuck in her uncurled and uncombed hair,
	      <lb/>her knees and chin together; while a ro­
	      <lb/>mance of the fourteenth century laid on her
	      <lb/>lap: from which she lifted her head every
	      <lb/>now and then, to say, <said>La! I wish my
		<lb/>sister would not make such a noise!</said></p>
            <p>The third time she made this remark,
	      <lb/><persName>Mary</persName> gave a sigh, and thought, within
	      <lb/>herself, ah! why should I sing? She then
	      <lb/>applied herself to her needle, and was
	      <lb/>silent.</p>
            <p>Just as the clock struck two, who should
	      <lb/>enter the apartment, but <persName>Frederic Harring­
		<lb/>ton</persName> and <persName>Lady Isabella Emerson</persName>! the glow­

	      <lb/>his bosom; and <persName>Mary</persName> could not be blind
	      <lb/>to his accompanying blush and love-fraught
	      <lb/>eye.</p>
            <p><persName>Margaret</persName> too was highly gratified, for
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> almost flew to her, and em­
	      <lb/>bracing her, said, <said>My lovely friend, I
		<lb/>am sure you are not well.</said> <said>Oh! yes,
		<lb/>now I am,</said> said <persName>Margaret</persName>, speaking from
	      <lb/>the native impulse of her heart, <said>I was
		<lb/>really ill, but the presence and condescen­
		<lb/>cion of your ladyship has quite cured me.</said>
	      <lb/><said>Sweet girl!</said> replied <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, and
	      <lb/>taking up the book, she added, <said>Come
		<lb/>with me into the garden; it is so delight­
		<lb/>ful after the rain; and I want to have a
		<lb/>little talk with you.</said> She then, with a

	      <lb/>and drawing <persName>Margaret</persName>'s arm through her
	      <lb/>own, walked with her into the garden:

	      <lb/>and fastidious. The servant entered, say­

            <p><persName>Harrington</persName> now made the best of his
	      <lb/>time, and endowed as he was with every in­
	      <lb/>sinuating art of persuasion, he was not long
	      <lb/>ere he wrought on the mind of the young
	      <lb/>and innocent <persName>Mary</persName>, so far, as to draw from
	      <lb/>her a faint and timid promise, of giving
	      <lb/>him that hope of her affections, which
	      <lb/>would enable him to support the pain of
	      <lb/>absence.</p>
            <p><persName>Frederic Harrington</persName> had formerly been
	      <lb/>an officer in the Guards; but not well
	      <lb/>pleased with a service, active only in deeds
	      <lb/>of continued dissipation, he had quitted it,
	      <lb/>at the request of his uncle, coinciding also
	      <lb/>with his own wishes after the death of his
	      <lb/>mother.</p>
            <p>He became acquainted with the honour­
	      <lb/>able and reverend <persName>Theodore Leslie</persName> at the
	      <lb/><placeName>University of Oxford</placeName>, when that gentleman
	      <lb/>had gone there to keep a long term, pre­
	      <lb/>vious to being made Master of Arts.
	      <lb/><persName>Frederic</persName> was fascinated with the easy and
	      <lb/>fashionable manners of the young divine,
	      <lb/>and entered into a firm friendship with him;

	      <milestone unit="sig" n="2B12r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">23</mw>
	      <lb/>but his frequent loans to this reverend gen­
	      <lb/>tleman had so impoverished him, together
	      <lb/>with much money purposely and gallantly
	      <lb/>lost to <persName>Lady Caroline Leslie</persName>, that his uncle,
	      <lb/>entirely to wean him from so destructive
	      <lb/>and dangerous a society, though he severely
	      <lb/>felt the separation, yet judged it better that
	      <lb/>he should again enter the army, and accom­
	      <lb/>pany the grand expedition to the <placeName>Scheldt</placeName>,
	      <lb/>when he might also be of service to his
	      <lb/>country, and distinguish himself by his per­
	      <lb/>sonal courage and merit.</p>
            <p><persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName> likewise regretted
	      <lb/>that so many fine young men, who might
	      <lb/>be usefully and bravely employed, and
	      <lb/>become an honour to <placeName>Great Britain</placeName> and
	      <lb/>themselves, should be lounging away their
	      <lb/>hours on the pavements of <placeName>Bond-street</placeName>
	      <lb/>and <placeName>Pall-mall</placeName>. Severe might be the
	      <lb/>lot, deep the sorrow of their surviving
	      <lb/>relatives, should they perish; but they
	      <lb/>would have this consolation, that the youth­
	      <lb/>ful heroes died on the bed of honour, and
	      <lb/>did their part in ensuring the safety of their

	      <lb/>island from the grasp of the usurper: and
	      <lb/>such as these enable the honest artificer, the
	      <lb/>industrious farmer, and the useful citizen
	      <lb/>to carry on their employments in peace
	      <lb/>and security, and spread the table of
	      <lb/>the wealthy tradesman with <said>luxury and

            <p>It was but in brief, that <persName>Frederic</persName> ac­
	      <lb/>quainted his <persName>Mary</persName> with <emph>one</emph> cause of his
	      <lb/>departure; which was the impoverished
	      <lb/>state of his finances: his persuasions to
	      <lb/><placeName>Lady Caroline Leslie</placeName> <mcr>had conquered her;</mcr>
	      <lb/>for he had prevailed upon her to take back
	      <lb/>the sum she had lost to him, on the even­
	      <lb/>ing of that day he first beheld the charm­
	      <lb/>ing <persName>Mary</persName>: this, in as delicate a manner as
	      <lb/>possible, towards her ladyship, did he ex­
	      <lb/>plain to <persName>Mary</persName>, on the accusation he re­
	      <lb/>ceived from her, of his being a general
	      <lb/>lover. He owned that he had never seen any
	      <lb/>woman so beautiful and fascinating, in per­
	      <lb/>son, as <persName>Lady Isabella Emerson</persName>; but it was
	      <lb/><emph>person alone</emph>; and its <said>skin-deep</said> and
	      <lb/>fugitive impressions had departed for ever!

            <p>The irradiating mind of <persName>Mary</persName>, while it
	      <lb/>embellished her countenance, made the
	      <lb/>charms of that countenance, though quick
	      <lb/>in their effects, increasing and durable in
	      <lb/>their impression.</p>
            <p><persName>Mary</persName> was easily disposed to believe all
	      <lb/>that her <persName>Harrington</persName> told her――perhaps the
	      <lb/>reader may think <emph>too</emph> easily: but <persName>Mary</persName> was
	      <lb/>very young, <persName>Frederic</persName> irresistibly insinuating
	      <lb/>and handsome, and they were also on the
	      <lb/>point of separating, perhaps never to meet
	      <lb/>again: she had found the object of her
	      <lb/>choice <emph>virtuous</emph> and <emph>innocent</emph>, when com­
	      <lb/>pared to what she had once thought him; and
	      <lb/>when she reflected on the distance between
	      <lb/>them, when she knew how many high-born
	      <lb/>and wealthy ladies to whom he had a right
	      <lb/>to aspire, she felt that conscious and gra­
	      <lb/>tified pride which cannot but glory in
	      <lb/>being the preferred choice of such a man.</p>
            <p><persName>Mary</persName> was not a model of <emph>perfection</emph>;
	      <lb/>far from it; she was a mere human being,
	      <lb/>subject to error: she had no vice, she

            <p>Too soon, much too soon for <persName>Frederic

		<lb/>garet</persName>, <said>I really presumed to think that
		<lb/>you and I were something alike in our

		<lb/>life, at least what it ought to be: I'll
		<lb/>send you some of <emph>my</emph> books; they will not

		<lb/>fond of reading about.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> had the art of giving a
	      <lb/>charm to all she uttered: <persName>Margaret</persName> was
	      <lb/>convinced that all she said must be right;
	      <lb/>and she regarded her ladyship with the

	      <lb/>looked on the style and tasteful elegance of
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Isabella</persName>'s dress: she adjusted her
	      <lb/>tucker, smoothed her dishevelled hair, as
	      <lb/>well as she could, with her fingers! but cast­
	      <lb/>ing her eyes downwards, she saw two de­
	      <lb/>fects in her light pink striped gown, which

	      <lb/>she could not then possibly repair; one
	      <lb/>was a greasy spot, in circumference of
	      <lb/>about an half-crown piece; the other a
	      <lb/>large hole, much the same size, which she
	      <lb/>had burnt as she stood over the kitchen
	      <lb/>fire reading, after having given some or­
	      <lb/>ders to the cook-maid, and which had been
	      <lb/>caused by the red-hot poker; while just
	      <lb/>before, she had unconsciously dipped the
	      <lb/>other end in the dripping-pan, being her­
	      <lb/>self wholly absorbed in the study of her fa­
	      <lb/>vourite romance.</p>
            <p>However, in spite of her grotesque figure,
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> continued to caress her, as
	      <lb/>she wanted to make both a <emph>tool</emph> and a <emph>fool</emph>

            <p><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> now perceiving that she
	      <lb/>had impressed <persName>Margaret</persName> with every idea she
	      <lb/>could wish respecting <persName>Sir Charles</persName>, pro­
	      <lb/>posed returning to the house, promising to
	      <lb/>send her the books as soon as she arrived
	      <lb/>at the parsonage.</p>
            <p>It may be easily seen, that from taking
	      <lb/>an improper bent, the refined understand­
	      <lb/>ing of <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> was perverted to the
	      <lb/>worst of purposes, and the pernicious works
	      <lb/>she perused, the ill example of her nearest
	      <lb/>relatives, and a naturally mischievous dis­
	      <lb/>position, all combined to corrupt her heart,
	      <lb/>and render her careless of future conse­
	      <lb/>quences, so as she could but achieve her
	      <lb/>desired pursuit. That heart had a degree
	      <lb/>of warmth which made love requisite to
	      <lb/>the happiness of her existence; she had loved
	      <lb/><persName>Major Raymond</persName>, but she never had re­
	      <lb/>garded any man with that degree of parti­
	      <lb/>ality which she felt for <persName>Frederic Harrington</persName>.

	      <lb/>Her penetration was most quick and acute;
	      <lb/>she saw, after the last visit of the farm­
	      <lb/>house family to the parsonage, that the
	      <lb/>heart of <persName>Frederic</persName> was lost to her for ever;
	      <lb/>she had suspected it, at the preceding visit,
	      <lb/>but she hoped, if it had only strayed from
	      <lb/>her, she should yet be able to recover it:
	      <lb/>now, her wounded pride made her fixed
	      <lb/>in the resolution to spurn him from her,
	      <lb/>even if she saw him sighing at her feet in
	      <lb/>despair.</p>
            <p>She was resolved in private to give <persName>Ray­
		<lb/>mond</persName> every hope; while in public she must
	      <lb/>affect to receive the address of <persName>Sir Charles

	      <lb/>though she inwardly detested him, and put
	      <lb/>every art in practice to rid herself of a
	      <lb/>lover so very uncongenial to her taste.</p>
            <p>She determined, if possible, to drive him
	      <lb/>into some kind of intrigue, which might
	      <lb/>take up his time and attention; and it will
	      <lb/>be thought strange that she should pitch

	      <lb/>able: she knew also that <persName>Sir Charles Sef­

	      <lb/>and doted on variety, in whatever female
	      <lb/>form it appeared, that was not downright

	      <lb/>but a very stupid companion for her, and
	      <lb/>in vain he endeavoured to say something

            <p>In about half an hour after her arrival at

	      <lb/>of marriage; and, if so tied, to meditate
	      <lb/>adultery; to break through the prudent
	      <lb/>bands of parental restraint, and give up all
	      <lb/>to love, which so far from being branded
	      <lb/>by these seductive writers with the title of
	      <lb/><emph>illicit</emph>, was styled <emph>virtuous</emph>; though scof­

	      <lb/>friends, for she was cunning enough to
	      <lb/>conceal, and study in private, the sources
	      <lb/>of her present transformation: as the mo­

            <p>He pressed her, at parting, to his heart;
	      <lb/>and gave her, with parental fondness, his
	      <lb/>blessing and advice, which sufficiently
	      <lb/>proved he had penetrated into the causes
	      <lb/>of the present change in her person and

		<lb/><persName>Mary</persName>, guard your heart!</said></p>
            <p>More than thrice did the secret mount to

	      <lb/>the clattering sound made by the hoofs of
	      <lb/>his favourite mare, he did not yet appear
	      <lb/>as quite departed. The dead silence that
	      <lb/>ensued made her tears stream afresh, and
	      <lb/>though still blessed with a kind uncle and
	      <lb/>a worthy and affectionate parent, she felt
	      <lb/>at that moment as if left alone in the world
	      <lb/>without a single friend.</p>
            <p>She leaned her aching head against the
	      <lb/>little book-case which contained the in­
	      <lb/>structive library her generous uncle had
	      <lb/>given her; kissed the lettered backs of
	      <lb/>some of the volumes, and gave herself up
	      <lb/>to all the indulgence of sorrow; for she
	      <lb/>well knew that each of the inhabitants of
	      <lb/>the farm, wholly occupied with their own

	      <lb/>easy address and fund of military anecdote,
	      <lb/>made his society always desirable, and the
	      <lb/>deprivation of it severely felt by his family.
	      <lb/>The servants had a pleasure in preventing
	      <lb/>his wishes; and his nieces were both emulous

	      <lb/>the hair to mark <mentioned><persName>C.M.</persName></mentioned> on his cambric
	      <lb/>pocket-handkerchiefs or cravats.</p>
            <p>A summons to tea took <persName>Mary</persName> from her
	      <lb/>library into the common parlour: her fa­

	      <lb/>while <persName>uncle Ralph</persName> drew the tea-table with

            <p><persName>Edward</persName>, after refusing the bread and

            <p>They all retired early to rest; and for a

	      <lb/>wrote to one or other of them by every

            <p>In the mean time, the plotting <persName>Lady Isa­

	      <lb/>libertine; he harboured against the unsus­
	      <lb/>pecting girl the basest designs; and while
	      <lb/>he laid his iniquitous plans to effect her
	      <lb/>ruin, he meant his short-lived attachment
	      <lb/>to her to be as transitory and fleeting as the
	      <lb/>passion with which she had inspired him;
	      <lb/>their sudden separation as momentary as

            <p><persName>Raymond</persName>, young, thoughtless, and in­

            <p>Every plan was laid by <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>

	      <lb/>sister began strongly to suspect that her
	      <lb/>tenderness for <persName>Major Raymond</persName> was again
	      <lb/>revived: the Major's visits, also, became
	      <lb/>so frequent, as to draw on him cool and

	      <lb/>distant and unrepeated invitations to stay

            <p>The Rector and his lady always slept in

            <p>In the perplexity of her mind, one morn­

	      <lb/>her pillow, a golden thought on a sud­

	      <lb/>ter to rise, and take a walk with her on the

            <p><persName>Sir Charles</persName>, ever joyful to obey the

	      <lb/>replied the Baronet, with a desponding look.

            <p><persName>Lady Isabella</persName>'s art, in this morning's adven­
	      <lb/>ture, shone conspicuous: she had appointed

	      <lb/>and he generally repaired to his library and

	      <lb/>riance of hair: she threw herself in a care­
	      <lb/>less attitude, half lying, half sitting, on a
	      <lb/>purple satin library-sofa; and while she
	      <lb/>raised her delicate fingers to play sport­
	      <lb/>ingly on the <mcr>candelabra</mcr> which stood be­
	      <lb/>side it, the snowy whiteness of her hand
	      <lb/>appeared dazzling: an ancle of the finest
	      <lb/>symmetry, and well-formed little foot, de­
	      <lb/>rived new beauty from the soft kid morn­
	      <lb/>ing boot which embraced it.</p>
            <p><persName>Sir Charles</persName> longed for the period when

	      <lb/>treating her to name the happy day, when
	      <lb/>he might call her his.</p>
            <p>The softness of her consenting looks,
	      <lb/>accompanied with a gentle sigh, made <persName>Sir
		<lb/>Charles</persName> easily conceive that he might <emph>him­

	      <lb/>on the part of her ladyship: <said>Whatever

            <p>The Baronet then insisted she should

	      <lb/>endeavouring to look grave, while satis­

		<lb/>unbecoming in people of rank and fash­

		<lb/>more respect; she is not yet, <persName>Sir Charles</persName>,
		<lb/>your wife; and the situation I found my
		<lb/>sister in on the sofa, is very improper in­
		<lb/>deed for a woman of her quality. I am
		<lb/>happy, certainly, that she is sensible of
		<lb/>the worth of a husband, such as you will
		<lb/>make her; but I must, in my house, beg
		<lb/>more decorum of manners, while she is yet
		<lb/>in her single state.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> retired in well-feigned
	      <lb/>confusion, inwardly rejoicing that her
	      <lb/>plan had succeeded so far; and more dis­

            <p>When he had sufficiently wrought on

	      <lb/>he could come disguised: he would not

            <p>The <persName>Reverend Theodore Leslie</persName> had never

	      <lb/>like to lend money, neither to give it away,
	      <lb/>unless to put in practice some very favour­
	      <lb/>ite pursuit: but, to please his future lady,
	      <lb/>to obtain the masquerade he had promised
	      <lb/>her, if possible, and the power this loan
	      <lb/>might give him over the <name>Leslies</name>, to do as
	      <lb/>he pleased; to make their house his home,
	      <lb/>and invite thereto whoever he might think
	      <lb/>proper: all these circumstances made him
	      <lb/>feign a generosity he by no means felt.</p>
            <p><said>Well, my dear friend,</said> said he, after
	      <lb/>a long, and to <persName>Mr. Leslie</persName>, a puzzling and
	      <lb/>painful pause,—<said>and is this really all the

		<lb/>mighty favour you have to ask of me?
		<lb/>Be assured, double that sum is yours, at
		<lb/>pleasure.</said></p>
            <p>He then hastened to his writing-desk,
	      <lb/>and gave a bill on his banker, to be paid at
	      <lb/>sight; but he did not <emph>double</emph> the sum, nor
	      <lb/>did he forget to take the proffered bond.</p>
            <p>However, with all his shallow princi­
	      <lb/>ples, he knew it would be the height of in­
	      <lb/>delicacy, at that moment, to ask a favour
	      <lb/>in return; and reserved the masquerade
	      <lb/>scheme till after dinner, when the cloth
	      <lb/>and servants should be withdrawn.</p>
            <p>In answer to his then strenuously urged
	      <lb/>request, the Reverend <persName>Theodore Leslie</persName>
	      <lb/>said, <said>My dear <persName>Sir Charles</persName>, I have but
		<lb/>one objection, that is the prejudice of the
		<lb/>country people: you well know, I am
		<lb/>sure, and will acknowledge, that I have
		<lb/>no aversion to any one fashionable amuse­
		<lb/>ment in the world, <foreign xml:lang="fr">au contraire</foreign>, and many
		<lb/>is the masquerade in town that I have ac­
		<lb/>companied <emph>you</emph> to: but to have such a

		<pb n="59"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="2D6r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">59</mw>
		<lb/>be inadmissible; nor can we accomplish it,
		<lb/>I am sure, without giving offence to these
		<lb/>votaries of the <mcr>old school</mcr>; and it will cast
		<lb/>a stigma on my professional character that
		<lb/>I know not how I should wipe off. Now
		<lb/>there is <persName>Edward Marsham</persName>, for instance,
		<lb/>my curate; why, I suppose nothing on
		<lb/>earth would make him bring his family to
		<lb/>such an entertainment! and I declare the
		<lb/>good folks at the farm-house are the
		<lb/>most decent people in this place: I do not
		<lb/>like to have a party without them; and
		<lb/>that girl, <persName>Mary Marsham</persName>, is an ornament
		<lb/>to any circle, and indeed the other im­
		<lb/>proves very much of late.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Lady Caroline</persName> turned up her lip with a
	      <lb/>contemptuous sneer. <said>Oh!</said> said <persName>Lady
		<lb/>Isabella</persName>, <said>as to my little sensible <persName>Marga­
		  <lb/>ret</persName>, I quite <emph>love</emph> her!</said>—<said>And so do I,

	      <lb/><mcr>quizzing</mcr>, half serious, as he watched the
	      <lb/>looks of his <persName>Isabella</persName>, who, though in­
	      <lb/>wardly pleased, pouted and affected to be
	      <lb/>jealous.

            <p><persName>Lady Caroline</persName>, who had seen much of

	      <lb/>eyed him with an archness which rather

            <p><persName>Lady Caroline</persName>'s spirits were uncommonly

            <p>The indefatigable <persName>Sir Charles</persName> again re­

		<lb/>you will thus avoid the stupid throng of

		<lb/>where, when they are all assembled and
		<lb/>ready to begin dancing, let <persName>Lady Caroline</persName>
		<lb/>or <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> propose some little change
		<lb/>of disguises and present the company with

            <p><said>I am sorry the Lieutenant is gone,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mr. Leslie</persName>; <said>there was a great deal
		<lb/>of originality and spirit about that fellow;
		<lb/>I liked him much: but <persName>Sir Charles</persName> and
		<lb/><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> were very glad he <emph>was</emph> gone:
		<lb/><persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, though she liked him, feared
		<lb/>him more; and <persName>Sir Charles</persName> knew he could
		<lb/>better impose on the unsuspecting virtue of
		<lb/><persName>Edward</persName>, and the simplicity of honest
		<lb/><persName>Ralph</persName>, than on the mind of a man who
		<lb/>had mixed so much in the world as <persName>Charles

		<lb/>would not tamely suffer any insult offered
		<lb/>to his family, nor endure the wrongs of a

            <p>The plan adopted by <persName>Mrs. Kennedy</persName> was

            <p><persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName>, not to appear

	      <lb/>which made him a welcome guest where­
	      <lb/>ever he appeared, arrived at the rectory the

	      <lb/>at <placeName>Ramsgate</placeName> with his regiment, waiting,
	      <lb/>not only for a fair wind, but for a fresh
	      <lb/>embarkation of troops before they sailed.</p>
            <p>The Rector and his Curate departed not
	      <lb/>from their professional character, but at­
	      <lb/>tended merely as lookers-on at this elegant
	      <lb/>and <emph>unique</emph> species of entertainment. <persName>Lady

	      <lb/>of hazard. The flag her ladyship held,

		<lb/>fears to venture, must never hope to

            <p><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> appeared in the dress of a

            <p><persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName>, who was in the

	      <lb/>fault that was found with her appearance

	      <lb/><persName>Lucy Ringwood</persName>, as a novice of <name>St. Domi­

	      <lb/>she took up the Rector's sole attention till
	      <lb/>the arrival of a minstrel in the evening,
	      <lb/>who never quitted her till the hour of sup­
	      <lb/>per, when he refused to unmask, and left
	      <lb/>the brilliant party wondering who he was.</p>
            <p>The guests who were expected from <placeName>Lon­

	      <lb/>country, in the environs of <placeName>Eglantine</placeName>, were

            <p>No one, after this, could be fastidious
	      <lb/>enough to make an objection to what ap­

	      <lb/>she declared it was quite <emph>scandalous</emph> to
	      <lb/>hide <mcr>people's beauty</mcr> under such nasty, ugly,
	      <lb/>painted things! <said>My dear madam,</said> said

            <p><said>Excuse me, <persName>Lady Wringham</persName>,</said> said

            <p><said>Besides,</said> said <persName>Sir Charles Sefton</persName>, <said>I

		<lb/>wear an ugly mask; it gains her so many

		<lb/>of all those who regard her.</said> <said>Well, well,

            <p><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> now having got rid of all

	      <lb/>scheme, which promised so much amuse­
	      <lb/>ment; and retiring into a recess, they
	      <lb/>quickly changed habits, unperceived by
	      <lb/>the rest of the female party, who were all
	      <lb/>occupied in choosing their masks.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> had
	      <lb/>caused the friar, <persName>Major Raymond</persName>, to
	      <lb/>change dresses with the <name>Turk</name>, <persName>Sir Charles
		<lb/>Sefton</persName>; who, not having the smallest sus­
	      <lb/>picion of what was going forward, or, in­
	      <lb/>deed, that she now loved any one upon
	      <lb/>earth but his own dear self, readily came
	      <lb/>into the plot, as it would facilitate his
	      <lb/>elopement with <persName>Margaret</persName>; whom, as her
	      <lb/>ladyship in the pilgrim's disguise, he could
	      <lb/>very well pay unremitted attention to; and
	      <lb/>as a few days was all he wished for to carry
	      <lb/>on his iniquitous commerce with the un­
	      <lb/>happy victim of his libertinism, he rejoiced
	      <lb/>in the scheme of <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, who laugh­
	      <lb/>ed inwardly at the success of her plans.</p>
            <p>Proud of her confidence, he retired with
	      <lb/><persName>Major Raymond</persName> to a summer-house at the

	      <lb/>ally exchanged their disguises, after the
	      <lb/>Major had made some strong objections, as
	      <lb/>had been before preconcerted between him
	      <lb/>and her ladyship.</p>
            <p>And now all the wit and small-talk of a
	      <lb/>masquerade enlivened the present gay as­
	      <lb/>sembly, which soon became crowded with
	      <lb/>masks in various characters: the trans­
	      <lb/>formed <persName>Raymond</persName>, from a friar to a <name>Turk</name>,
	      <lb/>took particular notice of the pretty shep­
	      <lb/>herdess; while the <persName>Friar Sefton</persName> was very
	      <lb/>busy in extorting confession from the fe­
	      <lb/>male pilgrim, to whom, when he declared
	      <lb/>he knew her, notwithstanding her disguise,
	      <lb/>he imparted in private the metamorphosis
	      <lb/>he had undergone. <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> confided
	      <lb/>also to her brother and sister the change
	      <lb/>she had made with <persName>Margaret</persName>; but took
	      <lb/>special care not to mention that which she
	      <lb/>had effected between her lovers; and thus

	      <lb/>characters in masks, whom none of the
	      <lb/>party were able to recognize, either by

	      <lb/>with a pair of boots of a very foreign make,
	      <lb/>with enormous long gold spurs: he strut­
	      <lb/>ted about in these boots, and afforded much
	      <lb/>diversion<anchor xml:id="a036" corresp="#n036" rend="pre(*)"/>; boasting that they were the

	      <lb/>with a <foreign xml:lang="fr">badinage</foreign> which was pointedly half
	      <lb/>serious, expressed with all the native high
	      <lb/>sense of pride peculiar to his country, his
	      <lb/>indignation at the idea of wearing<anchor xml:id="a037" corresp="#n036" rend="pre(*)"/> ano­

		<lb/>fide</foreign> <persName>General Le Febvre</persName>'s boots which
	      <lb/>then covered his legs. At length a warm

	      <lb/>tween the <rs type="properAdjective">Highland</rs> Chief and the <rs type="properAdjective">German</rs>
	      <lb/>Officer, over two or three tumblers of
	      <lb/>champaign, about which regiment it was
	      <lb/>that took the <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> general prisoner!
	      <lb/>The Highlander positively declared he was
	      <lb/>taken by the Prince's regiment, while the
	      <lb/><name>Hussar</name> contended, and indeed with un­
	      <lb/>questionable veracity, by all those who
	      <lb/>saw the action, that it was a <anchor xml:id="a038" corresp="#n038" rend="pre(*)"/>private hus­
	      <lb/>sar belonging to the King's <rs type="properAdjective">German</rs> Le­

	      <lb/>ing to a different regiment, while he con­
	      <lb/>tinued <emph>his</emph> services in the field of combat.</p>
            <p>The contest grew so warm, that the
	      <lb/>Chief challenged the <name>Hussar</name> immediately
	      <lb/>to retire and settle it in that way conform­
	      <lb/>able to the laws of honour. In vain the

	      <lb/>party interposed; the indignant officers
	      <lb/>haughtily bade good-night to the gay as­
	      <lb/>sembly, who, with all the indifference of
	      <lb/>fashion, continued their amusement; ex­
	      <lb/>cept that part of the company whose feel­

	      <lb/>by the fatal contagion of the goddess Dis­
	      <lb/>sipation, who builds her temple close by
	      <lb/>that of Vice.</p>
            <p>A faint sickness, which she could not
	      <lb/>account for, came over the feeling and
	      <lb/>compassionate <persName>Mary</persName>; in vain she endea­
	      <lb/>voured to persuade herself that it was only
	      <lb/>common humanity for a fellow-creature;
	      <lb/>why then did she not feel equally as keenly
	      <lb/>awake to the safety of the <rs type="properAdjective">Highland</rs> Chief?
	      <lb/>No, a nearer and more lively interest seem­
	      <lb/>ed kindling in her bosom towards his com­
	      <lb/>panion: she shuddered at, and severely
	      <lb/>condemned the inconstancy of her nature,
	      <lb/>which made her, in the intoxicating plea­
	      <lb/>sures of that evening, forget that such a

	      <lb/>only to draw a comparison to his disadvan­
	      <lb/>tage, with the accomplished stranger.</p>
            <p>The <rs type="properAdjective">Hussar</rs> Officer had attended to no
	      <lb/>female but her during the whole time he
	      <lb/>remained there; and those attentions were
	      <lb/>pointed and unremitting: the polished ele­
	      <lb/>gance of his manners, his fine martial form,
	      <lb/>his interesting foreign accent, which rather
	      <lb/>embellished the graces of his speech than
	      <lb/>destroyed them, made an impression on
	      <lb/><persName>Mary</persName>, which, whatever soft sentiment she
	      <lb/>might have before felt for <persName>Harrington</persName>,
	      <lb/>seemed new to her bosom and more de­

            <p><persName>Lady Caroline</persName> observing, as she seated

	      <lb/>in a small anti-room, which appeared to

		<lb/>they are convinced of it themselves, and

		<lb/>they knew they were unfit for: to-morrow,
		<lb/>be assured, they will be more cool, and
		<lb/>think nothing of it. Pray, do you know
		<lb/>them, that you are so alarmed?</said>—<said>Oh!
		<lb/>no, madam, I assure you,</said> said <persName>Mary</persName>,
	      <lb/>with that uncommon energy which made

	      <lb/>pect that she did: but she added, <said>Come,

		<lb/>by such uncommon agitation about stran­
		<lb/>gers; your father is not present, and your

	      <lb/>ner in which this lady of high fashion ex­
	      <lb/>pressed herself; and she felt a renewed de­
	      <lb/>testation of the manners of the age, which
	      <lb/>had so depraved a mind, in which she had
	      <lb/>just before seen, in the kind behaviour
	      <lb/>shewn to herself, an instance of the most

            <p>A ray of comfort now darted across the

	      <lb/>enquiry, that her father had followed them

	      <lb/>stinacy of impetuous young men of fashion,

	      <lb/>speak persuasion and conviction to their
	      <lb/>minds, how heinous is the sin of committing

	      <lb/>—<said>No, no, dear uncle,</said> said she, though

	      <lb/>flashed conviction on their minds, that
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> had eloped with <persName>Major Ray­

	      <lb/>had seen the shepherdess and the <name>Turk</name>,

            <p><persName>Lady Isabella</persName>'s woman was ordered in,

            <p><persName>Sir Charles</persName> was in a state of disappointed

            <p>The poor girls sat in that pitiable situa­

	      <lb/>not felt for <persName>Frederic Harrington</persName>, but for
	      <lb/>one apparently a stranger and a foreigner!
	      <lb/>and <persName>Frederic</persName> began to be jealous of <emph>him­
		<lb/>self</emph>! For though he proved his own irre­
	      <lb/>sistibility, yet as <persName>Mary</persName> had no idea that it
	      <lb/>was really him, he fancied he plainly saw
	      <lb/>an inconstancy in her nature, which though
	      <lb/>he felt himself more in love with her than
	      <lb/>ever, made him shudder; for he had re­
	      <lb/>solved, nor did he yet feel inclined to
	      <lb/>change his resolution, to make <persName>Mary</persName> his
	      <lb/>own, by the indissoluble ties of marriage.</p>
            <p>The champaign at the side-board was
	      <lb/>exquisite; the General and he did ample
	      <lb/>credit to it: the heat of the room made
	      <lb/>them insensible of the <emph>quantity</emph> their thirst
	      <lb/>caused them to quaff; and the fatigue
	      <lb/>of <persName>Harrington</persName>'s journey, with the little
	      <lb/>sustenance he had taken, made the wine

            <p>Not choosing to mix more than he could

	      <lb/>the person on whom he vented his ill-hu­
	      <lb/>mour, and the altercation before-mentioned
	      <lb/>took place, and which had been often pre­
	      <lb/>viously debated by these two very contend­
	      <lb/>ing parties in the <placeName>St. James's coffee-house</placeName>,

            <p><persName>General Rainham</persName>, however, in all the

            <p><persName>Mr. Alberry</persName>, with the assistance of <persName>Ed­

		<lb/>deric Harrington</persName> to the farm-house, where
	      <lb/>soon the agonized sight of <persName>Edward</persName> was
	      <lb/>convinced he saw in the wounded young
	      <lb/>man, the nephew of his brother <persName>Charles</persName>'s
	      <lb/>best benefactor; and indeed the senses of
	      <lb/><persName>Frederic</persName> not being yet fled, soon made him
	      <lb/>inform, in broken sentences, the anxious
	      <lb/>Curate who he was, and who, notwith­
	      <lb/>standing the bodily anguish he endured,
	      <lb/>yet ardently enquired which way was the
	      <lb/>wind? and bitterly sighed, at the idea of
	      <lb/>not being able to join his regiment.</p>
            <p>The famous village surgeon and apothe­
	      <lb/>cary, <persName>Mr. Alberry</persName>, was a man of a warm
	      <lb/>and benevolent heart; and had his medical
	      <lb/>skill been proportionate to the excellent

	      <lb/>qualities of that seat of feeling, he would
	      <lb/>have been the first in his profession.</p>
            <p>By practising in the <name>Marshams</name>' family
	      <lb/>from their infancy, he was a competent
	      <lb/>judge of their constitutions; he therefore
	      <lb/>never mistook complaints, which were in
	      <lb/>general very slight, and the volume of
	      <lb/><persName>Buchan</persName> which lay in his parlour-window,
	      <lb/>always furnished him with proper remedies
	      <lb/>for the young people<anchor xml:id="a040" corresp="#n040" rend="pre(*)"/>. Two chirurgical
	      <lb/>operations, which he had performed, served
	      <lb/>to establish his fame, beyond a possibility
	      <lb/>of doubt, in the village; one was the am­
	      <lb/>putation of a leg, the first he had perform­
	      <lb/>ed, without the assistance of, or consulta­
	      <lb/>tion with another surgeon: and though
	      <lb/>his lopping off that useful member hap­
	      <lb/>pened to be premature, yet, as no one
	      <lb/>knew any thing about that, and the pati­
	      <lb/>ent being a fine young man of three-and­
	      <lb/>twenty, possessed of an <rs type="properAdjective">Herculean</rs> strength
	      <lb/>of constitution, the wonderful operation
	      <pb n="104"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">104</mw>
	      <lb/>was spoken of with great admiration of the
	      <lb/>doctor's talents, all through the village and
	      <lb/>its environs. The next was on his own in­
	      <lb/>fant son, who had the misfortune to be
	      <lb/>born with a hare-lip: parental anxiety called
	      <lb/>forth all his energies, all his watchfulness:
	      <lb/>after he had closed it and fastened down the
	      <lb/>sides with the finest needles, he sat whole
	      <lb/>nights waking, with the child on his knees,
	      <lb/>to lull it to sleep, and prevent its cries from
	      <lb/>breaking the fragile and delicate closure;
	      <lb/>convinced that the care, patience, and
	      <lb/>anxiety of a parent alone, could keep the
	      <lb/>eyes from being closed in sleep for many
	      <lb/>succeeding nights.</p>
            <p>The boy, cured of this defect, grew
	      <lb/>uncommonly handsome; and the fame of
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Alberry</persName> spread far and wide: what
	      <lb/>served to establish it more firmly with the
	      <lb/><name>Marshams</name>, was his certain prognostics of
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Edward Marsham</persName>'s early death and
	      <lb/>consumptive habits, long before her friends
	      <lb/>had imagined her health to be in any way
	      <lb/>declining: not that the lady was at all
	      <pb n="105"/>

	      <lb/>consumptive, though naturally delicate;
	      <lb/>and a severe labour with her youngest
	      <lb/>daughter had been the sole cause of her
	      <lb/>demise in the bloom of her life.</p>
            <p>This, however, made him a <emph>croaking</emph>
	      <lb/>doctor; and if he had not all the <emph>skill</emph>,
	      <lb/>he had a great deal of the <emph>art</emph> of his pro­
	      <lb/>fession: he always appeared to apprehend
	      <lb/>his patients to be in imminent danger; and
	      <lb/>of which he found the good effects: if the
	      <lb/>sick person died, his judgment was un­
	      <lb/>doubted; if he recovered, the greater were
	      <lb/>his medical powers.</p>
            <p>A ball he had never extracted in his life,
	      <lb/>and he was afraid now to venture: at any
	      <lb/>rate, he really felt assured in his own mind
	      <lb/>that the present patient must die from the
	      <lb/>effects of his wound alone, and therefore
	      <lb/>he would not attempt the extraction, but
	      <lb/>declared it was impossible that it <emph>could</emph> be
	      <lb/>extracted.</p>
            <p><persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName>, however, in­

            <p>After the above account of <persName>Mr. Alberry</persName>,
	      <lb/>the reader will, no doubt, entertain some
	      <lb/>hopes of <persName>Frederic Harrington</persName>'s recovery;
	      <lb/>the wound in his shoulder was certainly a
	      <lb/>very bad one, but he was not <emph>mortally</emph>
	      <lb/>wounded, though the violent agitation of
	      <lb/>his mind, and the fatigue he had under­
	      <lb/>gone, combined to bring on a fever, which
	      <lb/>would inevitably prove dangerous, without
	      <lb/>the strictest care and attention.</p>
            <p>The agonies of <persName>Sir Edward</persName>'s mind may
	      <lb/>be felt, but can neither be described, nor
	      <lb/>even conceived, except by those who might
	      <lb/>chance to be placed in a similar situation:
	      <lb/>the wind had changed, the commandant
	      <lb/>had joined, and the expedition had sailed!
	      <lb/>The accident which had happened to his
	      <lb/>nephew, prevented him, not only from dis­
	      <lb/>tinguishing himself in the field of honour,
	      <lb/>but it would fix a stain on his military cha­

	      <lb/>ver be thoroughly obliterated, from his
	      <lb/>being absent at such a momentous crisis,
	      <lb/>merely to enjoy the pleasures of a private
	      <lb/>masquerade; for he had yet to learn the
	      <lb/>state of his nephew's heart with regard to
	      <lb/><persName>Mary</persName>; and even had he then known it, the
	      <lb/>impetuosity of impulsive feeling, and the
	      <lb/>want of government in the passions of his
	      <lb/>nephew, would have caused this truly pa­
	      <lb/>rental uncle to be only the more offended
	      <lb/>at his conduct: but added to this, his
	      <lb/>wounded honour, was the bitterly afflicting
	      <lb/>idea of the danger of that life, in which
	      <lb/>his own might be said to be bound up. He
	      <lb/>was too ready, from his own anxious fears,
	      <lb/>to believe the ill report made by <persName>Mr. Al­
		<lb/>berry</persName>, and the dreadful idea that his <persName>Fre­

            <p>All the present inmates of the farm-house

	      <lb/>the expence of extraordinary speed in the

	      <lb/>that it was only the rash haste of their sis­

	      <lb/>that they were sure she loved no one but
	      <lb/>their dear <persName>Sir Charles Sefton</persName>: no, <persName>Sir
		<lb/>Charles</persName> assured them, with much <foreign xml:lang="fr">sang­

	      <lb/>her affection for another, and had made
	      <lb/>use of himself only as a tool to accomplish
	      <lb/>her purpose, no power on earth should
	      <lb/>compel him to wed such a woman, and he
	      <lb/>was resolved to think no more of her. He
	      <lb/>then hastened to quit the acquaintance of

            <p>The village had ample food for conver­

            <p>The scandal also of having a masque­

	      <lb/>passed her hours of discontented leisure in

	      <lb/>able and Reverend <persName>Theodore Leslie</persName> left the
	      <lb/>care of the living to his worthy Curate:
	      <lb/>before those few days were expired, <persName>Major
		<lb/>Raymond</persName> received the hand of his beauti­
	      <lb/>ful and dashing <persName>Isabella</persName>.</p>
            <p>They hastened back as fast as post-horses
	      <lb/>could carry them, to <persName>Mr. Leslie</persName>'s rectory
	      <lb/>near <placeName>London</placeName>, to throw themselves on the

	      <lb/>tion of kindness: but the Rector and his
	      <lb/>lady peremptorily refused to see <persName>Major Ray­
		<lb/>mond</persName>. <said>Pay me, then, the residue of

		<lb/>have taken a fatiguing and expensive jour­

		<lb/>I liked the frolic of it, and was made a
		<lb/>wife also by the <orgName>church of <placeName>England</placeName></orgName> as I
		<lb/>returned from <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, the honest clerk
		<lb/>giving me away, and his daughter making

		<lb/>my good brother and sister, you have the
		<lb/>whole history of <persName>Isabella Emerson</persName>'s marri­
		<lb/>age, now <persName>Lady Isabella Raymond</persName>. All I
		<lb/>have now to add, is, that I expect prompt
		<lb/>payment of the remainder of my fortune;
		<lb/>it will support me for a little while, as the
		<lb/>most dashing officer's wife in <persName>Raymond</persName>'s
		<lb/>regiment: after that, let come what will;
		<lb/>a short life and a merry one, is my maxim;
		<lb/>and when life is no longer a scene of plea­
		<lb/>sure, but, on the contrary, replete only
		<lb/>with trouble and pecuniary difficulties, it
		<lb/>is easily laid down.</said> She then, with much

	      <lb/>morning, telling the Rector to leave the

	      <lb/>whatever house her <persName>Raymond</persName> was not al­
	      <lb/>lowed to accompany her, never would she
	      <lb/>enter again.</p>
            <p>More thunderstruck at her hasty de­
	      <lb/>mand, than at that independent manner,
	      <lb/>to which they had been long accus­
	      <lb/>tomed, the <persName>Reverend Theodore Leslie</persName>
	      <lb/>and his lady regarded each other: the for­
	      <lb/>tune, they knew, must be paid, and they
	      <lb/>had taken the fraternal freedom of borrow­
	      <lb/>ing, without asking the possessor, <measure>two or
		<lb/>three thousand pounds</measure>! What must they
	      <lb/>do? They agreed, after some little con­
	      <lb/>sultation, to see <persName>Raymond</persName>; put a good face
	      <lb/>on the matter; ascribe their anger to the
	      <lb/>haste only of the moment; give them a
	      <lb/>couple of thousands for the present, and
	      <lb/>tell them the remainder should be forth­
	      <lb/>coming in a very short time.</p>
            <p>But <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, once offended, did
	      <lb/>not so easily forgive; and, with a degree
	      <lb/>of mortifying condescension to her sister and
	      <lb/>brother-in-law, informed them, by letter,

	      <lb/>mainder, if they would order her <measure>three
		<lb/>thousand pounds</measure> immediately, and with­
	      <lb/>out again seeing them, or even mentioning
	      <lb/>husband to them, she accompanied him to
	      <lb/>join his regiment, still quartered within a
	      <lb/>few miles of <placeName>Eglantine</placeName>.</p>
            <p><persName>Major Raymond</persName>, as has been said be­
	      <lb/>fore, was young, handsome, and, <foreign xml:lang="fr">pour le
		<lb/>moment</foreign>, could be very insinuating; but his
	      <lb/>mind was weak, vain, and wavering; with
	      <lb/>an understanding too shallow to continue
	      <lb/>long the man, according to <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>'s
	      <lb/>taste, who, in a husband, certainly
	      <lb/>looked for a being superior to herself; and
	      <lb/>no one, but such a being, could make her
	      <lb/>endure a state she had always from her

		<lb/>ton</persName>, the wish to be rid entirely of the per­
	      <lb/>secutions of her friends, in regard to <persName>Sir
		<lb/>Charles Sefton</persName>, who became every day
	      <lb/>more and more odious to her, particularly
	      <lb/>since his attachment to <persName>Margaret</persName>, urged

	      <lb/>person she liked, and whom she admired
	      <lb/>for the present, for those mental qualities
	      <lb/>she thought him possessed of, but which
	      <lb/>consisted only in sentimental imitations
	      <lb/>learnt by rote, and all the acquired ac­
	      <lb/>complishments of <persName>Raymond</persName> were the mere
	      <lb/>flash of the moment, and soon worn
	      <lb/>out. Though, to answer her own purpose,
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> had encouraged <persName>Sir Charles</persName>
	      <lb/>in his designs against <persName>Margaret</persName>, yet it so
	      <lb/>shewed to her the depravity of his heart,
	      <lb/>to pursue such an intrigue, while he was
	      <lb/>on the point, as he thought, of leading
	      <lb/>herself to the altar, and argued such a want
	      <lb/>of feeling and principle, that though her
	      <lb/>own mind was far from correct, yet it
	      <lb/>was too great to ally itself to such a com­
	      <lb/>pound of fashionable licentiousness.</p>
            <p><persName>Major Raymond</persName> belonged to a regiment
	      <lb/>in which there were but very few married
	      <lb/>men; and the officers' wives were women
	      <lb/>of remarkably correct and exemplary man­
	      <lb/>ners, not very young, and by no means
	      <lb/>handsome. <persName>Major Raymond</persName> waited with

	      <lb/>ardour and impatience, when he could
	      <lb/>shew off his dashing and beautiful wife;
	      <lb/>and with a very small fortune, very little
	      <lb/>more than his military pay, and his wife's
	      <lb/><measure>three thousand pounds</measure> that he had just re­
	      <lb/>ceived from <persName>Mr. Leslie</persName>'s banker, he com­
	      <lb/>menced living at the rate of five thousand
	      <lb/>a year.</p>
            <p>He obtained on credit a most elegant
	      <lb/>barouche, and with his captivating part­
	      <lb/>ner, joined the regiment in high style, took
	      <lb/>a magnificent house and gardens, and fur­
	      <lb/>nished his side-board with massy plate, on

            <p>Nothing could exceed the splendour of

	      <lb/>beauty and her elegance; but she soon per­

	      <lb/>braced; and in a few weeks, <persName>Major Ray­
		<lb/>mond</persName> perceived, notwithstanding the play­
	      <lb/>ful variety of her attractions, that her
	      <lb/>beauty was become familiar to him, and no
	      <lb/>longer new; he shuddered at the prospect
	      <lb/>of her expence, and perceived already he
	      <lb/>had contracted enormous debts through
	      <lb/>her means, which he should never be able
	      <lb/>to pay.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, she fled to a series of
	      <lb/>dissipation of the most extravagant kind,
	      <lb/>to banish every species of thought, if pos­
	      <lb/>sible, from her mind, and which dissipa­
	      <lb/>tion was so incorrect, that it bordered on
	      <lb/>licentiousness; yet such was the fascina­
	      <lb/>tion of <emph>her</emph> manners, and such her splen­
	      <lb/>dour and expence, that she met with many
	      <lb/>who imitated her, more who censured
	      <lb/>her, and not one who could applaud a
	      <lb/>conduct which appeared to set all deco­
	      <lb/>rum, all morality and religion at defi­
	      <lb/>ance: for <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, as a wife, was in­

            <p>Leaving <persName>Major Raymond</persName> to the felicity
	      <lb/>of his wedded situation, it is time to revert
	      <lb/>to the wounded <persName>Frederic</persName>: hourly did he
	      <lb/>amend and promise again to bless the fond
	      <lb/>hopes of those by whom he was beloved,

	      <lb/>increased, so the ever uncurbed affections

	      <lb/>the unchecked ardour of his desire to be
	      <lb/>indissolubly united to such sweetness and
	      <lb/>amiability.</p>
            <p>He dreaded, however, to make known

	      <lb/>his anxious relative and friends found his

            <p><persName>Frederic</persName> intreated, with a firmness which

	      <lb/>would not conceal from him, if he thought

            <p><persName>Frederic</persName>, then turning to his uncle,

	      <lb/>his convalescence. The tremor, however,
	      <lb/>of <persName>Mary</persName>, her blushes, and the perfect state
	      <lb/>in which were the senses of his nephew,
	      <lb/>spite of the ardency of his fever, and the se­

		<lb/>loved <persName>Frederic</persName>, to life, that ye may long be
		<lb/>happily united by the sweet bonds of mu­

	      <lb/>of a father to <persName>Mary</persName>, and requested the
	      <lb/>worthy curate, <persName>Edward Marsham</persName>, to bind
	      <lb/>them in that state, which nought but death

		<corr/></choice>
	      <lb/>was now put on the finger of her daughter,
	      <lb/>who had the sad prospect before her, of
	      <lb/>being a widow on the day she was made a
	      <lb/>bride!</p>
            <p>After the arrival of the lawyer, <persName>Frederic</persName>
	      <lb/>bequeathed all his remaining fortune to his
	      <lb/>lovely wife, except a few trifling legacies
	      <lb/>to her family and his uncle: and much ex­
	      <lb/>hausted with the conflicting scenes of the
	      <lb/>day, sank back on his pillow, and giving
	      <lb/>a deep sigh, faintly exclaimed, <said>I shall
		<lb/>now die most happy!</said></p>
            <p><persName>Mary</persName> gave a shriek, and fainted in the
	      <lb/>arms of <persName>Sir Edward</persName>, who, from his own
	      <lb/>grief and agitation, was scarcely able to
	      <lb/>afford her his support. <said>Be not thus

		<lb/>alarmed,</said> said the worthy doctor, <said>he is
		<lb/>not yet gone; it is, perhaps, a crisis in his
		<lb/>disorder, which, instead of hastening his
		<lb/>demise, may, with care and the most deli­
		<lb/>cate caution, restore him to life: leave him

		<lb/>rience the least agitation of the mind and
		<lb/>spirits; if you remain here, that agitation
		<lb/>will be so violent, that I cannot answer for

            <p>Another indescribable terror had seized the
	      <lb/>mind of <persName>Mary</persName> during the performance of
	      <lb/>the solemn ceremony; nor did it entirely
	      <lb/>proceed from the mournful idea of her
	      <lb/>being only wedded to the man she loved,
	      <lb/>as he lay at the point of death; no, a fatal
	      <lb/>presage seemed to speak conviction to her
	      <lb/>sinking heart, that should it please the Al­
	      <lb/>mighty to work almost a miracle in her
	      <lb/>favour, by restoring him to life, she should
	      <lb/>never know happiness in an union with
	      <lb/><persName>Frederic Harrington</persName>. Benevolent and
	      <lb/>good as was his uncle, <persName>Sir Edward</persName>, she yet
	      <lb/>could see a reluctant pride seated on his

	      <lb/>brow as he gave her away; and though,
	      <lb/>with its awe-inspiring circumstances, the
	      <lb/>event particularly required seriousness, yet
	      <lb/>the gravity of her father's countenance was
	      <lb/>not only tinctured with the grief he must
	      <lb/>naturally feel at such a moment, but it was
	      <lb/>replete with a high degree of vexation and
	      <lb/>inquietude. Such was the marriage of the
	      <lb/>interesting <persName>Mary</persName>, and, too fatally for her
	      <lb/>future peace, was verified by her present
	      <lb/>predictions.</p>
            <p>To the great joy of <persName>Sir Edward</persName>, the dis­
	      <lb/>order of his nephew, after an alarming
	      <lb/>crisis, took a favourable turn: youth, a
	      <lb/>naturally excellent constitution, and having
	      <lb/>the first and ardent wish of his heart fully
	      <lb/>satisfied, his recovery was as rapid as it was
	      <lb/>astonishing.</p>
            <p>His youthful bride blamed her fears,
	      <lb/>imputed them only to nerves, perhaps de­
	      <lb/>bilitated by anxious watchings, and now
	      <lb/>began to think, in spite of a coolness and
	      <lb/>gravity on the part of <persName>Sir Edward</persName>, which
	      <lb/>sometimes a little disconcerted her, that no

	      <lb/>happiness on earth was equal to hers, in
	      <lb/>thus being so soon, and so unexpectedly
	      <lb/>united to the object of her first and only
	      <lb/>love. <persName>Frederic</persName>, for the present, felt rap­
	      <lb/>ture unfeigned; riches, titles, honours, all
	      <lb/>were despised, all seemed poor when he
	      <lb/>pressed his <persName>Mary</persName> to his bosom; and in
	      <lb/>those fond moments, he had no other wish
	      <lb/>than to dwell with her for ever, amongst
	      <lb/>the rural scenes of pastoral life; and he
	      <lb/><emph>then</emph> felt, that he could, without a sigh, re­
	      <lb/>sign all the gay scenes of fashion and ele­
	      <lb/>gance, to which he was once so devoted,
	      <lb/>and in which he had generally taken not
	      <lb/>only a shining, but a conspicuous part.</p>
            <p>His uncle purchased, and presented it to
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrington</persName>, an elegant cottage near
	      <lb/>her uncle's farm, till the health of <persName>Frederic</persName>
	      <lb/>should be perfectly re-established: but she
	      <lb/>could not forbear remarking, in spite of all
	      <lb/>her happiness, that <persName>Sir Edward</persName> never ex­
	      <lb/>pressed a wish, when her husband's reco­
	      <lb/>very should be complete, to see her in <placeName>Lon­

	      <lb/>took his leave, his parting with her uncle
	      <lb/>and father was cold and distant; while he
	      <lb/>formally took <emph>her</emph> hand, and just raised it
	      <lb/>to his lips; an action which appeared to
	      <lb/>her feeling mind to have more in it of
	      <lb/>politeness than cordiality.</p>
            <p>Her heart was full; the tears mounted
	      <lb/>to her eyes, but they were soon succeeded
	      <lb/>by smiles, and utterly chased away by the
	      <lb/>tender embrace of her <persName>Frederic</persName>, as he
	      <lb/>fondly wiped them off. Alas! the short
	      <lb/>hours of bliss are fleeting as the celerity of
	      <lb/>an arrow, while the chalice of sorrow,
	      <lb/>which we are often compelled to empty to
	      <lb/>the very dregs, is deep as its draught is
	      <lb/>bitter! and oh! how frequently is it re­

            <p>When <persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName> thought
	      <lb/>his nephew was lost to him for ever, how

	      <lb/>to conduct herself with that unobtruding
	      <lb/>ease which rendered her <emph>there</emph> an interest­
	      <lb/>ing and a charming guest: but then
	      <lb/>she only excited admiration as a very
	      <lb/>superior kind of girl, for one entirely
	      <lb/>brought up in the country! But what ac­
	      <lb/>complishments could she boast to entitle
	      <lb/>her to be the wife of his <persName>Frederic</persName>? <persName>Sir
		<lb/>Edward</persName> had never heard her sing; he
	      <lb/>knew not that she was possessed of a se­

	      <lb/><mcr>tambourine</mcr>; she could not draw a common

	      <lb/>mausoleums, or <rs type="properAdjective" rend="slant(italic)">Grecian</rs> statues; neither
	      <lb/>could she speak <name>French</name>, <name>Italian</name>, nor one

	      <lb/>sess one of those parts of education so requi­

	      <lb/>not needful for the wife of <persName>Frederic Har­
		<lb/>rington</persName> to know how to make his shirts;
	      <lb/>and he had not a doubt but that she would
	      <lb/>be rustic enough to let out the secret, that
	      <lb/>she knew how to <emph>spin</emph>!—shocking!—</p>
            <p>Such were the reflections of <persName>Sir Edward
		<lb/>Harrington</persName> on the marriage of his nephew;
	      <lb/>and such are the prejudices of high birth,
	      <lb/>even in the best of minds. The great and
	      <lb/>high-born are like a distinct class of beings
	      <lb/>from their inferiors; may they ever con­
	      <lb/>tinue so; for we know it is impossible that
	      <lb/>all men can be born equal; but let them
	      <lb/>not spurn at an union with exemplary merit,
	      <lb/>especially where there <emph>can</emph> be no degradation
	      <lb/>in the alliance, nor prefer the frivolous
	      <lb/>and empty accomplishments of changeful
	      <lb/>fashion, to the more solid endowments of
	      <lb/>the mind.</p>
            <p>Nothing, we believe, is more hard to era­
	      <lb/>dicate than family pride: the excellent, the
	      <lb/>worthy <persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName>, was not
	      <lb/>without an abundant share; and moving

	      <lb/>only among those of his own sphere, he was
	      <lb/>weak enough to think those accomplish­
	      <lb/>ments <emph>essential</emph> in the education of a lady,
	      <lb/>which are merely <emph>ornamental</emph>.</p>
            <p>He knew not half the natural abilities,
	      <lb/>or indeed the acquirements of his lovely
	      <lb/>niece; nor reflected how young and ductile
	      <lb/>she was, and how easily she might be taught
	      <lb/>some of those futile accomplishments on
	      <lb/>which fashion sets so high a value. At
	      <lb/>the parsonage, where she knew the well­
	      <lb/>taught and naturally intelligent <persName>Lady Isa­
		<lb/>bella Emerson</persName> made all the attainments of
	      <lb/>education seem poor, when displayed by
	      <lb/>another in her presence; <persName>Mary</persName> then,
	      <lb/>with her own natural humility, concealed
	      <lb/>the <emph>few</emph> which <emph>she</emph> possessed.</p>
            <p>She could not play, it is true, either on
	      <lb/>the <mcr>harp</mcr>, <mcr>piano-forte</mcr>, or <mcr>tambourine</mcr>; but
	      <lb/>she drew with taste, and from nature: her
	      <lb/>father had made her an excellent <rs type="properAdjective" rend="slant(italic)">French</rs>
	      <lb/>scholar, though she knew not <name>Italian</name> or

	      <lb/>conversed in <name>French</name>, that they might by
	      <lb/>practice improve each other; but as she
	      <lb/>was a proficient in the language, more
	      <lb/>gramatically by books than she shone in
	      <lb/>it by fluency of speech, this acquirement
	      <lb/>was also unknown to strangers.</p>
            <p><persName>Sir Edward Harrington</persName> had seen her
	      <lb/>at her own dwelling, in a sphere the most
	      <lb/>humble and domestic; tending the couch
	      <lb/>of his sick nephew, with all the indefati­

	      <lb/>in seeing her become his own niece!</p>
            <p>An unjust and illiberal idea shot across

	      <lb/>he revolved over many circumstances, all
	      <lb/>perverted to his falsely-conceived opinion;
	      <lb/>and he suffered himself to imbibe the

		<lb/>why your head is as thick as <emph>mush</emph>! I tell

            <p><persName>Margaret</persName> had heard enough; she rose

            <p>After that moment, which had convinced

	      <lb/>with which he had obeyed her commands
	      <lb/>she now construed into proofs of his ex­

            <p>She actually shed tears at her former cru­

	      <lb/>with more admiration than ever.</p>
            <p>Happy in the ideal possession of the
	      <lb/>heart of this hero in disguise, she again
	      <lb/>applied her solitary hours to reading, but
	      <lb/>the ghosts, the witches, the spacious cor­

            <p>In her father's library was the excellent

	      <lb/>re-instated in her heart's opinion, on firmer

            <p><persName>Mr. Marsham</persName> had gone that day, when
	      <lb/>she had heard <persName>Phelim</persName> relate the grandeur
	      <lb/>of his descent, to dine with some members
	      <lb/>of a fox-chase society, and this annual
	      <lb/>dinner generally kept him to a late hour.
	      <lb/><persName>Margaret</persName> and her father had dined <foreign xml:lang="fr">tête-à­

	      <lb/><persName>Frederic Harrington</persName> left his home, only to
	      <lb/>take a few very quiet morning airings at a
	      <lb/>gentle pace, in his post-chaise, on account
	      <lb/>of his yet unhealed wound; and he still

            <p>He was, as yet, delighted with his

	      <lb/>of life, which convinced him he could

	      <lb/>few polite accomplishments, that he might
	      <lb/>shew her off the ensuing winter in town to
	      <lb/>advantage; yet, a faint emotion of sur­
	      <lb/>prise, and almost self-reproof, sometimes,
	      <lb/>though not often, arose in his mind, to
	      <lb/>think that he should have been so very in­
	      <lb/>fatuated, as to make a girl <emph>his</emph> wife, who
	      <lb/>could not play with spirit at every genteel
	      <lb/>game at cards; could not, he was sure,
	      <lb/>delight in the charming midnight squeeze
	      <lb/>of a crowded <placeName>London</placeName> rout, nor be quite
	      <lb/>at home in the gay and splendid scenes of
	      <lb/>continual and confirmed dissipation.</p>
            <p>These symptoms of regret were very
	      <lb/>faint indeed; and, as has been remarked
	      <lb/>before, very seldom arose in his breast;
	      <lb/>but that they <emph>did</emph> arise, is certain: and
	      <lb/>when <persName>Mary</persName>, at such moments, delighted
	      <lb/>at the thoughts of learning music, has
	      <lb/>exprest that delight, and asked, when she

	      <lb/>Then his sudden return of fondness, as
	      <lb/>he regarded the varying attractions of
	      <lb/>her animated and intelligent countenance,
	      <lb/>the sweetness of her bewitching smile, and
	      <lb/>reflected on the excellency of her heart
	      <lb/>and disposition, he has quickly thought
	      <lb/>within himself, <said rend="pre()post()">Oh! such an angelic being
		<lb/>must confer honour on any situation</said>; and
	      <lb/>then impulsively catching her to his bo­

            <p><persName>Edward Marsham</persName>, as yet, perceived no

		<lb/>him so late before;</said> a loud ringing at the

		<lb/>sham</persName>! for his collar-bone was broken in
	      <lb/>two places, his arm also broken, and his
	      <lb/>body almost dashed to pieces.</p>

	      <lb/>hasty for any medical art to arrest; speech
	      <lb/>returned no more, though sense did not
	      <lb/>seem utterly fled, for he essayed to lift his
	      <lb/>unbroken arm, and his finger appeared to
	      <lb/>point, and his eye to glance towards an
	      <lb/>old <foreign xml:lang="fr">escritoire</foreign>, which stood in his bed­
	      <lb/>room, and in a few minutes after he was
	      <lb/>laid on his bed, he resigned his spirit into

            <p>Had the action of pointing to an old

	      <lb/>But wholly absorbed in the agonising scene

	      <lb/>plained to the <persName>Reverend Mr. Marsham</persName>
	      <lb/>the dreadful catastrophe. In going down

	      <lb/>had started at a cow which was grazing in
	      <lb/>a neighbouring meadow: the hill being

	      <lb/>that the horse had always been accustomed
	      <lb/>to start at black cattle, made him turn the
	      <lb/>creature round; in turning, he went too
	      <lb/>close to the side of the declivity, and fell
	      <lb/>from a perpendicular height of several
	      <lb/>feet, with the whole weight of the horse
	      <lb/>falling upon him.</p>
            <p>The gentleman who had been supping

	      <lb/>to prevent it: the horse had fled, and they

            <p><persName>Edward</persName> intreated to know to whom he
	      <lb/>was obliged for this mournful, yet friendly
	      <lb/>office; and found the gentleman was a
	      <lb/>man of immense fortune who resided chiefly
	      <lb/>in <placeName>London</placeName>, a <persName>Mr. Davenport</persName>.</p>
            <p>He was then on a visit with his lady, in
	      <lb/>the country; and this <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>
	      <lb/>was formerly a <persName>Miss Maddison</persName>, who,
	      <lb/>though some years younger than the late
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Edward Marsham</persName>, had been her
	      <lb/>most particular friend. <persName>Mr. Davenport</persName>
	      <lb/>promised to call on <persName>Edward</persName> before he
	      <lb/>quitted the country, which he expected
	      <lb/>would be very soon, and wishing him a

	      <lb/>ber of his departed brother, to weep over
	      <lb/>his shattered remains.</p>
            <p>In the morning, he recollected the <foreign xml:lang="fr">escri­

            <p>Poor <persName>Edward</persName> was left now with his <measure>sixty
		<lb/>pounds</measure> per annum, which he received for
	      <lb/>his cure, and a share of a small life-an­

            <p>He immediately dispatched a letter to

            <p><persName>Edward Marsham</persName> had yet to learn, that
	      <lb/><persName>Emily Maddison</persName>, and the dashing <persName>Mrs.
		<lb/>Davenport</persName>, were two very distinct charac­
	      <lb/>ters; she had married a man of immense
	      <lb/>riches, and a very slave to fashion. The

	      <lb/>introduced his beautiful bride in the

	      <lb/>and rooted effect, in a mind naturally
	      <lb/>weak; her unassuming character easily
	      <lb/>degenerated into a total want of proper
	      <lb/>self-opinion; and she was hurried onwards,
	      <lb/>only as the stream of fashionable customs
	      <lb/>and manners might carry her. The few
	      <lb/>virtues of her mind were quickly swal­
	      <lb/>lowed up in the vortex of dissipation; and
	      <lb/>thought at first she loved her husband,
	      <lb/>who was certainly very handsome, and two
	      <lb/>years younger than herself, yet, in less than
	      <lb/>one twelvemonth, she cared so little about
	      <lb/>him, that he became perfectly indifferent
	      <lb/>to her: while the flutterers of the day
	      <lb/>breathed soft nonsense and new compli­
	      <lb/>ments in her ear, her husband's ardour
	      <lb/>cooled towards her, and the fops of fa­
	      <lb/>shion were preferred for their continued as­
	      <lb/>siduity. <persName>Mr. Davenport</persName> soon began to feel
	      <lb/>that the highest satisfaction he derived

	      <lb/>remarks of his wife being the handsomest
	      <lb/>and best-dressed woman in the whole circle

	      <lb/>fascinating: yet the various scenes of dis­

	      <lb/>the lateness of the hours she kept, soon de­
	      <lb/>stroyed her charms, and in eight years she
	      <lb/>scarce shewed the reliques of what she <emph>had</emph>

            <p>It is true she might have been the <emph>very

	      <lb/>seventeen, though only by adoption, would

            <p xml:id="a044" corresp="#n044" rend="pre(*)">It was now some years since her hus­
	      <lb/>band and she had made the accomodating
	      <lb/>agreement between themselves, to let each
	      <lb/>other act, in every respect, as should best
	      <lb/>please them individually: they were both

            <p>But <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>, though her heart
	      <lb/>was warm by its natural generosity, had
	      <lb/>much more of the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> frigidity than
	      <lb/>the <rs type="properAdjective">Italian</rs> <foreign xml:lang="it">amoroso</foreign> in her composition.</p>
            <p>At the latter end of the ensuing week,
	      <lb/>after <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName> had paid her visit to
	      <lb/>the farm-house, <persName>Margaret</persName> was conveyed
	      <lb/>by her and her husband, in an elegant
	      <lb/>carriage and four, to their magnificent
	      <lb/>house in <name>Grosvenor-square</name>: she had seen,
	      <lb/>it is true, an high degree of taste and
	      <lb/>splendour at the parsonage, but here, all
	      <lb/>that the most refined luxury could invent,
	      <lb/>or opulence bestow, presented itself to
	      <lb/>charm her eyes and delude her warm ima­
	      <lb/>gination.</p>
            <p>She was immediately put in possession of
	      <lb/>a beautifully decorated dressing-room and
	      <lb/>bed-chamber, which, with all her native
	      <lb/>sweetness and polish of manners, <persName>Mrs.
		<lb/>Davenport</persName> desired her, while she gave her
	      <lb/>at the same time a kind embrace, to con­

	      <lb/>some mourning for her uncle, at <persName>Mrs. Da­
		<lb/>venport</persName>'s expence: she was now in a fine
	      <lb/>black cloth riding-habit, and being in
	      <lb/>sables, her dress she knew would be soon
	      <lb/>adjusted for their seven o'clock dinner, and
	      <lb/>throwing off her hat, she sat down on a
	      <lb/>superb sofa-bed, to admire all around her
	      <lb/>and feast her eyes with the beauty of that
	      <lb/>apartment, which she had been told to
	      <lb/>consider as her own.</p>
            <p>The beautifully devised little fire-screens,
	      <lb/>the emigrant bellows, and the portable
	      <lb/>book-cases, all shewed the opulence of
	      <lb/>their possessors, and the elaborate skill of
	      <lb/>the artist; they were not only tasteful
	      <lb/>trifles, they were costly; of the most ex­
	      <lb/>pensive materials, and of the choicest and
	      <lb/>most difficult to be obtained foreign wood
	      <lb/>that could be purchased.</p>
            <p>It was autumn, the weather was warm,
	      <lb/>and the half-open windows wafted with

	      <lb/>to take a frequent survey of her form and

	      <lb/>perfumes of <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> flowers, with that of
	      <lb/>the Eastern rose, she found in beautiful
	      <lb/>little bottles, in the recesses of her hand­
	      <lb/>some and modern constructed dressing-
	      <lb/>table.</p>
            <p>She took down a book or two, in order
	      <lb/>to see of what her little library consisted.
	      <lb/>The trifling productions of the day formed
	      <lb/>the chief part; among which, she found
	      <lb/>some works of <persName>Mrs. Kennedy</persName>'s, and having
	      <lb/>often perused <emph>them</emph> before, she took down
	      <lb/>various others, to see if she could find any
	      <lb/>similar to those works formerly lent her by
	      <lb/><persName>Lady Isabella Raymond</persName>; but this library
	      <lb/>consisted of a good deal of trials for modern
	      <lb/><mcr>indiscretions</mcr>, and some loose novels in the
	      <lb/><rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> language, such as <title xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">Le Sofa</title>, <title xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">Les
		<lb/>Avantures d'un jeun <name>Turc</name></title>, and a few more
	      <lb/>by the <emph>unrestrained</emph> writers which have
	      <lb/>flourished since the revolution: there were
	      <lb/>also a few <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> poems, where morality

	      <lb/>was quite unheeded, their subjects addressed
	      <lb/>only to the senses, while their language
	      <lb/>breathed a mixture of tenderness, delicacy,
	      <lb/>and sentiment, all calculated to warm the
	      <lb/>imagination, and turn the principles of
	      <lb/>virtue from their pure and genuine source.
	      <lb/>Some of these beautiful hanging shelves
	      <lb/>teemed with scandalous publications, not
	      <lb/><emph>very</emph> new; such as the <title rend="slant(italic)">Rising Sun</title>,

            <p>The clock striking six, made her start
	      <lb/>up and think of beginning her toilette for

            <p><persName>Margaret</persName> rose and curtsied to one whom

	      <lb/>and evidently much her superior in outward

	      <lb/>covering of her arms were a very handsome
	      <lb/>pair of bracelets: her dark hair was ele­
	      <lb/>gantly dressed, and fastened up with a gilt
	      <lb/>coronet comb; what little there was of her
	      <lb/>gown, was of a fine pink muslin; her cheeks
	      <lb/>were highly rouged, while her whole air
	      <lb/>had all that effrontery of a woman of high
	      <lb/>fashion, who sets the opinion of others at
	      <lb/>an independent defiance.</p>
            <p>She advanced, however, with that min­

            <p><persName>Margaret</persName> had now heard there was to
	      <lb/>be company in the evening, and she felt
	      <lb/>much surprised that there should be any
	      <lb/>gentleman that <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>, <emph>a married
		<lb/>woman</emph>, <quote rend="slant(upright)">loved very much;</quote> but, she
	      <lb/>thought, of course, it must be some near
	      <lb/>relation, some cousin, it might be; or
	      <lb/>perhaps, as she had been so particular
	      <lb/>about her dress, some odd kind of uncle,
	      <lb/>whom she was desirous of pleasing: but
	      <lb/>then again, she recollected that many of
	      <lb/>the <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> novels she had perused did not
	      <lb/>exclude lovers because a woman was mar­
	      <lb/>ried; quite the contrary; but then, O
	      <lb/>dear, <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName> was so different, she
	      <lb/>was too good, she was sure; and <persName>Mr. Da­
		<lb/>venport</persName> was too handsome for his wife to
	      <lb/>love any other man.</p>
            <p>However, there was to be company, and
	      <lb/><emph>gentlemen</emph> were expected; and <persName>Margaret</persName>
	      <lb/>was not yet judicious enough to know how
	      <lb/>to dress herself; and the elegant crape

	      <lb/>pear in at the <placeName>Argyle Rooms</placeName> or the <placeName>Pan­
		<lb/>theon</placeName>, she took out to wear on this even­
	      <lb/>ing; after having adorned her hair, which
	      <lb/>never curled well, and which was now
	      <lb/>rather deranged by her journey, with a jet
	      <lb/>diadem.</p>
            <p>She had never, since her days of infancy,
	      <lb/>worn a frock; and now she found all her
	      <lb/>efforts in vain, to dress herself without as­
	      <lb/>sistance; particularly from the breadth of
	      <lb/>her back, and a want of pliancy in her arms,
	      <lb/>which made her unable to button it. The
	      <lb/>clock struck seven, it chimed a quarter
	      <lb/>after, but she was yet no forwarder; and
	      <lb/>applying herself to the bell, she rang with
	      <lb/>all her might, but no one answered; again,
	      <lb/>and again she rang, after waiting several

	      <lb/>the bell-rope.</p>
            <p>It was half-past seven, and dinner had
	      <lb/>not yet been announced: five gentlemen

		<lb/>Davenport</persName> forgot that such a person as
	      <lb/>her dear <foreign xml:lang="fr">protegée</foreign> was in the house; while
	      <lb/>she was not handsome enough for <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Davenport</persName> to think at all about her; who,
	      <lb/>never much at his ease in the company of
	      <lb/>modest women, drawled out a few civil
	      <lb/>speeches to the lady and her daughter, who
	      <lb/>composed the female part of his guests.
	      <lb/>At length a servant came to say the dinner
	      <lb/>was served up; and an eager contention

	      <lb/>who was seated next to her, she said,

		<lb/>girl out of the country with me for a com­
		<lb/>panion, yesterday, and we arrived only here
		<lb/>this morning, from <placeName>Ingatestone</placeName>, at which

		<lb/>mediately; and if she is already engaged
		<lb/>with her, send up one of the maids to <persName>Miss

		<lb/>come down,—tell her we have half dined.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Davenport</persName> replied, turning his
	      <lb/>looks chiefly towards the company,—
	      <lb/><said>Why, really, <persName>Emily</persName>, had you brought
		<lb/>home a young lady of seventeen, any thing
		<lb/>tolerable in her person, I perhaps <emph>might</emph>
		<lb/>have thought about her; but I assure you,

		<lb/>imagine my wife was vulgar enough to be
		<lb/>jealous of me.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Mademoiselle Minette</persName>, however, has­
	      <lb/>tily buttoned <persName>Margaret</persName>'s frock, and down
	      <lb/>she went: but though <persName>Margaret</persName> looked
	      <lb/>far from well, and though mourning was
	      <lb/>by no means becoming to one, whose na­
	      <lb/>turally good skin had been discoloured into
	      <lb/>duskiness by the small-pox, yet the flurry
	      <lb/>she had experienced, had imparted a very
	      <lb/>pretty glow to her cheeks; and the depre­
	      <lb/>ciation of her person by <persName>Mr. Davenport</persName>
	      <lb/>was infinitely to her advantage, for the
	      <lb/>company was prepared to see a fright.</p>
            <p>She was not, however, embarassed by the
	      <lb/>bold <mcr>looks</mcr> of a set of fashionable men; for
	      <lb/>they regarded her with a cold indifference,
	      <lb/>and their eyes instantly reverted to the good
	      <lb/>things which were set before them.</p>
            <p>This was a <emph>friendly</emph> party: <persName>Mrs. Daven­
		<lb/>port</persName> was dressed more in a style of volup­
	      <lb/>tuous coquetry, than in any degree of
	      <lb/>splendour; but <persName>Margaret</persName>, whose sight
	      <lb/>was rather short, thought some other lady
	      <pb n="173"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="2I3r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">173</mw>
	      <lb/>had taken the head of the table, and she
	      <lb/>looked for her benefactress in vain; for
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName> had tucked up her beauti­
	      <lb/>ful light-brown hair under a wig almost
	      <lb/>black; till presently, her well-known voice
	      <lb/>made <persName>Margaret</persName> turn towards her, and she
	      <lb/>easily discovered her, by her peculiar and
	      <lb/>bewitching smile. <said>Mercy on me, child,</said>
	      <lb/>exclaimed she, <said>how you are drawn out.
		<lb/>O dear, you must not dress so, when we
		<lb/>have only a family dinner at home.</said></p>
            <p>The servants soon began to discover that
	      <lb/><persName>Miss <choice><sic>Masham</sic><corr>Marsham</corr></choice></persName> could be nothing more than
	      <lb/>an <emph>humble friend</emph>; they therefore forgot
	      <lb/>to change her plate: she had to call seve­
	      <lb/>ral times for a glass of water or porter;
	      <lb/>and not one gentleman had yet asked her
	      <lb/>to take a glass of wine, till <persName>Mrs. Daven­
		<lb/>port</persName> said to her husband, <said><persName>Henry</persName>, I hope
		<lb/>you take care of <persName>Miss Marsham</persName>!</said> He then
	      <lb/>coldly asked her, if she chose to take any
	      <lb/>wine? but calling on another lady to join
	      <lb/>them, he forgot to fill poor <persName>Margaret</persName>'s
	      <lb/>glass from the decanter which stood next

	      <lb/>him, and the cloth was removed before
	      <lb/>she had half finished her dinner, and she
	      <lb/>had the prospect before her of starving in
	      <lb/>the midst of plenty.</p>
            <p>After dinner, <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName> said, <said>Do,
		<lb/>my dear child, help me to one of those
		<lb/>apricots which stand near you: what's
		<lb/>your name? <persName>Margaret</persName>, I think, is not it?
		<lb/>It is very ugly.</said>—<said>My name, ma'am,</said>
	      <lb/>replied <persName>Margaret</persName>, <said>is <emph><persName>Margaritta</persName></emph>.</said>—
	      <lb/><said>Well, that <emph>is</emph> something rather more
		<lb/>tolerable.</said></p>
            <p>A new jargon of fashionable slang then
	      <lb/>took place, quite inexplicable to the silent
	      <lb/><persName>Margaret</persName>, with a confused kind of disser­
	      <lb/>tation on various public places, which <emph>she</emph>
	      <lb/>had never been at in her life; and various
	      <lb/>parties were proposed to the company, but
	      <lb/><emph>she</emph> was not included in the invitation.
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Benworth</persName> and her daughter sat op­
	      <lb/>posite to <persName>Margaret</persName>, and frequently spoke
	      <lb/>together in a low voice, as they looked to­
	      <lb/>wards her, which added to the unpleasant­
	      <lb/>ness of her situation.

            <p><persName>Mrs. Benworth</persName> had been a very fine wo­
	      <lb/>man, was a widow, and dearly loved the
	      <lb/>attentions, and highly estimated the adula­
	      <lb/>tion of the opposite sex, though not quite
	      <lb/>in so innocent a way as <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>;
	      <lb/>for the mind and ideas of <persName>Mrs. Benworth</persName>
	      <lb/>were coarse: though she was always ac­
	      <lb/>customed by birth and fortune, to move
	      <lb/>in the first circles, and her education hav­
	      <lb/>ing been excellent, her gross defects were
	      <lb/>only perceptible to those who had known
	      <lb/>her long.</p>
            <p><persName>Miss Benworth</persName> was a sly-looking, silent
	      <lb/>girl, and observed a most mortifying <foreign xml:lang="fr">sang
		<lb/>froid</foreign> and distance towards those who
	      <lb/>sought her notice, especially if she thought
	      <lb/>them any way her inferiors. <persName>Margaret</persName>
	      <lb/>perceiving her a young person, much about
	      <lb/>the same age with herself, and dressed neat
	      <lb/>and plain, and the materials of her dress
	      <lb/>far from costly, thought her some unas­
	      <lb/>suming girl, humble, perhaps, as herself
	      <lb/>in life; and she smiled at her when

	      <lb/>young lady immediately took off her eyes,
	      <lb/>without any change in her saturnine coun­
	      <lb/>tenance, and either applied herself to her
	      <lb/>dinner or whispered her mother.</p>
            <p>When the ladies, about nine o'clock,
	      <lb/>withdrew to the drawing-room, <persName>Mrs. Da­
		<lb/>venport</persName> was deeply engaged, apart, with
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Benworth</persName> and her daughter. <persName>Mar­
		<lb/>garet</persName> was entirely deserted, and left to her
	      <lb/>own reflections; which so reverted back
	      <lb/>to her farm at <persName>Eglantine</persName>, to her father, to
	      <lb/>her happy, happy sister, and poor <persName>Phelim
		<lb/>O'Gurphy</persName>, that with much difficulty she
	      <lb/>repressed the tears from starting to her
	      <lb/>eyes.</p>
            <p><persName>Miss Benworth</persName> at length rose, and
	      <lb/>went up to her; asked her if she could
	      <lb/>play or sing? and gave an audible <said>Oh!
		<lb/>heavens!</said> when she answered in the nega­
	      <lb/>tive.</p>
            <p><persName>Miss Benworth</persName> then addressed <persName>Mrs.

            <p>Though the countenance of the interest­

	      <lb/>from his long sojournment in the unhealthy
	      <lb/>climate of <placeName>St. Lucia</placeName>, yet now a deep crim­

	      <lb/>planted his arrows in the heart of his
	      <lb/>nephew.</p>
            <p>After this unlooked-for relative had been

	      <lb/>whom, when he presented himself, no one

	      <lb/>herself that yet better days awaited all
	      <lb/>her family than any they had heretofore
	      <lb/>experienced: she knew how dearly her
	      <lb/>father loved her; she knew how happy he
	      <lb/>would be when always in her society; and
	      <lb/>the ease and elegance in which she lived in

	      <lb/>her rural residence would ensure him
	      <lb/>many comforts which he had never known
	      <lb/>at the farm. Her sister was amply pro­
	      <lb/>vided for: she was the <foreign xml:lang="fr">protegée</foreign> of a woman,
	      <lb/>not only possessed of an immense fortune,
	      <lb/>but of a sweet temper and an excellent
	      <lb/>heart—<emph>she</emph> would <emph>never</emph>, endowed with
	      <lb/>these two <emph>last</emph> valuable gifts, forsake her;
	      <lb/>of that, this affectionate sister felt assured.
	      <lb/>It was true, she herself had experienced
	      <lb/>some change in the temper and manners of
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Harrington</persName>, but that she might na­
	      <lb/>turally expect; she was not to imagine an
	      <lb/><emph>husband</emph> would be always a <emph>lover</emph>!</p>
            <p>Thus argued the inexperienced <persName>Mary</persName>,
	      <lb/>who, though she endeavoured to be cheer­
	      <lb/>ful and contented, could not make the

	      <lb/>persuade herself that it was only the
	      <lb/>effect of her low spirits on the recent death
	      <lb/>of her uncle <persName>Ralph</persName>; oh! no,—they had
	      <lb/>been just highly elated by news from her
	      <lb/>favourite and happy <persName>uncle Charles</persName>; who

	      <lb/>cess of the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> arms at <placeName>Flushing</placeName>: and
	      <lb/>she had rejoiced at, and blessed a protect­
	      <lb/>ing Providence, that this her dear uncle
	      <lb/>was safe and unhurt, beloved and favoured
	      <lb/>by all his superior officers. Poor <persName>Mary</persName>!
	      <lb/>she banished the thought from her mind,
	      <lb/>that her <persName>Frederic</persName> was not the same as for­
	      <lb/>merly, yet it <emph>would</emph> intrude, and it <emph>would</emph>
	      <lb/>bring the little crystal trembler to her eye.</p>
            <p>She endeavoured to drive it away with
	      <lb/>the thoughts of her sister's promised hap­
	      <lb/>piness; but her sister was neither happy
	      <lb/>nor safe under <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>'s protection;
	      <lb/>who, though she took her <emph>as her own</emph>, did
	      <lb/>not mean to leave her a shilling! such an
	      <lb/>idea had never entered her head.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName> had often that much­

	      <lb/>and her mind, if mind she had any, was
	      <lb/>swayed only by the dictates of fashion, or
	      <lb/>the customs and opinions of those higher
	      <lb/>in rank than herself.

	      <lb/>her thoughts again reverted to her father,

            <p><persName>Frederic Harrington</persName> began, already, to
	      <lb/>pant for change; the fatal accident that
	      <lb/>had happened, the close mourning of his

	      <lb/>would render it quite contrary to the rules
	      <lb/>of established <emph>etiquette</emph>, for her to make
	      <lb/>her public appearance for two or three
	      <lb/>months at least: what a delightful oppor­
	      <lb/>tunity for him to take an unrestrained swing
	      <lb/>of fashionable pleasure! It is true he was
	      <lb/>in deep mourning also, but the late <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Marsham</persName> was only allied to him by mar­
	      <lb/>riage: he could very well urge that

            <p>The morning of that day, in which <persName>Mr.

	      <lb/>those of kind condolence he had received
	      <lb/>from his neighbours, and a few others of
	      <lb/>ceremony, to introduce <persName>Mr. Matthew Mar­
		<lb/>sham</persName> to their notice.</p>
            <p><persName>Lady Wringham</persName> had sent a verbal mes­

	      <lb/>offers of <distinct>sarvice</distinct> to the family.</p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Marsham</persName> therefore called at <persName>Sir

	      <lb/>at the top of the stairs, saying, <said rend="post()">Not at

	      <lb/>completely intoxicated.</p>
            <p>As he followed his master along a very

	      <lb/>of the <name>Wringhams</name>.</p>
            <p><persName>Edward</persName> knew that all lectureship, in the
	      <lb/>present state of his servant, would be not
	      <lb/>only useless, but misunderstood; he there­
	      <lb/>fore requested his son-in-law to order <emph>his</emph>
	      <lb/>servant to put him to bed, and reserved
	      <lb/>his own wise and mild exhortations till

            <p>In a few days, <persName>Mr. Harrington</persName> became
	      <lb/>extremely intimate with the late <persName>Mr. Mar­

	      <lb/>fication, than in his acquaintance with
	      <lb/>this amiable young man: how unlike the
	      <lb/>tumultuous and momentary friendship he
	      <lb/>had formed with the <name>Leslies</name>? and yet
	      <lb/>Harrington, though a virtuous esteem
	      <lb/>seemed taking firm root in his bosom for
	      <lb/>one possessed of sense, manly refinement,
	      <lb/>with excellence of heart and understand­
	      <lb/>ing; and though the wavering <persName>Frederic</persName>
	      <lb/>was in full and undisputed possession of
	      <lb/>all the warm and uncontaminated affection
	      <lb/>of a virtuous mind, enshrined in a form

            <p>His newly-acquired and much-esteemed

	      <lb/>could see at all times; so he could the wife
	      <lb/>of his fondest choice, and the reverend pa­
	      <lb/>rent whom he loved and honoured: the

	      <lb/>and wafted with it, his wishes for the
	      <lb/>pleasures of the gay world; and he lan­
	      <lb/>guished to take his accustomed round in

	      <lb/>how little prized are pure and tranquil
	      <lb/>pleasures, by the high-born and thought­

            <p><persName>Frederic Harrington</persName> took care not to
	      <lb/>say the true cause of his wishing for a
	      <lb/>change of scene; but told <persName>Mr. Matthew

	      <lb/>customed to autumnal sea-bathings, at the

	      <lb/>felt this custom had become an absolute
	      <lb/>requisite towards the preservation of his
	      <lb/>health. <persName>Matthew</persName> could urge nothing
	      <lb/>against what appeared so reasonable, and
	      <lb/>what he had always found, in the course
	      <lb/>of his profession, extremely sanative: he

            <p><persName>Mary</persName> expected that her <persName>Frederic</persName> would
	      <lb/>have been solicitous of her accompanying
	      <lb/>him; but she soon found her mistake, by
	      <lb/>his telling her he should be only absent
	      <lb/>for a very short period; and that he was

	      <lb/>leviate and shorten her hours of solitude;
	      <lb/>that, by the time he returned, she would

	      <lb/>as <persName>Mr. Harrington</persName> had fixed on <placeName>Cromer</placeName>,
	      <lb/>in <placeName>Norfolk</placeName>, for his bathing-place, she

	      <lb/>degree, a fashionable resort, yet it might
	      <lb/>be made, to those who wished it to be so,

	      <lb/>that such an extent of affliction she
	      <lb/>could never feel again: but how much
	      <lb/>more keen did she feel this separation!
	      <lb/>when she wept, for she could not help
	      <lb/>weeping on the bosom of a beloved hus­
	      <lb/>band, and saw him depart from her, not
	      <lb/>only with dry eyes, but with a visible
	      <lb/>emotion of pleasure, which he knew not
	      <lb/>how to conceal; for <persName>Frederic Harrington</persName>,
	      <lb/>with all his faults, had no dissimulation

            <p>Ashamed that her father should witness

	      <lb/>and locking herself in, gave way to the
	      <lb/>indulgence of a sorrow she at length
	      <lb/>blamed herself for, and could not help
	      <lb/>almost thinking ridiculous: she dressed
	      <lb/>herself, and assumed what cheerfulness she
	      <lb/>could at dinner, till her father drank the
	      <lb/>health of <persName>Mr. Harrington</persName>, as they were
	      <lb/>taking their dessert. He gently chid her
	      <lb/>for being so childish, as not being able to
	      <lb/>bear her husband out of her sight, whose
	      <lb/>intended stay was but for a very short

            <p><persName>Lucy Ringwood</persName>, the companion of her

	      <lb/>all the delight of emancipation, but he had
	      <lb/>not proceeded many miles before he found
	      <lb/>a void in his breast, and <persName>Mary</persName> presented
	      <lb/>herself to his fancy in all the sweet at­
	      <lb/>tractive influence of her lovely form.</p>
            <p>Every pleasant scene recalled her to his
	      <lb/>imagination, and on every one of nature's
	      <lb/>lovely views which he beheld as he passed

            <p>Just before he arrived at the inn, where

	      <lb/>take post-horses back, and request her to
	      <lb/>accompany him on his little excursion: but
	      <lb/>how ridiculous and how capricious he would

	      <lb/>it would never do!—no, he would write
	      <lb/>for her—that would be as bad: his letter
	      <lb/>would always tell against him; it would
	      <lb/>give her and her family unbounded sway
	      <lb/>over him.</p>
            <p><persName>Harrington</persName> was a man of the world;
	      <lb/>he was, indeed, in some respects the world's
	      <lb/>slave—and <persName>Mary</persName> was doomed to stay where
	      <lb/>she was.</p>
            <p>He ate for his dinner a morsel of fish,
	      <lb/>and the roast fowl went away untouched:
	      <lb/>he tossed off three or four glasses of port,
	      <lb/>and his thoughts about <persName>Mary</persName> seemed drown­
	      <lb/>ed in the last: he, therefore, leaped into
	      <lb/>the chaise, with a jocund air, and promis­
	      <lb/>ed to make himself amends at supper.</p>
            <p>He nodded in the chaise; and a dream
	      <lb/>brought his beloved <persName>Mary</persName> again by his
	      <lb/>side: he cursed his stars when he awoke,
	      <lb/>that she was not <emph>really</emph> there; and as the

	      <lb/>heath, he dropped a few tears at the idea
	      <lb/>of his <persName>Mary</persName>—left alone! He recalled her
	      <lb/>tender farewell—he execrated his own
	      <lb/>folly! while fashion, and fashion's plea­
	      <lb/>sures appeared poor indeed, when put in
	      <lb/>competition with her.</p>
            <p>But, as he stopped to supper, the re­
	      <lb/>membrance of his wife, his blissful cot­
	      <lb/>tage, his happy wedded state, vanished at
	      <lb/>one instant, and swift as the lightning's
	      <lb/>flash. Some of his former dashing com­
	      <lb/>panions were at the inn; renowned mem­
	      <lb/>bers of the whip-club, who had just been
	      <lb/>taking their dinner there; and were all
	      <lb/>getting completely forward in the service
	      <lb/>of the god of wine.</p>
            <p>They all hailed him by the title of

	      <lb/>they applauded him for his courage, in so
	      <lb/>soon breaking his fetters, though compo­
	      <lb/>sed only of the roses and myrtle of love;
	      <lb/>and added, that however charming was the

            <p>Before <persName>Frederic</persName> rose to breakfast his

	      <lb/>help contrasting the scene he had just wit­
	      <lb/>nessed, and in which he had borne a part,
	      <lb/>with the tranquil and self-approving plea­
	      <lb/>sures of his dear cottage; and he penned
	      <lb/>that first tender letter to <persName>Mary</persName>, which she
	      <lb/>received with so much delight.</p>
            <p>He arrived early the next morning at his
	      <lb/>place of destination: the beautiful and
	      <lb/>picturesque situation of <placeName>Cromer</placeName> again
	      <lb/>made him wish for <persName>Mary</persName>, to participate in
	      <lb/>the sublime kind of pleasure which it im­
	      <lb/>parted to his mind. He did not bathe that
	      <lb/>day, but returned to his inn; and in the
	      <lb/>evening dressed himself, and took a walk,
	      <lb/>at the going out of the tide, to observe
	      <lb/>with an awe-felt curiosity, if he could per­
	      <lb/>ceive any vestiges of a part of the old town
	      <lb/>and church that were overwhelmed by an
	      <pb n="8"/>

	      <lb/>of years since<anchor xml:id="a050" corresp="#n050" rend="pre(*)"/>.</p>
            <p>As he walked onwards, a very elegant
	      <lb/>female passed him, leaning on the arm of
	      <lb/>an officer; the gentleman appeared a ve­
	      <lb/>teran, had been handsome, and bore about
	      <lb/>him that evident look of gallantry which
	      <lb/>shewed he had been <foreign xml:lang="fr">un homme aux bonnes
		<lb/>fortunes</foreign> in his day.</p>
            <p>There was a dignity in his appearance
	      <lb/>which bespoke him of rank in his profes­
	      <lb/>sion, and a kind of air which thoroughly
	      <lb/>marked the man of high birth. The form
	      <lb/>of the lady was not only elegant, but was
	      <lb/>exquisitely fine: what little <persName>Frederic</persName> could
	      <lb/>see of her face, which was much hid by a
	      <lb/>lace veil, appeared young and very beau­
	      <lb/>tiful; <persName>Frederic</persName> fancied he had seen one like
	      <lb/>it, though he had now so very partial a
	      <lb/>view of that which was almost hid, as the
	      <lb/>lady passed him: however, the old town,
	      <lb/>the church, all was forgot, in this more

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">9</mw>
	      <lb/>lovely and modern piece of divine work­
	      <lb/>manship.</p>
            <p><persName>Frederic</persName> retired to his lodgings; and a
	      <lb/>sentiment beyond curiosity actuated the
	      <lb/>whole of his thoughts and ideas. The
	      <lb/>evening was sultry, he threw up the sash,
	      <lb/>and seated himself to enjoy a moonlight
	      <lb/>scene of uncommon beauty, and which,
	      <lb/>in another frame of mind, would have re­
	      <lb/>called all his forsaken pleasures of rural
	      <lb/>life; but now, not one inmate of his cot­
	      <lb/>tage shot their calm remembrance across
	      <lb/>his agitated heart.</p>
            <p>Several carriages passed by in hurried
	      <lb/>succession: he called up his landlady, and
	      <lb/>asked her what it meant? <said>They are
		<lb/>going to the assembly, sir,</said> said she;
	      <lb/><said>there is a grand ball and supper given
		<lb/>there to-night by the great general, <persName>Lord
		  <lb/>Fenwater</persName>, to the officers of a regiment,
		<lb/>who arrived here last week: I forget the
		<lb/>name of the regiment, for we have such a
		<lb/><mcr>power</mcr> of soldiers now coming, one after

		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">10</mw>
		<lb/>sure it so bewilders my poor brains that I do
		<lb/>not know the one from the other! Ah, Lord
		<lb/>help us! sir, the General is old enough, I
		<lb/>believe, to be your grandfather: but I am
		<lb/>sure he is turned fool; saving your presence,
		<lb/>sir, for speaking so of any gentleman;
		<lb/>and is fallen in love with a beautiful young
		<lb/>creature in the regiment; and it's all along
		<lb/>with <emph>she</emph>, that he gives this fine ball and
		<lb/>supper: for I heard say as how <emph>he</emph> should
		<lb/>say once, that he hated that there regiment,
		<lb/>and called them all a set of <mcr>scamps!</mcr>  I
		<lb/>think was his word; and he said the offi­
		<lb/>cers' wives were all no better than a <mcr>fusty</mcr>
		<lb/>set of old maids.</said></p>

	      <lb/>this lovely unknown. <said>Sit down, my

            <p>
              <said>Why, sir, I must say, I does not
		<lb/>know much good of him; for this lady is
		<lb/>another man's wife, and she is married to a
		<lb/>very handsome young man; and I am told, it
		<lb/>was quite a love-match on both sides: now,

            <p><persName>Harrington</persName> was soon persuaded; away
	      <lb/>they drove to the assembly-room: <persName>Frederic
		<lb/>Harrington</persName> more elegant, infinitely more
	      <lb/>pleasing and interesting than when in full
	      <lb/>health, derived new attractive powers from
	      <lb/>his suit of mourning; and in this guise he
	      <lb/>entered the ball-room.</p>
            <p>Thus interesting, thus attractive, the
	      <lb/>first object which met his eyes, increased in
	      <lb/>loveliness with every auxiliary of the most

            <p>She was seated on a sofa at the upper

	      <lb/>waving his hand towards <persName>Frederic</persName>, he said,
	      <lb/><said>Permit me, my lord, to introduce my

	      <lb/><said>I have had the honour of seeing <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Harrington</persName> before, with his worthy uncle,
		<lb/><persName>Sir Edward</persName>,</said> said the General, with visible
	      <lb/>coldness; his penetrating eye having ob­
	      <lb/>served the changes and emotion of <persName>Lady
		<lb/>Isabella</persName>'s and <persName>Harrington</persName>'s countenances.
	      <lb/><persName>Frederic</persName>, however, on the invitation of her
	      <lb/>ladyship, which was given with all the
	      <lb/><emph>nonchalance</emph> she could assume, threw him­
	      <lb/>self gracefully on the vacant seat beside

	      <lb/><said>Oh!</said> replied she, <said>he is not under so
		<lb/>dark a cloud but that I can discover
		<lb/>him.</said> This she uttered with a vain attempt
	      <lb/>to be sprightly; and the vanity of <persName>Har­
		<lb/>rington</persName> was gratified at perceiving the
	      <lb/>evident tremor of her heart, as her eyes met
	      <lb/>his: a rapidity of ideas thronged in quick
	      <lb/>succession upon her mind, and made her
	      <lb/>answers to every question that was put to
	      <lb/>her, vague, and from the purpose.</p>
            <p>Hilarity, content, self-approbation, which

		<lb/>man!</said></p>
            <p>The general had been content to the ut­

	      <lb/>dess<anchor xml:id="a051" corresp="#n051" rend="pre(*)"/>, whose superb set of brilliants, and

	      <lb/>in the morning, and for which she had

	      <lb/>smiles in the evening; she had also de­

	      <lb/>the handsome intrusive guest, but he heard
	      <lb/>her say that she would certainly go down
	      <lb/>a dance or two with him in the course of
	      <lb/>the evening: but <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>'s mind
	      <lb/>was in a state of cruel agitation; she
	      <lb/>feared, she hoped, and lamented: she knew
	      <lb/>that <persName>Frederic Harrington</persName> had married
	      <lb/><persName>Mary Marsham</persName>; but on her removal from
	      <lb/>the quarters she had first occupied with
	      <lb/>her husband, she knew not of <persName>Mr. Ralph
		<lb/>Marsham</persName>'s fatal accident: the mourning
	      <lb/>of <persName>Harrington</persName> was deep; he might, per­
	      <lb/>haps, be a widower! she had heard <persName>Mrs.
		<lb/>Harrington</persName> was thought to be consump­
	      <lb/>tive. <said>Oh! if he was a widower, then
		<lb/>was she a wretch indeed; she was married

	      <lb/>she thought that <persName>Harrington</persName> would not
	      <lb/>dance if he was so <emph>recent</emph> a widower. She
	      <lb/>therefore felt all her hatred return towards
	      <lb/><persName>Mary</persName>, and feared her superior attractions;
	      <lb/>but yet she hoped, fondly hoped, he still
	      <lb/>loved herself: and <persName>Frederic Harrington</persName>
	      <lb/>was sure, at that moment, he loved her

	      <lb/>ladyship more than any woman he had ever
	      <lb/>yet seen; he felt all that ardour of fond
	      <lb/>desire return in her presence, which is so
	      <lb/>often dignified by, and mistaken for the
	      <lb/>pure passion of love; and when she ven­
	      <lb/>tured to ask him after the health of <persName>Mrs.
		<lb/>Harrington</persName>, he stammered out that she
	      <lb/>was well, blushed and hung down his head,
	      <lb/>while he inwardly cursed his precipitate mar­
	      <lb/>riage; <said>This woman,</said> thought he, <said>this
		<lb/>resplendent beauty, who does honour to a
		<lb/>court by her appearance, might have been

            <p>About twelve o'clock <persName>Major Raymond</persName>

            <p><persName>Lady Isabella Raymond</persName>, from her pecu­
	      <lb/>niary embarrassments, had been tempted
	      <lb/>to listen to the gallant compliments, and
	      <lb/>receive the pointed attentions of <persName>Lord Fen­
		<lb/>water</persName><anchor xml:id="a052" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n052"/>; whose proverbial munificence was

	      <lb/><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> knew not a fourth part of the

            <p>Dislike to her, as well as indifference,
	      <lb/>had taken place in the Major's bosom of all

	      <lb/>partook, with a blind connivance, of all the
	      <lb/>festivities given in honour of his wife; en­
	      <lb/>couraged her in accepting the wealthy

	      <lb/>tion to a lieutenant-colonelcy, through his
	      <lb/>lordship's interest, danced, in gay vision,
	      <lb/>before his eyes. But now the torch of love
	      <lb/>was kindled again, with added fire, in the
	      <lb/>breast of her ladyship, by the fine person of
	      <lb/><persName>Frederic Harrington</persName>; the electric spark of
	      <lb/>which beamed from her eyes, and inspired
	      <lb/><persName>Frederic</persName> with mutual passion.</p>
            <p>Love gave softness and additional ani­
	      <lb/>mation to one of the most beautiful counte­

            <p>The General now saw, and left the field

	      <lb/>he meant to finish the summer at his cot­
	      <lb/>tage; whither he was going to repair im­
	      <lb/>mediately.</p>
            <p>The admonitory letter was at first scof­

	      <lb/>tation, and should he quit such a prize, in
	      <lb/>view, for the insipid caresses of a virtuous
	      <lb/>wife?</p>
            <p>Such were the impulsive thoughts of the
	      <lb/>deluded <persName>Frederic</persName>; but on cooler reflection
	      <lb/>he wrote a flattering answer to his uncle,
	      <lb/>saying, he should instantly repair home as
	      <lb/>soon as ever the physician who attended
	      <lb/>him would give him leave to quit the sea;
	      <lb/>then he would, on the wings of love, fly to
	      <lb/>his much-loved home, and dearly-revered
	      <lb/>uncle.</p>
            <p><persName>Sir Edward</persName>, at first, was the dupe of
	      <lb/>these hyperbolical expressions, but his si­
	      <lb/>lence afterwards, with his constrained let­

	      <lb/>baronet dread the worst.</p>
            <p>How delighted were the good Curate and
	      <lb/>his daughter at beholding this excellent
	      <lb/>man! who advanced, with a sweet cordi­

	      <lb/>amends for any coldness he might hitherto
	      <lb/>have shewn her; and that she should solely
	      <lb/>occupy that place in his affections so long
	      <lb/>held by his worthless nephew.</p>
            <p>One fine autumnal morning, as he was
	      <lb/>walking in the romantic and extensive
	      <lb/>garden which belonged to the cottage,
	      <lb/>he listened with enthusiastic pleasure to
	      <lb/>the most exquisite voice which had ever
	      <lb/>met his ear: the air it sung was plaintive,
	      <lb/>the peculiar harmony of it was wafted with
	      <lb/>the morning breeze to the place where he
	      <lb/>had seated himself; and <persName>Sir Edward</persName>, who
	      <lb/>was passionately fond of music, listened
	      <lb/>with that mute attention which dreaded to
	      <lb/>give way, even to his own respiration, lest
	      <lb/>it should destroy one melodious note of a
	      <lb/>songstress whose warbling seemed almost
	      <lb/>celestial.</p>
            <p>The voice seemed to proceed from a lit­
	      <lb/>tle <rs type="properAdjective">Chinese</rs> pavilion near the end of the
	      <lb/>garden; <persName>Sir Edward</persName> rose in order to direct

            <p><said>Some spirit of the air surely haunts

	      <lb/><said>my father and uncles little thought I

	      <lb/>cheek of <persName>Sir Edward</persName>, and he finished his
	      <lb/>breakfast in silence.</p>
            <p>This displeasure against his once darling
	      <lb/><persName>Frederic</persName> was by no means lessened at re­
	      <lb/>ceiving a letter from a sincere friend, a
	      <lb/>gentleman who was then at <placeName>Cromer</placeName>, and
	      <lb/>between whom and <persName>Sir Edward</persName> there had
	      <lb/>been a friendship existing from their days
	      <lb/>of infancy: this friend charged him, if
	      <lb/>possible, to withdraw his nephew immedi­
	      <lb/>ately from a scene of iniquity and destruc­
	      <lb/>tion; he informed the baronet, that he saw
	      <lb/>through all the despicable and unmanly ar­
	      <lb/>tifice of <persName>Major Raymond</persName>, with the fasci­
	      <lb/>nations and dangerous principles of <persName>Lady
		<lb/>Isabella</persName>; and that the morals and fortune
	      <lb/>of <persName>Mr. Harrington</persName> would be inevitably
	      <lb/>ruined by her baneful allurements.</p>
            <p><persName>Sir Edward</persName>, on the receipt of this af­
	      <lb/>flicting intelligence, wrote to his nephew
	      <lb/>the most kindly expostulating letter, where­
	      <lb/>in he made use of every tender and affec­
	      <lb/>tionate persuasion to induce his return to
	      <lb/>a wife, who not only loved him with vir­

	      <lb/>tuous constancy, but who did honour to
	      <lb/>his choice: he urged the obligatory neces­
	      <lb/>sity of his breaking those ignominious fet­
	      <lb/>ters by which he was now so completely
	      <lb/>and infamously bound; expatiated on the
	      <lb/>dreadful crime of indulging the illicit pas­
	      <lb/>sion with which he was inspired; but
	      <lb/>firmly promised, ere he concluded his let­
	      <lb/>ter, that not one reproachful sentence from
	      <lb/>him should reach his ear, if he would in­
	      <lb/>stantly return.</p>
            <p>This letter afforded only laughter to him
	      <lb/>and the gay partner in his guilt; and, by
	      <lb/>her advice, he wrote an answer, saying,
	      <lb/>That he was of age to act, in every respect,
	      <lb/>as he pleased; that he was quite weary of
	      <lb/>the shackles and restraints which an uncle,
	      <lb/>who could have no right to act with any
	      <lb/>authority, had so long laid upon him;
	      <lb/>that he was determined henceforth to act
	      <lb/>and think for himself: he had done every
	      <lb/>thing in his power to render his wife and
	      <lb/>her father independent and happy; and he
	      <lb/>was sure the present society of his uncle

	      <lb/>had much added to their felicity, and must
	      <lb/>make his own presence more easily dispensed
	      <lb/>with: that uncle he should certainly wel­
	      <lb/>come with the most sincere pleasure; and
	      <lb/>for that purpose he should come home as
	      <lb/>soon as it was conducive to his health, or
	      <lb/>any other reasons which might keep him
	      <lb/>where he was; but, that he never would
	      <lb/>be restricted; and he must beg to be con­
	      <lb/>sidered as totally independent in future,
	      <lb/>and at liberty, in every respect, to act as he
	      <lb/>pleased.—By the same post, <persName>Mary</persName> received
	      <lb/>a cold and distant letter from her once kind
	      <lb/>and tender <persName>Frederic</persName>. <persName>Sir Edward</persName> watched
	      <lb/>the various emotions of her interesting
	      <lb/>countenance as she read it; and <said>Oh!</said>
	      <lb/>thought he, <said>thou shalt yet triumph!</said></p>
            <p>Once he had an idea of taking the worthy
	      <lb/>Curate and his daughter, and setting off to
	      <lb/><placeName>Cromer</placeName>; <said>But alas!</said> thought he, <said>then
		<lb/>perhaps, this new-made wife, almost yet a

		<lb/>her: I will therefore occupy her thoughts,
		<lb/>and prepare her for that splendid station I
		<lb/>yet hope to see her fill—the happy and
		<lb/>honoured wife of <persName>Frederic Harrington</persName>.</said></p>
            <p>Without loss of time, and at that highly
	      <lb/>purchased and profuse expence which his
	      <lb/>large fortune enabled him to bestow on
	      <lb/>her, he sent to <placeName>London</placeName> for the most eminent
	      <lb/>masters to attend upon <persName>Mary</persName>; he was re­
	      <lb/>solved, that on her introduction into the
	      <lb/>great city next winter, she should outshine
	      <lb/>her criminal rival in the elegance of her
	      <lb/>carriage and manners, and also in those
	      <lb/>accomplishments to which he knew her di­
	      <lb/>vine voice and wonderfully quick capacity
	      <lb/>would impart a brilliancy.</p>
            <p>He told not his niece the extent of her
	      <lb/>misfortune, but gently hinted to her that
	      <lb/><persName>Frederic</persName> was a gay young man, too apt to
	      <lb/>be swayed by the contagion of modern
	      <lb/>manners: <said>Exert yourself, then, my sweet

		<lb/>heart of your husband may stray, and be
		<lb/>tempted to wander amongst them; but
		<lb/>you <emph>will</emph>, you <emph>shall</emph> regain it!</said></p>
            <p><persName>Mary</persName> started. <said>Fear nothing, my
		<lb/><persName>Mary</persName>,</said> continued he; <said>I only tell you,
		<lb/>the world you have just entered is beset
		<lb/>with danger and temptation of every kind,
		<lb/>particularly for our sex; the labyrinths of
		<lb/>fashion are unknown to you; I fear not
		<lb/>that <emph>you</emph> will lose yourself in them, but I
		<lb/>am not without some portion of anxiety on
		<lb/>my nephew's account: born and educated
		<lb/>amongst fashion's votaries, he is become
		<lb/>one of them, and loves the fickle goddess
		<lb/>too well: to you, the wife of his bosom,
		<lb/>the object of his fondest choice, belongs
		<lb/>the glorious task of his reformation. You

		<lb/>When your husband returns, receive him

	      <lb/>shadowy appearance, the inward state of
	      <lb/>his mind can be better fancied than pour­
	      <lb/>trayed: he hoped much from <persName>Mary</persName>, but
	      <lb/>he dreaded the wavering principles of his
	      <lb/>nephew, to whom he now fancied his for­
	      <lb/>mer partiality had been so great as to make
	      <lb/>him blind to his imperfections, which he,
	      <lb/>with all the self-tormenting pangs of anxi­
	      <lb/>ety, now magnified into a vicious disposi­
	      <lb/>tion: but <persName>Frederic Harrington</persName> was not na­
	      <lb/>turally wicked; he had excellent princi­
	      <lb/>ples and a feeling heart, but he had been
	      <lb/>spoilt by the incense of flattery, and the too
	      <lb/>evident admiration of the softer sex; while
	      <lb/>the gay principles of the present fashion­

	      <lb/>she easily received; her disposition had
	      <lb/>ever been such as to look always on the
	      <lb/>fairest side of life's deluding prospects; and
	      <lb/>her unwearied occupations in the day, with

	      <lb/>studying <name>Italian</name> with <persName>Sir Edward</persName>, who was
	      <lb/>a proficient in the language, and learning
	      <lb/>of him, in the evening, every fashionable
	      <lb/>game at cards, so employed her, that when

	      <lb/>but the greatest cause of his admiration of

	      <lb/>fashion, and a most delightful notoriety
	      <lb/>was attached to him who could be happy

	      <lb/>he resolved from that moment to complete

            <p>He was, indeed, as <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName> had

	      <lb/>the poisonous effects of romance-reading
	      <lb/>had not yet, notwithstanding the variety of
	      <lb/>life's usual scenes she had lately witnessed,
	      <lb/>been eradicated from her mind: and she
	      <lb/>now, without reflecting how much the
	      <lb/>members of the fashionable world unite,
	      <lb/>and are found together, thought it a most
	      <lb/>wonderful event that the first day of her
	      <lb/>arrival in <placeName>London</placeName> she should thus, so un­
	      <lb/>looked for, behold the object of her re­
	      <lb/>gard; and she felt certain that it was a
	      <lb/>sure presage of their being united: but, alas!
	      <lb/>he seemed to have forgotten her; and was
	      <lb/>the chosen favourite of a lady whom he
	      <lb/>appeared to regard with uncommon inte­
	      <lb/>rest, and to attend her with the most
	      <lb/>pointed gallantry.</p>
            <p>She caught a glance at herself in a long
	      <lb/>pier-glass; her thick figure appeared slim­
	      <lb/>mer in mourning, her face was flushed

	      <lb/>the reflection of numerous wax-lights, and
	      <lb/>she fondly imagined, that perhaps she

	      <lb/>was so much altered for the better, that
	      <lb/><persName>Sir Charles</persName> did not immediately recognise
	      <lb/>her, and she was determined, if an oppor­
	      <lb/>tunity offered, to address him first.</p>
            <p>It had not yet occurred to her, that
	      <lb/>perhaps the violent anger of disappointed
	      <lb/>love, at her refusing to elope with him
	      <lb/>from the masquerade, was the cause of his
	      <lb/>pretending not to recollect her.</p>
            <p><said>Well, I am a careless creature!</said> said
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>, with a childish lisp and
	      <lb/>giggle; <said>I forgot, <persName>Sir Charles</persName>, to intro­

	      <lb/>a kind of reproachful love-glance which
	      <lb/>the baronet pointed directly to <persName>Margaret</persName>
	      <lb/>as she concluded her artless sentence; who

	      <lb/>immediately explained, saying she had
	      <lb/>seen him at the <name>Leslies'</name>, when that family
	      <lb/>were at <placeName>Eglantine</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Love, particularly that illicit affection
	      <lb/>which goes by that name, is generally at­
	      <lb/>tended by a damsel in yellow attire, yclept
	      <lb/>Jealousy: <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName> observed some
	      <lb/>stolen glances between the baronet and
	      <lb/><persName>Margaret</persName>; she appeared, however, not to
	      <lb/>notice them, and turning to <persName>Sir Charles</persName>,
	      <lb/>said, <said>I have invited <persName>Mr. Leslie</persName> and
		<lb/><persName>Lady Caroline</persName> to a rout next week; you
		<lb/>have no objection to meet your old ac­
		<lb/>quaintance, I suppose: I have never heard
		<lb/>you even mention them; but I intended to
		<lb/>have sent you a card to-morrow.</said></p>

	      <lb/>louring; <said>I do not visit there now, but
		<lb/>we frequently meet.</said></p>
            <p>There was a constraint about <persName>Sir Charles</persName>,
	      <lb/>and a kind of mystery this evening, which
	      <lb/>did not well please <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>; and
	      <lb/>she was out of humour with him, with
	      <lb/>herself, and every one else. <persName>Sir Charles</persName>,

	      <lb/>with a desponding look, after numerous
	      <lb/>efforts to restore the lady to her usual
	      <lb/>sprightliness, uttered a pointed philippic
	      <lb/>against the cruel caprices of the fair; and
	      <lb/>darted a most reproachful look at <persName>Marga­
		<lb/>ret</persName>, which she well understood, and was
	      <lb/>now convinced she had found out the
	      <lb/>cause of his former coldness towards her.</p>
            <p>The arrival of some gay young men to
	      <lb/>supper, who were favourites of <persName>Mrs. Da­
		<lb/>venport</persName>, for that gross incense of flattery
	      <lb/>which they continually offered at the shrine
	      <lb/>of her beauty, gave <persName>Sir Charles</persName> an oppor­
	      <lb/>tunity of speaking to <persName>Margaret</persName> apart. She
	      <lb/>was so desirous of being re-instated in his
	      <lb/>good opinion, and receive again from him
	      <lb/>looks of tenderness instead of anger, that
	      <lb/>she said to him, <said>La! <persName>Sir Charles</persName>, I see
		<lb/>you are angry; but I am sure, when my
		<lb/>sister was taken so ill, I could not act
		<lb/>otherwise than I did on the night of <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Leslie</persName>'s masquerade, though I had con­
		<lb/>sented to a clandestine marriage with you.</said>
	      <lb/><said><emph>Marriage</emph>!</said> repeated the baronet; <said><emph>mar­

	      <lb/><said><persName>Lady Isabella</persName>!</said> said <persName>Margaret</persName>; <said>ah!
		<lb/>where is that dear friend of my heart?
		<lb/>that congenial soul with my own!</said> <said>I
		<lb/>do not know,</said> said the baronet; <said>we have
		<lb/>never met since her marriage; I am told
		<lb/>she is very unhappy; and point me out, if

	      <lb/><said>Yes, sir, my sister.</said>—<said>Is she?</said> con­

		<lb/>to make one woman happy long; he was

		<lb/>my beloved, my angelic <persName>Margaret</persName>, I love
		<lb/>you with that refined ardour that as­
		<lb/>sures me I shall love you for ever! and I
		<lb/>could not bear the idea of being <emph>obliged</emph>
		<lb/>to love you because a priest muttered over
		<lb/>a few vows, which vows are poor indeed, to
		<lb/>those my heart would make to the charms
		<lb/>of your mind and person!</said></p>
            <p><said>How can I write to you, my dear girl?
		<lb/>we are now observed.</said> He then turned to
	      <lb/>the company, but soon found a second op­
	      <lb/>portunity, amidst the buz of fashion, to
	      <lb/>address the credulous girl, under pretence
	      <lb/>of enquiring after some friends in the
	      <lb/>country.</p>
            <p><said>Beware,</said> said he to her, <said>of <persName>Mrs.

	      <lb/>dressing-room, and then retired to peruse
	      <lb/>her own.</p>
            <p>She found therein, that in about a fort­
	      <lb/>night her father purposed visiting town,
	      <lb/>with letters of recommendation from <persName>Sir
		<lb/>Edward Harrington</persName> to the Chancellor, re­
	      <lb/>questing his favour and patronage to a
	      <lb/>most worthy divine, and that he would
	      <lb/>bestow on him one of those valuable liv­
	      <lb/>ings which were in his immediate gift.
	      <lb/>She perceived a kind of depression of
	      <lb/>spirits ran through every line of this letter,
	      <lb/>and that he appeared by no means elevated
	      <lb/>with the fair prospects which awaited him.
	      <lb/>He wrote her word also that her <persName>uncle
		<lb/>Charles</persName> had been amongst the sick at
	      <lb/><placeName>Flushing</placeName>, but was speedily recovering, and
	      <lb/>expected shortly to arrive in <placeName>England</placeName>.
	      <lb/>She shed a few bitter tears; she dreaded
	      <lb/>the arrival of this uncle; she had acted
	      <lb/>that culpable part which she knew, if dis­

	      <lb/>covered, he would never forgive; for oh!
	      <lb/>the silly and romantic <persName>Margaret Marsham</persName>
	      <lb/>had suffered herself to be dishonoured by a
	      <lb/>treacherous and abandoned libertine!</p>
            <p>Though her betrayer had triumphed
	      <lb/>over her innocence and credulity, yet she
	      <lb/>was not an adept in art; vice was a stranger
	      <lb/>to her, and she was never likely, with all
	      <lb/>her failings, to become depraved: though
	      <lb/>her eyes were not yet open to the absurdity
	      <lb/>of the opinions she had imbibed from
	      <lb/>her dangerous readings, yet, after this, her
	      <lb/>fatal error, her sentiments became more re­
	      <lb/>fined, her way of thinking more just, and
	      <lb/>even her heart might be said to be better.
	      <lb/><persName>Sir Charles</persName> had triumphed over all her
	      <lb/>scruples, had taught her to consider her
	      <lb/>connection with him as <emph>virtuous</emph>: as yet
	      <lb/>she had perceived no change in his affec­
	      <lb/>tions; and <persName>Sir Charles</persName> had really wondered
	      <lb/>at himself that she pleased him so long:
	      <lb/>but there was a novelty in the amour;
	      <lb/>their interviews were short and stolen, and
	      <lb/>a kind of mystery attached to the intrigue

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">56</mw>
	      <lb/>which rendered it out of the common way,
	      <lb/>and gave a zest and a variety to his amorous
	      <lb/>pursuits.</p>
            <p>He told her how requisite it was, at pre­
	      <lb/>sent, from the eyes of a prying world
	      <lb/>(which he rejoiced to find was daily getting
	      <lb/>more liberal and enlightened), to conceal
	      <lb/>their present state of happiness, and confine
	      <lb/>it to their own bosoms: the consciousness
	      <lb/>of her deceitful conduct, an innate sense of
	      <lb/>the principles of female honour, which she
	      <lb/>knew she had violated, now made her heart
	      <lb/>sink with shame, and the big tear of una­
	      <lb/>vailing repentance and regret dropped from
	      <lb/>her eye.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>'s bell rang, and roused
	      <lb/>her to rally and recover her spirits; <persName>Mar­
		<lb/>garet</persName> was summoned into her presence. <said>I
		<lb/>have here a letter from your father, <persName>Mar­
		  <lb/>garitta</persName>,</said> said she; <said>in a fortnight I ex­
		<lb/>pect he will be in town.</said> <said>So he writes
		<lb/><emph>me</emph> word, madam,</said> said <persName>Margaret</persName>. <said>Well,
		<lb/>my dear,</said> said <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>, with her

		<lb/>the goodness to answer this letter for me;
		<lb/>make every apology on my part, but tell
		<lb/>him I am obliged to go out, or I would
		<lb/>certainly have done myself the honour of
		<lb/>answering it myself; but be sure you tell
		<lb/>him that I entreat, as does <persName>Mr. Davenport</persName>
		<lb/>also, that he will make our house his home
		<lb/>during his stay in town: and while you

		<lb/>and cellar can afford: I love your father,

	      <lb/>Here a sigh of regret stole also from the
	      <lb/>bosom of <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName> at the recollec­
	      <lb/>tion of <emph>her</emph> days of innocence, for which
	      <lb/>fashion, that approximate goddess of vice,
	      <lb/>had made her so little amends by the
	      <lb/>change; but hurrying reflection from her
	      <lb/>mind, as a painful intruder, she dashed off,
	      <lb/>in all the morning elegance of modern

            <p>A momentary gleam of comfort, when she
	      <lb/>saw her depart with smiles beaming upon
	      <lb/>her, quieted the mind and conscience of
	      <lb/><persName>Margaret</persName>, and she hastened to write her

	      <lb/>descended to desire <persName>Phelim</persName> to avail himself
	      <lb/>of <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>'s kind hospitality, she
	      <lb/>beheld the <emph>royal</emph> <persName>Phelim</persName> and a stout <name>Hi­

	      <lb/>both crying, or almost howling, and speak­
	      <lb/>ing together in a language she could not
	      <lb/>understand; but she was sure it was neither

            <p>This brawny son of <placeName>Erin</placeName>, whom <persName>Phelim</persName>
	      <lb/>now embraced, was coarseness and vulgarity
	      <lb/>personified; and the very sight of him had

	      <lb/>the native low breeding of <persName>Phelim</persName>, and
	      <lb/>that he was no <emph>royal</emph> or <emph>noble</emph> lover in dis­

            <p>Poor <persName>Margaret</persName> found great relief in the
	      <lb/>task <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName> had set her, of
	      <lb/>answering her father's letter which he had
	      <lb/>addressed to that lady; she would other­
	      <lb/>wise have been much at a loss for expres­
	      <lb/>sions to lengthen her own. The sun of in­
	      <lb/>nocence had set never to rise again; and
	      <lb/>her now overstrained terms of filial affec­
	      <lb/>tion, though regarded by her parent as pro­
	      <lb/>ceeding from that romantic enthusiasm
	      <lb/>she had ever evinced, were yet very different
	      <lb/>from those which formerly filled her let­
	      <lb/>ters: for heaven, when it formed the hearts
	      <lb/>of the <name>Marshams</name>, filled them with the
	      <lb/>fondest natural affections for the ties of
	      <lb/>blood and kindred, which nothing could
	      <lb/>eradicate, nor indeed obscure.</p>
            <p>But <persName>Margaret</persName> knew, in spite of all <persName>Sir
		<lb/>Charles Sefton</persName>'s sophistry, that she had
	      <lb/>acted wrong; she rejoiced when she saw
	      <lb/><persName>Phelim</persName>, half intoxicated, depart with the
	      <lb/>letters; and hastening to her dressing-

		<lb/>Charles Sefton</persName>, however, soon restored
	      <lb/>comfort to her mind, who finding out by
	      <lb/>his spies that <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>
	      <lb/>were from home, was ushered, for a gol­
	      <lb/>den bribe, by the convenient <persName>Minette</persName> into
	      <lb/>the apartment of <persName>Miss Marsham</persName>.</p>
            <p><persName>Sir Charles</persName> certainly felt some degree of
	      <lb/>tenderness for one who, though nature had
	      <lb/>been led astray by the delusions of imagina­
	      <lb/>tion, was yet a child of nature; artifice and
	      <lb/>deceit were by no means the native inhabi­
	      <lb/>tants of her breast, <emph>they</emph> were as <emph>foreign</emph>
	      <lb/>to her heart as it was repellant to them.</p>
            <p>He did not now perceive her red and
	      <lb/>swoln eyes without an emotion of pity and
	      <lb/>concern; and from his kind soothings and
	      <lb/>ardent protestations of unchanging affec­
	      <lb/>tion, he soon restored her to that state of
	      <lb/>happiness which she thought it impossible
	      <lb/>ever again to feel, after the mental anguish
	      <lb/>she had experienced in the morning. <said>Oh!</said>
	      <lb/>thought she, <said>he often told me, and he

		<lb/>to the cold restraints of formal marriage!</said></p>
            <p><persName>Sir Charles</persName> had stayed with <persName>Margaret</persName>
	      <lb/>till he heard the clock strike five; he was
	      <lb/>yet in his morning dress; and the hair of
	      <lb/><persName>Margaret</persName> was still <foreign xml:lang="fr">en papillotes</foreign>. The
	      <lb/><name>Leslies</name> were expected in the evening, and

	      <lb/>by a cold, and she reckoned much on see­

	      <lb/>hoped to hear something of <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>,
	      <lb/>her sister, whom she had ever loved, and
	      <lb/>to whose principles she had too fondly lis­

	      <lb/>fused by a kind of orange-coloured red,
	      <lb/>which imparted that shame to the speaking
	      <lb/>eyes he possessed from nature, that <persName>Mrs.

	      <lb/>revolved over with rapidity several con­
	      <lb/>curring circumstances, which served to
	      <lb/>prove to her that <persName>Sir Charles</persName> had a nymph
	      <lb/>in her house which was much dearer to
	      <lb/>him than herself, whom he had frequently
	      <lb/>styled his matchless <persName>Calypso</persName>. She, there­
	      <lb/>fore, rang the bell with violence, and or­
	      <lb/>dered a servant to let <persName>Miss Marsham</persName> be in­
	      <lb/>formed that she wanted her instantly in the

            <p><persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName> had no idea that the ba­

	      <lb/>the fashionable world enough to know that
	      <lb/>variety, in almost any form, is pleasing to

	      <lb/>her a formidable rival: she would not,

			<lb/>that plunged me into sorrow, my family

			<lb/>ral virtue.</p>
		      <p>At this æra of my life, after seven
			<lb/>years unremitting and implacable anger
			<lb/>from my sole surviving parent—a father!
			<lb/>I received, with a summons to my long­
			<lb/>forbidden home, his last blessing and for­
			<lb/>giveness: till then, after my fatal crime,
			<lb/>committed at the inexperienced and thought­
			<lb/>less age of seventeen, his doors had been
			<lb/>shut against me, and all the ardent plead­
			<lb/>ings of a tried and valued friend were in
			<lb/>vain. Oh! my son, had it not been for
			<lb/>that friend, thy mother would have never
			<lb/>lived to have brought thee forth!  Sacred,
			<lb/>pure, and heaven-descended affection, fe­

			<lb/>twines its finest tendrils with healing suc­
			<lb/>cour around the suffering and bursting
			<lb/>heart!</p>
		      <p>Such to me, when expelled a parent's
			<lb/>roof, and compelled to buffet against all
			<lb/>the horrors of indigence (for I had solemnly
			<lb/>vowed never to behold your father more),
			<lb/>was <persName>Ellen Bradbury</persName>. How often has her fine
			<lb/>form knelt before my unrelenting father,
			<lb/>how often has she clung to him, kissed his
			<lb/>feet and bedewed them with her tears; and
			<lb/>been as often spurned from him! Oh!
			<lb/>my son, the retrospect of these sorrowful
			<lb/>moments, when the generous <persName>Ellen</persName> would
			<lb/>share with me her last guinea, are too
			<lb/>painful to my recollection—I am becoming
			<lb/>incoherent—I must endeavour to preserve
			<lb/>some method in this, the last epistle I shall
			<lb/>most probably write to you; which will
			<lb/>inform you of some events you are yet ig­
			<lb/>norant of; and which, as a fond mother's
			<lb/>bequest and dying intreaty, will be of in­
			<lb/>finite importance to you.</p>

			<pb n="80"/>

			<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">80</mw>
			<lb/>teen, I was complimented, in the village
			<lb/>where I resided, for possessing much beau­
			<lb/>ty; and my father being a wealthy farmer,
			<lb/>and I his only child, it was rumoured that
			<lb/>my fortune would be large: this <emph>latter</emph>
			<lb/>consideration, more than the <emph>former</emph>, gained
			<lb/>me many suitors in a county remarkable for
			<lb/>its expence, and where fortune is always
			<lb/>sought for, as an appendage to personal
			<lb/>qualifications, however bountiful <emph rend="case(smallcaps)slant(upright)">they</emph>
			<lb/>may have been bestowed on the owner. At
			<lb/>this time, a gentleman arrived from <placeName>Lon­
			  <lb/>don</placeName>, who had recently lost his father; and
			<lb/>a valuable farm being attached to his pa­
			<lb/>trimony, he came down to <emph>my</emph> father, through
			<lb/>the recommendation of a friend, to receive
			<lb/>from him some instructions in the farming
			<lb/>business, of which he was totally igno­
			<lb/>rant.</p>
		      <p>There was nothing ever so repugnant
			<lb/>to my frank disposition as any kind of ar­
			<lb/>tifice; and there was a blunt honesty about
			<lb/>this young man, united with the character
			<lb/>of the true gentleman, which highly pleas­

			<lb/>ed me: never did I behold so much can­
			<lb/>dour in a human countenance before; and
			<lb/>indeed his whole person might then be said
			<lb/>to be very handsome.</p>
		      <p>The man of education, the innate
			<lb/>well-born gentleman, as much surpasses
			<lb/>the rich country farmer which we farmers'
			<lb/>daughters are in the habit of seeing, as a
			<lb/>finished courtier about <placeName>St. James's</placeName> does
			<lb/>an inhabitant of <placeName>Smithfield</placeName> or <placeName>Whitecha­
			  <lb/>pel</placeName>: I, who had received a boarding-school
			<lb/>education in <placeName>Queen-Square</placeName>, and passed the
			<lb/>vacations with a rich relation in <placeName>London</placeName>,
			<lb/>could but too easily, with many a degree

			<lb/><quote>their windows, the eyes,</quote> and greeted
			<lb/>each other:—alas! too soon, for my peace
			<lb/>of mind, they found they were congenial.
			<lb/>Oh! let me not dwell on these scenes, which,

			<lb/>remorse! Suffice it to say, one fatal even­

		      <p>He prepared to depart; and I really
			<lb/>think he could not support the idea of cal­
			<lb/>ling that woman his wife, who had not
			<lb/>possessed sufficient command over herself
			<lb/>to repel his persuasions: he appeared to la­
			<lb/>bour to express himself; a weight seemed
			<lb/>pressing on his heart, from which I, with
			<lb/>a bosom torn by anguish, relieved him:
			<lb/><said>We have given way, <persName>Marsham</persName>,</said> said I
			<lb/>to him, <said>to the indulgence of our mu­

			<lb/>me; <said>I know it is true that your father
			  <lb/>has higher views for you, for he has made
			  <lb/>me his confident; but I am willing instant­
			  <lb/>ly to carry you off and marry you privately,
			  <lb/>if you will risk the possibility of his for­
			  <lb/>giveness when the deed is done.</said> There
			<lb/>was a coldness in this constrained offer I
			<lb/>could not bear, and I said, <said>No, <persName>Mr.
			    <lb/>Marsham</persName>, as I never will carry deceit to
			  <lb/>the arms of any other man, so my true af­

			  <lb/>has passed between us, my dear <persName>Jane</persName>, need
			  <lb/>never be known; and the gentleman your

			  <lb/>young, and by no means disagreeable; I

			<lb/>my son, retrieve the honour of thy sex! be

		      <p>What became of your father at that
			<lb/>moment I knew not, I saw no more of
			<lb/>him; the severe agonies of my mind caused
			<lb/>me a fainting fit; and on my recovery, I
			<lb/>found myself lying on my bed, and the vil­
			<lb/>lage apothecary, the very sight of whom I
			<lb/>detested, standing by me: this man was a
			<lb/>vulgar, gossiping being, who went tattling
			<lb/>from house to house, and made himself
			<lb/>welcome at many, by retailing all the
			<lb/>scandal he could pick up.</p>
		      <p>It seems I had fainted in the parlour,
			<lb/>and that <persName>Mr. Marsham</persName> had ran out,
			<lb/>alarmed, to call assistance; I was laid on
			<lb/>my bed, restored by volatiles, and, as I kept

			<lb/>my complaint, and made myself appear as

			<lb/>upon sending for this hateful apothecary;
			<lb/>poor <persName>Ellen</persName>, whom on the discovery of my

			<lb/>then in the room alone with me. <said>Ha!

			<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">86</mw>
			<lb/>equal agitation, I turned to the doctor, say­

			  <lb/>oh! save me from the wrath of a parent;</said>
			<lb/>and taking my purse, containing <measure>ten guineas</measure>
			<lb/>and some loose silver, I put it into his
			<lb/>ready-opening hand, and said, <said>Oh! dear
			  <lb/>sir, accept this trifle from a grateful heart,
			  <lb/>and I will do much more for you, you
			  <lb/>shall not find me ungrateful.</said>—<said>Oh!
			  <lb/>no,</said> said <persName>Ellen</persName>, <said>spare but my friend, be
			  <lb/>secret, and here, dear doctor.</said> She then
			<lb/>gave him her little stock, consisting of
			<lb/>about <measure>three guineas</measure>; and as he took the
			<lb/>money, he said, <said>Do you think I would
			  <lb/>not perform a good-natured action without
			  <lb/>fee or reward? however, I will accept
			  <lb/>these proofs of your generosity, and be only
			  <lb/>your banker; you may want this, if your
			  <lb/>father is unrelenting.</said></p>
		      <p>Surely, thought I, I have been mis­
			<lb/>taken in this man; he promises to be my
			<lb/>friend, should my transgression reach the

			<lb/>instant ruin; for the first thing he did,
			<lb/>after he had quitted me, was to hasten to
			<lb/>my father and inform him of the situation
			<lb/>I was in; who no sooner heard it, than,
			<lb/>without mercy, without listening for one
			<lb/>instant to my cries and intreaties, turned
			<lb/>me immediately out of doors, without
			<lb/>money, or any other clothes than those I at
			<lb/>that wretched minute wore.</p>
		      <p>The <name>Misses Bradbury</name> were without
			<lb/>father or mother; but <persName>Ellen</persName> was under the
			<lb/>charge of a sister near eighteen years older
			<lb/>than herself: she was still a very beautiful
			<lb/>woman, and possessed much liberality of
			<lb/>mind and sentiment; but, to guard her
			<lb/>pretty young sister, she affected more rigi­
			<lb/>dity of manners than were natural to her
			<lb/>real disposition, which I have been since
			<lb/>told was always uncommonly gay and
			<lb/>lively; but she was, at that time, yet of an
			<lb/>age not to escape censure, with her very
			<lb/>fine person, had she not been uncommonly
			<lb/>prudent and rather reserved.</p>
		      <p><persName>Ellen</persName> was afraid to say much to her on
			<pb n="88"/>
			<milestone unit="sig" n="3E8v"/>
			<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">88</mw>
			<lb/>my account, as she happened then not to be
			<lb/>greatly in her sister's good graces, having
			<lb/>formed an attachment which <persName>Miss Brad­
			  <lb/>bury</persName> thought very imprudent in a girl
			<lb/>who had very little fortune of her own.</p>
		      <p>This predilection of <persName>Ellen</persName>'s was very
			<lb/>strong towards a young clergyman of the
			<lb/>name of <persName>Ringwood</persName>; who had nothing but
			<lb/>a small curacy for his support: the ardent
			<lb/>love however that he felt for the lovely
			<lb/><persName>Ellen</persName>, obscured his reason; and, without
			<lb/>reflecting on the indigence to which he
			<lb/>might reduce the object of his affections,
			<lb/>he was continually urging her to a private
			<lb/>marriage: to this <persName>Ellen</persName> would by no
			<lb/>means consent, fearful of giving offence to
			<lb/>her amiable sister, whom she tenderly
			<lb/>loved.</p>
		      <p>This sweet pattern of friendship, my
			<lb/>dear <persName>Ellen</persName>, whose small fortune was in the
			<lb/>hands of her sister till she should come of
			<lb/>age (and <persName>Miss Bradbury</persName> had been left a
			<lb/>very handsome independency by her god­
			<lb/>mother), affected to stand in want of some
			<pb n="89"/>
			<milestone unit="sig" n="3E9r"/>
			<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">89</mw>
			<lb/>trifles for the approaching winter, and bor­
			<lb/>rowed <measure>five guineas</measure> of her guardian sister;
			<lb/>these she presented me; and I took an hum­
			<lb/>ble lodging, anxiously awaiting the time of
			<lb/>my delivery, while she continually essayed,
			<lb/>but all in vain, to melt the obdurate heart of
			<lb/>my father in my favour. My generous friend
			<lb/>suffered me not to want the common <emph>neces­
			  <lb/>saries</emph> of life; but this was all she could
			<lb/>do for me; alas! I had been used to its
			<lb/><mcr>luxuries</mcr>.</p>
		      <p>In the mean time I found it impossible
			<lb/>to subsist, and pay my rent with the little
			<lb/>succour my poor friend could afford me;
			<lb/>and my inhuman landlady, observing the
			<lb/>state of my finances, told me her character
			<lb/>was dear to her, and she could have no
			<lb/>young lady's bastards brought forth, in­
			<lb/>deed, in <emph>her</emph> house! while various conjec­
			<lb/>tures sprang up in the village about the
			<lb/>father of my child, whom I was resolved to
			<lb/>conceal, and that from the tenderest con­
			<lb/>cern for his safety: not that my father was
			<lb/>a violent man, or one likely to resort to
			<pb n="90"/>
			<milestone unit="sig" n="3E9v"/>
			<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">90</mw>
			<lb/>sword or pistol, as means of vengeance:
			<lb/>he was also very infirm; but he might
			<lb/>have recourse to <emph>law</emph>: he might even
			<lb/>compel my <emph>seducer</emph>, as he would call him,
			<lb/>to marry me: horrid thought! that <persName>Mar­
			  <lb/>sham</persName>, whose love of me and my refined way
			<lb/>of thinking, wishing to be only free and
			<lb/>spontaneous, and that his mind and heart
			<lb/>should be mine, and mine alone, should be
			<lb/><emph>compelled</emph> to do me justice, by marrying
			<lb/>me! I should have been even sorry that my
			<lb/>forlorn and abandoned state had caused
			<lb/>him, from kind <emph>compassion</emph>, to have become
			<lb/>my husband; for,

			</quote>
		      </p>
		      <p>However, this vow of <persName>Ellen</persName>'s and
			<lb/>mine caused <persName>Miss Bradbury</persName> to set her face
			<lb/>against me; for it was confidently re­
			<lb/>ported that the father of my child was
			<lb/>one of the lowest labourers about my fa­
			<lb/>ther's farm; he was uncommonly handsome
			<lb/>for such a sort of man, but he was vulga­
			<lb/>rity itself: I had often remarked to several
			<pb n="91"/>
			<milestone unit="sig" n="3E10r"/>
			<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">91</mw>
			<lb/>people how handsome he was, and parti­
			<lb/>cularly to <persName>Miss Bradbury</persName>: and one night,
			<lb/>as we were unseen spectators of an harvest
			<lb/>supper amongst the labourers, this unfor­
			<lb/>tunate man was called upon to drink the
			<lb/>health of the <emph>prettiest</emph> girl in the village
			<lb/>that <emph>he</emph> knew: he immediately swore a
			<lb/>great oath, that there was not such a pretty
			<lb/>girl in the whole world as his young mis­
			<lb/>tress, and added, with all the coarseness
			<lb/>natural to such a being, <said>Ecod! I know
			  <lb/>she's as dainty a lass as ever a man would
			  <lb/>wish to kiss.</said> The apothecary and his
			<lb/>wife, with <persName>Miss Bradbury</persName>, stood next me,
			<lb/>where we were peeping at the jovial crew.
			<lb/><said>There's a conquest, <persName>Miss Matthews</persName>,</said>
			<lb/>said they; and I, like a silly girl, blushed
			<lb/>and motioned immediately to withdraw;
			<lb/>but it was more from the enraptured and
			<lb/>love-darting eyes of your father, who stood
			<lb/>on the other side of me, than from the ad­
			<lb/>miration of the clown.</p>
		      <p>The apothecary, however, during my
			<lb/>pregnancy, threw out his inuendos that
			<pb n="92"/>
			<milestone unit="sig" n="3E10v"/>
			<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">92</mw>
			<lb/>there was little doubt about the father; es­
			<lb/>pecially, by my determining to conceal
			<lb/>him. <said>No doubt,</said> <persName>Miss Bradbury</persName> said,
			<lb/><said>but I was ashamed of such a vulgar
			  <lb/>amour; she did not think my taste could
			  <lb/>have been so grovelling; and though she
			  <lb/>was very willing to grant every indulgence
			  <lb/>and forgiveness to those who went astray,
			  <lb/>yet she could not endure a woman, who
			  <lb/>had shewn herself so sensual, and made the
			  <lb/>first advances; which must have been the
			  <lb/>case indeed in the present instance.</said> My
			<lb/>father soon took care to get the poor fellow
			<lb/>pressed and sent to sea; without daring to
			<lb/>risk the knowledge of so fatal a truth, by
			<lb/>asking the unhappy wretch any questions.</p>
		      <p>How much ought my sex to take
			<lb/>warning from an error like mine! they may
			<lb/>assure themselves that the calumny which
			<lb/>attacks an imprudent female increases her
			<lb/>fault to tenfold its imagined enormity, by
			<lb/>the malevolence of that sting which her
			<lb/>own guilty conduct has provoked and
			<lb/>barbed against her.

		      <p>Poor <persName>Ellen</persName>, as a last resource, flew to

			  <lb/>indeed,</said> said my faithful <persName>Ellen</persName>, <said>he is
			  <lb/>not the father of that child which my

			  <lb/>not deny her a part of what she so gene­

			  <lb/><persName>Tom Smith</persName> is not the father of that child,

			  <lb/>the discovery might do something in recon­
			  <lb/>ciling her father to her, tell me who it is,
			  <lb/>or go out of my house this instant.</said>
			<lb/><said>Sir,</said> said she, <said>I will obey you, and
			  <lb/>leave you to the bitter reproaches of your
			  <lb/>own sordid mind: I do not know who is
			  <lb/>the father; but I know my friend so well,
			  <lb/>that I am convinced she never would sub­
			  <lb/>mit to the embraces of a low, untaught and
			  <lb/>vulgar man, one from the very dregs of so­
			  <lb/>ciety.</said> He gave an impudent laugh in
			<lb/>her face, and made use of terms that would
			<lb/>only sully my pen to transcribe. She re­
			<lb/>turned to me, with a countenance on which
			<lb/>sat despair, without the smallest illumination
			<lb/>of hope. <said>My dear <persName>Jane</persName>,</said> said she, <said>suf­
			  <lb/>fer me to tell your father this dreadful
			  <lb/>secret.</said>—<said>Oh! never,</said> replied I, <said>both
			  <lb/>my vow and yours are registered in heaven:

			  <lb/>art ignorant; and never will I endanger
			  <lb/>thee, or impair thy moderate fortune.</said>
			<lb/><said>Suffer me,</said> said the charming girl,
			<lb/><said>to write to <emph>him</emph>, and inform him of your
			  <lb/>situation.</said> I told her, that if she at­
			<lb/>tempted such a thing, she must forfeit my
			<lb/>friendship and esteem for ever: at the
			<lb/>same time, I assured her, that when the
			<lb/>time arrived that I could with certainty
			<lb/>inform him he was the father of a <emph>living</emph>
			<lb/>child, I would write to him myself and let
			<lb/>him know the event.</p>
		      <p>What now shocked me most of all
			<lb/>was, that the character of my <persName>Ellen</persName> began
			<lb/>to suffer, from her known and constant at­
			<lb/>tachment to my worthless self: even her
			<lb/><persName>Ringwood</persName> began to treat her with some
			<lb/>degree of coldness, and requested her one
			<lb/>day to break off her connection with me;
			<lb/>she answered him to the following pur­
			<lb/>pose.</p>
		      <p>
			<said>My dear <persName>Ringwood</persName>, you have fre­
			  <lb/>quently asked me to wed you privately; I
			  <lb/>have as often protested against it; you have
			  <pb n="96"/>
			  <milestone unit="sig" n="3E12v"/>
			  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">96</mw>
			  <lb/>told me that you had friends in the com­
			  <lb/>mons, willing and able to grant you a spe­
			  <lb/>cial licence whenever you applied: should
			  <lb/>I take this rash step, my amiable sister,
			  <lb/>much more frank-hearted and good-hu­
			  <lb/>moured than she outwardly appears, would
			  <lb/>forgive me, notwithstanding the invalidity
			  <lb/>of our marriage, from my being not
			  <lb/>quite of age. Now, <persName>Ringwood</persName>, I have
			  <lb/>often refused to grant you your strenuously
			  <lb/>urged request; I now, perhaps under­
			  <lb/>going the mortification of being refused,
			  <lb/>offer myself to you.</said>
		      </p>
		      <p>The enraptured lover knew not how
			<lb/>to express his grateful thanks and acquies­
			<lb/>cence:  <said>But hold,</said> said <persName>Ellen</persName>, <said>it is
			  <lb/>on one condition alone I am yours. My
			  <lb/>unfortunate friend, <persName>Miss Matthews</persName>, must
			  <lb/>become a part of our family; she must
			  <lb/>share, equally with us, our scanty fortunes,
			  <lb/>and find an asylum under the roof of our
			  <lb/>humble cottage, for herself and her babe.</said>
			<lb/><persName>Ringwood</persName> appeared embarrassed:  <said>You

			  <lb/>never will be yours.</said>—<said>Retract that

			<lb/>said he, <said>I will ever be the friend of <emph>your</emph>
			  <lb/>friend; and under our roof she shall find
			  <lb/>protection, and every comfort in my power
			  <lb/>to bestow.</said> This generous scheme, how­
			<lb/>ever, I never would consent to, as it might
			<lb/>perhaps injure the young man in his eccle­
			<lb/>siastical promotion; but I acted a decep­
			<lb/>tive part, and affected to accede to his li­
			<lb/>beral offers. During the delays always at­
			<lb/>tendant on these stolen weddings, you, my
			<lb/>beloved son, made your appearance, in a
			<lb/>wretched hovel, where a woman who had
			<lb/>formerly worked on our farm, permitted
			<lb/>me to lye in: it was there, my child, you
			<lb/>first drew your vital existence.</p>
		      <p>Had you been of my own sex, it is
			<lb/>most probable I should never have given
			<lb/>your father any intimation of your birth;
			<lb/>but I wished my son to be educated as a
			<lb/>gentleman, and to feel the protection of a
			<lb/>father. I informed him therefore, that

			<lb/>upon him myself, yet now a dearer claim
			<lb/>called upon him and his parental feelings.
			<lb/>I forbore to say any thing of my indigent
			<lb/>state; only told him, as my father would
			<lb/>never see the child or <emph>me</emph>, whom he could
			<lb/>not forgive, I requested him as a father,
			<lb/>and as a man, to attend to his education,
			<lb/>and let his boy be placed in some situation
			<lb/>which might not be a discredit either to
			<lb/>his parents or himself. He sent me a hand­
			<lb/>some remittance; requesting, as I was so
			<lb/>young a mother, you might be put out to
			<lb/>nurse: I complied with his request, and
			<lb/>repaired to my dear friend, <persName>Mrs. Ringwood</persName>,
			<lb/>who, with her worthy husband, often ac­
			<lb/>companied me in my frequent visits to
			<lb/>you.</p>
		      <p>At the age of five years old your fa­
			<lb/>ther placed you at a boarding-school, not
			<lb/>many miles from where I resided; whither
			<lb/>he frequently went down to see you, and

			  <lb/>farther from you; for I have been informed
			  <lb/>that <persName>Mr. Marsham</persName>, when he is arrived at
			  <lb/>a proper age, means to send him to a public

		      <p>Ah! my son, when you had entered
			<lb/>your eighth year, your father sent you to a
			<lb/>respectable academy near <placeName>London</placeName>, and for
			<lb/>some years I saw you no more! Eventful
			<lb/>epocha of my life! your grandfather then
			<lb/>lay on the bed of death; he sent for me,
			<lb/>embraced me, and gave me entire forgive­
			<lb/>ness.</p>
		      <p>On opening his will, I found myself
			<lb/>the sole heiress to his immense wealth,
			<lb/>with a fortune in the hands of an eminent
			<lb/>banker amounting to <measure>twenty thousand
			  <lb/>pounds</measure>; but thus restricted, that by no
			<lb/>means should I leave you one shilling of it,

			<lb/>until you attained your twenty-fourth year:
			<lb/>that day, that I obtained my parents' for­
			<lb/>giveness, was my birth-day: I just became
			<lb/>that age; the lawyer sat by his bedside,
			<lb/>penning the will; and he said to me, in a
			<lb/>low voice, <said><persName>Miss Matthews</persName>, it is well
			  <lb/>known, that illegitimate children have no
			  <lb/>right to any name but that of their mother:
			  <lb/>your father is not well pleased, that though
			  <lb/>you have had the modesty not to call your
			  <lb/>son by your own name, yet that you should
			  <lb/>think of giving him one of a long-valued
			  <lb/>friend: cannot you change it, and adopt
			  <lb/>some other?</said> My heart rose to my lips, I
			<lb/>was about to break my vow, and tell them
			<lb/>of your father; but then, joy at the assu­
			<lb/>rance that my parent had no suspicion of
			<lb/>my <persName>Marsham</persName>; terror, lest violent anger
			<lb/>on the discovery might not only injure
			<lb/>him on his bed of death, but also him I
			<lb/>could never cease to love, and his still more
			<lb/>dearly beloved offspring, made me check
			<lb/>myself; and as your father had desired you
			<lb/>might bear his name, I said, <said>Sir, the
			  <pb n="101"/>
			  <milestone unit="sig" n="3F3r"/>
			  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">101</mw>
			  <lb/>name pleased me: old <persName>Mr. Marsham</persName> was
			  <lb/>my godfather; I esteem the character of
			  <lb/>his family though unknown to me, and I do
			  <lb/>them no injury by adopting a name which
			  <lb/>is common in <placeName>England</placeName>; nor can I think of
			  <lb/>changing it, as my son has been known by
			  <lb/>it for seven years.</said> He said no more, but
			<lb/>continued his writing.</p>
		      <p>In this will, I found I was strictly for­
			<lb/>bade to marry your father, whoever he
			<lb/>might be: this filled my eyes with tears of
			<lb/>anguish and indignation, because it con­
			<lb/>vinced me that my father had died in full
			<lb/>belief that you was the child of <persName>Thomas
			  <lb/>Smith</persName>. Beware, my son, oh! beware of
			<lb/>making rash vows; they argue a temerity
			<lb/>in us wretched children of the dust, which
			<lb/>mars the plan of our creation; poor, help­
			<lb/>less, dependent beings in that great scale;
			<lb/>unable of ourselves, to say what shall be
			<lb/>the event of the next moment.</p>
		      <p>Without hesitation, I gave the house,
			<lb/>the farm, and all its lands, to my dear
			<lb/>respected friends, the <name>Ringwoods</name>; with
			<pb n="102"/>

			<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">102</mw>
			<lb/>liberty, at their deaths, to bequeathe them
			<lb/>to whomsoever they might please to make
			<lb/>their heirs. I only requested in return,
			<lb/>that <persName>Ellen</persName> would write to your father, that
			<lb/>I was no more; and you was told the same,
			<lb/>until I should be able to entrust you with
			<lb/>the secret.</p>
		      <p>The health of my dear <persName>Mrs. Ring­
			  <lb/>wood</persName> had been sadly declining since the
			<lb/>birth of her little girl: she is four years
			<lb/>younger than yourself; from an infant,
			<lb/>she promised to be a pattern of female love­
			<lb/>liness, and was the perfect resemblance of
			<lb/>her angelic mother.</p>
		      <p>I was informed your father bore the
			<lb/>news of my death not without being ten­
			<lb/>derly affected for me, but with that resig­
			<lb/>nation and philosophy which shewed his
			<lb/>love towards me had never equalled mine
			<lb/>for him: no, it was rather the fugitive
			<lb/>impression made on a man possessing all
			<lb/>the ardour of youth, by a young creature in
			<lb/>her first bloom, and whose person had the
			<lb/>universal reputation of being beautiful.

		      <p>But how delightfully was I compen­
			<lb/>sated, in hearing the deep affliction which
			<lb/>my supposed death gave to your yet infan­
			<lb/>tine mind!</p>
		      <p>At the time you was about nine years
			<lb/>old, I lost my inestimable <persName>Ellen</persName>; and her
			<lb/>husband, whose love for her increased, as
			<lb/>each day passed over their heads, expired
			<lb/>in less than a twelvemonth after, leaving
			<lb/>their only daughter solely dependent on
			<lb/><persName>Miss Bradbury</persName>, to whom they bequeathed
			<lb/>all that I had given them. <persName>Miss Brad­
			  <lb/>bury</persName> adopted the Mrs. to her maiden name,
			<lb/>and with her niece removed into <placeName>Essex</placeName>.
			<lb/>I had at this time retired into <placeName>Devonshire</placeName>,
			<lb/>where I passed, under a feigned name, for a
			<lb/>widow; and no one but my banker, in
			<lb/>whose hands I placed my fortune, knew
			<lb/>that <persName>Jane Matthews</persName> was yet living: you
			<lb/>recollect this worthy man accompanying
			<lb/>me, when with sweet filial fondness you
			<lb/>witnessed, with overflowing joy, my resus­
			<lb/>citation; you was then an apprentice, at
			<lb/>the age of fourteen.

		      <p>Finding my health gradually decay­
			<lb/>ing, and the approach of death sensibly
			<lb/>near, I made my will; I learned, with
			<lb/>much satisfaction, your father's intention
			<lb/>of providing for you by a genteel profes­

			<lb/>independent of it.</p>
		      <p>As you will, no doubt, receive also
			<lb/>some other advantages from a father, who
			<lb/>evinces much affection for you, I have be­
			<lb/>queathed, in my will, <measure>ten thousand pounds</measure>
			<lb/>of the twenty yet in my banker's hands, to
			<lb/><persName>Lucy Ringwood</persName>, the daughter of the first
			<lb/>among female friends, and a worthy divine,

			<lb/>you will find explained and enlarged upon
			<lb/>in my last will and testament, now in the

			  <lb/>ham</placeName>, where you was born, in the <name>parish of
			  <lb/>St. John's</name>, county of <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>. I am told
			<lb/>that <persName>Lucy Ringwood</persName> promises to possess

			<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">105</mw>
			<lb/>lovely mother. Let me warn you, my be­
			<lb/>loved <persName>Matthew</persName>, against the easy lapse of
			<lb/>the heart, in the season of youth: reflect,
			<lb/>that you can never espouse <persName>Lucy Ring­
			  <lb/>wood</persName>, after my bequest to her, without an
			<lb/>appearance of that sordid interest which
			<lb/>would desire to obtain the <emph>whole</emph> of your
			<lb/>mother's property: I look upon you both
			<lb/>as my children; love her like a kind bro­
			<lb/>ther no more. I have equally divided
			<lb/>my fortune between ye; but it must be <emph>se­
			  <lb/>perately</emph>, or it is no longer gratitude on
			<lb/>my part towards her valued mother, who
			<lb/>succoured me when I had not a shilling.
			<lb/>Oh! no, if <persName>Lucy Ringwood</persName> and you were
			<lb/>united in marriage, it would be only a de­
			<lb/>sire for it to descend to my children's
			<lb/>children. Beware! ah! beware of her at­
			<lb/>tractions; shew yourself uninterested, in
			<lb/>every respect, when you present her, from
			<lb/>me, with an independent fortune.</p>
		      <p>An humble green turf will cover the

			<lb/>erected over your grandfather: kneeling on

			<lb/>(and your mother's spirit will rest in peace,)
			<lb/>and no admiration of <persName>Lucy Ringwood</persName>'s
			<lb/>person may tempt you to express a wish,
			<lb/>that she should bestow herself (for with
			<lb/>herself her fortune must be bestowed) on
			<lb/>you. Yet, ah! take warning by your un­
			<lb/>happy mother, and make no solemn vow!
			<lb/>promise only to obey her to the utmost of
			<lb/>your power: all vows are rash; for when
			<lb/>made, they must be strictly kept; for oh!
			<lb/>what sin can exceed that of perjury. <quote>We

			<lb/>implants in our bosoms; and that your
			<lb/>father, in spite of all the calumny that as­

			<lb/>sorrow, was in once hearing that your fa­

			  <lb/>never knew a mind so great as mine; that
			  <lb/>I might <emph>once</emph> err; but that my soul was too
			  <lb/>naturally virtuous, ever to repeat my er­
			  <lb/>ror.</said> I hope he was not deceived in me;
			<lb/>but oh! when he thought me thus excel­
			<lb/>lent, why not joyfully pass his life in ho­
			<lb/>nourable marriage with such a woman?</p>
		      <p>Yet this, his <emph>last</emph> expression concerning
			<lb/>me which ever reached my ears, gives
			<lb/>comfort to the last hours of my life, and I
			<lb/>die most happy! Visit then the grave of
			<lb/>your mother, and think of her last request!
			<lb/>She releases you from the promise, but
			<lb/>think, oh think! of her dying wishes; oh!
			<lb/>my son, they centre all in thy happiness and
			<lb/>honour. May thy fair tree of manhood be
			<lb/>rich in those fruits of integrity, humanity
			<lb/>and goodness, for which the blossoms of

			<lb/>but be ever cautious of carrying misery and
			<lb/>regret into a family, by the indulgence of
			<lb/>inclination, or the too easy yieldings of fe­
			<lb/>male youth and inexperience: be assured,
			<lb/>in the circles of life in which I have moved,
			<lb/>and in those which you will most probably
			<lb/>fill, man is the first aggressor, and on that
			<lb/>superior sex much depends the morality of
			<lb/>every class of life.</p>
		      <p>The hand that writes this will have

            <p>When <persName>Matthew</persName> came to take possession

            <p><persName>Mrs. Susan</persName> put on her spectacles and

	      <lb/>of the Major; it appeared rather to hint a

            <p>The heart of <persName>Edward</persName> was now in such

	      <lb/>over the fatal newspapers, he gave way to

            <p>She had seated herself, with a pallid

	      <lb/>always embellished her cheek and lip, now
	      <lb/>only encircled her eyes; in vain she en­
	      <lb/>deavoured to eat, and appear tranquil; in
	      <lb/>vain she pressed her father to eat likewise;
	      <lb/>his appetite, like hers, was fled, and the
	      <lb/>dinner went away almost untouched.</p>
            <p>When the servants were withdrawn, the
	      <lb/>bursting sorrow again found its way from
	      <lb/>the sweet eyes of <persName>Mary</persName>: her father drew

		<lb/>that a great and entire reformation will be
		<lb/>worked in his conduct, even by this atro­
		<lb/>cious error, and that you and your virtues
		<lb/>will become dearer to him than ever. A

		<lb/>that of guilt, giving way to the indulgence
		<lb/>of passion, is never esteemed by a man
		<lb/>after the enthusiasm of desire is grown lan­

		<lb/>I, certainly, as well as yourself, would not

		<lb/>distress, as he has been the <emph>primary</emph> cause

	      <lb/>sits, while the surly porter as oft uncivilly
	      <lb/>told her his master was not at home; and

	      <lb/>the window, <said>Aye, child,</said> said the porter,
	      <lb/><said>but he does not choose to be at home to
		<lb/>you; and this is no time; his ladies always
		<lb/>come of an evening: not that I think,</said>
	      <lb/>added he, looking in her face and inso­
	      <lb/>lently laughing, <said>that he will see <emph>you</emph>!
		<lb/>however, if you have a mind to come to­
		<lb/>morrow night, I believe he will be at

            <p>Somewhat comforted to hear that there
	      <lb/>was a prospect of her seeing him on the
	      <lb/>morrow, she went home; she knew <persName>Mrs.
		<lb/>Davenport</persName> was going to the theatre in the
	      <lb/>evening of the morrow, and that she should
	      <lb/>be left alone; for she now never went with
	      <lb/>her in public. The poor girl's spirits were
	      <lb/>this day better, being rather elevated by
	      <lb/>hope; but the behaviour of <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs.
		<lb/>Davenport</persName> to her was not only rude and
	      <lb/>uncivil, but cutting in the extreme: the

		<lb/>try girl; besides, he always, I am told,
		<lb/>loved <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>; and no doubt she is
		<lb/>far superior to <persName>Mrs. Harrington</persName>, though
		<lb/>they say she is a nice little creature:—by

		<lb/>courteous! Come, <persName>Margaritta</persName>, tell us,</said>

	      <lb/>continued he, as he helped her to a glass

	      <lb/><said>Oh! sir, <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, certainly.</said>
	      <lb/>But the heart of <persName>Margaret</persName> was full; it
	      <lb/>rose to her throat, and almost choked her
	      <lb/>utterance: she reflected on her sister's mis­
	      <lb/>fortune, and how cruelly the infidelity of
	      <lb/><persName>Harrington</persName> must have operated on a mind
	      <lb/>like hers; and, bringing her thoughts home

            <p><said>Lord bless me, child!</said> said <persName>Mrs.

		<lb/>these things are nothing in fashionable life;

            <p><persName>Margaret</persName> trembled, lest her father
	      <lb/>might chance to be one of them, and has­
	      <lb/>tily withdrew to perform the orders of <persName>Mrs.

	      <lb/>tily at some new sallies of her husband's
	      <lb/>wit upon <persName>Mrs. Harrington</persName>, the deserted
	      <lb/>bride, whom he swore he would go and
	      <lb/>comfort, promising himself certain suc­
	      <lb/>cess: but sitting about a quarter of an hour
	      <lb/>longer with his wife, to whom he was un­
	      <lb/>commonly polite and attentive, he repaired
	      <lb/>to pass the evening with his favourite <name>Sul­
		<lb/>tana</name>, while his lady entertained at home

	      <lb/>mained like a cypher, unnoticed, except
	      <lb/>by the whisper of <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName> to one
	      <lb/>or two of her particular friends, and the
	      <lb/>shrugs and sneers of the gentlemen.</p>
            <p>At length the eventful evening arrived,
	      <lb/>and <persName>Margaret</persName>, after <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName> had
	      <lb/>driven to the theatre, stole softly down
	      <lb/>stairs, and with a beating heart and trem­
	      <lb/>bling feet, escaped into the street.</p>
            <p>It was dark; she was young and well
	      <lb/>dressed; her bonnet and pelisse made in
	      <lb/>the highest style of fashion: she had never
	      <lb/>been in the street alone, before, in the
	      <lb/>evening; she was accosted by many smart­
	      <lb/>looking young men; she thought that surely
	      <lb/>she had captivated them by her appearance,
	      <lb/>and she hoped the most delightful success,
	      <lb/>from the self-conviction of her personal
	      <lb/>charms, which must have been so striking
	      <lb/>on that evening, when, in walking from
	      <lb/><placeName>Grosvenor Square</placeName> to <placeName>St. James's Street</placeName>, she
	      <lb/>had been called <said>pretty girl,</said> <said>sweet little
		<lb/>dear,</said> and earnestly requested by several
	      <lb/>dashing looking men, as she thought them,
	      <lb/>the permission of escorting her home:

	      <lb/>these <emph>dashers</emph> were, however, chiefly men­
	      <lb/>milliners, tavern-waiters, servants out of
	      <lb/>livery, and markers at the gambling-tables,
	      <lb/>and who were either going to their several
	      <lb/>avocations, or taking a lounge after their
	      <lb/>dinners, and affecting the fine gentlemen.</p>
            <p>She arrived at <persName>Sir Charles Sefton</persName>'s door,
	      <lb/>and knocked at it with all the buoyant
	      <lb/>spirit she just then felt. <said>Ah! what, is
		<lb/>it you, my dear?</said> said the porter. <said>Pray,
		<lb/>who are you speaking to?</said> said she, of­
	      <lb/>fended at his familiarity. <said>I'll be d----d
		<lb/>if I know,</said> said he, holding the door half
	      <lb/>open; <said>but <persName>Sir Charles</persName> is not at home.</said>
	      <lb/><said>You told me he would be,</said> said <persName>Mar­
		<lb/>garet</persName>. <said>So I believe he will,</said> said the
	      <lb/>porter, stretching himself, and yawning,
	      <lb/><said>when the play is over; he has ordered
		<lb/>supper at home.</said>—<said>Then cannot I sit
		<lb/>down in one of the apartments, and await
		<lb/>his return? <persName>Sir Charles</persName> knows me very
		<lb/>well, and I am sure he will be glad to see
		<lb/>me.</said>—<said>Oh! like enough,</said> said the
	      <lb/>porter, <said>my master knows a great many
		<lb/>young ladies; but as <emph>you</emph> are quite <emph>un-</emph>

		<lb/>known to <emph>me</emph>, having never been admitted
		<lb/>here, I can't let you in.</said> So saying, he
	      <lb/>slammed the door in her face. Poor <persName>Mar­
		<lb/>garet</persName> burst into tears; but resolving to see
	      <lb/><persName>Sir Charles</persName> that night, even if she should
	      <lb/>never again be admitted within <persName>Mrs. Da­
		<lb/>venport</persName>'s doors, she determined on staying
	      <lb/>till the performance at the theatre was
	      <lb/>ended.</p>

	      <lb/>than by walking with the appearance of un­

	      <lb/>bustle of urgent business.</p>
            <p>The moon now began to rise in full splen­
	      <lb/>dour, and, added to the lamps and the
	      <lb/>bright passages of the gaming and coffee­
	      <lb/>houses, imparted a brilliant illumination
	      <lb/>to the street. An hackney-coach stopped
	      <lb/>at a shop opposite to where <persName>Margaret</persName> was
	      <lb/>standing; she crossed over, though from
	      <lb/>what motive she knew not, except to give
	      <lb/>some kind of variation to her nightly walk.
	      <lb/>A gentleman got out, and handed out a
	      <lb/>lady, who was closely wrapped in a dark
	      <lb/>coloured shawl, and who wore a large bon­
	      <lb/>net which entirely concealed her face.
	      <lb/>The gentleman attempted to follow her
	      <lb/>into the house, but she said, <said>No, no—
		<lb/>we never meet again, except on <emph rend="case(smallcaps)slant(upright)">one</emph> con­

		<lb/>dition.</said> He bowed with solemnity, and
	      <lb/>reascended the carriage. The lady entered
	      <lb/>the house, after waving her hand to the
	      <lb/>servant to take away the light, and the
	      <lb/>door suddenly closed with a kind of cau­
	      <lb/>tion. The gentleman was wrapped in a
	      <lb/>curricle-coat, the cape buttoned over his
	      <lb/>cheeks, while a slouch hat hid the upper
	      <lb/>part of his face. Of the gentleman or lady
	      <lb/><persName>Margaret</persName> had not the slightest recollection;
	      <lb/>but the lady seemed to interest her, and she
	      <lb/>was almost certain she had heard her voice
	      <lb/>before; she felt herself unable to move
	      <lb/>from the door after it was shut; she watch­
	      <lb/>ed its re-opening, she looked up at the
	      <lb/>windows, but all were close shut; and a
	      <lb/>still silence seemed to prevail about the
	      <lb/>house.</p>
            <p>The rattle of carriages from various di­
	      <lb/>rections now announced the close of the
	      <lb/>theatrical entertainment; and seeing <persName>Sir

	      <lb/>riages, and arrived time enough to see him
	      <lb/>hand out a lady richly dressed, while ano­
	      <lb/>ther carriage stopped, from which descend­
	      <lb/>ed two more ladies and two gentlemen, all
	      <lb/>apparently of the first fashion. She wait­
	      <lb/>ed the departure of the carriages, and then
	      <lb/>again presented herself before the <name>Cerberus</name>
	      <lb/>of the hall.</p>
            <p><said>Why it is impossible you can see <persName>Sir

		<lb/>wishes only to speak <emph>one</emph> word with him.</said>
	      <lb/><said>Oh! that is not my office,</said> replied he;

	      <lb/>made him relent, though he shrugged

	      <lb/>he had brought down an answer.</p>

	      <lb/>should be able to speak to his master, he
	      <lb/>was so engaged; but she had better walk
	      <lb/>into that room, shewing her a little dark
	      <lb/>side-parlour, in which was no fire, and
	      <lb/>where he left her with one solitary bit of
	      <lb/>candle, which soon began to glimmer in
	      <lb/>the socket; and the wretched girl sat shi­
	      <lb/>vering with cold, and without even the
	      <lb/>comfort of light: she heard the watchman
	      <lb/>cry the hour of half-past one, and a star­
	      <lb/>light morning. To return to <persName>Mr. Daven­
		<lb/>port</persName>'s she now found would be impracti­
	      <lb/>cable, and she trembled at the result. Pre­
	      <lb/>sently she heard the door softly open.</p>
            <p>Not being able to distinguish objects
	      <lb/>from the shutters being closed, the fond
	      <lb/>idea rushed upon her mind that it was her
	      <lb/>dear <persName>Sir Charles</persName>; but she was soon unde­
	      <lb/>ceived by the footman saying, <said>What,
		<lb/>are you in the dark, miss? I have at
		<lb/>last, with much difficulty, spoken to <persName>Sir
		  <lb/>Charles</persName>; he says it is totally impossible for
		<lb/>him to see you now, but, if you like, you

            <p><persName>Margaret</persName> still leant on the hope of see­
	      <lb/>ing her perfidious lover in the morning,
	      <lb/>and strolled to the Park, determined there
	      <lb/>to pass the night: the sentries hailed her,

		<lb/>comes there?</said> She knew not how to reply,
	      <lb/>and they suffered her to pass on in silence,
	      <lb/>as they deemed it might not be impossible
	      <lb/>but that she had an appointment with the

	      <lb/>military hero in rank, to pass the night
	      <lb/>with him, <foreign xml:lang="la">sub rosa</foreign>.</p>
            <p>She crossed the Park, and the moon re­

	      <lb/>in the most refined part of this scenic pro­

	      <lb/>served, instead of raising her spirits, to

		<lb/>with his two aunts, last night: why, la,

            <p>The woman, seeing her ready to faint,

	      <lb/>something like compassion, she told her,
	      <lb/>as she opened the half-closed entrance a
	      <lb/>little wider, to follow her down into her
	      <lb/>own room; where she gave her a bit of
	      <lb/>toast that was left frying on a plate before
	      <lb/>the fire, and a cup of half-cold tea, which
	      <lb/>she stirred for her, and then put the silver
	      <lb/>tea-spoon out of her reach: this temporary
	      <lb/>refreshment somewhat revived poor <persName>Mar­

	      <lb/>she took her leave of the unfeeling house­

            <p>As she came nearly opposite to the shop

	      <lb/>put a sealed note in her hand, and begged she
	      <lb/>would be pleased to read it: it was writ­
	      <lb/>ten in a hand evidently disguised, and con­
	      <lb/>tained the following words:</p>
            <said>
              <p>If, as I am almost assured, you are

	      <lb/>as the magnificent well-lighted hall and
	      <lb/>spacious staircases gleamed on his sight,
	      <lb/>evincing opulence and grandeur, he re­
	      <lb/>joiced in seeing the lovely friend of his
	      <lb/>late wife so splendidly established in life;
	      <lb/>yet a sigh escaped his bosom, when, in the
	      <lb/>elegant and often envied situation to which
	      <lb/>his <persName>Mary</persName> had been raised, she had expe­
	      <lb/>rienced but little comfort in such glitter­

	      <lb/>have died at the idea of again experiencing
	      <lb/>that state of quiet and genteel mediocrity
	      <lb/>enjoyed by <persName>Emily Maddison</persName>.</p>
            <p><persName>Edward</persName> was not sorry to hear that his
	      <lb/>daughter was at home alone; for, with a
	      <lb/>father's tender affection, he loved his poor
	      <lb/><persName>Margaret</persName> with all her foibles; and he
	      <lb/>hoped her residence in town had taken off,
	      <lb/>in some degree, the romantic enthusiasm
	      <lb/>of her ideas: and, as he had frequently
	      <lb/>been told that her person and man­
	      <lb/>ners were much improved, he flattered him­
	      <lb/>self he should really find her more reason­
	      <lb/>able, and that he should have the satisfac­
	      <lb/>tion of enjoying with her an hour or two
	      <lb/>of social and rational conversation.</p>
            <p>After waiting a considerable time in the

	      <lb/>that <persName>Miss Marsham</persName> could no where be

	      <lb/>sided over their toilettes: the other ser­
	      <lb/>vants said they were almost sure she did
	      <lb/>not go with their mistress; while the por­
	      <lb/>ter in the hall said, no person was with her
	      <lb/>except <persName>Miss Benworth</persName> and two gentlemen,
	      <lb/>which four persons just filled the coach.
	      <lb/><persName>Edward</persName>, however, concluding she <emph>had</emph>
	      <lb/>gone with <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>, felt no anxiety,
	      <lb/>and leaving his card, saying he would call

	      <lb/>habitation at the good Baronet's, in <placeName>St.

            <p>These fashionable servants, who had al­

	      <lb/>on their master and mistress, never heeded
	      <lb/>whether or no she had descended from the

	      <lb/>ments, the company departed. <said>Well,

            <p><persName>Robert</persName> then mentioned his not being

	      <lb/><said>It is singular,</said> said <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>,

	      <lb/>said she, continuing the subject in her own
	      <lb/>native language at the departure of <persName>Ro­
		<lb/>bert</persName>; <said>will you believe that <persName>Sir Charles
		  <lb/>Sefton</persName> took leave of me to-night, as

		<lb/>out him? He stammered, hesitated, and
		<lb/>with the most awkward air in the world,
		<lb/>wished me and my party a good night. I
		<lb/>shall be glad when he is <emph>gone</emph>,</said> continued
	      <lb/>she, her eyes giving the lie to her tongue;

		<lb/>to supper, but you see she is not to be

            <p><said>By heaven,</said> said <persName>Mr. Davenport</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>I'm afraid, <persName>Emily</persName>, that <persName>Sir Charles</persName> is
		<lb/>fool enough to think of taking the girl off
		<lb/>with him to <placeName>Madeira</placeName>; there is no doubt
		<lb/>but that the consequence of her indiscre­
		<lb/>tion is likely very soon to appear: the fel­
		<lb/>low does not seem possessed of much feel­
		<lb/>ing; yet, perhaps the idea of being a
		<lb/>father, may make him take some care of
		<lb/>the mother, till such time as the <emph>dear
		  <lb/>creature</emph> presents him with his <mcr>ape-like</mcr>
		<lb/>countenance; then he may make her a
		<lb/>trifling settlement, sufficient to maintain
		<lb/>her there, and I really think it is the best
		<lb/>thing he can do.—Well, sure such a

		<lb/>I think his appearance by no means deserv­

		<lb/>so, my dear, but, by the bye, confounded
		<lb/>ugly. Don't be uneasy, <persName>Emily</persName>, if I tell
		<lb/>you something that I saw to-night. As I
		<lb/>was coming out of <placeName>Boodle's</placeName> rather earlier
		<lb/>than I usually do, for I could find by the
		<lb/>carriages the play was but just over, I
		<lb/>could neither find my rascals nor the cha­
		<lb/>riot; I suppose they had gone to take a
		<lb/>peep at the riot that was expected to take
		<lb/>place at the theatre: I walked on, how­
		<lb/>ever, as you know I am not devoted to
		<lb/>gaming, and finding myself in the losing
		<lb/>vein, I had no inclination to return; so
		<lb/>telling the porter at the door to inform my
		<lb/>servants when they came, that I had walked
		<lb/>home, the night being uncommonly fine,
		<lb/>I made a stroll of it. As I passed opposite

	      <lb/>with all the bitter vexation of jealousy. It
	      <lb/>could not be for the fate of the poor girl,

	      <lb/>and with whom her husband was so enrap­

	      <lb/>he therefore called to him his favourite

	      <lb/>awaited the morning visit of the <persName>Reverend
		<lb/>Edward Marsham</persName>.</p>
            <p><persName>Edward</persName> wished to pay his respects that
	      <lb/>morning to his Right Honourable and
	      <lb/>Reverend Rector; but, to present himself
	      <lb/>there for a morning visit before two
	      <lb/>o'clock in the afternoon, would never do:
	      <lb/>an earlier hour must not be thought of

            <p><persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>, however, rose that

		<lb/>bert</persName>, her footman, whom she had sent to
	      <lb/>various parts of the town, to discover, if
	      <lb/>possible, any tidings of her: he had heard,

	      <lb/>gantly made, grey, corded sarsnet pelisse,
	      <lb/>and bonnet of the same, with black tassels,
	      <lb/>had been seen wandering in the park at
	      <lb/>day-break, seemingly in great distress of
	      <lb/>mind. <persName>Mrs. Davenport</persName>'s good-natured

	      <lb/>of <persName>Sir Charles Sefton</persName>, whom, she made no
	      <lb/>doubt, had driven the unhappy girl from
	      <lb/>his presence, when <persName>Mr. Davenport</persName> saw her
	      <lb/>at his door; and that she had in despair
	      <lb/>drowned herself in the canal. She knew
	      <lb/>not how to act, she was half tempted to
	      <lb/>order her carriage and drive out, to avoid
	      <lb/>the sight of her long-known and respected
	      <lb/>friend, and spare him the pangs which she
	      <lb/>must give to his parental feelings: but then

            <p>It was now past one, and at that hour

            <p>Though every word this independent

	      <lb/>the late agitations of that mind had im­
	      <lb/>paired her person: life, spirit, and vivacity
	      <lb/>no longer sparkled in her now anxious

	      <lb/>escape it: instead of the keen and pointed
	      <lb/>satire tempered with genteel, though origi­
	      <lb/>nal wit, which used to enliven her conver­

	      <lb/>bestowed the strong expressions of anger
	      <lb/>and malevolence.</p>
            <p>The mind of <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> was not,
	      <lb/>naturally, intended for the throne of vice:
	      <lb/>education, the prevalence of fashion, the ill
	      <lb/>examples of her nearest relations, with the
	      <lb/>books she perused from her girlish days,
	      <lb/>had warped, and almost entirely overset
	      <lb/>the few good principles inherent in her,
	      <lb/>and caused her to give way to the free in­
	      <lb/>dulgence of any favourite inclination: the
	      <lb/>pride and obstinacy of self-will made her
	      <lb/>continue in any opinion she once thought
	      <lb/>proper to receive, even though her heart
	      <lb/>or her mature judgment condemned it:
	      <lb/>rashness and impetuosity governed her con­
	      <lb/>duct; and to shew her independence of her
	      <lb/>relatives, and her contempt of the world,
	      <lb/>she would, in the momentary impulse of
	      <lb/>haughty vexation, exercise her revenge on
	      <lb/>those who would dare to contradict or re­
	      <lb/>strain her, even though she inflicted ven­
	      <lb/>geance on herself. Such chiefly was her

		<lb/>mond</persName>; and of this imprudent and hasty
	      <lb/>marriage the reader has already seen the
	      <lb/>result.</p>
            <p>The passions of <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> were warm,
	      <lb/>her affections ardent, and her friendship,
	      <lb/>if it once took root, even if misplaced,
	      <lb/>was sincere: had she been differently edu­
	      <lb/>cated, though her mind was by no means
	      <lb/>faultless, and though her temper was na­
	      <lb/>turally severe and mischievous, yet, if in
	      <lb/>early youth her fine sense had been taught
	      <lb/>to take a proper bent, she would, with her
	      <lb/>native energies, have been as conspicuous
	      <lb/>for her virtue, as for her contempt of that
	      <lb/>ornament to the female character, and her
	      <lb/>mind would have become as excellent as
	      <lb/>it was great.</p>
            <p>It is a painful reflection on the bounded
	      <lb/>limits of all human worth, but there cer­
	      <lb/>tainly are some characters, wherein the
	      <lb/>weeds of pride and passion so choke the
	      <lb/><emph>latent</emph>, but yet not <emph>extinct</emph> virtues, that
	      <lb/>they must sink before they can rise: the

            <p>With anguish unspeakable, he took his

	      <lb/>of a villain.</p>
            <p>After many perplexing conjectures, it
	      <lb/>struck him that it was more than probable
	      <lb/>she had accompanied her seducer on his

	      <lb/>was actually in the house at the very time

            <p>Now alone, and freed from the busy un­

		<lb/>dear <persName>Mary</persName>: remember, my worthy friend,
		<lb/>it behoves you, as much as possible, to
		<lb/>pour the balm of paternal comfort into
		<lb/>her bleeding heart; and for this, I am
		<lb/>sure, you will see how needful it is for you
		<lb/>to exert all your energies: and we must
		<lb/>patiently wait the event of hearing of your
		<lb/>other daughter, by the next accounts from
		<lb/><placeName>Madeira</placeName>; for I have not the least doubt
		<lb/>but that she has prevailed on <persName>Sir Charles</persName>
		<lb/>to take her with him: she expected, daily,
		<lb/>your arrival in town, and dreaded to en­
		<lb/>counter the anger of a virtuous parent.
		<lb/>Make yourself easy, my excellent friend;
		<lb/>when I certainly find she is with <persName>Sir Charles</persName>,
		<lb/>I will compel him to do her justice.</said>

            <p>It was in vain for poor <persName>Edward Mar­

	      <lb/>not even owned the dear tie which called
	      <lb/>him to <placeName>Twickenham</placeName>.</p>
            <p>In about three or four days, <persName>Sir Edward</persName>
	      <lb/>and <persName>Mr. Marsham</persName> came to town: as the

	      <lb/>called on him in their way home; but
	      <lb/>found, more to the disappointment of <persName>Sir
		<lb/>Edward</persName>, than the heart-broken <persName>Mr. Mar­
		<lb/>sham</persName>, that the benefice had been given
	      <lb/>away a few days before: the Chancellor,
	      <lb/>however, made most fervent promises of

	      <lb/>own account, he felt sincerely desirous of
	      <lb/>serving.</p>
            <p>Such a flattering reception from one so
	      <lb/>high in rank and power, would at one time
	      <lb/>have imparted much pleasureable hope to

	      <lb/>more allure, nor the prospect of an easy
	      <lb/>competency any longer gratify, which,
	      <lb/>on account of bequeathing something to
	      <lb/>his poor <persName>Margaret</persName>, would once, had she
	      <lb/>remained virtuous, have been the summit of
	      <lb/>his earthly wishes.</p>
            <p>He left <persName>Sir Edward</persName> in <placeName>Pall-mall</placeName>, where
	      <lb/>he was engaged to dine with a very par­
	      <lb/>ticular friend, and where he much wished

	      <lb/>pany him, for change of scene, and to
	      <lb/>dissipate his thoughts; but the Curate
	      <lb/>intreated so earnestly to be excused, that

            <p>After he had taken a solitary dinner, a

            <p>Though he had, at first, winked at the

	      <lb/>shilling of his damages, which he laid at
	      <lb/><emph><measure>sixty thousand pounds</measure>!</emph></p>
            <p><persName>Edward</persName> sat some time in that scheming
	      <lb/>kind of various thought, which fixes upon
	      <lb/>nothing, when a faint sickness came over
	      <lb/>him; and being a beautiful night, and ra­
	      <lb/>ther warm for the season, he walked towards
	      <lb/>the <placeName>Green Park</placeName>, to try the effect of the
	      <lb/>air, to ponder over his misfortunes, and
	      <lb/>await the next morning for action and ex­
	      <lb/>ertion, which would now become requisite
	      <lb/>towards his own support.</p>
            <p>As he knew the keeper of the gate, he
	      <lb/>rang, and asked his permission to walk
	      <lb/>round the bason: after taking two or three
	      <lb/>turns, it began to grow somewhat dark,
	      <lb/>from the moon being under a cloud, which
	      <lb/>appeared to threaten rain: he discovered
	      <lb/>during this obscurity something white, like
	      <lb/>two female figures, who appeared to move
	      <lb/>towards the grove. Whether from an
	      <lb/>irresistible impulse of curiosity, or only
	      <lb/>with a view of dissipating his wretched
	      <lb/>thoughts, he knew not, but he rose with

	      <lb/>caution, and followed with softly stealing
	      <lb/>step after them, till he drew near, and then
	      <lb/>concealed himself among the trees.</p>
            <p>One of them addressed the other in a
	      <lb/>very low voice, as follows: <said>I think the
		<lb/><name>Park</name> is totally empty. Now, my friend,
		<lb/>my comforter in affliction, give me a last
		<lb/>embrace!</said> The other figure fell on her
	      <lb/>knees, and answered her; but her voice
	      <lb/>seemed hoarse and scarcely articulate, and
	      <lb/>as if she laboured under a severe cold.
	      <lb/><said>Think, oh! think, my dear friend,</said> said
	      <lb/>she, <said>Oh! let us reflect, before it will be

		<lb/>oh! if it should be a daughter, you deliver

	      <lb/>—<said>But do not we, ourselves,</said> said the
	      <lb/>other, <said>make this world a scene of misery?</said>
	      <lb/><said>Farewell,</said> said she, whose daring mind
	      <lb/>seemed most under the influence of despair,
	      <lb/><said>a moment is too long to live, after the
		<lb/>upbraidings of a friend; and if I <emph>have</emph> been

		<lb/>nishment, I hasten to receive my deserts;
		<lb/>but my chastisement shall be inflicted by a
		<lb/>superior being to the sons and daughters
		<lb/>of mortality.</said> She then dragged herself
	      <lb/>from her friend, who still endeavoured
	      <lb/>to cling to her, crying, <said>No, no, living
		<lb/>or dying, my lot shall never be separated
		<lb/>from yours.</said> They then walked so quick
	      <lb/>to the fatal bason, that <persName>Edward</persName> had much
	      <lb/>ado to overtake them, and prevent the

	      <lb/>tation. He endeavoured to exalt his voice,
	      <lb/>and cry, <said>Hold!</said> but the palpitation of
	      <lb/>his heart made the word die amongst the
	      <lb/>rustling of the leaves, which were agitated
	      <lb/>by a rising wind: he plainly, however, dis­
	      <lb/>tinguished the voice of <persName>Lady Isabella Ray­
		<lb/>mond</persName> calling to her friend, <said>Now I set
		<lb/>you the example,</said> and gave the fatal
	      <lb/>plunge before <persName>Edward</persName> had time to prevent
	      <lb/>it. He seized the other trembler in his
	      <lb/>arms, and said, <said>Stop, rash young woman,
		<lb/>and I will save your friend.</said> He then
	      <lb/>rushed into the water, and bore her breath­
	      <lb/>less to the shore: he alarmed the Park­
	      <lb/>gate-keeper, and between them, they con­
	      <lb/>veyed her to the nearest public-house, where
	      <lb/>medical assistance being immediately sent
	      <lb/>for, the wretched <persName>Isabella</persName> was soon re­
	      <lb/>covered.</p>
            <p>During this scene, <persName>Edward</persName> had not once
	      <lb/>turned towards <persName>Margaret</persName>; having little
	      <lb/>idea that his daughter could be residing
	      <lb/>with, and the avowed friend of, the woman

	      <lb/>had been strictly watched, in the fear that
	      <lb/>she might escape, and still commit what
	      <lb/>these desperate young women had seemed
	      <lb/>resolved upon.</p>
            <p><persName>Margaret</persName> had soon discovered her father
	      <lb/>in the deliverer of <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>; and
	      <lb/>dreading to encounter his looks and re­
	      <lb/>proaches, she had knelt by the bed-side,
	      <lb/>with her face hid by, and resting on her
	      <lb/>arms: the physician, however, whom <persName>Ed­

		<lb/>requisite to attend to this young woman; I
		<lb/>have remarked her posture for some time,
		<lb/>and what little I can see of her face, is pale
		<lb/>as death.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Edward</persName> helped him to raise her: what

	      <lb/>honour, inconsistency, and irreligion; and
	      <lb/>he resolved in spite of every wordly preju­

            <p>The day began to break, as <persName>Mr. Mar­

	      <lb/>the hackney-coach which stood in waiting:
	      <lb/>much did he say to her, during her ride to
	      <lb/>her former lodgings in <placeName>St. James's-street</placeName>;
	      <lb/>deeply did he impress her mind with her
	      <lb/>sole dependence on a superior power: the
	      <lb/>haughty, high-born, the once flattered and
	      <lb/>caressed <persName>Lady Isabella Raymond</persName> now sank
	      <lb/>humbled before a poor country Curate,

	      <lb/>been directed to her with that superiority
	      <lb/>which virtue now gave him, the height of

	      <lb/>mark, and that very judiciously, as she

	      <lb/>be possible to fix her in any temporary
	      <lb/>lodging, that was reputable, till a later
	      <lb/>hour in the day; and with so much sad
	      <lb/>and forlorn meekness, with so much po­
	      <lb/>lished and native sweetness, did she urge
	      <lb/>her request, that <persName>Edward</persName> and his daughter
	      <lb/>not only stayed and partook of her break­
	      <lb/>fast, but he sat near two hours after with
	      <lb/>her, enforcing his pious and gentle pre­
	      <lb/>cepts, and advising the plan of life he
	      <lb/>wished her in future to adopt. He had
	      <lb/>long studied the human heart, he had often
	      <lb/>witnessed the real contrition of the sincere
	      <lb/>penitent, as he has attended the bed of
	      <lb/>sickness and death; and he feared not now
	      <lb/>to trust <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> with the worst of all
	      <lb/>her enemies—herself! He meant, after he
	      <lb/>had seen her re-established in her lodgings,

	      <lb/>the deeply abashed <persName>Isabella</persName>, and said, as
	      <lb/>his eyes were moistened with the tear of
	      <lb/>pity, <said>Persevere! think how many years

	      <lb/>dropped on her knees, and gratefully be­
	      <lb/>dewed the hand, which she fervently gras­
	      <lb/>ped, with her tears. They then all solemnly

	      <lb/>and his daughter departed.</p>
            <p>They drove a short distance from <placeName>Lon­

		<lb/>mark for the arrows of slander: would you
		<lb/>believe that calumny has most severely
		<lb/>handled you this morning? <persName>Mr. Leslie</persName>
		<lb/>was returning from a masquerade, as you
		<lb/>handed into an hackney-coach, from a little
		<lb/>obscure public-house, his sister-in-law,
		<lb/><persName>Lady Isabella</persName>! He huddled his domino
		<lb/>round him, for the revere<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">n</unclear> gentleman, by
		<lb/>what chance I know not, was on foot, and
		<lb/>traced the coach, till he saw it stop at an
		<lb/>house in <placeName>St. James's-street</placeName>: he marked well
		<lb/>the house, and then repaired to the <name>St.
		  <lb/>James's Coffee-house</name>, where bereaving
		<lb/>himself of his domino, he sat and watch­
		<lb/>ed this house, to which he was nearly

		<lb/>either party; but <persName>Mr. Leslie</persName> rose and in­
		<lb/>treated a few minutes conversation with
		<lb/>me, at the window in which he was posted:
		<lb/>he related to me what he had seen; I told
		<lb/>him it was impossible:  <said>Do you think,</said>
		<lb/>said he, <said>I do not know <persName>Lady Caroline</persName>'s
		  <lb/>sister?</said>—<said>Assuredly, sir, any one who
		  <lb/>had often seen <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>, could not
		  <lb/>easily be mistaken in <emph>her</emph> person, in <persName>Mr.

		  <lb/><placeName>Eglantine</placeName></persName>. <said>Yes, sir, your <emph>late</emph> Curate,</said>
		<lb/>said I. <persName>Leslie</persName> dropt his bold eyes;—how­
		<lb/>ever, to make short my story, to satisfy his
		<lb/>repeated request, I stood and gazed with
		<lb/>him at the window, and, to my great sur­
		<lb/>prise, saw you hand a female into a hack­
		<lb/>ney-coach; she was so enveloped in a shawl,
		<lb/>and her face so concealed in a huge bon­
		<lb/>net, that no one could distinguish her form
		<lb/>or features: but we had little doubt but
		<lb/>it was <persName>Lady Isabella</persName>. I was much mor­
		<lb/>tified, took my leave, and came away; for

		<lb/>the coffee-house, before you took <emph>your</emph>
		<lb/>leave: and I must say, that I thought with­
		<lb/>in myself, whatever may be <persName>Edward Mar­
		  <lb/>sham</persName>'s motives, he surely carries Christian
		<lb/>charity too far, to be thus mysteriously in
		<lb/>company with the woman who has, by an
		<lb/>adulterous commerce with his daughter's
		<lb/>husband, made that daughter miserable.
		<lb/>But this was not all I was fated to endure
		<lb/>this morning.</p>
              <p>I called in at a fruit-shop, to pay for
		<lb/>some fruit I had purchased a few days ago,
		<lb/>and there stood a gossiping awkward-look­
		<lb/>ing girl of a servant maid, twirling the key of
		<lb/>a street-door round her finger. <said>Why, yes,</said>
		<lb/>said she to the shop-woman, (while I was
		<lb/>speaking to the master,)  <said>I <distinct>thinks</distinct>, indeed,

		  <lb/><emph>muddled</emph> herself up, that nobody should
		  <lb/>know her, I suppose.</said>—<said>Sure! well, like
		  <lb/>enough,</said> said the wench, <said>I <distinct>hasn't</distinct> been
		  <lb/>at home some time, and I dare say I shall
		  <lb/>get a fine noise; for <distinct>I'se</distinct> been giving it

		  <lb/>about their neighbours.</said> She then began
		<lb/>a long gossip's tale, in which I found you
		<lb/>and your ladies no more concerned, and I
		<lb/>went home: but recollecting that I had
		<lb/>appointed my banker to meet me at his

            <p>Retirement the most secluded, was now

	      <lb/>vacant and in his own gift, but which he
	      <lb/>had never thought sufficiently good to
	      <lb/>present him with, having higher views for
	      <lb/>him.</p>
            <p>The poor romantic wanderer, <persName>Margaret</persName>,
	      <lb/>was still to retain the name she had adopt­
	      <lb/>ed, and to pass for a young widow; for,
	      <lb/>as <persName>Sir Edward</persName> remarked, a little decep­
	      <lb/>tion which does no harm, must sometimes
	      <lb/>be practised in a deceptive world, to en­
	      <lb/>able us to pass through it, when we have
	      <lb/>erred, not only for our own credit, but
	      <lb/>chiefly for that of our families and con­
	      <lb/>nexions.</p>
            <p>This good man carried his generosity
	      <lb/>so far, as even to propose that <persName>Margaret</persName>
	      <lb/>might make a part of his family, at his

	      <lb/>respectable matron, with whom she might

	      <lb/>and ready to be put in execution, <persName>Charles
		<lb/>Marsham</persName> arrived from <placeName>Walcheren</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Prosperous in his situation, honoured by
	      <lb/>all his superior officers, and beloved by
	      <lb/>those beneath him, he had obtained,
	      <lb/>through the interest of those in power,
	      <lb/>who were well disposed to serve him, and to
	      <lb/>whom his merits were long unknown, the
	      <lb/>most rapid promotion; and had an appoint­
	      <lb/>ment of still higher trust, honour, and
	      <lb/>profit bestowed upon him, but which,
	      <lb/>however, would compel him again to quit
	      <lb/>his country, and that in a very few days.</p>
            <p>When this became known to his excel­

	      <lb/>perhaps it was owing to the presence of his
	      <lb/>uncle.</p>
            <p>Many, however, were the bitter epi­
	      <lb/>thets, which he bestowed on <persName>Lady Isa­
