            <p>In a retired valley, embosomed in a
               <lb/>wood of many years' growth, and five
               <lb/>miles distant from any town in <placeName>Devon­
               <lb/>shire</placeName>, was an ancient solitary mansion,
               <lb/>surrounded with a few acres of ground
               <lb/>appertaining to it, though formerly a
               <lb/>very large estate belonged to the house.
               <lb/>This was now the property of the gene­
               <lb/>ral, in right of <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, his wife;
               <lb/>and to this place he intended to retire on 
               <lb/>his landing in <placeName>England</placeName>.
            </p>
            <p><persName>General Douglas</persName> was descended from 
               <lb/>one of the first families in <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, and
               <lb/>began the world with a good fortune,
               <lb/>besides his commission; but a generous 
               <lb/>unsuspecting nature made him too easily
               <lb/>a prey to the artful, cold-hearted, and 
               <lb/>designing. Thus, when he married the
               <lb/>honourable <persName>Miss Treharne</persName>, who was as
               <lb/>poor as himself, he found he had little
               <lb/>more than his sword to depend on. But,

               <lb/>courageous in the cause of love as he
               <lb/>was brave in the field, he loved too well
               <lb/>to despair, and by his judicious conduct,
               <lb/>his cool and steady courage, he gained 
               <lb/>the admiration of his brother-officers.
               <lb/>His superiors esteemed him, and his
               <lb/>advance in the army was rapid; yet,
               <lb/>with all this success, he found it diffi­
               <lb/>cult to support the rank of a general
               <lb/>officer, as he had little more remaining
               <lb/>than his pay. A numerous family, of
               <lb/>whom three only were now living, was
               <lb/>a heavy expence, but, by strict economy,
               <lb/>the general and <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> succeeded
               <lb/>in maintaining a good appearance; and
               <lb/>being universally respected, the truest
               <lb/>harmony, the most unbounded confi­
               <lb/>dence, subsisted between them, and they
               <lb/>never regretted, in any scene or situa­
               <lb/>tion, however trying, that they had risk­
               <lb/>ed friends, fortune, every thing, from
               <lb/>their attachment to each other.
            </p>

               <lb/>old, rich, and avaricious. He was se­
               <lb/>veral years the general's senior; and
               <lb/>though he well knew his embarrass­
               <lb/>ments, would not assist him in the most
               <lb/>trifling degree. If he could have been
               <lb/>attached to any one, the general would
               <lb/>have had the first place in his regard:
               <lb/>but, alas! his affection centered in his
               <lb/>treasures—they were brethren, wife, chil­
               <lb/>dren—all, to his sordid mind. But <persName>ge­
               <lb/>neral Douglas</persName> endured this with the for­
               <lb/>titude of an upright mind. At his death
               <lb/>he knew he should inherit the estates (if
               <lb/>he withheld his personal property), and
               <lb/>with that consolatory reflection he was
               <lb/>resigned.

           <p><name>The Enchanter</name> sloop of war, in which
               <lb/>the <name>Douglas</name> family had taken their pas­
               <lb/>sage, was commanded by <persName>captain Bur­
               <lb/>ton</persName>, an acquaintance of the general's.
               <lb/>The ship was to touch at the island of 
               <lb/><placeName>Newfoundland</placeName>, to make spruce beer for
               <lb/>the crew to drink, who were rather in

                <lb/>an unhealthy state, and severely afflicted
                <lb/>with the scurvy, having been for three
                <lb/>years chiefly at sea, where they had en­
                <lb/>countered dangers most severe, with ma­
                <lb/>ny hardships and privations.
           </p>
           <p>They anchored in a small unfrequent­
               <lb/>ed bay, which they preferred, as they did
               <lb/>not wish to be interrupted. On landing,
               <lb/>they found this spot quite uninha­
               <lb/>bited; and the sailors, by felling a great
               <lb/>number of trees, soon obtained materials
               <lb/>for building two huts. In one they placed
               <lb/>a copper for boiling the spruce, and uten­
               <lb/>sils for the beer, with every necessary re­
               <lb/>quisite for its completion; and the other
               <lb/>hut, on a larger scale, was for the accom­
               <lb/>modation of the officers and passengers
               <lb/>when they came on shore. But the ac­
               <lb/>tive minds of the young <name>Douglases</name> could
               <lb/>not be satisfied with the shelter made by
               <lb/>the seamen, and united their efforts to
               <lb/>compose a bower, according to their own
               <lb/>fancy, which was to be exclusively theirs

               <lb/>and their parents, when they made a vi­ 
               <lb/>sit to the land in the day; for all return­

       <p><persName>Rose</persName> was at this period fourteen years
              <lb/>old; but being taller than is usual at that
              <lb/>age, with a figure most completely form­
              <lb/>ed, she was generally judged to be seven­
              <lb/>teen. Her person gave a striking promise
              <lb/>of that dazzling beauty which was after­
              <lb/>wards so much admired. Rich ringlets of
              <lb/>golden hair waved round a face beaming
              <lb/>with expressive sweetness and good-hu­
              <lb/>mour. The bright lustre of her large ha­
              <lb/>zel eyes was heightened by the beauti­
              <lb/>ful bloom that tinted her cheek. Her
              <lb/>features were not strictly regular, but the
              <lb/><foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">tout ensemble</foreign> was so captivating, that no
              <lb/>mind of taste thought of asking if that
              <lb/>face was regularly handsome.

       <p><persName>Felix</persName>, her brother (and never was a
              <lb/>brother more tenderly loved by a sister),
              <lb/>was a year older, and promised to be a            
              <lb/>model of personal elegance and manly
              <lb/>beauty. Nor was his heart undeserving

              <lb/>of an exterior so perfect. Every virtue
              <lb/>and excellence that adorn the human
              <lb/>heart glowed in his youthful bosom, and
              <lb/>gave the fairest prospect of decided
              <lb/>worth.
       </p>
       <p><persName>Jane</persName>, the youngest, was of a very dif­
              <lb/>ferent disposition, though she had some
              <lb/>good qualities, which compensated, in a
              <lb/>slight degree, for the excessive violence
              <lb/>of her temper. Her spirits were lively
              <lb/>and ungovernable; but when good-na­
              <lb/>ture influenced them, her countenance
              <lb/>was animated and pleasing. Her blue
              <lb/>eyes sparkled with fire; and when she
              <lb/>laughed, she displayed the whitest and
              <lb/>finest teeth ever seen. Ringlets of ches­
              <lb/>nut hair, resembling glossy silk, cluster­
              <lb/>ed on her pretty little head, and her fi­
              <lb/>gure promised to be slender and well-
              <lb/>proportioned.
       </p>
       <p>When their bower was finished, they
              <lb/>repaired to it every day, and were some­
              <lb/>times visited by their father and mo­
              <lb/>ther, who enjoyed the shade and re­

              <lb/>freshing sea-breezes, though they all
              <lb/>found the gnats and other stinging in­
              <lb/>sects very troublesome. If the weather
              <lb/>did not allow them to quit the ship,
              <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> amused herself with drawing dif­
              <lb/>ferent berries, of which there were a
              <lb/>great quantity on the island, and some
              <lb/>curious butterflies. She likewise paint­
              <lb/>ed a curlew, which <persName>Felix</persName> shot, feeding
              <lb/>on the partridge berry, that makes a tart
              <lb/>resembling the cranberry.
      </p>
      <p>The curlews are excellent eating, and,
              <lb/>at this season of the year, were exceed­
              <lb/>ingly plump with feeding on the berries.
              <lb/><persName>Felix</persName> was a very good shot, and sup­
              <lb/>plied the captain's table with wild geese,
              <lb/>ducks, and venison; for a great many deer
              <lb/>inhabited the woods in <placeName>Newfoundland</placeName>.
              <lb/>The sailors, by fishing, procured the fine
              <lb/>cod-fish which frequent this coast in
              <lb/>shoals, and they were constantly sup­
              <lb/>plied with fresh provision of the best
              <lb/>sort.

              <lb/>unattended, on account of the wolves
              <lb/>and bears, that might attack a single
              <lb/>person, if ravenous, successfully. The

              <lb/>approached any spot where inhabitants
              <lb/>were to be found. The black and brown
              <lb/>bear were very harmless, and it was only
              <lb/>the white bear that caused any apprehen­
              <lb/>sion.
      </p>    
      <p>One afternoon, <persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName>, attend­
              <lb/>ed by their faithful <name>Ponto</name>, had pene­

              <lb/>into the adjacent wood, as <persName>Felix</persName> was
              <lb/>gone on a shooting-party. A most fra­
              <lb/>grant smell tempted them to proceed,
              <lb/>and <persName>Jane</persName> exclaimed—<said>I am certain
              <lb/>there is a strawberry-bed near.</said>     
      </p> 
      <p>They followed the delightful scent,
              <lb/>till they reached a bank covered with
              <lb/>this refreshing plant in its wild state.
              <lb/>The scarlet fruit blushed beside the ver­
              <lb/>dant leaves, and peeped out from the
              <lb/>grass that endeavoured likewise to con­
              <lb/>ceal them, but in vain, as its fragrance

              <lb/>betrayed their hidden beauties—like
              <lb/>modest merit, that unobtrusive would
              <lb/>secrete itself, till brought to light by
              <lb/>some penetrating liberal eye.
      </p>         
      <p><persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName> regaled themselves,
              <lb/>and at the same time filled a small bas­
              <lb/>ket for their father and mother, and the
              <lb/>good-natured <persName>captain Burton</persName>. <name>Ponto</name>
              <lb/>likewise amused himself, and they could
              <lb/>not avoid smiling to see him nipping the
              <lb/>strawberries; but fearful he would de­
              <lb/>vour too many, they soon drove him
              <lb/>away.
      </p>
      <p>The basket was quickly filled, and
              <lb/>they were returning to the bower, when
              <lb/>a low moaning broke on their ear from
              <lb/>the stillness that reigned around. A
              <lb/>deep groan followed. <name>Ponto</name> whined,
              <lb/>raised his ears, and darted forwards,
              <lb/>while <persName>Rose</persName>, whose gentle feeling heart
              <lb/>was ever alive in the cause of humanity,
              <lb/>eagerly but unthinkingly followed the
              <lb/>dog to the spot from whence the sound

      <p>Horror and astonishment now over­

              <lb/>lay down by the poor <name>Indian</name>. <persName>Jane</persName> at
              <lb/>this moment came running to them, and
              <lb/>assisted <persName>Rose</persName> to bind up the wound,
              <lb/>which was near the shoulder, in the
              <lb/>broadest part of the arm, with her cam­

      </p>
      <p>She could speak a little broken <name>Eng­

             <lb/>In her simple sincere manner she ex­
             <lb/>pressed her gratitude to the young la­

      </p>
      <p>The <name>Esquimaux</name> had lost a great deal
             <lb/>of blood, and was very weak; and having

             <lb/>on a bed of dried spruce fir boughs, and
             <lb/>placed her bow and arrows by her side.
             <lb/>The sisters then gave her some wine to
             <lb/>drink, which was fortunately in the

             <lb/>cloak, made signs for her to go to sleep,
             <lb/>and that they would watch at the en­
             <lb/>trance that nothing should disturb her.
      </p> 
      <p>The wounded <name>Indian</name> seemed glad to
             <lb/>be in security and quiet, and sleep soon
             <lb/>pressed heavily on her eyelids. <persName>Rose</persName>
             <lb/>and <persName>Jane</persName> sent a sailor to the ship, to in­

             <lb/>as calm as an infant's. Her long shining

             <lb/>rose, from the feverish heat that burnt
             <lb/>in her veins. Her features were very

             <lb/>She had not the large head and flat face
             <lb/>that distinguishes the <name>Esquimaux</name>, nor 
             <lb/>their thick lips; her mouth was small,

             <lb/>tifully modelled. The boots that enve­
             <lb/>loped her feet had slipped off, and dis­

              <lb/><persName>Losquillo</persName>, who was ardently attached to
              <lb/>her, when the artful and wicked <persName>Robec­
              <lb/>ka</persName>, the mountaineer, strove to seduce
              <lb/>the affections of her husband.
      </p>
      <p>The tender and gentle <persName>Kamira</persName> began
              <lb/>to be deserted for the bold <persName>Robecka</persName>,
              <lb/>whose tall stature and commanding air
              <lb/>seemed as if she demanded homage from
              <lb/>the mild and gentle <name>Esquimaux</name>, and her
              <lb/>meagre visage and ferocious eye pre­
              <lb/>sented a disgusting contrast to the soft
              <lb/>countenance of <persName>Kamira</persName>.
      </p>
      <p><persName>Robecka</persName> had all the bad qualities of
              <lb/>her tribe, united with the vices of <rs type="properAdjective">Euro­
              <lb/>pean</rs> nations. She was immoderately
              <lb/>fond of strong drink, and, never satisfied
              <lb/>with any quantity she obtained, still
      <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">craved</mw>
      <pb/>
      <milestone unit="sig" n="B8v"/>
      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">16</mw>
              <lb/>craved for more; constant falsehood
              <lb/>stained her lips, and no property was se­
              <lb/>cure where she entered. <persName>Kamira</persName> was
              <lb/>soon informed of the fondness of <persName>Ro­
              <lb/>becka</persName> for her <persName>Losquillo</persName>, and was resolved,
              <lb/>as much as possible, to follow him where­
              <lb/>ever he went that she could convenient­
              <lb/>ly accompany him, though she disliked
              <lb/>roving about, as was the custom of her
              <lb/>country-people, and had rarely left home
              <lb/>before.
      </p>
      <p><persName>Robecka</persName>, though born a mountaineer,
              <lb/>was the widow of an <name>Esquimaux</name>, and
              <lb/>possessed a worthless, merciless, and re­
              <lb/>vengeful heart. This <persName>Kamira</persName> knew, and
              <lb/>feared that by her constant influence she
              <lb/>might render the inoffensive <persName>Losquillo</persName> as
              <lb/>depraved as herself, if she was not also
              <lb/>with him to counteract her power; for
              <lb/><persName>Losquillo</persName> was of that pliant disposition
              <lb/>that, like the reed, bends to every blast.
              <lb/>This disposition is pleasing to its posses­
              <lb/>sor and associates, when it meets with
              <lb/>amiable characters only, who will not

             <lb/>take an unfair advantage; but most dan­
             <lb/>gerous, when a vicious character gains
             <lb/>an ascendancy over a gentle yielding
             <lb/>mind.
      </p>
      <p>While <persName>Kamira</persName> remained with her hus­
             <lb/>band, <persName>Robecka</persName> found her dominion
             <lb/>much lessened; and enraged to madness,
             <lb/>she watched in ambuscade for <persName>Kamira</persName>,
             <lb/>when she had separated from her party 
             <lb/>in pursuit of the deer.
      </p>
      <p>Fatigued with the chace, the young
             <lb/><name>Esquimaux</name> had thrown herself on the
             <lb/>grass, in a shady spot, to repose her
             <lb/>wearied frame, when the sanguinary
             <lb/>mountaineer crept unperceived, and be­
             <lb/>fore she was aware, stabbed her with a
             <lb/>tomahawk.          
      </p>
      <p>But the blow was not struck with the
             <lb/>force and effect <persName>Robecka</persName> intended—it
             <lb/>wounded her arm, instead of her breast,
             <lb/>at which she had aimed; and as the
             <lb/>guilty, however daring, are easily alarm­
             <lb/>ed, the approaching voices of <persName>Rose</persName> and

             <lb/><persName>Jane</persName> made her afraid to stay and repeat
             <lb/>the blow.     
      </p>
      <p>The wretch now fled from her victim
             <lb/>with the utmost swiftness, only regret­
             <lb/>ting that she had not effectually destroy­
             <lb/>ed her, though she hoped she had
             <lb/>wounded her so dangerously that she
             <lb/>might linger, and, for want of proper as­
             <lb/>sistance, perish from her wounds, or from
             <lb/>being destitute of food. At all events,
             <lb/>she knew, from her being in a light slum­
             <lb/>ber, that she could not know who struck
             <lb/>the blow, and if she recovered, would be
             <lb/>ignorant of her assassin.             
      </p>
      <p><persName>Robecka</persName> had just reached their night­
             <lb/>ly haunts, when she encountered <persName>Los­
             <lb/>quillo</persName> and his companions. He asked
             <lb/>her if she had seen <persName>Kamira</persName>? and <persName>Robec­
             <lb/>ka</persName> answered, that two hours since she
             <lb/>saw her pursuing a fine red deer, but
             <lb/>mentioned that it was in a direction
             <lb/>quite opposite to where she had left her,
             <lb/>wounded and bleeding.

      <p>No more was thought of this till night
             <lb/>was far advanced, and she had not re­
             <lb/>turned to their noctural rendezvous.
             <lb/><persName>Losquillo</persName> then became very uneasy, and
             <lb/>after searching for her several days,
             <lb/>though always distant from where she
             <lb/>actually was, he resigned every hope of
             <lb/>recovering her, and gave credit to a tale
             <lb/>related by one of his friends. It was,
             <lb/>that <persName>Kamira</persName> had been destroyed by a
             <lb/>white bear, as this friend had seen a
             <lb/>white bear, by a stream of water, growl­
             <lb/>ing over the mangled body of a female
             <lb/><name>Esquimaux</name>, whose dress and size appear­
             <lb/>ed to resemble <persName>Losquillo's</persName> lost wife.      
      </p>
      <p>It was now the period for him and his
             <lb/>party to quit <placeName>Newfoundland</placeName>. Discon­
             <lb/>solate, he quitted this island, that had
             <lb/>proved so fatal to him, resolving never
             <lb/>to land again on the detested spot. But
             <lb/>the <name><rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> Indian</name> soon proved that
             <lb/>he was not more constant than the more
             <lb/>refined <name>European</name>, and, in a very short
             <lb/>time, appeared to console himself with

             <lb/>the caresses of the treacherous moun­
             <lb/>taineer, for the amiable and lovely <persName>Ka­
             <lb/>mira's</persName> loss.          
      </p>
      <p>While these events were passing, <persName>Ka­
             <lb/>mira</persName> slowly recovered from the effects of
             <lb/>her wound. <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, with her
             <lb/>husband's and <persName>captain Burton's</persName> permis­
             <lb/>sion, had her brought on board, where
             <lb/>she remained till she was sufficiently re­
             <lb/>covered to go occasionally on shore. She
             <lb/>was then allowed to visit the favourite
             <lb/>bower with their children, and to attend
             <lb/>them when they walked, or strolled in
             <lb/>the woods, with <name>Ponto</name> to guard them.
      </p> 
      <p><persName>Rose</persName> improved <persName>Kamira</persName> in the <rs type="properAdjective">Eng­
             <lb/>lish</rs> language, and taught her to read.
             <lb/>The rapidity of her improvement was
             <lb/>remarkable, and her attachment to them
             <lb/>all seemed to grow with it, but more
             <lb/>particularly for <persName>Rose</persName>, whose gentle me­
             <lb/>thod of instruction made her like to
             <lb/>learn.
      </p> 
      <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> was very proud of her
             <lb/>pupil, and it would have made a pretty

              <lb/>picture, to have sketched the deep em­
              <lb/>browned countenance of the <name>Esquimaux</name>,
              <lb/>in her native dress, on her knees, taking
              <lb/>a lesson from the fair-haired <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> girl,
              <lb/>in whose face sweetness and benevolence
              <lb/>were depicted.
      </p>
      <p>But <persName>Kamira</persName> was very melancholy,
              <lb/>though her wound was nearly healed.
              <lb/>She had learnt, from two mountaineers
              <lb/>who came in a shallop to the bay, that
              <lb/><persName>Losquillo</persName> had landed at <placeName>Labrador</placeName>, and
              <lb/>was gone up the country, a great way
              <lb/>off, with <persName>Robecka</persName>, to whom, it was re­
              <lb/>ported, he was now married, as <persName>Kamira</persName>
              <lb/>was supposed to have been murdered by
              <lb/>the bears, or eloped with another <name>Indian</name>.
     </p>
     <p>When <persName>Kamira</persName> heard this, she wrung
              <lb/>her hands, struck her bosom, and wept.
     </p>
     <p><persName>Rose</persName> cried to see her poor <name>Esquimaux</name>
              <lb/>thus afflicted, and tried to comfort her;
              <lb/>and the general and <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, who
              <lb/>were also present, strove to sooth her.
     </p>  
     <p>When she was a little recovered, <persName>Ka­
              <lb/>mira</persName> gracefully addressed them.—<said>Good

              <lb/>white people,</said> said she, extending one
              <lb/>arm as she spoke, <said>take <persName>Kamira</persName> to your
              <lb/>country, where the great king lives. Let
              <lb/>her be your servant and your children's!
              <lb/>Your great king and your country shall
              <lb/>then be hers. Never shall the chain you
              <lb/>have bound round her heart be broken;
              <lb/>the chain shall be always bright. No
              <lb/>people have a quicker feeling of injuries,
              <lb/>nor a more grateful rememberance of fa­
              <lb/>vours, than <name><rs type="properAdjective">Esquimaux</rs> Indians</name>. If you
              <lb/>wanted food, my bow and arrow should
              <lb/>kill the wild deer as it runs, and the
              <lb/>birds as they fly in the air; I would
              <lb/>catch the fish too, as it moves in the wa­
              <lb/>ter, for you. If you required clothing, I
              <lb/>would hunt the beasts for their fur, to
              <lb/>keep you warm, and bears' and foxes'
              <lb/>skins I would lay at your feet.</said>         
       </p>
       <p>As she pronounced these last words,
              <lb/>the <name>Indian</name> bowed her head, and knelt to
              <lb/>them.      
       </p>
       <p>The general raised her up, and <persName>Mrs.
              <lb/>Douglas</persName>, with his approbation, assured

               <lb/>her they would be happy to take her
               <lb/>under their protection, if she was certain
               <lb/>she would be contented at a distance
               <lb/>from her native land, and consent to
               <lb/>wear an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> dress; that if she
               <lb/>agreed to it, she should be dressed in a
               <lb/>few days as an <name>Englishwoman</name>.
       </p>
       <p>The docile <persName>Kamira</persName> gladly complied
               <lb/>with this request, and from that moment
               <lb/>became more cheerful, as her fate was
               <lb/>now decided, and she was not in a state
               <lb/>of uncertainty, as suspense was painful
               <lb/>even to her uncultivated mind.
       </p>
       <p>The following day, when <persName>Felix</persName> was
               <lb/>as usual absent, engaged in hunting or
               <lb/>shooting, the sisters were sitting with
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName>, in a small grove of birch and
               <lb/>mountain-ash trees, almost out of sight
               <lb/>of the bower and huts, when a loud
               <lb/>scream attracted their attention. They
               <lb/>looked around, and saw the sailor-boy,
               <lb/>who watched the spruce when boiling
               <lb/>in the copper, running with great speed
               <lb/>to them.

       <p>They advanced to meet him, and his

       <p>He was almost breathless with run­

               <lb/>ed, <said>a great black bear has just come
               <lb/>into the hut, and went to the pan where

               <lb/>and, I dare say, has eat it all up by this

               <lb/>I ran out, and was so glad, for I was
               <lb/>afraid, when he had pleased his sweet

       <p><persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName> burst out a laughing,

       <p><persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName> ran back to their
               <lb/>bower, and <persName>Jack</persName> got up into a tree, as
               <lb/>he judged that it would be too much
               <lb/>engaged with the <name>Indian</name>, when she at­
               <lb/>tacked it, to climb after him.
       </p> 
       <p>Surfeited with its sweet food, the
               <lb/>shaggy animal presently came slowly
               <lb/>from the hut, and <persName>Kamira</persName> aimed an
               <lb/>arrow so dextrously, that it pierced the
               <lb/>rough beast to the heart; it staggered
               <lb/>and fell, but not till another arrow had
               <lb/>darted through its head. <persName>Kamira</persName> ap­
               <lb/>roached when she saw it motionless,
               <lb/>and then called to <persName>Jack</persName>, who descended

       <p>When <persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName> perceived him

                <lb/>over, and hastened to the spot. They
                <lb/>were delighted, as well as <persName>Jack</persName>, to see
                <lb/>him extended lifeless, as they feared,
                <lb/>if he had not been dispatched, he would

       <p><persName>Rose</persName> now proposed that they should

                <lb/>for having been laughed at.
       </p>
       <p><persName>Jack</persName> was quite pleased, and said he
                <lb/>should not mind if another bear came,
                <lb/>provided <persName>Kamira</persName> was there to shoot it,

       <p><persName>Felix</persName> and his sisters expressed their

                <lb/>had passed so many happy hours to their

                 <lb/>be too much fatigued. Though they

                 <lb/>land</placeName>, that all was novelty.

         <p>It was late in the evening when the

                 <lb/>bre shade, that darkened the adjacent

                 <lb/>the edifice, which was seated in a deep
                 <lb/>valley. But no melancholy existed in
                 <lb/>the minds of the younger part of the
                 <lb/>family.
         </p>
         <p>Notwithstanding they derived a great
                 <lb/>deal of amusement from their journey,
                 <lb/>yet the idea of reaching their own home
                 <lb/>was most pleasing, and <persName>Rose</persName> observed

         </p>
         <p>The building appeared to have been
                 <lb/>intended for a place of great security,
                 <lb/>and its venerable majestic appearance
                 <lb/>gave it an air of departed grandeur. It
                 <lb/>had four turrets, and was encompassed
                 <lb/>by a deep moat, which extended to the

         <p>To enter <placeName>Treharne Hall</placeName>, you were
                <lb/>obliged to cross this river, that meander­
                <lb/>ed through the valley; and for that pur­
                <lb/>pose an old drawbridge was let down,
                <lb/>which was seldom drawn up. The ri­
                <lb/>ver was narrow, and a boat kept moor­
                <lb/>ed there to row from the Hall, and an­
                <lb/>other on the opposite side, for the con­
                <lb/>venience of crossing the water.

         <p>An aged man, with hair as white as
                <lb/>silver, and florid complexion, was wait­
                <lb/>ing on the bank of the river to ferry
                <lb/>them over. His daughter, a stout,
                <lb/>healthy young woman, opened the Hall-
                <lb/>door, and conducted them into the man­
                <lb/>sion, where her father and herself had
                <lb/>done their utmost to make it as com­
                <lb/>fortable as they could.

         <p><persName>Robin</persName> had been an old domestic of

          <p>The vestibule was hung with armour,
                 <lb/>intermixed with statues of some of the
                 <lb/>ancestors of the <name>Treharne</name> family. The
                 <lb/>house was furnished in the most an­
                 <lb/>tique style; and they were much enter­
                 <lb/>tained with the uncommon height of
                 <lb/>the candlesticks. The chairs in the eat­
                 <lb/>ing-room were of gilt leather, and so
                 <lb/>heavy, that no female hand could lift
                 <lb/>them. Flowered crimson satin curtains
                 <lb/>ornamented the drawing-room, to which
                 <lb/>the rest of the furniture corresponded,
                 <lb/>and the walls were hung with family
                 <lb/>pictures. The oaken floor was rubbed
                 <lb/>till it shone like a looking-glass, and it
                 <lb/>was so slippery, they could hardly walk

                 <lb/>ing a carpet as soon as possible. But
                 <lb/>the library was the apartment they
                 <lb/>most admired, as it appeared to contain
                 <lb/>an extensive collection of books, and
                 <lb/>looked into a beautiful shrubbery, filled
                 <lb/>with rose-trees and a varied number of

                 <lb/>neglected for many years, and flourished
                 <lb/>in all the wild luxuriance of nature, as
                 <lb/><persName>Robin</persName> was too old now to work hard,
                 <lb/>therefore it was impossible for him to

          <p>The family at <placeName>Treharne</placeName> had been set­
                  <lb/>tled there but a very short time, when
                  <lb/>they received visits from several ladies
                  <lb/>and gentlemen, who were resident at
                  <lb/>that period in the neighbourhood and
                  <lb/>many miles distant. After they had ap­
                  <lb/>peared at their parish church, which was
                  <lb/>half a mile from the hall, and situated in
                  <lb/>the large romantic village of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>,
                  <lb/>they were visited likewise by its most
                  <lb/>respectable inhabitants. <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>
                  <lb/>felt additional satisfaction at their hav­
                  <lb/>ing a prospect of society, as she wished
                  <lb/><persName>Rose</persName>, from the timidity of her disposi­
                  <lb/>tion, to be frequently in company, that
                  <lb/>she might in some degree conquer it, as
                  <lb/>her natural diffidence obscured her me­
                  <lb/>rit, and she appeared to less advantage.
                  <lb/>Often was her timid reserve ascribed to a

                  <lb/>haughtiness and pride, quite opposite to
                  <lb/>her real character, for no one could be
                  <lb/>more humble and modest.

          <p>The affection of this good mother for 
                  <lb/>her children filled her with a thousand
                  <lb/>apprehensions. It made her look for­
                  <lb/>ward to futurity, and ruminate with
                  <lb/>anxiety on the general's ill state of health.
                  <lb/>In the event of his death, their circum­
                  <lb/>stances might probably be cruelly em­
                  <lb/>barrassed, and, deprived of their valued

                  <lb/>ious, and hoped her path through life
                  <lb/>would be less dangerous and painful:
                  <lb/>yet, while she prepared her mind for
                  <lb/>whatever misfortunes might be inflicted,
                  <lb/>she still trusted that the blow she dread­
                  <lb/>ed would be long averted, as the loveli­
                  <lb/>ness of her daughters made her tremble
                  <lb/>for their fate.

                  <lb/>pected that in a year or two he would be

                  <lb/>and therefore he could not oppose his in­

                  <lb/>yet felt an irresistible pleasure at his
                  <lb/>brave boy evincing the same predilection

                 <lb/>The countenance of the latter was pleas­
                 <lb/>ing and animated; her figure was very
                 <lb/>small, but well proportioned, and had
                 <lb/>she not been marked with the small-pox,
                 <lb/>she would have been pretty; and her

                 <lb/>had a temporary wooden bridge placed
                 <lb/>across, for the convenience of walking
                 <lb/>to the garden, as it was more convenient
                 <lb/>than ferrying over in a boat.                   
           </p>
           <p>The garden had a wide terrace, which
                 <lb/>commanded a pleasing view, and the
                 <lb/>most rare, sweet-scented, and beautiful
                 <lb/>shrubs and flowers, were planted pro­
                 <lb/>fusely on each side. At the end of the
                 <lb/>terrace was a walk, shaded with high
                 <lb/>trees, terminated by a picturesque pond,
                 <lb/>planted on each side with weeping wil­
                 <lb/>lows. The terrace sloped down to a
                 <lb/>lawn rather extensive, with a wall all
                 <lb/>round. It was concealed with trees, so

                 <lb/>being pleased at having <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> dishes
                 <lb/>well dressed every day. His lordship
                 <lb/>has a great share of vivacity; the house
                 <lb/>is constantly full of company, and he
                 <lb/>will insist on my being always present,
                 <lb/>as well as the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> governess. But

                 <lb/>bly passionate; he swears and damns

                 <lb/>but my lord and herself have deceived
                 <lb/>me respecting my situation there. I
                 <lb/>was to be her companion, as she was ac­        
                 <lb/>quainted with my parents in <placeName>France</placeName>,
                 <lb/>and to instruct her little girls in <name>French</name>
                 <lb/>and music, which the governess does not
                 <lb/>properly understand, and good masters
                 <lb/>are not to be had in the country; but I 
                 <lb/>am now desired to teach two boys also,
                 <lb/>and another just come from school; a
                 <lb/>little cousin is likewise introduced at the
                 <lb/>lessons. What is still more ridiculous,
                 <lb/>not satisfied with this, when we are with­

                 <lb/>me read <name>French</name>, and the governess trans­
                 <lb/>lates it very indifferently, which is quite

                 <lb/>But, to make amends, <persName>lady Morrington</persName>
                 <lb/>is lively, gay, and good-natured—<foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">elle

                 <lb/>I have known some <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> ladies and
                 <lb/>gentlemen who have proved the most
                 <lb/>ardent and sincere friends, and I have
                 <lb/>known many of my countrymen and
                 <lb/>women, under a coarseness of behaviour
                 <lb/>that disgusts those accustomed to good
                 <lb/>society, conceal a deceitful insincere dis­
                 <lb/>position. But I thank you, <persName>Miss Wiz­
                 <lb/>zle</persName>, for your observations, as I wish my
                 <lb/>daughter to check her propensity to be
                 <lb/>so easily charmed with every new ob­
                 <lb/>ject, as she will find it dangerous, when
                 <lb/>she is introduced into the world, and
                 <lb/>has not her mother to always guide her
                 <lb/>in the choice of a friend or acquaint­
                 <lb/>ance: when she has seen as much of
                 <lb/>mankind as we have, she will not be so

           <p><persName>Miss Wizzle</persName> did not appear pleased

                 <lb/>who, in fact, complimented her highly
                 <lb/>by it, as <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> was ten years

                 <lb/>ties she always joined, in preference to
                 <lb/>the society of those more suitable to her
                 <lb/>time of life. She was now dressed in
                 <lb/>deep mourning, and looked very respect­
                 <lb/>able, with her hair thickly powdered, and
                 <lb/>as white as the sugar on a twelfth-cake.  
           </p>
           <p><persName>Miss Polly</persName> discouraged <persName>Rose's</persName> sudden
                 <lb/>partiality for <persName>mademoiselle de <placeName>Rimont</placeName></persName>,
                 <lb/>but proved herself equally weak, by af­
                 <lb/>fecting to be quite captivated with <persName>Miss
                 <lb/>Douglas</persName> and her sister; and calling them  
                 <lb/>her sweet young friends, hoped they
                 <lb/>should frequently meet and walk to­
                 <lb/>gether.  
           </p>  
           <p>As she was talking in this strain, <persName>Miss
                 <lb/>Jane Douglas</persName> said, with great <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">naïveté</foreign>—
                 <lb/><said>Don't be displeased, <persName>Miss Wizzle</persName>, but

            <p><persName>Jane</persName> found it difficult to repress an
                    <lb/>inclination to laugh, as she thought <persName>Miss
                 <lb/>Polly</persName> had no reason to fear being taken
                 <lb/>for a <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> lady, as her manners were
                 <lb/>so inferior. She was quite relieved at
                 <lb/>her rising to take leave; and when
                 <lb/>she was gone, diverted herself at her ex­
                 <lb/>pence.  
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> checked her.—<said>She is
                <lb/>certainly very ridiculous, <persName>Jane</persName>, but I
                <lb/>shall not allow you to laugh at her, as I
                <lb/>think her a good-natured well-meaning
                <lb/>woman, and will not have her censured,
                <lb/>unless I find any thing in her mind to
                <lb/>disapprove. For her prejudices I make
                <lb/>an allowance, as she has been educated
                <lb/>in a village almost two hundred miles
                <lb/>from <placeName>London</placeName>.</said>

            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> appeared perfectly happy, and

                <lb/><persName>Dolly</persName> knew, and was partial to the
                <lb/>kitchen department, and most laborious
                <lb/>employment, from having been accus­
                <lb/>tomed to violent exercise. <persName>Dolly</persName> was
                <lb/>infinitely pleased, as she preferred wait­
                <lb/>ing on the young ladies and <persName>Mrs. Doug­
                <lb/>las</persName>, and working at her needle, which
                <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> disliked.   
            </p> 
            <p>Adjoining the kitchen was a small
                <lb/>neat housekeeper's room, where <persName>Dolly</persName>
                <lb/>sat with <persName>Kamira</persName> when their toil was
                <lb/>finished. <persName>Dolly</persName> sometimes worked at
                <lb/>needlework, and <persName>Kamira</persName> sung <rs type="properAdjective">Esqui­
                <lb/>maux</rs> songs, and related stories of her
                <lb/>country, which she described to the
                <lb/>wonder-struck country girl, with their
                <lb/>sports and customs. Then would <persName>Dolly</persName>
                <lb/>astonish <persName>Kamira</persName> with tales she had heard
                <lb/>from her childhood, of ghosts and hob­

           <p>At the period of this history, the

                <lb/>and even the farmers, tradespeople, and

                <lb/>stitious, and believed in spirits, witches,
                <lb/>and fairies. The fairies they called fer­
                <lb/>ries and piskies; and <persName>Dolly</persName> told <persName>Kamira</persName>
                <lb/>there was a field near <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, called
                <lb/><placeName>Ferrie's Field</placeName>, where you could see the
                <lb/>rings in which they danced, and who­
                <lb/>ever went through that field at night
                <lb/>was pisky-led, which meant, that they
                <lb/>could not find their way out all night,
                <lb/>but kept walking about to discover the
                <lb/>stile, and did not, till the sun rose.   
           </p>
           <p><persName>Dolly</persName> said her uncle was pisky-led in
                <lb/>that field, and he heard the little ferries
                <lb/>laughing at him because he could not
                <lb/>find out either stile, as there were two
                <lb/>in this field, it being a thoroughfare.

           <p><persName>Felix</persName> and <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> were pass­
                <lb/>ing the housekeeper's room one evening,
                <lb/>when they heard <persName>Dolly</persName>, who had an
                <lb/>harmonious voice, singing a very pretty
                <lb/>tune. They both went into the room,
                <lb/>and asked the name of the song.

           <p><persName>Dolly</persName>, blushing, replied—<said direct="false">She was

                <lb/>they no laugh. Tell all about ghosts
                <lb/>in white, eyes on fire; and little ferries
                <lb/>dance, and laugh and sing. Oh, such

                <lb/>make me all fright, and yet like to hear

           <p><said>I shall be pleased to hear the stories,</said>

               <lb/>she seldom came, and she had not seen
               <lb/>her, though <persName>Robin</persName>, her father, had.
               <lb/>After apologizing for having a cold,

                               <lb/>field</placeName>, and directed their steps to <persName>doctor

                       <lb/>Wizzle's</persName> house, as he was usually styled.
                       <lb/>The general rarely accompanied them in
                       <lb/>these excursions, as he did not like com­
                       <lb/>pany, his ill state of health preventing him
                       <lb/>from enjoying any society; and though
                       <lb/>he seemed lately a little better, his time
                       <lb/>was most frequently passed in his library,
                       <lb/>garden, and in riding on horseback.  
                 </p>
                 <p><persName>Doctor Wizzle</persName> appeared to be near
                       <lb/>eighty, and had a plump, good-natured,
                       <lb/>rosy face. His figure was thick and
                       <lb/>short, and his wife's tall and thin. She
                       <lb/>was a very dark woman, and always
                       <lb/>held her hand to her head, from being
                       <lb/>troubled with a violent pain in her head
                       <lb/>continually. The son, a little plain man,
                       <lb/>with his mother's complexion, was sen­
                       <lb/>sible, well behaved, and a good disposi­
                       <lb/>tion; but his manners were formal in
                       <lb/>the extreme—frequently quite ludicrous.
                       <lb/><persName>Miss Wizzle</persName> was visiting in the village,
                       <lb/>but <persName>Miss Rachel</persName>, her sister, was pre­
                       <lb/>sent. In person she resembled her elder

                       <lb/>sister, but was quiet and inoffensive in
                       <lb/>her manners.
                  </p>
                 <p>When <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> and her children
                       <lb/>arrived at the apothecary's shop, they
                       <lb/>were ushered into a parlour, painted dark
                       <lb/>brown. <name>The Wizzles</name> rose to meet them,
                       <lb/>and advanced to the door, exclaiming all
                       <lb/>together—<said>This is a favour indeed!
                       <lb/>this is a favour indeed!</said>  
                 </p>
                 <p>The room was so obscure, being at the
                       <lb/>back of the shop, and painted so dis­
                       <lb/>mally, that <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> could hardly
                       <lb/>distinguish their physiognomy. At
                       <lb/>length, with great ceremony and com­
                       <lb/>pliments, they were seated quietly.
                 </p>
                 <p><said>So, <persName>Miss Jane</persName>,</said> said the little doctor,
                       <lb/>in his shewy plaid morning-gown, and
                       <lb/>placing his hands on his knees—<said>so,
                       <lb/>Miss, you are an <name>American</name>?</said>
                 </p>
                 <p><said>Oh no, sir,</said> <persName>Jane</persName> replied, <said>we
                       <lb/>were born in <placeName>England</placeName>, and have only
                       <lb/>resided several years in <placeName>America</placeName>.</said>

                       <lb/>stand, my dear; but you have early be­
                       <lb/>held another part of the world. I have
                       <lb/>sailed to the <rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> islands, though I
                       <lb/>have never seen <placeName>London</placeName>, or been more
                       <lb/>than thirty miles from this village, where
                       <lb/>I first drew breath.</said>
                 </p>
                 <p><said>I find, mad-dam,</said> cried <persName>Mr. Jerry
                       <lb/>Wizzle</persName>, who always drawled out the
                       <lb/>word madam ridiculously long and slow,
                       <lb/><said>that you enjoyed rational solitude
                       <lb/>when you first came to <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, not
                       <lb/>shunning human beings as tigers, or
                       <lb/>courting them as friends. I wish health
                       <lb/>may shower its blessings on the good ge­
                       <lb/>neral, and peace, mad-dam, strew his path
                       <lb/>with flowers. What more can the world
                       <lb/>give?</said>
                 </p>
                 <p><said>You are perfectly correct, sir,</said> re­
                       <lb/>plied <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, diverted with his
                       <lb/>uncommon formality.

                 <p>At this instant <persName>Miss Polly</persName> was an­
                       <lb/>nounced. She had returned the day be­
                       <lb/>fore from <placeName>Dawlish</placeName>, where she had been
                       <lb/>visiting since she called at <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, and

                       <lb/>was quite enraptured with it. Proudly
                       <lb/>she shone in all the glory of shining bu­
                       <lb/>gles, and a hat loaded with feathers, that
                       <lb/>waved like those on a horse at a funeral,
                       <lb/>and seemed adorned for conquest.  
                 </p>
                 <p><placeName>Dawlish</placeName> had quite reanimated her
                       <lb/>and turned her brain; she could never
                       <lb/>again endure <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>, it was so dull.
                       <lb/>There were several families of distinction
                       <lb/>at <placeName>Dawlish</placeName>, and a pack of hounds that
                       <lb/>go out three times a-week; she often
                       <lb/>fell in with them in her rides, and
                       <lb/>had she staid much longer, she would
                       <lb/>have been a keen sportswoman. The se­
                       <lb/>cond morning after her arrival she had
                       <lb/>a fine view of the Channel fleet, sailing
                       <lb/>past the place, and from her bed-room
                       <lb/>could see the finest sight in nature—the
                       <lb/>sun rising, as it were, from the ocean.

                       <lb/>more common things than the sun, do
                       <lb/>oblige us, <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, by drinking a

                       <lb/>daughters—I am fond of the company
                       <lb/>of young people; for your stay is so short
                       <lb/>now, we have hardly time to feel our
                       <lb/>pleasure.</said>  
                 </p>
                 <p><said>The days will lag tediously, mad­

                       <lb/>my mind's eye will see you, and my ear
                       <lb/>retain the sound of your voice; and I
                       <lb/>hope I shall behold those daughters  
                       <lb/>of yours, looking as very, very pretty as

                       <lb/>how you amuse yourselves, the Hall
                       <lb/>stands so very lonely. Do you ever
                       <lb/>play at cards, as they do in this village,

                 <p>In the evening they commenced their

                       <lb/>lived. Their way to it was down a long

                       <lb/>on each side, and the scenery was beau­

                       <lb/>looked very picturesque. Two other

                       <lb/>rural romantic effect. The banks were
                       <lb/>covered with wood strawberries, and
                       <lb/>nut-trees (intermingled with eglantine
                       <lb/>and woodbines), which promised to pro­

                 <p>In the miller's garden were several

                       <lb/>of flowers, rose-trees, and myrtles, in

                       <lb/>the first floor; the roses hung in blush­
                       <lb/>ing clusters, and diffused their perfumed
                       <lb/>odours, and the snowy blossoms of the

                       <lb/>now introduced them to the dame, who
                       <lb/>was a most respectable-looking old wo­
                       <lb/>man, about seventy; and they all entered
                       <lb/>the cottage. She wished them to walk  
                       <lb/>into her little parlour, but knowing the
                       <lb/>dame generally sat in the kitchen, they
                       <lb/>insisted on remaining there, as they were
                       <lb/>anxious not to derange her.  
                 </p>
                 <p>They admired the oaken dresser, or­
                       <lb/>namented with old-fashioned china plates,
                       <lb/>and the best teapot and tea-equipage.
                       <lb/>A very handsome clock was placed near
                       <lb/>the door, and an old japan cabinet stood
                       <lb/>in the corner, filled with punchbowls,
                       <lb/>glasses, jugs, and china, of an ancient
                       <lb/>date, that had been handed down, for
                       <lb/>many generations, to the miller.

                 <p><persName>Dolly</persName> now informed her aunt the

                       <lb/>glad to hear her relate some of her won­
                       <lb/>derful stories, which had so often enter­

                        <lb/>tale—yet many's the one I have amused
                        <lb/>their grandmamma with. She was a
                        <lb/>dear good lady, when I lived with her
                        <lb/>as her ladyship's maid. We were much
                        <lb/>of a muchness in point of age.</said>

                        <lb/>she was sitting on, and exclaimed—
                        <lb/><said>How! did you ever live with <persName>lady
                        <lb/>Treharne</persName>? and did you ever see our
                        <lb/>mamma?</said>           
                 </p>
                 <p><said>Ay, ay, Miss—many's the time,
                        <lb/>before you were born, or thought of.
                        <lb/>When I lived with your grandmamma,
                        <lb/>they did not have such fine ladies for
                        <lb/>maids as they do now-a-days. <persName>Miss
                        <lb/>Douglas</persName> is very like my dear mistress;
                        <lb/>it's paying you no bad compliment, Miss,
                        <lb/>so don't blush about it, for your grand­
                        <lb/>mamma was called the beauty of <placeName>Devon­ 
                        <lb/>shire</placeName>. But I believe, poor dear lady! 
                        <lb/>she died of a broken heart, at her son's
                        <lb/>turning out so wicked, and using his sis­

                        <lb/>cruel one! Excuse me, Miss, for speak­
                        <lb/>ing so of your uncle; but, indeed, your
                        <lb/>mamma is the flower of the family.</said>
                 </p>
                 <p><said>How very singular that my mother
                        <lb/>did not tell us this!</said> cried <persName>Felix</persName>.     
                 </p>
                 <p><said>I suppose, young gentleman, it is
                        <lb/>because it makes her unhappy to talk
                        <lb/>about it, as he is the same as no relation,
                        <lb/>since he never comes to see or inquire 
                        <lb/>after his sister or her children; therefore
                        <lb/>don't be noticing to her what I have
                        <lb/>told, as perhaps she would not like the
                        <lb/>cat to be let out of the bag.</said>
                 </p>
                 <p><said>But if my mother knew you lived
                        <lb/>here, she would be glad to see you, I am
                        <lb/>sure.</said>
                 </p>
                 <p><said>Why, I can't say, <persName>master Douglas</persName>;
                         <lb/>perhaps it will remind her of scenes best
                         <lb/>forgot; though, God knows, I should re­
                         <lb/>joice to see the dear lady I have carried
                         <lb/>in my arms when she was a baby, and I
                         <lb/>young and strong.</said>

                         <lb/>for a long time on this subject, in which
                         <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> occasionally joined; but <persName>Jane</persName> look­
                         <lb/>ed cross and discontented.
                 </p>
                 <p><said>We shall certainly inform my mo­

                         <lb/>you lived with <persName>lady Treharne</persName>,</said> said <persName>Mr.
                         <lb/>Douglas</persName>; <said>but we will have the pru­
                         <lb/>dence to avoid repeating your descrip­
                         <lb/>tion of my uncle, as we would not, for
                         <lb/>any consideration, make my dear mo­
                         <lb/>ther unhappy. That is the reason she
                         <lb/>often sighs and looks melancholy, which
                         <lb/>I attributed to my father's frequent ill­
                         <lb/>ness.</said>
                </p>
                 <p><said>But, <persName>dame Brownson</persName>,</said> exclaimed
                         <lb/><persName>Jane</persName>, in a peevish tone of voice, <said>I wish
                         <lb/>you would tell me some ghostly or hob­
                         <lb/>goblin story.</said>  
                 </p>
                 <p><said>It is too late,</said> replied <persName>Felix</persName>, <said>we
                         <lb/>must hasten home, or it will be quite
                         <lb/>dark before we reach the Hall, and our

                 </p>
                 <p><said>No, it won't; do stay a little longer.

                 </p>
                 <p><said>We have heard what is much more
                         <lb/>interesting—and perhaps it will fatigue
                         <lb/><persName>Mrs. Brownson</persName>; another time will do as
                         <lb/>well, and we shall have a good excuse

                         <lb/>she walked, as she repeated these words,
                         <lb/>in no gentle tone, into the garden.
                 </p>
                 <p><said>I am sorry,</said> exclaimed <persName>Felix</persName>, <said>you
                         <lb/>are so childish, selfish, and rude. Pray
                         <lb/>excuse her, <persName>Mrs. Brownson</persName>; she will
                         <lb/>know better when she is older, for her
                         <lb/>heart is not so much in fault as her tem­
                         <lb/>per, which cannot endure the most tri­
                         <lb/>fling disappointment.</said>
                 </p>
                 <p><said>I am sorry for her,</said> replied the

                         <lb/>life with any comfort? It is seldom

                         <lb/>richest. Ah dear! she seems of her

                 <p>Just as <persName>dame Brownson</persName> finished speak­
                         <lb/>ing, they heard a loud exclamation from
                         <lb/><persName>Jane</persName>. She had been peeping into one
                         <lb/>of the hives, and having disturbed some
                         <lb/>of the bees, two had stung her on the
                         <lb/>forehead, which swelled up in a moment.
                 </p>
                 <p>The dame applied some sweet-oil to it,
                         <lb/>and they wished her good-night, <persName>Jane's</persName>
                         <lb/>good-humour not being heightened by
                         <lb/>this accident.
                 </p>
                 <p>Her brother and sister were sorry for
                         <lb/>her mishap, but had difficulty to refrain
                         <lb/>from smiling, she looked so ruefully with
                         <lb/>this addition to her countenance, which
                         <lb/>had previously lost all sweetness from her
                         <lb/>cross temper.
                 </p>
                 <p>As they walked forward, a poor wo­
                         <lb/>man was sitting by the side of the road,
                         <lb/>who you could perceive had been very
                         <lb/>handsome, though burnt with the sun,
                         <lb/>and dressed like a beggar. A boy of
                         <lb/>five years old, well dressed, except his

                         <lb/>before her. Soon after a sailor on
                         <lb/>crutches, with one leg, joined them, and
                         <lb/>bowed to the young ladies and <persName>Felix</persName> re­
                         <lb/>spectfully. Neither asked charity, though
                         <lb/>they seemed to want it. 
                 </p>
                 <p>Something in their appearance moved
                         <lb/>the compassionate heart of <persName>Rose</persName>, and ap­
                         <lb/>proaching, she gave them a few halfpence.
                         <lb/>They thanked her with a modest air, and
                         <lb/>the woman then related their distress.
                 </p>
                 <p>They had already travelled a hundred
                         <lb/>miles, on their road to a gentleman's
                         <lb/>house, who respected her husband, and
                         <lb/>would befriend him and his family. The
                         <lb/>night before they had slept in the open
                         <lb/>air, not having money to pay for a lodg­
                         <lb/>ing, though they had been accustomed

                         <lb/>furnished. Her husband had been a sail­

                         <lb/>or companion, treated so well as ours.
                         <lb/>In my opinion, too much attention to

                 <p><persName>Lady Morrington</persName> made some trifling

                         <lb/>It is not surprising, when we consider
                         <lb/>that she was only a servant before she
                         <lb/>was married to <persName>lord Morrington</persName>, who
                         <lb/>has educated and improved her. How
                         <lb/>different is my lord! With all his faults,
                         <lb/>he has no haughtiness, and plays with
                         <lb/>me as if I was his child. If she were
                         <lb/>mistress, she would not let me dine at
                         <lb/>table, and says that a governess, or
                         <lb/>companion, ought never to make morn­
                         <lb/>ing visits, and she would be enraged if I
                         <lb/>did. You see, <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">ma chere</foreign>, one cannot
                         <lb/>know people directly, nor indeed for a
                         <lb/>long time, for I thought <persName>lady Morring­

                         <lb/>find it is not all roses. How true is the

                         <lb/>days. Her ladyship expected a large
                         <lb/>party about that period to assemble and
                         <lb/>remain a fortnight at the Castle, observ­
                         <lb/>ing, at the same time, that the general
                         <lb/>and <persName>Felix</persName> could ride over every day, as
                         <lb/>she had not room sufficient to accommo­

                 <p>As <persName>lady Morrington</persName> was one of those

                         <lb/>her party. <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> was, in society,

                         <lb/>bred; she was perfectly handsome, and

                         <lb/>ness, made them a desirable acquisition,
                         <lb/>more particularly as <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>,
                         <lb/>though not affluent, was known to be
                         <lb/>related to one of the most ancient fami­
                         <lb/>lies in <placeName>England</placeName>. The general was like­

                         <lb/>thy. <persName>Rose Douglas</persName> was indeed too
                         <lb/>young to be introduced into company,
                         <lb/>but she looked older than she was, and

                         <lb/>father's that I first drew breath, five
                         <lb/>years after the birth of my brother, the
                         <lb/>present <persName>lord Treharne</persName>. When I was of
                         <lb/>an age to distinguish one object from an­
                         <lb/>other, and capable of any attachment, I
                         <lb/>was partially fond of my brother, as he

                         <lb/>and playing with me. He was then a

                 <p>The days of my childhood passed like

                         <lb/>painful. My father inherited but a small

                         <lb/>my brother <persName>George</persName> had been two years
                         <lb/>at college. Heavy bills, which he had
                         <lb/>incurred contrary to their wishes and ad­
                         <lb/>vice, were brought in; yet they had re­
                         <lb/>presented to him, when he was sent to
                         <lb/><placeName>Oxford</placeName>, that if he wished to sustain the
                         <lb/>appearance of a nobleman and gentleman,
                         <lb/>he must not be extravagant. Instead
                         <lb/>of receiving the mild remonstrances of
                         <lb/>his parents with contrition, <persName>George</persName> gave
                         <lb/>way to the violence of passion he too
                         <lb/>frequently indugled; and irritating his
                         <lb/>father, caused my mother to suffer the
                         <lb/>deepest affliction. Her sweet and gen­
                         <lb/>tle disposition could not endure these
                         <lb/>scenes of indelicate altercation on the
                         <lb/>part of a son she loved with maternal

                         <lb/>husband, that she might be enabled to
                         <lb/>supply my unfeeling brother with addi­

                         <lb/>very inconvenient to them.

                 <p>By these precautions and depriva­

                         <lb/>How striking was the alteration vice and
                         <lb/>dissipation had made in his appearance,
                         <lb/>though he had only attained the twenty-
                         <lb/>second year of his age! A sallow pale­
                         <lb/>ness, intermixed with spots of some erup­
                         <lb/>tive humour, had taken place of the man­

                         <lb/>the fairest skin a man should possess.
                         <lb/>His figure, graced by personal symme­
                         <lb/>try, was now disfigured by a distorted
                         <lb/>limping gait, proceeding from a wound
                         <lb/>received in his thigh, when engaged in a

                 <p>Alas! had his figure been alone de­

                         <lb/>of a fine person. Had this disfigurement
                         <lb/>originated from any brave or noble ac­

                         <lb/>the sorrows of another. His despair had
                         <lb/>arisen nearly to frenzy, and he would
                         <lb/>eventually have destroyed himself, had
                         <lb/>not one ray of hope darted into his ima­
                         <lb/>gination. He was acquainted with a rich
                         <lb/>vulgar young man, of the name of <persName>Mug­
                         <lb/>gins</persName>, who had endeavoured at intimacy
                         <lb/>with <persName>George</persName>, and been neglected by him.
                         <lb/>His father had acquired an enormous for­
                         <lb/>tune in trade, to which was added the

                         <lb/>having occurred after he was grown up
                         <lb/>to manhood. Knowing that my brother
                         <lb/>was the son of a lord, his attentions to
                         <lb/>him were overpowering, as he had a
                         <lb/>great deference for persons of rank, from
                         <lb/>recollecting the lowness of his origin.
                         <lb/>The idea, therefore, suddenly suggested
                         <lb/>itself to <persName>George</persName>, to borrow a large sum
                         <lb/>of money of <persName>Mr. Muggins</persName>, and promise
                         <lb/>to repay it at some future period, or else
                         <lb/>procure him the hand of his sister in
                         <lb/>marriage, which, from his ambition to
                         <lb/>be allied to rank, he was convinced
                         <lb/>would make him enraptured at such a
                         <lb/>proposal. In consequence of this scheme,
                         <lb/>my brother gave so fascinating a descrip­
                         <lb/>tion of my beauty, accomplishments, and
                         <lb/>sweetness of temper, that the foolish
                         <lb/>young man became quite enamoured of
                         <lb/>the favourable portrait he drew, without

                 <p>From the circumstances that had

                 <p>When <persName>lord Treharne</persName> recovered from

                         <lb/>tined for me, hoping to be again enabled
                         <lb/>to save part of his yearly income, to re­
                         <lb/>place my little property. But his con­
                         <lb/>stitution was so enfeebled by the fever,
                         <lb/>caused by the shock it had sustained at
                         <lb/>discovering my brother's wickedness,
                         <lb/>that he gradually grew weaker and
                         <lb/>weaker, and was soon pronounced to be
                         <lb/>in a rapid decline.

                         <lb/>described with justice. She passed her
                         <lb/>nights without sleeping, watching by
                         <lb/>his bedside, and never quitted him, un­

                         <lb/>The pain she felt at seeing him suffer
                         <lb/>imparted so much anguish, that her
                         <lb/>health was materially injured, and threat­

                 <p>At length his sufferings became less
                         <lb/>acute, and calmly did he close his virtu­
                         <lb/>ous life. His last moments were only
                         <lb/>embittered with regret at quitting the
                         <lb/>world unable to provide more liberally for
                         <lb/>my mother and myself: yet it was con­
                         <lb/>soling to his feelings, that, while <persName>lady
                         <lb/>Treharne</persName> lived, his jointure would am­
                         <lb/>ply provide for us both.

                 <p>He little thought that her sensibi­

                         <lb/>from long enjoying the comfort of a mo­
                         <lb/>ther's love. With difficulty they suc­
                         <lb/>ceeded in persuading her to quit his
                         <lb/>breathless form, where she mourned over
                         <lb/>him who was dearest to her on earth,
                         <lb/>with all the agony of an affectionate
                         <lb/>heart; and, had she lived, would have

                 <p>Thus was I cruelly deprived, by a
                         <lb/>brother's corrupt principles, of the best
                         <lb/>of fathers, and my mother of a husband

                         <lb/>regard. The conflict was too severe, and,
                         <lb/>six weeks after <persName>lord Treharne's</persName> decease,
                         <lb/>she followed him to that peaceful grave,
                         <lb/>where sorrow cannot afflict the good, or
                         <lb/>insult reach them, leaving me a miser­
                         <lb/>able and deserted orphan.

                 <p>Subdued with keenest anguish for
                         <lb/>their loss, I was insensible, for a long
                         <lb/>time, to any thought of my future des­
                         <lb/>tiny. My brother, on the contrary, was
                         <lb/>remorseless, and only regretted that his
                         <lb/>extravagance had prevented them from
                         <lb/>bequeathing him any ready money, and
                         <lb/>that by their death he inherited the fa­
                         <lb/>mily estates only. My mother had been
                         <lb/>so good as to sell her jewels, to gratify
                         <lb/>his profusion when he went on his tra­
                         <lb/>vels; yet he even seemed to envy my

                         <lb/>gardens and fields.

                         <lb/>They were consequently relieved in their

                         <lb/>flowed. At this critical moment, your

                         <lb/>and kindness, I frankly confided to him

                         <lb/>assured him that I accepted him with

                         <lb/>would secure my happiness, he looked
                         <lb/>animated and pleased. He would have
                         <lb/>spoken to <persName>George</persName> directly, as he had too
                         <lb/>much proper spirit to fear him; but I
                         <lb/>would not subject him to his insolence,

                         <lb/>repaired to the house of the lady who
                         <lb/>had been my governess, and was much
                         <lb/>attached to me.
                 </p>
                 <p>There I remained till I had the felicity
                         <lb/>of being united to your father, and our
                         <lb/>marriage took place about a week after
                         <lb/>I left my brother's protection. His rage,
                         <lb/>I was informed, was quite ungovernable,
                         <lb/>when he found I was gone without
                         <lb/>yielding to his wish to unite me to
                         <lb/><persName>Muggins</persName>, for he weakly imagined to
                         <lb/>terrify me into compliance.
                 </p>

                         <lb/>caused me any uneasiness but the fear
                         <lb/>of losing him. Of my brother, <persName>lord
                         <lb/>Treharne</persName>, I have not had any intelli­
                         <lb/>gence, except that he exists, for seven
                         <lb/>or eight years. Before that time I un­
                         <lb/>derstood that, conformable to his princi­
                         <lb/>ples, he married, soon after I quitted
                         <lb/>him, a very rich citizen's daughter he
                         <lb/>despised, for the advantage of her wealth.
                         <lb/>Of course, they live wretchedly toge­
                         <lb/>ther, as his vile temper made her life, as
                         <lb/>well as his own, miserable.

                         <lb/>quent dejection. Can I be otherwise
                         <lb/>than melancholy, when the recollection
                         <lb/>of those excellent parents, and their un­
                         <lb/>merited sufferings, calls forth the tear of
                         <lb/>deep regret? My only consolation is
                         <lb/>the remembrance of their distinguished
                         <lb/>and amiable virtues. May this narrative

                         <lb/>the example of your uncle be a warning

                         <lb/>the destroyer of his father and mother—
                         <lb/>not, indeed, by unlawful murder, which
                         <lb/>would have been mercy, but by a linger­
                         <lb/>ing death of sorrow, inflicted by the
                         <lb/>conduct of a child they tenderly loved.
                         <lb/>I hope it will instruct <persName>Jane</persName> to correct
                         <lb/>the violence of her passions, which I
                         <lb/>have often shuddered to find so strongly
                         <lb/>resembling her uncle's disposition. He
                         <lb/>was unhappy himself, and disturbed the
                         <lb/>peace of all who had the misfortune to
                         <lb/>be connected with him.

                         <lb/>proof with good-humour, but sullenness.
                         <lb/>She arose to quit the room, saying, with

                         <lb/>ed her perverse daughter—<said>I am

                         <lb/>from the different reflections that obtru­
                         <lb/>ded involuntarily. <persName>Jane</persName>, who slept in

                         <lb/>was in a sound slumber, when <persName>Miss

                         <lb/>the chamber-door. The stairs were close
                         <lb/>to it, and after a few minutes, she heard
                         <lb/>footsteps softly descending the staircase,
                         <lb/>which surprised and attracted her atten­
                         <lb/>tion. The house-clock at that moment
                         <lb/>struck two, and she was startled at hear­
                         <lb/>ing any one up so late, as the whole fa­
                         <lb/>mily usually retired to rest before mid­

                 <p>The low sound of voices, and of pass­

                         <lb/>an hour all was still and silent. <persName>Rose</persName>
                         <lb/>felt an uneasy sensation, and unable to
                         <lb/>compose herself to rest, she got out of
                         <lb/>bed, and looked from the window, as the
                         <lb/>moon shone bright and clear. It dis­

                         <lb/>was uncommon, in that retired spot.—
                         <lb/>About ten or twelve horses were wait­
                         <lb/>ing on the opposite side of the river,
                         <lb/>with four men seated near them, on the
                         <lb/>bank. In a few minutes they were join­
                         <lb/>ed by eight others, and mounting in
                         <lb/>great haste, they all rode off towards the
                         <lb/>sea-coast.

                 <p>Of this appearance she was perplexed
                         <lb/>what to think. Sometimes she fancied
                         <lb/>the horsemen were robbers, or smugglers,
                         <lb/>and had some relation with the voices
                         <lb/>and footsteps she had heard on the stair­
                         <lb/>case. Whatever might be the event,
                         <lb/>she felt alarmed and agitated, and obser­
                         <lb/>ving the precaution of bolting the door,
                         <lb/>which had hitherto been neglected, she
                         <lb/>once more sought her restless pillow,
                         <lb/>and, notwithstanding all her apprehen­

                         <lb/>was haunted by the spirits of their ma­

                         <lb/>of their wicked son. <persName>Felix</persName> added, that

                         <lb/>being haunted, as it would revive the
                         <lb/>memory of scenes they wished to forget.
                         <lb/>It might possibly have been <persName>Kamira</persName> and

                         <lb/>peated, to awaken him, as he slept in the

                         <lb/>ness from her mind, as he was of opinion
                         <lb/>there was no real cause for anxiety.

                 <p>In the afternoon, when <persName>dame Brown­

                         <lb/>with the general. It was a stormy even­
                         <lb/>ing, and though the Hall was three miles
                         <lb/>from the sea, you could hear its distant
                         <lb/>roaring.

                         <lb/>say there is a gentleman and lady seen
                         <lb/>and heard there, at <placeName>Westpool</placeName> (which is

                         <lb/>orphan lady, whom he followed about
                         <lb/>whereever she went, and would not let
                         <lb/>her rest, trying all he could to gain her
                         <lb/>love, and promising her marriage. But
                         <lb/>this he never intended, thinking it was          
                         <lb/>an honour enough for him to notice her 
                         <lb/>as a mistress, as he was a great lord, and
                         <lb/>she a poor young lady, without a far­ 
                         <lb/>thing. At length, with a great deal of
                         <lb/>persuasion, she ran away with him; and 
                         <lb/>after a few weeks, he picked a quarrel
                         <lb/>with her, and left her without a penny to 
                         <lb/>help herself with. The loss of him she          
                         <lb/>truly loved afflicted her more than being 
                         <lb/>in want, and in a fit of crazy madness
                         <lb/>she flung herself into the sea, from a rock
                         <lb/>at <placeName>Westpool</placeName>. But the vengeance of God,

                         <lb/>timely end, and dragged by the stirrup
                         <lb/>to so great a distance, that his body was 
                         <lb/>horribly mangled, and his face smashed
                         <lb/>all to pieces, that not a feature could be

                 <p>They all looked, and were much in­

                         <lb/>about sixteen, in a clean but faded green
                         <lb/>and black livery, washing a pair of stock­
                         <lb/>ings in the river. He then hung the
                         <lb/>stockings on a bush to dry, and taking
                         <lb/>the white neckcloth from his neck, wash­
                         <lb/>ed it also. After washing it, he held it
                         <lb/>himself, to dry in the wind and sun,

                 </p>
                 <p>Wholly occupied in his cleanly em­
                         <lb/>ployment, he anxiously pursued it with­

                         <lb/>though many persons happened to walk
                         <lb/>that way at the time, and looked at him
                         <lb/>with curiosity and surprise. His face
                         <lb/>was pale, but his shirt as white as snow,
                         <lb/>which he had undoubtedly washed in a
                         <lb/>pond, stream, or river.

                 </p>
                 <p>A word was sufficient for the warm­
                         <lb/>hearted <persName>Kamira</persName>, who, on hearing this,
                         <lb/>beckoned to him, and going to the river­
                         <lb/>side, got into the boat, and soon ferried

                 <p>The story he told was simple and pa­
                         <lb/>thetic. His young master, with whom he
                         <lb/>lived, and was attached to, having died
                         <lb/>suddenly, he was returning on foot to
                         <lb/>see his friends in <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, who were re­
                         <lb/>spectable farmers, when he was over­
                         <lb/>taken in a lonely road by a gang of rob­
                         <lb/>bers, who robbed him of all his money  
                         <lb/>and clothes, except what he had on, and
                         <lb/>would even have stripped him of them,
                         <lb/>had not a sudden noise disturbed, and
                         <lb/>caused them to run off in haste.
                 </p>
                 <p>The general, on hearing this account,
                         <lb/>suffered him to remain all night at the

                         <lb/>comfort to his friends.
                 </p>
                 <p>On his arrival at his home, he wrote a

                         <lb/>bitant, as it was so much improved since
                         <lb/>they visited <persName>Mrs. Brownson</persName> three months
                         <lb/>since.
                 </p>
                 <p>The storm increased most violently,
                         <lb/>and the rain and hail fell so fast, that it
                         <lb/>was no time for ceremony, and they
                         <lb/>hastened to the cottage, and loudly
                         <lb/>knocked at the door. A black girl
                         <lb/>opened it, and a short fat woman, gen­
                         <lb/>teelly dressed, came forward, and beg­
                         <lb/>ged them, with great civility, to enter.
                         <lb/>Gladly they consented; and when they
                         <lb/>walked into the passage, the rain drop­
                         <lb/>ped from their dresses, and streamed on
                         <lb/>the floor. 
                 </p>
                 <p>The lady politely insisted on their

                         <lb/>ments while theirs were being dried.
                         <lb/>With great good-nature she likewise
                         <lb/>offered them a bed, should the tempest
                         <lb/>continue, as the general did not keep a
                         <lb/>carriage, and none nearer than <placeName>Exeter</placeName>
                         <lb/>was to be procured.
                 </p>
                 <p>The storm continued to rage with
                         <lb/>unabated violence till two hours after it
                         <lb/>was dark. At length its fury lessened
                         <lb/>—the warring elements were calmed,
                         <lb/>and it quite cleared up.
                 </p>
                 <p>They made many grateful acknow­
                         <lb/>ledgements to <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>, the widow
                         <lb/>lady, for her friendly attention and
                         <lb/>hospitality, and returned to <placeName>Treharne</placeName>,
                         <lb/>accompanied by <persName>Sophia</persName>, the black girl,
                         <lb/>to whom they made a present for her
                         <lb/>trouble.
                 </p> 
                 <p>They found the general and <persName>Mrs.

                         <lb/>unpleasant intelligence that they had left
                         <lb/>the mill several hours; but they quieted
                         <lb/>their apprehensions with the hope that
                         <lb/>they had taken shelter somewhere.
                 </p>
                 <p>With the kindness <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> had
                         <lb/>evinced to their children they were much
                         <lb/>pleased. They described her as having
                         <lb/>the remains of a very handsome face,
                         <lb/>with a diminutive fat person. Her con­
                         <lb/>versation was suitable to a woman who
                         <lb/>had received a very superior education,
                         <lb/>and whose mind had been highly culti­
                         <lb/>vated. Extremely lively and eccentric,
                         <lb/>she was of that character that was cer­
                         <lb/>tain of pleasing two young people who
                         <lb/>knew nothing of the world, and had never
                         <lb/>seen any one like her. She laughed im­
                         <lb/>moderately, and would repeat scraps of
                         <lb/>poetry in the most theatrical style, which
                         <lb/>was quite a novelty to them.

                 <p>The following day was remarkably

                         <lb/>which <persName>Kamira</persName> was to carry, as their
                         <lb/>mother understood from <persName>Jane</persName> that <persName>Mrs.
                         <lb/>Pryce</persName> had four children, two of whom
                         <lb/>were very young, and she concluded
                         <lb/>the fruit would be very acceptable for
                         <lb/>them.

                        <lb/>which opened with a wicket-gate, they
                        <lb/>heard a most discordant noise, that
                        <lb/>sounded as if some person was scolding
                        <lb/>furiously. They tapped at the door;
                        <lb/>but the harsh sounds within prevented
                        <lb/>their being attended to, and gently lift­
                        <lb/>ing the latch, they walked in, and found
                        <lb/><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> in the passage, with a stick
                        <lb/>in her hand, beating the black girl.

                <p>The girl was crouched on her knees
                        <lb/>before her, crying, while she loaded her

                        <lb/>no sooner did she perceive the young
                        <lb/>ladies and their attendant, than she
                        <lb/>ceased her clamour, and welcomed them
                        <lb/>with an affected smile of good-humour,

                        <lb/>while the poor girl silently made her
                        <lb/>retreat.
                </p> 
                <p><persName>Kamira</persName> had not been accustomed to
                        <lb/>such scenes at the general's, and could
                        <lb/>hardly restrain her indignation. She
                        <lb/>would, with her natural warmth of tem­
                        <lb/>per and frankness, have declared her
                        <lb/>anger at this barbarous sight, had not
                        <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> looked expressively at her. This
                        <lb/>alone prevented her from mentioning
                        <lb/>her abhorrence of such inhuman beha­
                        <lb/>viour, which was peculiarly revolting in
                        <lb/>a female who had any pretensions to the
                        <lb/>character of a gentlewoman, and whose
                        <lb/>education should have made her more
                        <lb/>refined.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> insisted that the young

                       <lb/>gladly assented, saying they had none,
                       <lb/>as most of their acquaintance in the

                       <lb/>the specimen she had just witnessed of
                       <lb/><persName>Mrs. Pryce's</persName> inhumanity had made an un­
                       <lb/>favourable impression: but when <persName>Rose</persName>
                       <lb/>found that <persName>Jane</persName> was determined to stay,
                       <lb/>she consented to be with her, as she did
                       <lb/>not like to leave her there by herself.
                       <lb/>She sent a message by <persName>Kamira</persName> to her
                       <lb/>mother, and cautioned the <name>Indian</name> not to
                       <lb/>repeat what she had seen of <persName>Mrs. Pryce's</persName>
                       <lb/>behaviour.

               <p><persName>Kamira</persName> was attached to all the family,

                       <lb/>commands, she was pleased when the

               <p>The conversation, after <persName>Kamira</persName> left
                       <lb/>them, was chiefly supported by <persName>Jane</persName>
                       <lb/>and <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>, while <persName>Rose</persName> amused

                       <lb/>natured young strangers, as <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>
                       <lb/>had rarely any visitors, and were con­

                       <lb/>forbidden by their mother, after they
                       <lb/>had played an hour with <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>.

               <p><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> placed a stick by her side

                       <lb/>waddled after them in a rage, and inflict­
                       <lb/>ed corporal chastisement. Accustomed
                       <lb/>daily to this correction, it did not pre­

               </p>
               <p>About an hour before dinner, <persName>Mrs.
                       <lb/>Pryce</persName> left them to dress herself, as she
                       <lb/>styled it, which was very necessary, as
                       <lb/>she was exceedingly dirty, which they
                       <lb/>had not observed when they took shel­
                       <lb/>ter from the storm at her cottage, as it
                       <lb/>was nearly dark then. Her skin had
                       <lb/>the appearance of not having been wash­
                       <lb/>ed for a long time; and her hair, natural­
                       <lb/>ly a pretty colour, was disguised with
                       <lb/>dirt and grease.
               </p>
               <p>The eldest daughter was named <persName>An­
                       <lb/>gelica</persName>; and when her mother had re­
                       <lb/>tired to arrange herself, <persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName>

                       <lb/>were astonished and diverted to hear
                       <lb/><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> exclaim, in a voice of thun­
                       <lb/>der—<said><persName>Sophia</persName>! <persName>Sophia</persName>! bring me my
                       <lb/>rouge-pot.</said>
               </p>
               <p><persName>Sophia</persName> could not find it; and after
                       <lb/>striking her two or three blows, <persName>Mrs.
                       <lb/>Pryce</persName> again thundered forth—<said><persName>Ange­
                       <lb/>lica</persName>! <persName>Angelica</persName>! where is my rouge-
                       <lb/>pot? You ought to know, <persName>Angelica</persName>,
                       <lb/>where my rouge-pot is.</said>
              </p>
              <p>The child answered—<said>Indeed, dear
                      <lb/>mamma, I do not know where it is, but
                      <lb/>I will look, dear mamma.</said>
              </p>
              <p><said>Go then!—Fly!</said>
              </p>
              <p><persName>Angelica</persName> and the rest of these child­
                      <lb/>ren were all taught to say <said>dear mam­
                      <lb/>ma</said>, at every word, which sounded
                      <lb/>quite absurd, and was an affectation of
                      <lb/>affection.
              </p>
              <p>After the tumult had subsided, and

                      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> appeared with a clean face
                      <lb/>and hands, that had been long unwash­

                      <lb/>and even to her nose, which gave her a
                      <lb/>very ruddy appearance, and would have
                      <lb/>deceived any one, so natural did this
                      <lb/>bloom appear.
              </p>
              <p><said>How much it resembles nature!</said>
                      <lb/>exclaimed <persName>Rose</persName>, unthinkingly.
              </p>
              <p><said>You think so, do you?—does it
                      <lb/>not? I suppose you put on yours in
                      <lb/>the same manner? But you have rather
                      <lb/>too much carmine on your cheeks.</said>
              </p>
              <p><persName>Rose</persName> blushed, and said she never wore
                      <lb/>any.
              </p>
              <p><said>Come, don't be so sly. How art­
                      <lb/>ful you are! I won't believe such non­
                      <lb/>sense. Every body wears it, even men.</said>
              </p>
              <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> did not think it worth
                      <lb/>while to answer this ridiculous and
                      <lb/>unfounded assertion; and <persName>Sophia</persName> came
                      <lb/>in that moment to announce that the

              <p><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> withdrew to superintend

                      <lb/>loudly vociferating, and abusing <persName>Sophia</persName>
                      <lb/>because there was not a clean tablecloth
                      <lb/>for dinner.
              </p>
              <p><persName>Sophia</persName> excused herself by saying—
                      <lb/><said>You know, ma'am, we have but one
                      <lb/>tablecloth, and that is soiled.</said>
             </p>           
              <p><said>Begone then, wretch, and bring me
                      <lb/>a clean sheet—that will do.</said>
              </p>
              <p>At hearing this, <persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName> could
                      <lb/>with difficulty restrain themselves from
                      <lb/>laughing when she returned.
              </p>
              <p>The sheet was brought in, and an ex­
                      <lb/>cellent and expensive dinner placed on
                      <lb/>it, with a great deal of wine and ale.
                      <lb/>The poor children were allowed to be
                      <lb/>present, and eagerly looked at them
                      <lb/>when they were eating, but were not
                      <lb/>suffered to taste any of the good things,
                      <lb/>which made <persName>Rose</persName> quite unhappy; and
                      <lb/>she petitioned for them to have at least
                      <lb/>some of the tart or pudding. But the
                      <lb/>hard-hearted greedy <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> refused,
                      <lb/>while she feasted and eagerly devoured
                      <lb/>the best on the table.

              <p>When they had dined, the children
                      <lb/>were sent into the kitchen with <persName>Sophia</persName>,
                      <lb/>to a meal of potatoes and fat, mixed to­
                      <lb/>gether, which their mother said was
                      <lb/>better for their health than any other
                      <lb/>nourishment.
              </p>
              <p>After dinner, <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>, who had
                      <lb/>drank a great deal of ale and wine, threw
                      <lb/>herself on the sofa, where she fell fast
                      <lb/>asleep, and snored loudly.
              </p> 
              <p>The black girl went up stairs to ar­
                      <lb/>range the bed-rooms; and the children
                      <lb/>having no one to take care of or repri­
                      <lb/>mand them, ran into the garden, and
                      <lb/>amused themselves with doing a great
                      <lb/>deal of mischief.
              </p> 
              <p><persName>Rose</persName> entertained herself with a book,
                      <lb/>and <persName>Jane</persName> in playing with a little pug­
                      <lb/>dog, that knew a variety of tricks.

              <p>When <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> awoke from her

                      <lb/>call.
              </p>
              <p>The sisters assisted <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> in
                      <lb/>searching all over her little habitation
                      <lb/>for the unfortunate black girl, and at
                      <lb/>length discovered her stretched fast
                      <lb/>asleep on one of the children's beds,
                      <lb/>overcome with fatigue and ill-usage.
                      <lb/>She was going to make the bed, when
                      <lb/>she sunk on it exhausted.

              <p>At this well-known summons, the

                      <lb/>thick gruel, but the most dirty ill-made
                      <lb/>mess they had ever seen. Poor little

                      <lb/>ready to cry for joy. They all seemed
                      <lb/>glad of their supper, as well as little 
                      <lb/><persName>Tommy</persName>, having had but a scanty meal

                      <lb/>expressed her dislike of <persName>Mrs. Pryce's</persName>
                      <lb/>conduct and disposition to her sister,
                      <lb/>observing, that the only excuse she could
                      <lb/>make for her was, that she must be
                      <lb/>mad. If she was not, she really was
                      <lb/>afraid she was a very wicked woman,
                      <lb/>from her cruel treatment of <persName>Sophia</persName>, and
                      <lb/>severity and injustice to her children.—<said>I

                      <lb/><said>that our parents will approve of any

                      <lb/>and inhumanity disclose itself more, I
                      <lb/>shall certainly not conceal my sentiments

                      <lb/>absurd, and ultimately procured his li­
                      <lb/>berty. He had been to the <placeName>East Indies</placeName>
                      <lb/>in the early period of his life, and travel­
                      <lb/>led over the greater part of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, be­
                      <lb/>sides residing many years in <placeName>France</placeName>;
                      <lb/>therefore the general and his lady ex­
                      <lb/>pected to receive a great deal of informa­
                      <lb/>tion and entertainment from him, as he
                      <lb/>was near seventy, and a man of educa­
                      <lb/>tion.
              </p>
              <p>But he woefully disappointed their ex­
                      <lb/>pectations. He could speak neither
                      <lb/><name>French</name> nor <name>English</name> well, his discourse
                      <lb/>being a mixture of both; and his con­
                      <lb/>versation, if ladies were present, inter­
                      <lb/>larded with bombast and fine-sounding
                      <lb/>ridiculous compliments. When he was
                      <lb/>introduced to <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> and her
                      <lb/>daughters, he exclaimed—<said>Here is a

              <p><persName>Doctor Owen</persName> wore a <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> wig, ex­

                      <lb/>was its appearance, that they did not
                      <lb/>suppose it was a peruke, till, in bowing
                      <lb/>profoundly and awkwardly, it fell from
                      <lb/>his head, leaving it quite bare. He was
                      <lb/>very much confused; and as he took it
                      <lb/>up and adjusted it, laid all the fault on
                      <lb/>the wig—<said>They make the wigs so bad­

                      <lb/>voice, <said>that one cannot keep them fast
                      <lb/>on one's head. I am very sorry indeed
                      <lb/>for this accident; I beg you ten thou­

                     <lb/>ridiculous as his manners, and he wore a
                     <lb/>large red linen waistcoat, with flaps.
                     <lb/>When they had seen him before, he was
                     <lb/>dressed in a handsome suit of black,
                     <lb/>which made him appear, as he had been
                     <lb/>good-looking in his youth, most respect­
                     <lb/>able; but he was as whimsical in his
                     <lb/>dress as in every thing, and often va­
                     <lb/>ried it.
             </p> 
             <p><persName>Mr. Eustace</persName> was between thirty and
                     <lb/>forty years of age. He had been an at­
                     <lb/>torney, but from extravagance and ex­
                     <lb/>treme dissipation, had incurred debts to
                     <lb/>a large amount. When nearly ruined,
                     <lb/>he accepted a lieutenant's commission in
                     <lb/>the militia, which was not a school to
                     <lb/>improve a vitiated mind. His figure was
                     <lb/>about the middle height, nothing re­
                     <lb/>markable; but his face, at the period of

                     <lb/>Douglas</persName>, was very handsome. It ex­
                     <lb/>actly resembled a portrait (from which
                     <lb/>engravings have been made) of the <persName>earl

                     <lb/>of <placeName>Essex</placeName></persName>, <persName>queen Elizabeth's</persName> favourite.
                     <lb/>His eyes were beautifully expressive—a
                     <lb/>rich dark hazel; his eyebrows finely pen­
                     <lb/>cilled, his nose perfectly formed, his fore­
                     <lb/>head high and broad, like the earl's pic­
                     <lb/>ture, but his chin too long. What was
                     <lb/>very singular, his disposition, in many
                     <lb/>points, as well as his features, resembled
                     <lb/>that unfortunate nobleman's; he was
                     <lb/>very passionate and impetuous, grossly
                     <lb/>insolent if offended in the most tri­
                     <lb/>fling degree: but he had not the good
                     <lb/>qualities that likewise distinguished the
                     <lb/><persName>earl of <placeName>Essex</placeName></persName>. If his wishes were not in­
                     <lb/>stantly complied with by those of whom
                     <lb/>he did not stand in awe, he would cruelly
                     <lb/>insult and mortify the objects of his dis­
                     <lb/>pleasure. In company with the general,

                     <lb/>respectability, that he dared not presume
                     <lb/>to affront with impunity, he was reserv­

                     <lb/>was boisterous, rude, and even descend­
                     <lb/>ed, when his spirits were high, to be in­
                     <lb/>solently vulgar. Yet he did not disclose
                     <lb/>his character to people he respected till
                     <lb/>he had known them a long time. Since

                     <lb/>attended <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> and her sister
                     <lb/>when they walked out, accompanied by

                     <lb/>his formality and eccentricities, was
                     <lb/>much esteemed by the general and all
                     <lb/>his family, as he was a good, friendly,
                     <lb/>learned, and accomplished man. He
                     <lb/>drew and painted in a very pleasing
                     <lb/>style, and his little sitting-room (in which
                     <lb/>he received his visitors separate from his
                     <lb/>parents and sisters) was ornamented
                     <lb/>with his performances, and many pret­
                     <lb/>ty curiosities, beautiful shells, and fos­

                     <lb/>themselves, and have attractive manners;
                     <lb/>and as he assumed a captivating address,
                     <lb/>and was animated and sensible, he had
                     <lb/>the satisfaction of perceiving she thought
                     <lb/>him very agreeable.
             </p>
             <p>Having secured, he imagined, a warm
                     <lb/>interest in her artless bosom, he ventur­
                     <lb/>ed by degrees to unfold the disgusting
                     <lb/>side of his disposition: but his vanity
                     <lb/>was miserably deceived, though he had
                     <lb/>a great share of conceit, in supposing she
                     <lb/>was so infatuated as to be blindly indul­
                     <lb/>gent to his faults. One instance she
                     <lb/>witnessed of his violence and unfeeling
                     <lb/>heart made her form the resolution to
                     <lb/>suppress any affections she was inclined
                     <lb/>to feel. This resolution was strength­
                     <lb/>ened by a conversation she had with <persName>Mr.

                     <lb/>was entangled already with a woman,
                     <lb/>by whom he had two children. To all
                     <lb/>females, unless they had a large fortune,
                     <lb/>his intentions were dishonourable, how­
                     <lb/>ever much he might admire their per­
                     <lb/>sons. <persName>Jerry</persName> observed, that he was very

                     <lb/>harne</placeName>; but he trusted, as his stay at <placeName>Fair­
                     <lb/>field</placeName> would now be very short, the affair
                     <lb/>might be of little consequence. <persName>Jerry</persName>
                     <lb/>also added, that he confided in her un­
                     <lb/>derstanding, of which he had a high opi­
                     <lb/>nion, to banish such a character from her
                     <lb/>mind, relying at the same time on her
                     <lb/>prudence not to mention what he had
                     <lb/>discovered of his disposition to the gene­
                     <lb/>ral; he would undoubtedly be indig­
                     <lb/>nant and irritated at his presumption in
                     <lb/>daring to make love to his daughter
                     <lb/>without honourable designs, which the

                     <lb/>remained in the drawing-room, with the

                     <lb/>This he observed, and was enraged at

                     <lb/>deed he possessed too much of the latter
                     <lb/>quality, and was often distressed from
                     <lb/>his extreme liberality. The noble, libe­

                     <lb/>always too strong, led him often into

                     <lb/>may vie with any in the world for com­
                     <lb/>pleteness. The number of ships con­
                     <lb/>stantly there look like a grove of trees.
                     <lb/>Formerly the town sent out yearly some
                     <lb/>hundred <rs type="properAdjective">Guinea</rs> men, uncommonly hand­
                     <lb/>some ships, and fitted up in the neat­
                     <lb/>est style imaginable. Most of them car­
                     <lb/>ried guns, and being fast-sailing vessels,
                     <lb/>often took prizes. The merchants at

                     <lb/>those ships they are anxious about.
                     <lb/>Upon a high hill, by the sea-side, eve­

                     <lb/>the flag of the merchant to whom the

                     <lb/>habitants of the town are remarkably
                     <lb/>handsome: but I will allow for your for­

                     <lb/>made you forget the absent ones. The

                     <lb/>is taken out of it, which is of a useful
                     <lb/>kind. To conclude, this town swarms
                     <lb/>with people, who do not care a curse

                         <lb/>pish character, which did not appear con­

                         <lb/>of those of his profession, who are ex­

                         <lb/>unpolished, but generous, good-natured,
                         <lb/>and unaffected, and as rough and diffi­

                 </p>
                 <p>But severely did <persName>Courtenay</persName> revenge
                         <lb/>himself on those females who, unac­

                         <lb/>pleasing most forcibly. His understand­
                         <lb/>ing was excellent, but the violence of his
                         <lb/>passions often eclipsed his good sense;

                 <p>Innumerable (when in <placeName>London</placeName>) were

                         <lb/>he was the destroyer of their peace, their
                         <lb/>purity, their reputation, and, eventually,
                         <lb/>sometimes of their life. Yet he conti­

                         <lb/>the sole object of his wishes. Yet his

                         <lb/>with rapture, and glanced, with a wish
                         <lb/>to destroy, on the artless lovely face.
                         <lb/>He little heeded if the woman he was
                         <lb/>to marry could secure his attachment, as
                         <lb/>money would procure him, at any time,
                         <lb/>a beautiful mistress. He would have
                         <lb/>given the preference to a pretty wife, but
                         <lb/>in the search for riches, paid his court

                         <lb/>not known, and being a new scene of ac­

                         <lb/>rich, and perhaps lovely girl. But if she
                         <lb/>was wealthy, that was sufficient, as he

                         <lb/>masks, which was quite a novelty in the
                         <lb/>country, and promised much amusement.
                 </p>
                 <p><persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName> were elated at the pro­

                         <lb/>An entertainment of this description
                         <lb/>was quite new, and caused them an agree­

                         <lb/>something heavy had been rolled down,
                         <lb/>which was succeeded by a piercing shriek.
                         <lb/>They both sat up in bed to listen, and
                         <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> asked who was there? No answer
                         <lb/>was returned, and at that moment their

                         <lb/>descending were now heard, and busy
                         <lb/>whisperings; and soon after, the heavy

                         <lb/>and turned the handle with force several
                         <lb/>times; but it resisted their efforts, being
                         <lb/>bolted as well as locked. <persName>Jane</persName>, after the
                         <lb/>first alarm, was so frightened, that she
                         <lb/>had crept to her sister's bed, and they

                         <lb/>ed down the stairs. Soon after the other
                         <lb/>noises ceased, and all was quiet again;
                         <lb/>but so uneasy did they feel, that they

                       <lb/>well-proportioned, about the middle

                        <lb/>ted, particularly by <persName>Rose</persName>, who really

                        <lb/>was unconscious of the impression she

                <p><persName>Rose</persName> danced with <persName>sir Henry Arundel</persName>,
                        <lb/>who was very pleasing and gentlemanly,
                        <lb/>about thirty. He was handsome and
                        <lb/>elegant, and she resigned him with re­
                        <lb/>gret, even to dance with her good-hu­

                        <lb/>who was, as well as <persName>Courtenay</persName>, in pursuit
                        <lb/>of a woman with money. His person
                        <lb/>was insignificant, but his manners agree­
                        <lb/>able, with a prodigious stock of vanity.
                        <lb/>His life was exactly the reverse of what it
                        <lb/>ought to be. When in town, he general­

                        <lb/>colourless and thin. He usually rose at
                        <lb/>five in the afternoon, and went out di­
                        <lb/>rectly to dinner, having breakfasted be­

                <p><persName>Captain O'Brien</persName> was much vexed at
                        <lb/>having asked <persName>Rose</persName> to dance, when he
                        <lb/>found, from <persName>lord Morrington</persName>, that her
                        <lb/>beauty was all her dower, as his lord­
                        <lb/>ship, who knew his character, on pur­
                        <lb/>pose to torment him had hinted that she
                        <lb/>was wealthy. He was, consequently,
                        <lb/>at first, in very high spirits at the pro­
                        <lb/>spect of obtaining a beautiful girl and
                        <lb/>money too; but when <persName>lord Morrington</persName>
                        <lb/>whispered to him that it was quite the
                        <lb/>contrary, and that he was concerned he
                        <lb/>had made a mistake, his rage at being
                        <lb/>undeceived, and thus bereft of all his
                        <lb/>golden visions, was almost ungovern­
                        <lb/>able, and he could with difficulty be
                        <lb/>commonly civil to his fair partner.

                <p><persName>Rose</persName>, disgusted with his behaviour,
                        <lb/>had declined standing up any longer,
                        <lb/>and finding all the other ladies engaged,
                        <lb/>he lounged up to her, after he had ex­
                        <lb/>pressed his disappointment to <persName>lord Mor­
                        <lb/>rington</persName>, determined to vent his spleen
                        <lb/>by abusing the company, as there was
                        <lb/>no one but herself to whom he could dis­
                        <lb/>burden his ill-natured mind at that mo­

                        <lb/>sprightly dance, or in conversation.
                </p> 
                <p><persName>Rose</persName> was quite depressed at seeing
                        <lb/>him again approach, as she was rejoiced
                        <lb/>at having got rid of him. He sat down
                        <lb/>by her, and, finding she did not speak,
                        <lb/>suddenly exclaimed—<said>Do look, <persName>Miss

                        <lb/>with a complaint most distressing. It
                        <lb/>is painful to have illness and personal
                        <lb/>defects made a subject of laughter.</said>
                </p>
                <p><said>But he deserves it; he is as rich as
                        <lb/>a <name>Jew</name>, and as stingy as the devil. He
                        <lb/>is a good-for-nothing old man, and as ill-
                        <lb/>tempered as he is disagreeable, and so
                        <lb/>afraid of dying, that, for fear he should
                        <lb/>take cold, he puts on all his clothes
                        <lb/>smoking hot, even in the dogdays. He
                        <lb/>never reads the newspaper, or a book,
                        <lb/>till it has been aired before the fire. His
                        <lb/>boots and his hat are placed in front of a
                        <lb/>large fire, till they are so burning hot,
                        <lb/>that they are obliged to be held out of the
                        <lb/>window to cool. He is seldom the least

                        <lb/>every thing he wears, actually scorch him.
                        <lb/>One morning when I called at his house
                        <lb/>I found him jumping about the room
                        <lb/>without a coat, apparently in an ecstacy
                        <lb/>of delight. I asked what had happened,

                        <lb/>screaming with agony, fearful it would
                        <lb/>give him cold to sit in the same room,
                        <lb/>much more to be so near, and affected

                        <lb/>my friend away. After this adventure,
                        <lb/>he had a fit of ill-temper for several days.

                        <lb/>is terribly afraid of thunder and light­

                        <lb/>He was apparently in the meridian of

                        <lb/>as if he was in indifferent health. His

                <p>Fortunately his remarks were un­

                        <lb/>most lovely being she had ever beheld.
                        <lb/>She was attired in a pale pink silk jacket,
                        <lb/>and white silk petticoat, trimmed with
                        <lb/>ribbons of the same colour, and a wreath
                        <lb/>of ivy and pink flowers confined her
                        <lb/>luxuriant chesnut hair. Her face was
                        <lb/>round, with two cheeks resembling
                        <lb/>peaches; her eyes dark, with the sweet­
                        <lb/>est mouth; her lips like coral, and finely
                        <lb/>formed; and the light elegance of her fi­
                        <lb/>gure gave one the idea of a sylph. She
                        <lb/>smiled with an air of good-humour at <persName>Rose</persName>,
                        <lb/>who was quite captivated with her, and

                        <lb/>and he sustained his character uncom­
                        <lb/>monly well. <persName>Eustace</persName> (who had not

                        <lb/>was at a great distance from <persName>lord Mor­

                        <lb/>ing again, as <placeName>Treharne</placeName> was half-way from
                        <lb/>where she resided to the Castle.

                <p><persName>Miss Herbert</persName> had scarcely left the

                        <lb/>will not disguise that I think you too
                        <lb/>much addicted to severe aspersion.</said>
                </p>  
                <p>Here their conversation was interrupt­
                        <lb/>ed by the general, <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, and
                        <lb/><persName>Jane</persName>, who informed her the postchaise
                        <lb/>was ready to convey them home.
                </p>  
                <p>They were attended to the carriage by
                        <lb/>the <persName>count de Fontenai</persName>, the marquis, and
                        <lb/>several other beaux, and left this plea­

                        <lb/>recollection of the pleasure they had en­
                        <lb/>joyed without any alloy.

                <p>The general returned with them in

                        <lb/>neral Douglas</persName> had, in the course of the
                        <lb/>evening, met with a favourite acquaint­
                        <lb/>ance, whom he had not seen for several
                        <lb/>years, and this made the hours pass im­
                        <lb/>perceptibly and pleasantly.
                </p> 
                <p>The day after the ball was very fine
                        <lb/>for the latter end of <name>November</name>, and
                        <lb/>tempted <persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName> to walk. Their
                        <lb/>conversation, as they proceeded, natu­
                        <lb/>rally turned on the occurrences of the
                        <lb/>last evening.
                </p>
                <p><said>You appeared,</said> observed <persName>Rose</persName>, <said>to
                        <lb/>admire the <persName>count de Fontenai</persName>: his per­
                        <lb/>son is very pleasing, and his elegant
                        <lb/>style of dancing quite fascinating, but to
                        <lb/>his understanding and manners I am a
                        <lb/>stranger. Is he sensible and agreeable?</said>
                </p>  
                <p><said>Quite the reverse; I think he is half
                        <lb/>a fool, and very inferior to the <persName>marquis
                        <lb/>de Monclair</persName> in captivation.</said>
               </p>  
               <p><said>Explain, then, why you had the ap­
                       <lb/>pearance of being much pleased with
                       <lb/>him, and neglected the marquis, with
                       <lb/>whom you seldom danced?</said>

                <p><said>Because, though I prefer the person,
                        <lb/>sense, and manners, of the <persName>marquis de
                        <lb/>Monclair</persName>, I would sacrifice my inclina­
                        <lb/>tion to the wealth of <persName>Fontenai</persName>, as I am
                        <lb/>told he is very rich, and an only son.</said>
                </p> 
                <p><said>You are very wrong, <persName>Jane</persName>; for if
                        <lb/><persName>Fontenai</persName> is as weak as you represent
                        <lb/>him, he may, by some foolish action, im­
                        <lb/>pair his fortune, while <persName>Monclair</persName>, with
                        <lb/>his good understanding, may improve
                        <lb/>instead of diminishing the little he pos­
                        <lb/>sesses. Besides, you ought not to en­
                        <lb/>courage both; you may lose each ad­
                        <lb/>mirer by such coquetry, which is cer­
                        <lb/>tainly dishonourable.</said>
                </p>  
                <p><said>I do not care a straw for either, but
                        <lb/>I am in the right to amuse myself with
                        <lb/>their admiration; and even if they should
                        <lb/>in time entertain a real passion, it will
                        <lb/>do them no injury. I recollect hearing
                        <lb/><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> say, that men seldom die for
                        <lb/>love; they are soon consoled.</said>

                <p>Just as she pronounced these words,

                </p> 
                <p>They ran up directly to <persName>Jane</persName>, and the
                        <lb/>little girl said—<said>How many days it is
                        <lb/>since you have been to see us! Mamma
                        <lb/>often talks of you, and wishes you would

                </p>  
                <p><persName>Jane</persName>, who seldom blushed, now felt a
                        <lb/>deep crimson suffuse her cheeks, and in
                        <lb/>confused accents desired them to tell
                        <lb/>their mamma she would call very soon,
                        <lb/>and dismissed them.
                </p>  
                <p>But the little girl called out, as they
                        <lb/>were going—<said>Mamma told us to walk
                        <lb/>this way, as perhaps we might meet you,
                        <lb/>as we used to do,</said> which heightened her
                        <lb/>confusion.

                        <lb/>discovery, notwithstanding all your pre­

                        <lb/>suspicious, from the inquiries my mother

                        <lb/>kindness during the storm, and request­
                        <lb/>ed we will be polite and good-natured
                        <lb/>when we meet her or the children, but
                        <lb/>to avoid any intimacy. I fear you will
                        <lb/>bring yourself into some affliction, if you
                        <lb/>persevere in visiting her.</said>

                <p><said>I am the best judge of my own con­

                        <lb/>for, conscious she had acted wrong, she
                        <lb/>endeavoured to drown the reflection in

                        <lb/>her temper. This conduct, she observed,
                        <lb/>that was overlooked in a child, was in­
                        <lb/>supportable in a woman; and she should
                        <lb/>remember they were descended from a
                        <lb/>distinguished family, that she hoped she
                        <lb/>would endeavour not to disgrace, as her
                        <lb/>thoughtless behaviour made her very un­

                </p>  
                <p>Fury flashed in <persName>Jane's</persName> eyes, and she

                        <lb/>a turning in the winding road they were

                <p><persName>Jane</persName> had the prudence to check her
                        <lb/>anger, and said, in a whisper, before the

                        <lb/>would conceal her visits to <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>
                        <lb/>from her mother, she would promise to
                        <lb/>only call and see her once more.

                        <lb/>usual sweetness of temper walked for­
                        <lb/>ward with <persName>Jane</persName>, leaving <persName>Courtenay</persName> to

                        <lb/>make himself very agreeable, and when

                        <lb/>to succeed.

                <p><persName>Rose</persName> was more charmed with his con­

                        <lb/>and for the time, unconsciously, she
                        <lb/>experienced a predilection in his favour,

                <p>They had not walked much further,

                <p><persName>Captain Burton</persName> was disgusted with

                        <lb/>fashions, and that he always cut out

                        <lb/>pantaloons; and if any work was required
                        <lb/>to ornament the latter part of his dress,
                        <lb/>he drew the design himself.
                </p> 
                <p><said>This may be very interesting to your

                        <lb/>probably also interest your valet, who

                </p>  
                <p>The marquis was perfectly free from
                        <lb/>the coxcombical weakness that made <persName>De
                        <lb/>Fontenai</persName> ridiculous, and it silenced the
                        <lb/>count on this subject for the present;
                        <lb/>but he commenced another almost as ab­
                        <lb/>surd. His vanity made him conjecture
                        <lb/>that <persName>Jane Douglas</persName> admired him as much
                        <lb/>as he did her, and looking tenderly at
                        <lb/>her, he sighed and said—<said>I have a

                        <lb/>as I was going to observe, I do not think

                        <lb/>black, but to have her apartments like­
                        <lb/>wise hung with the same dismal colour,

                        <lb/>the old story of the <rs type="properAdjective">Ephesian</rs> matron,

                        <lb/>of his admiration. He introduced the
                        <lb/>subject of marrying from interested
                        <lb/>motives, and thought it disgraceful for

                <p><said>That is no extenuation of their er­

                        <lb/>rality than those advanced or advancing
                        <lb/>in years. How superior is their attach­
                        <lb/>ment to an old man's! A young man
                        <lb/>does not know the colour of your eyes,

                        <lb/>and cheerful, as if accustomed to good
                        <lb/>society, though her language was simple.
                        <lb/><persName>Mrs. Curtis</persName> appeared to dote on her

                        <lb/>about three years previous to the present
                        <lb/>period. The warmth of his attachment
                        <lb/>and friendship for <persName>lady Harvey</persName> was al­

                        <lb/>to it. On the ground-floor was a pretty

                        <lb/>the drops of anguish seemed to tremble

                <p>After passing three happy days, they

                        <lb/>to mention how often he had expressed
                        <lb/>an attachment to her, and told many a
                        <lb/>tale of love. She was apprehensive of
                        <lb/>his incurring her mother's anger, who
                        <lb/>would consequently inform the general
                        <lb/>of the circumstance, which would excite
                        <lb/>his indignation against <persName>Eustace</persName>; and she
                        <lb/>could not endure the reflection, ill as he
                        <lb/>had behaved to her, of causing him any

                       <lb/>so beloved, whose naturally strong con­

                       <lb/>that tenderness which springs from the
                       <lb/>heart, and is so superior to the assidui­
                       <lb/>ties of an hireling.

               <p>This arrangement being concluded,

                       <lb/>which was very consolatory to their mo­

                       <lb/>a family to support, and was himself en­
                       <lb/>vironed with riches he had not the spirit
                       <lb/>to enjoy. His miserly disposition had
                       <lb/>contracted the natural and social affec­
                       <lb/>tions of the heart; and he once refused
                       <lb/>to lend the general a trifling sum of mo­

               <p>The general's journey passed without
                       <lb/>any remarkable occurrence, and, as they
                       <lb/>travelled expeditiously till they reached
                       <lb/><placeName>Scotland</placeName>, <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> was pleased to
                       <lb/>observe that he supported the fatigue
                       <lb/>better than she could have expected.
                       <lb/>To <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> the scenery in <placeName>North
                       <lb/>Britain</placeName> was quite new, and she admired
                       <lb/>that part of her journey that conducted
                       <lb/>her to the banks of the picturesque river
                       <lb/><placeName>Dee</placeName>, that has been so often celebrated
                       <lb/>in verse. The country combined wild
                       <lb/>and pleasing images: here fields of
                       <lb/>waving corn, intermixed with craggy
                       <lb/>hills and towering rocks, diversified the
                       <lb/>landscape; a cheerful village peeped
                       <lb/>from among the trees, and willows and

                       <lb/>lofty pines graced the side of the water,
                       <lb/>as, calm and smooth, it clearly flowed
                       <lb/>along. They proceeded through a wind­
                       <lb/>ing romantic vale, bounded with moun­
                       <lb/>tains clothed with wood, till they reach­
                       <lb/>ed a sterile spot, from whence a natural
                       <lb/>cascade fell, and murmuring rushed
                       <lb/>among the overhanging rocks and cliffs,
                       <lb/>the water, where it was not mixed with
                       <lb/>foam, being as bright and transparent as
                       <lb/>crystal.

               <p>They travelled progressively till they
                       <lb/>attained a hill that commanded a pro­
                       <lb/>spect of the <placeName>Dee</placeName>, flowing gently onward,
                       <lb/>and on the summit of this eminence was
                       <lb/>erected, many centuries since, the gothic
                       <lb/>castle of <persName>sir James Douglas</persName>, the general's
                       <lb/>harsh and parsimonious brother.
               </p>  
               <p>The cheerful aspect of the river, re­

                       <lb/>air. A little island in the river, planted
                       <lb/>with shrubs and trees, gave a variety to

                       <lb/>the scene. Some of the neighbouring
                       <lb/>summits were shaded with broom and
                       <lb/>heath, enlivened with its gay purple and
                       <lb/>yellow blossoms; and here and there
                       <lb/>a grey rock raised its venerable head.

               <p>At the back part of the castle of
                       <lb/><placeName>Towie Craigs</placeName> was a large park, extend­
                       <lb/>ing to a great distance, filled with deer,
                       <lb/>whose branching horns and light ele­
                       <lb/>gant figures gave a pleasant feature to

               </p>   
               <p>They reached the Castle-gate; the
                       <lb/>postillion rang the heavy bell; it sound­
                       <lb/>ed loud and hoarse, and a ferocious mastiff
                       <lb/>barked furiously, as if unaccustomed to
                       <lb/>the arrival of visitors. The door was
                       <lb/>cautiously and slowly opened, after an
                       <lb/>old man from one of the casements had

                       <lb/>seated in the postchaise. The same

                       <lb/>days. He conjectured, therefore, that

                       <lb/>danger, as a change for the better was a

                          <lb/>doctor's, a visit they had long intended.
                          <lb/><persName>Captain Burton</persName> and his friend were to
                          <lb/>accompany them, and they were much
                          <lb/>gratified at no longer having to encoun­
                          <lb/>ter the sarcasms of the satirical <persName>Eustace</persName>.
                  </p>       
                  <p><persName>Courtenay</persName> and <persName>Burton</persName> were punctual
                          <lb/>to their engagement, and they com­
                          <lb/>menced their walk to <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>. Part of
                          <lb/>this walk led by the river side, and the
                          <lb/>remainder through a wood of small ex­
                          <lb/>tent, but picturesque and pleasing. The
                          <lb/>sun was gradually sinking in the west,
                          <lb/>and its faint rays lightly gilded the trees,
                          <lb/>almost bare and leafless. A few remain­
                          <lb/>ing leaves sometimes rustled down, and
                          <lb/>strewed their path, announcing the ap­
                          <lb/>proaching conclusion of the year. The
                          <lb/>woodland scene was occasionally varied
                          <lb/>by clumps of tall firs, verdant laurels,
                          <lb/>variegated hollies, and gloomy yew.
                  </p>        
                  <p>Had this rural walk been less agree­

                          <lb/>versation, which imparted a pleasing in­
                          <lb/>terest to each surrounding object. <persName>Bur­
                          <lb/>ton</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName> walked with a quicker
                          <lb/>pace before them, talking away, gay and
                          <lb/>unconcerned, as no lurking passion cre­
                          <lb/>ated in their bosoms the least anxiety or
                          <lb/>perturbation.
                  </p>      
                  <p>Notwithstanding all <persName>Rose</persName> had heard
                          <lb/>to the disadvantage of <persName>Courtenay</persName>, she
                          <lb/>would not suffer one suspicious thought
                          <lb/>to be disingenuously concealed in her
                          <lb/>mind, or to flutter about her heart to his
                          <lb/>discredit, and prevent her giving the
                          <lb/>fullest scope to her confidence.

                          <lb/>enough, yet he did not feel so happy as

                          <lb/>pleasure or on a shooting excursion. It
                          <lb/>was so delightful, he observed, to be re­

                         <lb/>that is not so frequent as I could wish;
                         <lb/>and she has a fault which displeases me
                         <lb/>—it is a disposition to view with a jaun­
                         <lb/>diced eye the perfections of her own sex,
                         <lb/>particularly if any attention or marked

                         <lb/>hands, and rubbing it on her hair, in­
                         <lb/>stead of a roll of pomatum, as she wore
                         <lb/>powder. They found it difficult to pre­

                         <lb/>and seated themselves patiently (at her

                 <p>At length she descended with them
                         <lb/>to the drawing-room, dressed in the

                         <lb/>ordinary than she had ever appeared

                         <lb/>pinching her sallow cheeks to produce a

                         <lb/>was more genteel for a lady to be pale.

                         <lb/>worth while to tell an untruth, and was

                         <lb/>this scheme of vengeance to mortify
                         <lb/>him. But she was defeated, in a great

                 <p>After supper, singing was introduced,

                 <p>Their visitors were apprehensive, from

                         <lb/>should sing all the songs he knew, which
                         <lb/>they dreaded, as a severe tax on their po­
                         <lb/>liteness, the poor old doctor having, of
                         <lb/>course, at his age, a wretched voice; but
                         <lb/>they were greatly relieved by discover­

                         <lb/>twelve years old. He had left it in

                         <lb/>man was too well aware of female cun­
                         <lb/>ning on these occasions, and too artful
                         <lb/>himself to be easily gained. It was the

                         <lb/>admired, having been a man of great
                         <lb/>gallantry; but even the power of beauty
                         <lb/>could not conquer his parsimonious na­
                         <lb/>ture, which made him averse even to

                         <lb/>rectly, and left her to quietly enjoy her
                         <lb/>reflections. But <persName>Rose</persName> was not allowed

                 <p>Accordingly she touched the bell, and
                         <lb/>informed <persName>Kamira</persName>, who answered it, that
                         <lb/><persName>Robin</persName>, <persName>Dolly</persName>, and herself, might go di­
                         <lb/>rectly to bed, if they had fastened up
                         <lb/>the house.
                 </p>     
                 <p><persName>Kamira</persName> assured her that every place
                         <lb/>had been secured, except the hall-door,
                         <lb/>some hours, and that was now just bolt­

                 </p>         
                 <p><persName>Rose</persName> dismissed her, and listened to

                         <lb/>during the general's absence. The <persName>mar­

                         <lb/>remarked; therefore it proved, with all
                         <lb/>his professions, that he did not choose
                         <lb/>to commit them to writing, and had not
                         <lb/>so much affection for her as the count.
                 </p>        
                 <p><persName>Rose</persName> replied, that she was exactly of
                         <lb/>the same opinion, and that she admired
                         <lb/>a man who had love enough to risk his
                         <lb/>sentiments in writing. How infinitely
                         <lb/>superior to the mean suspicious being
                         <lb/>who dares not acknowledge with his pen
                         <lb/>the affection he has frequently avowed!
                 </p>      
                 <p>Having indulged <persName>Jane</persName> with chatting
                         <lb/>as long as was agreeable to her, <persName>Rose</persName>
                         <lb/>took the candle, and ascending the stairs,
                         <lb/>her sister followed. They had just reach­

                         <lb/>window that looked over the river, when
                         <lb/>a strong light flashed so bright and sud­
                         <lb/>denly across their eyes, that <persName>Rose</persName> start­
                         <lb/>ed, and in the astonishment and terror
                         <lb/>of the moment let the candle fall, and

                         <lb/>it was extinguished. The night was
                         <lb/>very dark and cold; but a faint glimmer
                         <lb/>seemed still to shine near the window.
                 </p>      
                 <p>When they were recovered from their
                         <lb/>surprise, they approached to discern what
                         <lb/>it was, and perceived a large body of
                         <lb/>light by that part of the river where
                         <lb/>the boat was moored. It appeared as if
                         <lb/>two or three persons were holding torches
                         <lb/>by the water side.
                 </p>   
                 <p><said>It cannot be any one who wishes to
                         <lb/>see us waiting there,</said> exclaimed <persName>Rose</persName>
                         <lb/><said>or they would sound the bugle, which
                         <lb/>is placed near the boat purposely to an­
                         <lb/>nounce the arrival of visitors; and I
                         <lb/>should not imagine any one would call
                         <lb/>so late at night, unless it were my bro­
                         <lb/>ther returned unexpectedly, a happiness
                         <lb/>that would reward us for all our fears.
                         <lb/>However, I cannot hope that the lights
                         <lb/>are caused by that fortunate event, as he
                         <lb/>would certainly loudly acquaint us with
                         <lb/>his approach, by blowing the horn, and
                         <lb/>crossing over without ceremony.</said>

                 <p>While they formed this, and many
                         <lb/>other conjectures, the lights began to
                         <lb/>move, and forming two distinct bodies,
                         <lb/>glided along by the side of the river, to
                         <lb/>a very great distance, as far as the eye
                         <lb/>could reach, and disappeared.
                 </p>        
                 <p>With the vanishing of the lights, they
                         <lb/>lost all hope of seeing <persName>Felix</persName>, and now
                         <lb/>groped in the dark till they found their
                         <lb/>way to their bedchamber. Not a star
                         <lb/>beamed in the sky—all was deeply ob­
                         <lb/>scure and gloomy; and they were saying
                         <lb/>how very dismal and uncomfortable it
                         <lb/>was to undress without a candle, when
                         <lb/>the room became suddenly illuminated.
                 </p>        
                 <p>They ran to the window, and beheld
                         <lb/>the same lights moving rapidly, and
                         <lb/>fiercely blazing, like a bundle of wood
                         <lb/>on fire. Sometimes they were elevated
                         <lb/>five feet from the ground, hovered near
                         <lb/>the river, and at length melted into air,
                         <lb/>emitting sparks of flame.

                         <lb/>with a Lantern</name>. Two of these lights are
                         <lb/>not commonly seen, but I have heard
                         <lb/>my mother relate they have been dis­
                         <lb/>covered, but rarely, and more in foreign
                         <lb/>countries than in <placeName>England</placeName>. I cannot

                         <lb/>shine more at a distance than near, and

                         <lb/>soon as they expected. The appearance
                         <lb/>of the lights and thinking about it kept
                         <lb/>them awake for some time, till these re­

                 <p>The heavy trampling of horses on the

                         <lb/>galloping; and as the last sound of the
                         <lb/>horses' hoofs resounded on the ear, they
                         <lb/>seemed to be pursued equally fast by
                         <lb/>another party, and several pistols were
                         <lb/>discharged.

                         <lb/>ing to attack the mansion.

                         <lb/>the affrighted girl, <said>what will become
                         <lb/>of us, with only old <persName>Robin</persName> for a protec­
                         <lb/>tor? I think we had better go and call
                         <lb/>him up.</said>
                 </p>    
                 <p><persName>Rose</persName> assented, and endeavoured to
                         <lb/>calm her, while they threw on their
                         <lb/>wrapping gowns. Knowing that he slept
                         <lb/>in one of the attics, near his daughter
                         <lb/>and <persName>Kamira</persName>, they opened the door to
                         <lb/>proceed thither, when they observed a

                         <lb/>light gleam from the lower staircase.
                         <lb/>Concluding to a certainty that it was
                         <lb/><persName>Robin</persName>, or one of the maids, who, alarm­
                         <lb/>ed like themselves, had got up, and was
                         <lb/>going to the kitchen, they followed the
                         <lb/>welcome light.
                 </p>       
                 <p>It moved with such rapidity, that they
                         <lb/>could not overtake it, and therefore call­
                         <lb/>ed <persName>Robin</persName>. But no answer being return­
                         <lb/>ed, they repeated the name of <persName>Kamira</persName>
                         <lb/>and <persName>Dolly</persName>. Still all was silent—no friend­
                         <lb/>ly voice re-echoed to theirs; but they
                         <lb/>continued to pursue the light, which
                         <lb/>moved so quickly from them, though
                         <lb/>they walked fast, that they could not
                         <lb/>distinguish the person who carried it.
                 </p>         
                 <p>At length it led them to the top of
                         <lb/>the stairs conducting to the damp ex­
                         <lb/>tensive cellars underneath, where it to­
                         <lb/>tally vanished, leaving them in impene­
                         <lb/>trable darkness. The stillness of night
                         <lb/>was only interrupted at that gloomy mo­
                         <lb/>ment by plaintive moans and lamenta­
                         <lb/>tions, mingled with voices, that all seem­

                         <lb/>ed to issue from the hollow mouldy
                         <lb/>vaults beneath.
                 </p>      
                 <p><persName>Jane</persName> shrieked aloud, and fainted on
                         <lb/>the ground, while her sister endeavoured
                         <lb/>to save her from falling.
                 </p>        
                 <p><persName>Rose</persName> now felt really terrified; she did
                         <lb/>not like to quit <persName>Jane</persName>, who was quite in­
                         <lb/>sensible, and cold as ice, and, as her only
                         <lb/>prospect of relief, loudly vociferated the
                         <lb/>name of <persName>Robin</persName>.
