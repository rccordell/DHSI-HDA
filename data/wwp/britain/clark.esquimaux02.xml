              <lb/>the house; but the tinder being damp, he
              <lb/>had great difficulty in striking a light;
              <lb/>and this circumstance, with having to
              <lb/>dress, had delayed him. He procured
              <lb/>some water and hartshorn for <persName>Miss Jane</persName>,
              <lb/>and they soon succeeded in restoring her
              <lb/>to animation; then leading her into the
              <lb/>library, placed her on a sofa till she was
              <lb/>quite recovered.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> now mentioned to <persName>Robin</persName>
               <lb/>the lights she had seen by the river, and

               <lb/>ceived and conducted them near the cel­
               <lb/>lars, whence the noise proceeded which
               <lb/>had frightened them.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Robin</persName> shook his head, and informed
               <lb/>them that when he was in <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, if
               <lb/>such lights were seen there, either in
               <lb/>houses or in their vicinity, they were

               <lb/>be a great affliction, as we expect it. God

               <lb/>an omen of any other person's in the
               <lb/>family!</said>
            </p>
            <p>The considerate <persName>Robin</persName> now requested
               <lb/>the young ladies to retire to their apart­
               <lb/>ment, as he was afraid their health might
               <lb/>suffer from being so thinly clothed in such
               <lb/>inclement weather. He begged them to
               <lb/>be easy in their minds, and endeavour to
               <lb/>obtain some repose, as it was his intention
               <lb/>to remain watching till daylight, when he
               <lb/>proposed calling the maids, and then get­
               <lb/>ting some sleep himself.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> told him she approved
               <lb/>this plan very much, and hoped he would
               <lb/>remain in bed all the next day if he liked,
               <lb/>as it was not good for his health at his age
               <lb/>to be deprived of rest.
            </p>
            <p>He thanked her, and presenting them
               <lb/>with a candle, they retired to their room,
               <lb/>where soft refreshing slumbers soon visited

               <lb/>being calmed by knowing old <persName>Robin</persName> was
               <lb/>on the watch to guard them from future
               <lb/>ill. No other alarming sound occurred,
               <lb/>and at daybreak he called his daughter and
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName>, whom he acquainted with the
               <lb/>last night's adventure, and then resigned
               <lb/>himself to the drowsiness he felt.
            </p>
            <p>In the morning they awoke pale and
               <lb/>dispirited, for the impression still remain­
               <lb/>ed of the horrors they had encountered
               <lb/>the night before. <persName>Jane</persName> was very dull and
               <lb/>melancholy, which quite surprised <persName>Rose</persName>,
               <lb/>who looked indisposed and did not feel

               <lb/>from some natural reason, probably very
               <lb/>simple when known. The preceding
               <lb/>evening had been thick and hazy, and a
               <lb/>heavy dew fallen, which made her imag­
               <lb/>ine the lights were occasioned by nox­
               <lb/>ious vapours exhaled from the moist earth,

               <lb/>as <persName>Will</persName> with a wisp was seen frequently
               <lb/>in misty weather, and near rivers, which,
               <lb/>added to its being a damp foggy night,
               <lb/>seemed to elucidate the phenomenon.
               <lb/>That part of the mansion where they slept
               <lb/>had more tendency to dampness than any
               <lb/>other quarter of the building, being si­

               <lb/>whence vapours might ascend.  At all

               <lb/>mined to make herself as little uneasy as

               <lb/>rectitude of her mind, and the high sense
               <lb/>she entertained of religion, strengthened
               <lb/>her naturally timid mind, and she confided
               <lb/>in the supreme goodness of that great and
               <lb/>beneficent being, our Creator, who, she
               <lb/>felt assured, would not permit any super­
               <lb/>natural appearance or evil apparition to
               <lb/>injure those who have not committed any

               <lb/>crime; she was therefore (with these sen­
               <lb/>timents) the more astonished at the deep
               <lb/>impression the late incidents had made on
               <lb/>her sister, who appeared previously to be
               <lb/>undaunted and fearless.
            </p>
            <p>While these reflections engaged her
               <lb/>thoughts, <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> came in her carriage
               <lb/>to convey them to her residence, on a visit
               <lb/>for two days, and with great good-nature
               <lb/>had invited <persName>Burton</persName> and <persName>Courtenay</persName> to meet
               <lb/>the young ladies at dinner the first day to
               <lb/>amuse them.  <persName>Mrs. Fane's</persName> habitation was
               <lb/>an elegant modern building, erected of
               <lb/><placeName type="properAdjective">Portland</placeName>-stone, with a green smooth lawn
               <lb/>in front, commanding a pleasing view of
               <lb/><placeName>Exeter Cathedral</placeName>, which seemed to be
               <lb/>placed, from the windows, among the ver­
               <lb/>dant trees and meadows.
            </p>
            <p>The house was elegantly furnished ac­
               <lb/>cording to the direction and taste of her
               <lb/>favourite nephew, <persName>lord Clairville</persName>, whose
               <lb/>amiable attention to his excellent aunt did
               <lb/>honour to his heart and understanding.

               <lb/>young men ridiculed him for it, their ill-
               <lb/>natured observations only excited the con­
               <lb/>tempt of the good.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> was a very fine majestic
               <lb/>figure, and had been uncommonly hand­
               <lb/>some in her youth; herself and two sisters
               <lb/>were the daughters of a rich tradesman,
               <lb/>who bestowed on his children a very ac­
               <lb/>complished and superior education. These
               <lb/>three sisters possessed no common share
               <lb/>of beauty; the two younger married gen­
               <lb/>tlemen of distinction and fortune, and the
               <lb/>eldest, who was allowed to be the most
               <lb/>beautiful and captivating, espoused <persName>vis­
               <lb/>count Clairville</persName>, who was fascinated with
               <lb/>her mental and personal perfections. <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Fane</persName> had a native elegance of mind and
               <lb/>manners, and from having married so
               <lb/>young, and early associated with the best
               <lb/>society, her address was as polished as
               <lb/>her heart was refined, virtuous, and be­
               <lb/>nevolent.
            </p>

               <lb/>it was painted by <persName>sir Joshua Reynolds</persName>;
               <lb/>and though the colours, like many of his
               <lb/>paintings, were gradually fading away, yet
               <lb/>enough of the picture remained to trace
               <lb/>how exquisitely lovely and beautiful she
               <lb/>had been; her form appeared symmetry
               <lb/>itself, and her face as perfect—a fair beauty,
               <lb/>like her handsome daughters, whom they
               <lb/>had seen twice. The gardens, and every
               <lb/>thing belonging to <persName>Mrs. Fane's</persName> residence,
               <lb/>were specimens of elegant neatness, and
               <lb/>her kind attention made the time flow
               <lb/>smooth and sweetly.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Miss Herbert</persName> was invited to meet them;
               <lb/>she was all kindness and affection, and
               <lb/>wished them to come the following day
               <lb/>to her father's house. <persName>Rose</persName> declined this
               <lb/>invitation with a sigh, as her parents had
               <lb/>desired them not to visit at any other
               <lb/>place than <persName>Mrs. Fane's</persName>, and once at <persName>doctor
               <lb/>Wizzle's</persName>, where they had already been.
               <lb/>But her amiable hostess conquered these

               <lb/>scruples, by assuring her they would not
               <lb/>have the least objection to their visiting
               <lb/>anywhere with her, and that she would
               <lb/>accompany them to <persName>Mr. Herbert's</persName> the
               <lb/>next day.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Courtenay</persName> appeared quite animated at
               <lb/>meeting with <persName>Rose</persName> again, and evinced
               <lb/>the same insinuating softness and fascina­
               <lb/>tion of manners which drew the chain that
               <lb/>entwined her heart still closer.  <persName>Rose</persName> had
               <lb/>no opportunity of speaking privately to
               <lb/>him; but when her sister only was near,
               <lb/>merely asked if he had written to <placeName>Scot­
               <lb/>land</placeName>, as she knew <persName>Jane</persName> would not attach
               <lb/>any thing of importance to this question.
            </p>
            <p>He replied, that on second thoughts he
               <lb/>had considered it would be improper till
               <lb/>the fate of <persName>sir James Douglas</persName> was decided,
               <lb/>as it might be judged obtrusive and inde­
               <lb/>licate, at a period of so much bustle and
               <lb/>moment, to mention a subject of that de­
               <lb/>scription.  <persName>Rose</persName> acquiesced with this opi­
               <lb/>nion, apparently dictated by strict pro­
               <lb/>priety; indeed, had it been otherwise, her

               <lb/>partiality would have influenced her to
               <lb/>coincide with his sentiments.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Captain Burton</persName> evidently admired <persName>Miss
               <lb/>Herbert</persName>, but received no encouragement
               <lb/>from her, which was easily understood by
               <lb/><persName>Miss Douglas</persName>.  Frequently had she heard
               <lb/>her friend <persName>Mary Herbert</persName> declare, that
               <lb/>however partial she might be to an amia­
               <lb/>ble man, she would never think of in­
               <lb/>dulging that partiality, unless he was a
               <lb/>person of consequence and great fortune.
               <lb/><persName>Mary</persName> observed, that from having been
               <lb/>accustomed to move in the first circles,
               <lb/>and to live in the best and most expensive
               <lb/>style, she could not for romantic love
               <lb/>brook a moderate situation in life.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> admitted that she was perfectly
               <lb/>right, if such were her ideas of happiness,
               <lb/>as she always thought no one should cen­
               <lb/>sure another for thinking differently from
               <lb/>themselves, as almost every human being
               <lb/>had different ideas of felicity.  Poor <persName>Bur­
               <lb/>ton</persName>, she was therefore convinced, would
               <lb/>be doomed to wear the willow.

            <p><persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> conveyed them early the

               <lb/><persName>Miss Herbert's</persName> father.  <persName>Mr. Herbert</persName> was
               <lb/>engaged to visit a friend at a considerable
               <lb/>distance, therefore they only beheld him
               <lb/>for a few minutes; but the little they had
               <lb/>seen prepossessed them in his favour; he
               <lb/>was remarkably handsome, and had the
               <lb/>air of a man of fashion.  The residence of
               <lb/><persName>Mr. Herbert</persName> was an irregular building,
               <lb/>charmingly situated on an eminence; ori­
               <lb/>ginally it contained but few rooms, but
               <lb/>different possessors had added to it, and it
               <lb/>was now a good-sized house. Never had
               <lb/>they seen any situation where the pro­
               <lb/>spects were so picturesque and varied;
               <lb/>each apartment commanded a different
               <lb/>delightful view.

            <p><persName>Miss Herbert's</persName> governess was in the
               <lb/>library, and they were introduced to her.
               <lb/>The windows of this room looked upon a
               <lb/>sweet woodland scene, and they seated
               <lb/>themselves here to enjoy the scenery quite

               <lb/>and valuable authors, not only in <name>English</name>,
               <lb/>but in <name>French</name>, <name>Italian</name>, and other lan­
               <lb/>guages. <persName>Mr. Herbert</persName> had been ambas­
               <lb/>sador at several foreign courts, and con­
               <lb/>versed fluently and elegantly in <name>French</name>,
               <lb/><name>Italian</name>, <name>German</name>, and <name>Spanish</name>, and was al­
               <lb/>lowed to be very accomplished.

            <p>From the library they proceeded to the
               <lb/>drawing-room, which afforded from the
               <lb/>windows an extended landscape, wild and
               <lb/>rural.  But <persName>Rose</persName> was most pleased with
               <lb/>the paintings and portraits that ornament­
               <lb/>ed the walls. One lovely picture of <persName>Mary
               <lb/>Herbert</persName>, as a child, delighted her, and she
               <lb/>could not quit it without reluctance, even
               <lb/>to look at an interesting portrait of her
               <lb/>grandmother, which was most expressive
               <lb/>and lovely; and likewise one of her aunt,
               <lb/>a celebrated beauty.  <persName>Mr. Herbert</persName> was
               <lb/>likewise painted as a handsome youth, as
               <lb/>a boy, and at two different periods of his

               <lb/>like yourself, at the appalling sounds which

               <lb/>dinary sounds; indeed, I have heard them
               <lb/>myself utter horrible and offensive cries.
               <lb/>We must keep our fright a secret, or we
               <lb/>shall be ridiculed and laughed at.</said>
            </p>
            <p>As she pronounced these words, chiefly
               <lb/>to remove any uneasiness from her sister's
               <lb/>mind, she hastily tore open her letter, and
               <lb/>read it aloud to <persName>Jane</persName>. <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> in­
               <lb/>formed them, that <persName>sir James</persName> still continued
               <lb/>to linger, and though his recovery was
               <lb/>impossible, his disorder was of that nature,
               <lb/>that it might be months before the awful
               <lb/>event took place. It was a severe disap­
               <lb/>pointment, she continued, to be detained
               <lb/>at the <placeName>Castle of Towie Craigs</placeName>, in a manner
               <lb/>so unforeseen, and required some fortitude
               <lb/>to support, as she felt deeply concerned at
               <lb/>being separated from her children, more
               <lb/>particularly from the hope of returning
               <lb/>soon being now very distant.  But the
               <lb/>pleasing intelligence she had to communi­
               <lb/>cate would compensate, she imagined, to
               <lb/>them as it did to her, for every other cha­
               <lb/>grin. It was the agreeable news, that

               <lb/>their father was in most excellent health;
               <lb/>the air of his native hills appeared to have
               <lb/>restored his youth.  He amused himself
               <lb/>with his gun, in climbing the steep ascents,
               <lb/>and wandering among the moors, moss-
               <lb/>grounds, and dales he had formerly trod;
               <lb/>in retracing the scenes of his youthful
               <lb/>pleasures, and visiting those acquaintances
               <lb/>of his early days that remained in the
               <lb/>neighbourhood, he seemed to have forgot­
               <lb/>ten all his cares.  His enjoyments, <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> observed, constituted hers, for
               <lb/>she had no other; and when the general
               <lb/>was absent, she was oppressed with melan­
               <lb/>choly.  <placeName>The Castle</placeName> was neglected and
               <lb/>dirty, and she had never seen a female
               <lb/>countenance of higher rank than a peasant
               <lb/>since she entered it.  The food was of
               <lb/>the coarsest and plainest description, and
               <lb/>that scantily supplied, as <persName>sir James's</persName> ruling
               <lb/>passion influenced him on the verge of the
               <lb/>grave, and his old servants, <persName>Sandy</persName> and
               <lb/><persName>Maggie</persName>, were governed by the same spirit
               <lb/>of economy. Though she ate but little
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">herself,</mw>
               <pb/>

               <lb/>herself, she was delighted to observe the
               <lb/>keen relish with which the general partook
               <lb/>of his homely fare, his appetite sharpened
               <lb/>by straying among the leafless woods,
               <lb/>and over the bleak heath-covered wastes.
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> concluded with saying,
               <lb/>that she confided in their continuing to
               <lb/>pursue the line of conduct the general's
               <lb/>and her affection had pointed out before
               <lb/>they left <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, and that the goodness
               <lb/>of their children would console them for
               <lb/>every misfortune and mortification they
               <lb/>had experienced through life.  <persName>Mrs. Doug­
               <lb/>las</persName> added, that if they did not return home
               <lb/>as soon as they wished, she hoped they
               <lb/>would enjoy their brother's society and
               <lb/>protection very shortly, which would en­
               <lb/>liven their solitude.
            </p>
            <p>When <persName>Rose</persName> had finished this letter, she
               <lb/>expressed her severe regret at the probable
               <lb/>long protracted absence of her beloved
               <lb/>parents, in which <persName>Jane</persName> concurred; and <persName>Miss
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> then began to answer her mo­
               <lb/>ther's letter, and inform her of all that had

               <milestone unit="sig" n="B9v"/>
               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">18</mw>
               <lb/>passed in her absence. Her sister and her­
               <lb/>self were to write alternately; but <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>was to answer the first letter.  <persName>Jane</persName> went
               <lb/>into the library to practise and sing to her
               <lb/>lute, while her sister was thus engaged.
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> had written nearly half of her letter,
               <lb/>and described to her mother the avowal
               <lb/><persName>captain Courtenay</persName> had made of his attach­
               <lb/>ment, and his first intention of writing to
               <lb/>her father for his consent to their union,
               <lb/>and that he now thought of delaying the
               <lb/>subject till they returned home.  Just as
               <lb/>she had acknowledged in her letter her
               <lb/>predilection for him, which she hoped her
               <lb/>mother would approve, her attention was
               <lb/>aroused by the opening of the door, and
               <lb/>she beheld the form most dear to her en­
               <lb/>ter.  Though seldom now absent from her
               <lb/>thoughts, he was particularly present at
               <lb/>that moment.
            </p>
            <p><said>I met your sister,</said> said <persName>Courtenay</persName>,
               <lb/><said>going into the garden, and she informed

               <lb/>general is so well, but sorry he is detain­
               <lb/>ed.  Come, put by your writing, as I in­
               <lb/>tend chatting an hour or two with you;
               <lb/>and as no post goes from <placeName>Exeter</placeName> to-day,
               <lb/>you will have time enough to finish your
               <lb/>letter to-night or to-morrow.  Have you
               <lb/>mentioned me in your epistle?</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> blushed, and, with her natural
               <lb/>candour, confessed she had disclosed his
               <lb/>proposals and professions of regard.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Courtenay</persName> looked rather confused, and
               <lb/>his eye fell beneath hers, for <persName>Rose</persName> inno­
               <lb/>cently gazed at him as she spoke, with­
               <lb/>out observing his agitation.  They had

               <lb/>they walked out, and <persName>Courtenay</persName> remark­
               <lb/>ing the circumstance to her, requested to
               <lb/>be allowed to imprint a kiss.  <persName>Rose</persName> did
               <lb/>not like to refuse this favour, as she con­
               <lb/>sidered herself engaged to him; but when
               <lb/>he noticed that he never had an opportu­
               <lb/>nity of enjoying such happiness till now,
               <lb/>she replied, with great simplicity, that it
               <lb/>was his own fault.

               <lb/>grant in the presence of my mother and
               <lb/>sister.  This has been early inculcated to
               <lb/>me, and that no man, who truly loves,
               <lb/>would require any indulgence a parent
               <lb/>would disapprove in their absence.</said>

               <lb/>rejoined <persName>Courtenay</persName>, <said>but she has, like
               <lb/>you, prejudices, from not having seen so
               <lb/>much of the world as I have; she cannot
               <lb/>consequently be so good a judge of what
               <lb/>is correct and consistent with the general
               <lb/>opinion of mankind.  You cannot love
               <lb/>me, if you prefer her advice to mine; you
               <lb/>should be guided by your <persName>Courtenay</persName>, who

               <lb/>rows, and disappointments, which I would
               <lb/>cheerfully dissipate, and if possible prevent:
               <lb/>but as no man is wise at all times, so nei­

               <lb/>times; it is not, it is much to be feared, the

               <lb/>triumphs, and folly takes the lead—But

               <lb/>rupt the pure character of <persName>Rose Douglas</persName>
               <lb/>in the most designing manner. Her asto­
               <lb/>nishment was so great, that she could not
               <lb/>express her surprise at that moment.
               <lb/>Though little acquainted with the world,
               <lb/>her morality was so steady, and her bias
               <lb/>to virtue so naturally great, that she had
               <lb/>a horror of every thing tending to vice,
               <lb/>well aware of its deformity. To his infinite
               <lb/>vexation, <persName>Jane</persName> interrupted them, for it was
               <lb/>his intention to endeavour to more strong­
               <lb/>ly disseminate his vicious notions into her
               <lb/>spotless mind, not suspecting the disappro­

            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> had left them together two hours,

               <lb/>the following day.  With a good-nature
               <lb/>not very usual with her ladyship, she con­

               <lb/>which did not please <persName>Jane Douglas</persName>, who

            <p>The soft incense of flattery was harmo­
               <lb/>ny to <persName>Jane</persName>, and the most exaggerated
               <lb/>adulation was not too gross for the de­

               <lb/>bled with apprehension for her sister's
               <lb/>happiness, from perceiving her heart would
               <lb/>soon be won by any being, however
               <lb/>worthless and undeserving, that flattered
               <lb/>her. She always repeated, with exultation
               <lb/>and vanity, even the most trifling compli­
               <lb/>ments she received.  <persName>Rose</persName>, with the hop

            <p>Notwithstanding the imperfections of

               <lb/>gentleman's daughter, when engaged to

               <lb/>The glow of health on her cheeks vanish­
               <lb/>ed, and a snowy paleness succeeded; even
               <lb/>from her lips the roseat colour fled. A
               <lb/>weight seemed to oppress her heart, while
               <lb/>she tried to suppress the drops of anguish
               <lb/>that were ready to flow, as she could not
               <lb/>endure that <persName>Louise</persName> and her sister should
               <lb/>perceive her weakness, in regretting one
               <lb/>so unworthy and deceptious.  Feeling
               <lb/>herself, however, nearly fainting, she found
               <lb/>it impossible to restrain her emotion any

               <lb/>severe, from having placed unlimited con­

               <lb/>against her. She does not blame the

               <lb/>Had my father and mother been at home,
               <lb/>he would not have ventured to disclose
               <lb/>his disgraceful passion, for it is humiliat­
               <lb/>ing to be the object of a dishonourable re­
               <lb/>gard. Most artfully he took advantage
               <lb/>of their absence, and I was always rather
               <lb/>surprised at his never on any occasion
               <lb/>writing me a love-letter. Men in gene­
               <lb/>ral, when they have any attachment, I have

            <p>Thus keenly wounded and depressed
               <lb/>with grief, was the aching bosom of <persName>Rose
               <lb/>Douglas</persName>.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Louise</persName> and her sister feelingly endea­
               <lb/>voured to raise her spirits by lively and
               <lb/>entertaining subjects of conversation; and
               <lb/>wishing to appear grateful, she pretended
               <lb/>to lose the remembrance, in listening to
               <lb/>them, of her unprincipled lover. But a
               <lb/>little incident that accidentally occurred
               <lb/>revived the recollection of him so forcibly,
               <lb/>that involuntary tears bathed her pallid
               <lb/>cheeks, which her friend and sister pre­
               <lb/>tended to disregard, that they might not
               <lb/>increase her anguish.
            </p>
            <p>At that instant the bugle at the side of
               <lb/>the river loudly sounded; the splashing of
               <lb/>oars in the water followed, and the sono­
               <lb/>rous bell echoed through the ancient man­
               <lb/>sion with a heavy solemn sound.

               <lb/>the room, and up the staircase, to reach
               <lb/>her apartment before the hall-door opened.
               <lb/>Fearful she might be obliged to make her
               <lb/>appearance, she bathed her eyes with cold
               <lb/>water, to remove the redness caused by
               <lb/>the tears she had shed, and as she was
               <lb/>thus engaged, heard the massy portal
               <lb/>grate on its rusty hinges.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> remained undisturbed for some
               <lb/>time, to her great satisfaction, as the traces
               <lb/>of affliction were disappearing, and would
               <lb/>soon not be easily observed. Gladly
               <lb/>would she have continued retired up
               <lb/>stairs, but <persName>Kamira</persName> tapped at the door,
               <lb/>and said a gentleman wished to speak
               <lb/>with her directly in the drawing-room.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> inquired who it was that
               <lb/>was so anxious to see her? but <persName>Kamira</persName>,
               <lb/>not having seen this visitor, could not tell,
               <lb/>as <persName>Robin</persName> had delivered the message for
               <lb/>her to convey to his young mistress.
               <lb/>Though her curiosity was awakened, she
               <lb/>obeyed the summons with a heavy heart.

               <lb/>her astonishment when the first person
               <lb/>that met her eyes was <persName>Eustace</persName>, standing
               <lb/>by the fire, conversing gravely with <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>and <persName>Louise</persName>.
            </p>
            <p>Hardly could she recognize him, so
               <lb/>much was he changed. No longer inso­
               <lb/>lent and haughty, a pensive air was dif­
               <lb/>fused over his meagre face. His form was
               <lb/>equally emaciated, and an old shabby blue
               <lb/>great-coat hung loosely wrapped about
               <lb/>his wasted figure. One arm was support­
               <lb/>ed by a sling, and the other he held out
               <lb/>with a smile, to shake hands with <persName>Rose</persName>,
               <lb/>assuming a look of sweetness and good-
               <lb/>humour foreign to his nature.
            </p>
            <p>The bugle now sounded again: the ab­

               <lb/>of <persName>Eustace</persName>, and then retreated. He ap­

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> answered not, but flew with the

               <lb/>all the feeling humanity she possessed.
               <lb/>A fellow-being was in distress: she re­

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> then repaired to the kitchen, to

               <lb/>him to destruction.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> now ordered them to prepare the
               <lb/>secret chamber at the bottom of the turret
               <lb/>near the cellars, which it was impossible
               <lb/>for any one to discover who was not well
               <lb/>acquainted with its situation. As soon as
               <lb/>it was ready, and the bedding well aired,
               <lb/>she desired them to inform her, and in the
               <lb/>meantime to bring some refreshments and
               <lb/>wine for the gentleman.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> afterwards returned to calm the
               <lb/>agitated mind of her guest, and disclosed
               <lb/>to him immediately that he had no rea­
               <lb/>sonable motive for alarm. She acquainted
               <lb/>him at the same time with the steps she
               <lb/>had taken for his entire security, and the

               <lb/>freshed, though the wound in his arm was

               <lb/>humanely washed his wound, and then

            <p>When he was gone, <persName>Jane</persName> observed to

               <lb/>to that ill-natured man, who had treated
               <lb/>her lately with unvarying insolence.—
               <lb/><said>He ought to have been turned from the
               <lb/>door,</said> she continued, <said>for his imperti­
               <lb/>nence. I am convinced he is a mass of de­
               <lb/>ceit, and has a mean soul to come cringing
               <lb/>and praising (because he is in distress) the
               <lb/>woman he before constantly insulted. If
               <lb/>he really admired you, as he now pretends,
               <lb/>he would have conducted himself better.
               <lb/>In adversity he can behave correctly, but
               <lb/>depend on it, in prosperity he will be as
               <lb/>gross and ill-tempered as ever.</said>

               <lb/>sickly and poverty-struck appearance,
               <lb/>melted the tender heart of the feeling
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName>. Even <persName>Jane</persName> and <persName>Louise</persName>, whose bo­
               <lb/>soms were steeled against him, began to
               <lb/>commiserate the unfortunate <persName>Eustace</persName>, and
               <lb/>in compassion for his present sufferings,
               <lb/>strove to forget his former haughty inso­
               <lb/>lence. When not walking through the
               <lb/>various apartments in the turret, he was
               <lb/>engaged in reading, or writing numberless
               <lb/>letters on business, which <persName>Rose</persName> promised
               <lb/>to get conveyed for him to the post: but
               <lb/>he never quitted that part of the mansion,
               <lb/>or ventured beyond the confines of his
               <lb/>secure retreat, the friendly turret.
            </p>
            <p>In the afternoon <persName>Courtenay</persName> arrived. He
               <lb/>had watched the return of <persName>lady Morring­
               <lb/>ton</persName> and <persName>mademoiselle de <placeName>Rimont</placeName></persName>, and
               <lb/>knowing that the coast was now clear at
               <lb/><placeName>Treharne</placeName>, he set off for that place with all
               <lb/>possible expedition; eager was he to pro­
               <lb/>secute his designs on the ill-fated unsus­
               <lb/>picious <persName>Rose</persName>, who never would have sus­
               <lb/>pected him. It was the information <persName>Louise</persName>

               <lb/>communicated that opened her eyes for
               <lb/>the first time; and but for her friendly
               <lb/>warning voice, she might probably have
               <lb/>been plunged still deeper in misery.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Courtenay</persName> wished to subjugate her to
               <lb/>his power, before his intended marriage
               <lb/>with <persName>Miss Manson</persName>, which he flattered
               <lb/>himself would not reach <persName>Miss Douglas's</persName>
               <lb/>ear, as she now lived so retired in con­
               <lb/>sequence of the general's absence. He had
               <lb/>considered that if he was united to a rich
               <lb/>woman, who did not interest his feelings,
               <lb/>he could with her wealth support magni­
               <lb/>ficently the woman he loved. But obtain
               <lb/>her he must, before he married, or it would
               <lb/>be impossible, he knew, to gain her, from
               <lb/>her rectitude of principle, afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>Most fortunately, as he erroneously
               <lb/>thought, when he came to <placeName>Treharne</placeName> he
               <lb/>found the lovely object of his guilty pas­
               <lb/>sion alone in the drawing-room. <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>was gone out to take a walk, <persName>Rose</persName> being
               <lb/>too much indisposed to accompany her.
               <lb/><persName>Courtenay</persName> entered with a countenance of

               <lb/>happiness and animation, and an elastic
               <lb/>step, as all his designs were apparently
               <lb/>prosperous. However, her serious air,
               <lb/>and her eyes red with weeping, as she had
               <lb/>indulged her grief in solitude, now her sis­
               <lb/>ter was absent, alarmed and damped his
               <lb/>spirits.—<said>I am afraid you are not well,</said>
               <lb/>he exclaimed, and offered to clasp her in
               <lb/>his arms; but she repulsed him indig­
               <lb/>nantly, saying—<said>This is going beyond
               <lb/>the bounds of friendship, <persName>captain Courte­
               <lb/>nay.</persName></said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Friendship!</said> he replied with emo­
               <lb/>tion; <said>that is a cold word. I deceived my­
               <lb/>self then in supposing you allowed me
               <lb/>your love? Did you not own you regard­
               <lb/>ed me well enough to brave adversity? I
               <lb/>assure you, my love, you have never been

               <lb/>to share my fate, good or bad. Repeat
               <lb/>what I desire ardently to hear again.
               <lb/>Would you not like to have me for your

            <p><persName>Courtenay</persName> started; guilt was in his
               <lb/>countenance; he rose from his seat, looked
               <lb/>confused, paced the room, and did not an­
               <lb/>swer for several minutes. At length he
               <lb/>mildly articulated—<said>How can you talk
               <lb/>so?—am I not poor myself?</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Then you should never have address­
               <lb/>ed me, nor artfully won my affection by
               <lb/>assiduous attention and professions of re­
               <lb/>gard, when you intended to wed another.
               <lb/>I have been too well educated to be your
               <lb/>mistress, and disgrace my family. My fa­
               <lb/>ther and brother are brave and honour­
               <lb/>able, and would resent your base conduct
               <lb/>if they knew it; but no consideration
               <lb/>should cause me to endanger their valued

               <lb/>manner proved he was quite confounded,
               <lb/>with all his assurance. <said>’Tis false that I
               <lb/>am going to be married. Who told you
               <lb/>I was? What is the name of the lady?</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I shall not divulge who told me; but
               <lb/>the name of the lady is <persName>Manson</persName>, the rich
               <lb/>heiress.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>It's false as hell!</said> ejaculated <persName>Courte­
               <lb/>nay</persName>, exasperated to fury: <said>blisters on the
               <lb/>tongue who said it! I am not going to
               <lb/>be married. Do you think I would come
               <lb/>and see you if I were?</said>
            </p>
            <p>His manner was so natural as he spoke,
               <lb/>that <persName>Rose</persName> would have doubted the truth
               <lb/>of what she had heard, had not the autho­
               <lb/>rity been so good; but as it was impos­
               <lb/>sible to doubt, it only made his falsehood
               <lb/>appear more glaring.
            </p>
            <p><said>Once I judged you had more honour
               <lb/>than to have done so,</said> replied <persName>Rose</persName>; <said>but
               <lb/>that is past. I have the best testimony for
               <lb/>the reality of my assertions, and therefore
               <lb/>for both our sakes it is better that we meet

               <lb/>loved you, and my inclination would have
               <lb/>influenced me never to have forsaken you.
               <lb/>For this reason I wish you well, and shall
               <lb/>be tempted to think, if you had not been
               <lb/>in such narrow and distressed circum­
               <lb/>stances, you would have acted more ho­
               <lb/>nourably; but that we meet no more I
               <lb/>insist, as it can answer no good purpose.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>But I will come and see you, if I
               <lb/>think proper,</said> said <persName>Courtenay</persName>, with vehe­
               <lb/>mence; <said>you cannot prevent me.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I shall order the servants never to ad­
               <lb/>mit you, if you oblige me to act thus by
               <lb/>intruding. Do not force me to such an
               <lb/>exposure, for the affianced husband of an­
               <lb/>other shall never be encouraged by me.</said>
               <lb/>And with these words she rushed from the
               <lb/>room, to conceal the heart-wounding emo­
               <lb/>tion that almost overpowered her.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> retreated to her own apartment,
               <lb/>and locking herself in, yielded to the
               <lb/>piercing anguish that oppressed her. Bit­
               <lb/>ter tears relieved the agonizing sensations
               <lb/>that rent her bosom at this final separation

               <lb/>from a man she fondly loved, though she
               <lb/>no longer esteemed him. Reason may
               <lb/>calm, but has no power to directly remove
               <lb/>the first impression and burst of grief at
               <lb/>the loss of what we value highly—time
               <lb/>must co-operate with reason's gentle ad­
               <lb/>monitions, to effect a perfect cure.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> heard the groom lead out <persName>Courte­
               <lb/>nay's</persName> horses, and his loved voice speaking
               <lb/>to the man and <persName>Robin</persName>. Blinded nearly
               <lb/>with her tears, she yet approached the
               <lb/>window to take a last look of his beloved
               <lb/>form, so fatal to her repose. Hastily she
               <lb/>snatched a glance, fearful he might turn
               <lb/>his head and see her looking after him;
               <lb/>then clasping her hands in agony, she
               <lb/>threw herself almost fainting on the bed.
               <lb/>She listened to the sound of his horse's
               <lb/>feet as he galloped off, which she would
               <lb/>never again hear, and then wept incessant­
               <lb/>ly for an hour.—<said>Alas!</said> she exclaimed,
               <lb/><said>I have lost him for ever! I shall see him
               <lb/>no more; or if I do, it will be as the hus­
               <lb/>band of <persName>Miss Manson</persName>.</said>

            <p>When the first bitterness of her sorrow
               <lb/>was insensibly alleviated, and her agonized
               <lb/>mind more tranquil, <persName>Rose</persName> got up, and
               <lb/>looking in the glass, was shocked at her

               <lb/>apartment, looking so ill and woe-begone,
               <lb/>that she was struck with deep concern, as
               <lb/>the hardest heart must have been softened
               <lb/>at the affecting alteration she presented.—

               <lb/>somely of you, that I begin to forgive him

               <lb/>from her a great deal of intelligence re­

               <lb/>the remembrance of him to whom she had
               <lb/>been tenderly and disinterestedly attach­
               <lb/>ed could not be immediately obliterated,
               <lb/>notwithstanding all his guilt to her. That
               <lb/>heart must be unstable and insipid that

            <p>When <persName>Rose</persName> visited <persName>Eustace</persName> again, <persName>Jane</persName>

               <lb/>ful tenderness with which he accosted her.
               <lb/>Depressed as <persName>Rose</persName> was, she could hardly

               <lb/>specting <persName>Eustace</persName>. In the course of con­
               <lb/>versation, he mentioned that when the
               <lb/>bailiffs came in pursuit of him, he was at
               <lb/>a friend's near <placeName>Warwick Castle</placeName>, who had
               <lb/>a fine house with a park and large lake,
               <lb/>in which they rowed about frequently.
               <lb/>He was enjoying himself very happily,
               <lb/>when the disturbers of his felicity arrived,
               <lb/>and inquired for him at this pleasant resi­
               <lb/>dence. Suspecting from the description
               <lb/>they were sheriff's officers, he desired his
               <lb/>friend (to whom he disclosed his situation)
               <lb/>to put them on a wrong scent, and set off
               <lb/>with the utmost celerity; but with all his
               <lb/>precaution was traced by them within a
               <lb/>few miles of <placeName>Treharne</placeName>. Finding himself
               <lb/>in its vicinity, it suddenly occurred to him
               <lb/>to ask shelter from the general, not know­
               <lb/>ing he was absent, as it was a place to
               <lb/>which his persecutor could not easily have
               <lb/>access.—<said>Be persuaded, <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>,</said>
               <lb/>he continued, <said>that while life is permitted
               <lb/>to me, neither you or any branch of your

               <lb/>step you have taken in sheltering me; nor
               <lb/>can your parents censure you for being
               <lb/>humane. My heart is ready to render
               <lb/>you affectionate kindness, and when for­
               <lb/>tune no longer frowns, my hand will be
               <lb/>open to serve you and your family, as far
               <lb/>as human means, and a sincere attention
               <lb/>to your and their interest, will allow. I
               <lb/>shall say no more on the subject at pre­
               <lb/>sent—guess the rest, and experience shall
               <lb/>demonstrate that gratitude has made me
               <lb/>what I profess to be, sincerely devoted to

            <p><said>I have heard that <placeName>Warwick Castle</placeName> is
               <lb/>a most beautiful place,</said> said <persName>Jane</persName>; <said>did
               <lb/>you see it?</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I did,</said> replied <persName>Eustace</persName>, <said>and admired
               <lb/>the entrance to the Castle through a road
               <lb/>cut out of the rock, with ivy growing up
               <lb/>it. The porter's lodge is composed of a
               <lb/>single tower; in it were shewn, when I was
               <lb/>there, a great many curious things that
               <lb/>formerly belonged to <persName>Guy earl of <placeName>War­
               <lb/>wick</placeName></persName>. His sword and spear were larger

               <lb/>than any other man could use; I doubt
               <lb/>whether his horse's armour would fit the
               <lb/>largest of the cart-horse kind. There was
               <lb/>also the tusk of a wild boar which he kill­
               <lb/>ed, and the rib of a dun cow, in that day
               <lb/>the terror of the country, and twice as big
               <lb/>as any one of the common size. The in­
               <lb/>side of the Castle is large and well fur­
               <lb/>nished. After seeing the Castle, I went
               <lb/>to the church, which is called the <placeName>War­
               <lb/>wick Chapel</placeName>, and has several fine monu­
               <lb/>ments; the one of <persName>Richard Beauchamp</persName>, of
               <lb/>brass gilt and marble, is particularly so.
               <lb/>In returning from <placeName>Warwick</placeName>, I passed a
               <lb/>gentleman's seat called <placeName>Guy's Cliff</placeName>, where
               <lb/>this famous man resided; the stables are
               <lb/>cut out of the rock. Half a mile from the
               <lb/>road we saw <placeName>Kenilworth Castle</placeName>, which is
               <lb/>a ruin, one of the finest in <placeName>England</placeName>. You
               <lb/>recollect, undoubtedly, it was inhabited by
               <lb/><persName>the earl of <placeName>Leicester</placeName></persName>, who gave a grand
               <lb/>entertainment to <persName>queen Elizabeth</persName>.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I remember reading in some book a

               <lb/>I have just mentioned; but cruel destiny
               <lb/>sends me far away. I have been advised to
               <lb/>go abroad for some time, that I may avoid
               <lb/>all danger from creditors till my affairs are
               <lb/>arranged.</said>

               <lb/>intention of being guided by it. When
               <lb/>you feel secure from molestation, in a fo­

            </p>
            <p><said>It is, however, a painful sensation to

               <lb/>like always imparts happiness most per­
               <lb/>fect to me. I never had any real enjoy­
               <lb/>ment of your company before; I only saw
               <lb/>you now and then for a short period, and
               <lb/>consequently could not be so well ac­
               <lb/>quainted with your dispositions.</said>

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Jane</persName> endeavoured to recon­
               <lb/>cile him to the necessity of quitting <placeName>Eng­
               <lb/>land</placeName>, and, soothed by their representation
               <lb/>and kindness, he became less averse to it.

            <p><persName>Robin</persName> was sent every morning to <placeName>Exeter</placeName>
               <lb/>with messages, commissions, or letters for

            <p><persName>Eustace</persName> had business of moment to set­

               <lb/>Douglas</persName> when he borrowed a small sum
               <lb/>of her, occasioned much additional trouble
               <lb/>as well as expence at <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, as a sepa­

               <lb/>day. He remained a fortnight longer,
               <lb/>during which period they declined, on his
               <lb/>account, visiting <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName>, fearful the
               <lb/>servants should make any blunder and
               <lb/>inadvertently betray him in their absence,
               <lb/>as several strange rough-looking men had
               <lb/>lately made inquiries after him at their
               <lb/>house.
            </p>
            <p>Some days previous to his departure,
               <lb/>when his business was nearly settled, he
               <lb/>told <persName>Rose</persName>, before her sister, that his grati­
               <lb/>tude would never cease, and that if she
               <lb/>would condescend to accept his hand and
               <lb/>accompany him to a foreign country, he
               <lb/>could maintain her there, though not
               <lb/>in <placeName>England</placeName>. <persName>Eustace</persName> added, that he
               <lb/>would be her servant, till she got another
               <lb/>abroad, as he could not take one with them,
               <lb/>as nothing is to be told to servants, who,
               <lb/>unless old and faithful attendants, are al­
               <lb/>ways fond of chatting, which would spoil
               <lb/>his plan of retreat from his own country,
               <lb/>and the retirement in which he wished for
               <lb/>a year or two to live.—<said>I propose this,</said>

               <lb/>be more gratifying to me. It is with pain

               <lb/>my defence, will judge more favourably.
               <lb/>In a very few years, perhaps months, I
               <lb/>shall inherit a large estate from a relation,
               <lb/>who is considerably advanced in age, and
               <lb/>in a critical state of health, impaired by
               <lb/>frequent indispositions. Then,</said> he ex­
               <lb/>claimed, with apparent enthusiastic ardour,
               <lb/><said>I will prove my gratitude to <persName>Miss Doug­
               <lb/>las</persName>, who, though not rich herself, befriend­
               <lb/>ed me in the trying season of misfortune,
               <lb/>when all had forsaken me—the woman
               <lb/>who pretended to love me, friends, rela­
               <lb/>tions—all. Here I found a refuge, when
               <lb/>no other roof would shelter me. May

               <lb/>much value or importance to his profes­

               <lb/>deceived in one to whom she attributed
               <lb/>every virtue that could adorn the human
               <lb/>mind, whose understanding she had re­
               <lb/>spected, whose courage she had admired,
               <lb/>and whose good sense she had highly
               <lb/>esteemed.  <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> was not eager
               <lb/>to believe asseverations made in the mo­
               <lb/>ment of calamity, and said but little to his
               <lb/>protestations that his entire confidence
               <lb/>should be placed in her, and the transac­
               <lb/>tions of his future life reposed wholly in
               <lb/>the faithful depository of her friendly bo­
               <lb/>som. For his own sake she wished he
               <lb/>might be sincere, and seriously reform, and
               <lb/>if he did evince gratitude, would prove he
               <lb/>had some goodness of heart.

            <p>As <persName>Jane</persName> spoke, her sister's eyes imper­
               <lb/>ceptibly closed, and overcome with resist­
               <lb/>less drowsiness, she hurried off her clothes,
               <lb/>and sunk immediately into a profound
               <lb/>slumber. Yet her rest was not calm, but
               <lb/>frequently disturbed with horrible dreams:
               <lb/>sometimes she was carried over tremen­
               <lb/>dous precipices, from which she often fell,
               <lb/>and awoke with the shock, but only to

               <lb/>and dream of encountering robbers and
               <lb/>murderers.

            <p>The morning was far advanced, and the

               <lb/>did not know the time, as <persName>Kamira</persName> always
               <lb/>called them at eight, when they had not
               <lb/>been up at an unusually late hour; but
               <lb/>she was determined to rise now, as she
               <lb/>considered it would be of benefit to her
               <lb/>headache.—<said><persName>Jane</persName>,</said> said she, <said>I am very
               <lb/>unwell, and that is the reason, I suppose,
               <lb/>I was so dull when I went to sleep.</said>
            </p>
            <p>No answer being returned, <persName>Rose</persName> put
               <lb/>back the curtains of her bed to see if her
               <lb/>sister still slept, and perceived that she was
               <lb/>risen before her. Concluding from this
               <lb/>circumstance, which was quite unusual,
               <lb/>that the morning was very far advanced,
               <lb/>she hastily arose, and quickly dressing her­
               <lb/>self, repaired to the breakfast-room. Here
               <lb/>she did not, as she expected, find her, and
               <lb/>there was no appearance of her having
               <lb/>breakfasted, or any preparation for that
               <lb/>meal.

               <lb/>that she was gone, she told her, to take a
               <lb/>walk, and desired previously that <persName>Miss
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> might not be disturbed, as she
               <lb/>was indisposed. To conceal her surprise
               <lb/>was difficult, as <persName>Jane</persName> never walked so
               <lb/>early; but she kept secret her astonishment
               <lb/>in her own breast. The day, however, wore
               <lb/>away, and <persName>Jane</persName> did not return; <persName>Rose</persName> could
               <lb/>no longer therefore disguise the uneasiness
               <lb/>that oppressed her. The servants were

               <lb/>anxiety, which she did, respecting her sis­

               <lb/>only more keenly to feel the disappoint­

               <lb/>ting winds shrilly resounded through the
               <lb/>antique structure, and caused strange
               <lb/>sounds, reviving the expectation that her
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">sister</mw>

               <lb/>sister was returned, and thus more acutely
               <lb/>depressing her hopes. Neither the ser­
               <lb/>vants or <persName>Rose</persName> retired till a later hour, that
               <lb/>they might be ready to receive <persName>Miss Jane</persName>
               <lb/>if she returned: but vainly did they ex­
               <lb/>pect her. When her sister entered their
               <lb/>room, and looked at the vacant bed, her
               <lb/>heart swelled almost to suffocation—the
               <lb/>agonies she felt were indescribable. Some­
               <lb/>times she feared that <persName>Jane</persName> had fallen into
               <lb/>the river, and then other images of horror
               <lb/>presented themselves, till, exhausted with
               <lb/>misery and the deepest affliction, <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>wept herself to sleep.
            </p>
            <p>The next day, <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> recalled
               <lb/>to her remembrance how dull her sister
               <lb/>had been for some time, which was (as she
               <lb/>then remarked) quite foreign to her natu­
               <lb/>ral character. These observations made
               <lb/>her apprehensive that her flight was pre­
               <lb/>meditated, and she shuddered lest any
               <lb/>unworthy reason should have prompted
               <lb/>her to forsake her paternal roof. The un­
               <lb/>certainty she was in relative to her sister's

               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">72</mw>
               <lb/>fate added a keener sting to the sorrows
               <lb/>that pierced her bosom. She likewise re­
               <lb/>collected <persName>Jane's</persName> aversion latterly to the old
               <lb/>family mansion, their residence, which ap­
               <lb/>peared as if she had one more agreeable in
               <lb/>view.
            </p>
            <p>In the afternoon, as <persName>Rose</persName> was mourn­
               <lb/>fully seated, reading to divert her sad re­
               <lb/>flections, <persName>Robin</persName> entered with a note, which,
               <lb/>he said, a countryman had left, and would
               <lb/>not wait for an answer. At the sight of
               <lb/>her sister's handwriting, she was ready to
               <lb/>faint with joy, as it convinced her she was
               <lb/>living. Eagerly she tore it open, anxious
               <lb/>to receive some comfort to relieve her ago­
               <lb/>nized mind. <persName>Jane</persName> mentioned in her let­
               <lb/>ter, that she was concerned to have added
               <lb/>to her uneasiness by quitting her secretly,
               <lb/>but circumstances of infinite importance
               <lb/>had imperatively obliged her to act with
               <lb/>apparent want of feeling; that she wished
               <lb/>to inform her she was well, and not far off,
               <lb/>and if <persName>Rose</persName> would meet her at twelve the

               <lb/>of <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, near the rustic seat, she would
               <lb/>then impart, for her satisfaction, the events
               <lb/>that had occasioned her mysterious con­
               <lb/>duct.
            </p>
            <p>The affectionate disposition that was pe­
               <lb/>culiar to the character of <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>
               <lb/>made her rejoice at learning that no fatal
               <lb/>accident had happened to <persName>Jane</persName>—she lived,
               <lb/>and that was comfort inexpressible; every
               <lb/>other sorrow, but that of losing her for
               <lb/>ever in this world, could be endured. The
               <lb/>servants were told to make no additional
               <lb/>search, as she had received intelligence
               <lb/>that was satisfactory. Impatiently did she
               <lb/>look forward to the moment appointed,
               <lb/>though anxiety mingled with the delight
               <lb/>of meeting her. Every hour was an age
               <lb/>till the time arrived for her repairing to
               <lb/><placeName>Treharne</placeName> wood, to meet her lamented
               <lb/>sister.
            </p>
            <p>The sun shone brightly, with more than
               <lb/>usual splendour, when <persName>Rose</persName> commenced
               <lb/>her walk to the rustic seat. Its golden
               <lb/>beams glittered on the evergreens, whose

               <lb/>piercing blast that whistled through the
               <lb/>wood, where luxuriantly flourished the
               <lb/>laurel, with large dark berries, the fir-tree,
               <lb/>pine, and gloomy yew. The green and
               <lb/>variegated holly and mountain-ash, with
               <lb/>their scarlet berries, formed a gay and
               <lb/>pleasing contrast to the deep green of the
               <lb/>bay-tree and ivy. The severity of the cold
               <lb/>was unfelt by <persName>Rose</persName>, who walked very fast,
               <lb/>and the silence of the woodland scene was
               <lb/>only interrupted by the fluttering of the
               <lb/>mistletoe-thrush, who feeds in winter on
               <lb/>the white berries of this plant, that grew
               <lb/>on the ash and apple-trees with which
               <lb/><placeName>Treharne</placeName> wood abounded.

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> waited a quarter of an hour at the
               <lb/>place of rendezvous with agitation and im­
               <lb/>patience. At last <persName>Jane</persName> appeared, slowly
               <lb/>advancing towards her. <persName>Rose</persName> burst into
               <lb/>tears when they met, and perceived, with
               <lb/>grief, <persName>Jane's</persName> pale and altered countenance,
               <lb/>which betrayed the conflicting passions she
               <lb/>had suffered since they parted.

               <lb/>close our union, for some reason, to which
               <lb/>I am a stranger. It is too late to retract;
               <lb/>I have given myself a master, and I am
               <lb/>forced to obey. Oh, <persName>Rose</persName>! had I followed
               <lb/>your advice, which I despised, I should
               <lb/>not have been thus miserable. It is <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Pryce</persName> that has been my destruction. To
               <lb/>divert myself, I weakly embraced every

               <lb/>to your persuasion, and unknown to you

               <lb/>and her influence so great, that she gained
               <lb/>a forcible ascendancy over me. Two gen­

               <lb/>one of them, <persName>colonel Guilford</persName>, who was

               <lb/>his person, by degrees I got entangled with
               <lb/>him in a love affair; yet I would not,
               <lb/>though I gave him encouragement, posi­
               <lb/>tively engage myself, as I really was not
               <lb/>partial to him as a lover. In fact, I should

               <lb/>that he governed me against my inclina­
               <lb/>tion. Time passed, and every thing went
               <lb/>on quietly, till by some chance (of which
               <lb/>I am ignorant) the colonel gained informa­
               <lb/>tion of the assiduities and admiration of
               <lb/>the <persName>count de Fontenai</persName> and the <persName>marquis de

               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>, to whom I imparted all that
               <lb/>occurred in confidence, betrayed me, as I
               <lb/>had mentioned how much the count and
               <lb/>marquis admired me, for it is impossible
               <lb/>to imagine any other method by which he

               <lb/>wash his hands in the blood of that man
               <lb/>who dared address me. The colonel add­
               <lb/>ed, that if I did not consent to marry him
               <lb/>in a few days, he would destroy me, and
               <lb/>afterwards blow out his own brains. I
               <lb/>was terrified into compliance, and consent­
               <lb/>ed to meet him in three days at <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Pryce's</persName>, to listen to what he had further
               <lb/>to say on the subject; for I really fancied
               <lb/>he loved me to distraction, and would ex­

            <p>Most unfortunate was the moment

               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>, seated at table. After an
               <lb/>early dinner, with an elegant dessert, and
               <lb/>a profusion of different costly wines, of
               <lb/>which they made me partake, I am of

               <lb/>was poured into the wine, for I only, with
               <lb/>great persuasion, drank two glasses, yet
               <lb/>felt giddy and stupid after drinking them.

                <lb/>costed me with the most winning tender­
                <lb/>ness. When he perceived his arts had

                <lb/>man was in the house, and that he had
                <lb/>procured a special licence, which would
                <lb/>make me his for ever. A heavy stupor
                <lb/>enchained my senses, caused by the drug
                <lb/>infused into the wine; I was scarcely sen­
                <lb/>sible of what I did, and influenced by ter­
                <lb/>ror (as the fear of some horrible catastrophe,
                <lb/>if I refused, overwhelmed me), in an evil
                <lb/>hour I consented to unite my destiny with

                <lb/>dent to keep it a secret till his death, to
                <lb/>which measure I assented.

               <p>A circumstance, however, that would
                  <lb/>have been interesting, had my parents' ap­

                  <lb/>me to take some step to avoid my situ­

                  <lb/>I have been told is pleasing to most men
                  <lb/>who are attached to their wives, he was
                  <lb/>quite out of humour. It was useless for
                  <lb/>him to be discontented; he had no alter­
                  <lb/>native, and conveyed me, on the morning
                  <lb/>I was missed, to a small house about ten
                  <lb/>miles off. Previously, he gave me some

                  <lb/>this disclosure, he should also solicit your
                  <lb/>secrecy: but he contrived to delay his in­

               <lb/>hers and her parents' happiness. Yet, me­
               <lb/>lancholy as she was, <persName>Rose</persName> felt considerable
               <lb/>relief at knowing <persName>Jane's</persName> real destiny, as no

               <lb/>have had the fortunate consequence of
               <lb/>rendering her more steady, and made her
               <lb/>seriously reflect on her misconduct. <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>liked her sister's vivacity when it was re­
               <lb/>strained within proper bounds, but when
               <lb/>she transgressed them, and wounded the
               <lb/>feelings of others thoughtlessly, it often
               <lb/>inflicted severe pain, which inclined her

               <lb/>Hardly dared she ask <persName>Rose</persName> the cause of her
               <lb/>pensive look, from a forebodement that
               <lb/>some serious calamity had happened. This
               <lb/>lady loved her friend, <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>, with
               <lb/>the most sincere affection, and the pro­

               <lb/>of her family would have caused her the
               <lb/>deepest sorrow. <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> inquired after
               <lb/><persName>Miss Jane Douglas</persName>, as she was absent, and
               <lb/>the perturbation with which <persName>Rose</persName> answer­

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> hesitated for a few minutes, as it
               <lb/>was not her secret only, but her sister's;
               <lb/>otherwise, from the frankness of her charac­

            <p>The struggle in her bosom soon, how­

               <lb/>and discerning friend. Without further
               <lb/>hesitation, <persName>Rose</persName> now revealed, with can­
               <lb/>dour and artlessly, her unexpected grief at
               <lb/>being deprived so alarmingly of her sister's
               <lb/>society, at a period, too, when the consola­
               <lb/>tion of a companion was most required.
               <lb/>Yet this deprivation she could have borne
               <lb/>with resignation, had she been assured of
               <lb/>her happiness; but she had, alas! reason
               <lb/>to fear, that by her want of duty, and de­
               <lb/>sertion of her, she had ascertained her own
               <lb/>infelicity.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> listened to this simple narra­

               <lb/>was inevitable, acquainting the general
               <lb/>and <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> with <persName>Jane's</persName> elopement.
               <lb/>A precipitate avowal of her clandestine
               <lb/>marriage, as they were at a distance, would
               <lb/>poignantly afflict them, and irritate the
               <lb/>general, which would add an additional
               <lb/>pang to her mother's woes. Many alle­

               <lb/>This promise made her less miserable,
               <lb/>and the agreeable conversation of this

               <lb/>who was intimate with her brother, and
               <lb/>brought intelligence of him so deservedly
               <lb/>beloved by her. <persName>Robin</persName> retired just as
               <lb/>she was addressing the stranger with the
               <lb/>usual compliments on such an occasion,
               <lb/>and requesting him to approach the fire.
            </p>
            <p>The stranger answered not, but stood
               <lb/>immovable and irresolute, till the retreat­
               <lb/>ing steps of <persName>Robin</persName> were unheard. Amaze­
               <lb/>ment at such unexpected behaviour asto­
               <lb/>nished <persName>Rose</persName>, but before she had time to
               <lb/>recover from the wonder that seized and
               <lb/>perplexed her, the stranger hastily threw

               <lb/>off the plaid cloak and fur cap which dis­
               <lb/>guised him, and discovered to her asto­
               <lb/>nished sight the figure of her perfidious
               <lb/>lover, <persName>Courtenay</persName>.
            </p>
            <p>A light wig covered his black hair, and
               <lb/>a pair of brown mustachios, painted on his
               <lb/>upper lip, disfigured and altered him so
               <lb/>effectually, that it was impossible to find
               <lb/>out the diguisement immediately. <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>shrieked aloud, but <persName>Robin</persName> was too far off
               <lb/>to hear her, as he was very deaf.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Courtenay</persName> clasped her to his bosom, and
               <lb/>asked if he had not counterfeited well to
               <lb/>deceive her and the old man? adding,
               <lb/>that it was a proof how much he loved, to
               <lb/>take so much trouble only to see her.
            </p>
            <p>Indignant, <persName>Rose</persName> struggled to free her­
               <lb/>self; but he held her fast, notwithstanding
               <lb/>all her efforts and remonstrances. Find­
               <lb/>ing that opposition would not move him,
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> now descended to entreaties. Pa­
               <lb/>thetically and with tears, she implored
               <lb/>him to release her, and at length gained
               <lb/>her point. But <persName>Courtenay</persName> would not re­

               <pb/>

               <lb/>store her to liberty till he had first insisted
               <lb/>on her listening attentively to him. Un­
               <lb/>mindful of this stipulation, <persName>Rose</persName> was no
               <lb/>sooner released than she flew to the bell,
               <lb/>which <persName>Courtenay</persName> prevented her reaching,
               <lb/>being aware of this circumstance.
            </p>
            <p>He instantly uttered the most horrible
               <lb/>imprecations, and threatened that the con­
               <lb/>sequence should be seriously fatal if she
               <lb/>again made the attempt. <persName>Rose</persName> submit­
               <lb/>ted, from knowing that the kitchen was
               <lb/>at too great a distance for her screams to
               <lb/>be audible, and she yielded from necessity.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Courtenay</persName> now proceeded, with an elo­
               <lb/>quence that might have prevailed in a
               <lb/>nobler cause, to supplicate her to be his
               <lb/>mistress privately. His embarrassed finan­
               <lb/>ces, and the debts he had contracted,
               <lb/>would not suffer him, he observed, to
               <lb/>marry at a period so critical, but that in
               <lb/>the course of a twelvemonth his income
               <lb/>would be augmented; he could then have
               <lb/>the happiness of offering himself and for­
               <lb/>tune to her, though the ardour of his
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">passion</mw>

               <lb/>passion would not brook delay till that
               <lb/>time, as another might in the interim de­
               <lb/>prive him of her he only loved. The
               <lb/>match that was to have taken place be­
               <lb/>tween him and <persName>Miss Manson</persName> had, he as­
               <lb/>serted, been broken off, from his superior
               <lb/>attachment to her, and he was resolved no
               <lb/>consideration should influence him to wed
               <lb/>another woman—he was hers and only
               <lb/>hers for life, and if she would indulge him
               <lb/>by being his, on his own terms, for a short
               <lb/>time, he could visit her at her father's till
               <lb/>fortune was his friend, and he could call
               <lb/>her his own in the face of the world.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> mildly deprecated a proposal she
               <lb/>considered as insulting to a female edu­
               <lb/>cated in virtuous principles. Finding she
               <lb/>persevered in rejecting gently, but with
               <lb/>firmness, his vicious propositions, his rage
               <lb/>became ungovernable.—<said>Do you think,</said>
               <lb/>he cried, with an expression of fury that
               <lb/>made her shudder—<said>do you think I will
               <lb/>sacrifice all my brilliant prospects for love
               <lb/>and you? No! you shall be mine on what

               <lb/>terms I think proper;</said> and as he thun­
               <lb/>dered out these words, with the counte­
               <lb/>nance of a demon, he struck her several
               <lb/>blows so severely, that they appeared as if
               <lb/>they would annihilate and crush her slight
               <lb/>and fragile form, shaped with unequalled
               <lb/>symmetry.
            </p>
            <p>Seeing her shrink from him with hor­
               <lb/>ror, he roughly grasped her arms till the
               <lb/>coarse pressure bruised them, then seized
               <lb/>her hand so tightly, that he grazed the
               <lb/>skin, and the blood gushed out. Terrified
               <lb/>to agony, and writhing with pain, <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>was quite desperate, as she thought herself
               <lb/>in the power of a madman; she now ex­
               <lb/>erted all her strength, and springing sud­
               <lb/>denly and forcibly from him, reached the
               <lb/>bell, which she rang violently, feeling her
               <lb/>life endangered.
            </p>
            <p>To hear their young lady ring the bell
               <lb/>with such violence was so unusual, that
               <lb/><persName>Robin</persName> and <persName>Kamira</persName> were quite frightened,
               <lb/>as they remembered a stranger was with
               <lb/>her, and had been told stories of robbers

               <lb/>introducing themselves into a house with
               <lb/>some plausible tale. The faithful <name>Indian</name>
               <lb/>would accompany him to the library, to
               <lb/>assist in defending her dear <persName>Miss Rose</persName>, if
               <lb/>necessary.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Courtenay</persName> gnashed his teeth and grind­
               <lb/>ed them with a ferocious glance when
               <lb/>they entered, which gave him a fiend-like
               <lb/>look, not resembling any thing human
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> had ever beheld. Inwardly she re­
               <lb/>turned thanks to Heaven, who had rescued
               <lb/>her from the power of this barbarian, in
               <lb/>whose face, distorted with brutal anger
               <lb/>and unmanly vice, she could not trace the
               <lb/>soft, smiling, insinuating being who had
               <lb/>won her regard.
            </p>
            <p>A moment had scarcely elapsed since
               <lb/>the bell loudly sounded, for <persName>Robin</persName> and
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> had ran instead of walked from
               <lb/>the kitchen, so much did they respect and
               <lb/>love <persName>Miss Rose</persName>, and feel alarmed, from
               <lb/>the fear of any harm happening to their
               <lb/>excellent young lady. Both servants stood
               <lb/>aghast when they perceived <persName>captain Courte­

               <lb/>nay</persName>, as they knew him notwithstanding
               <lb/>his mustachios, and <persName>Robin</persName> was surprised
               <lb/>at finding a gentleman in the library so
               <lb/>different from the one he had introduced,
               <lb/>and that he had described to <persName>Kamira</persName>,
               <lb/>which filled her with wonder. <persName>Miss
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> desired <persName>Kamira</persName> to remain in the
               <lb/>library, and told <persName>Robin</persName> to attend <persName>captain
               <lb/>Courtenay</persName> to the hall-door, and then ferry
               <lb/>him over the river. With a gloomy, sul­
               <lb/>len air, <persName>Courtenay</persName> put the wig in his
               <lb/>pocket, placed his fur cap on his head,
               <lb/>and throwing on the plaid cloak, walked
               <lb/>away without speaking. He was so much
               <lb/>disconcerted that he had lost all that artful
               <lb/>self-command that generally distinguished
               <lb/>him, and made him succeed in his impure
               <lb/>wicked designs
            </p>
            <p>When <persName>Rose</persName> heard <persName>Robin</persName> return from
               <lb/>escorting him to the other side of the ri­
               <lb/>ver, a weight appeared taken off her mind.
               <lb/>She told him to securely fasten every door,
               <lb/>and particularly that one at the back of
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">the</mw>

               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">96</mw>
               <lb/>the house, by which she discovered he had
               <lb/>entered. <persName>Robin</persName> had attributed his coming
               <lb/>that way to his being a stranger, and had not
               <lb/>entertained the least suspicion; but <persName>Miss
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> cautioned him to be more careful
               <lb/>in future, and never suffer any one to en­
               <lb/>ter by that back passage at night. When
               <lb/><persName>Robin</persName> was dismissed, <persName>Rose</persName> shewed <persName>Ka­
               <lb/>mira</persName> the bruises on her arms, which were
               <lb/>very painful and frightfully swelled; one
               <lb/>hand was very much lacerated and bleed­
               <lb/>ing, to which she made <persName>Kamira</persName> apply the
               <lb/>ointment that had cured the wound <persName>Eus­
               <lb/>tace</persName> had received in defending himself.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> bathed the bruises with hot
               <lb/>vinegar, and as she gently rubbed them,
               <lb/>washed the marks of savage violence with
               <lb/>the tears of fidelity and real sensibility.
               <lb/>The ideas of revenge in which she had
               <lb/>been educated mingled with her sorrow
               <lb/>for her mistress; anger flashed in her fine
               <lb/>black eyes as she ceased to weep.—<said>I

            </p>
            <p>Ill as <persName>Rose</persName> felt, she could scarce refrain
               <lb/>from smiling, as a word from her made
               <lb/>her as gentle as a lamb, though she talked
               <lb/>so furiously; for gratitude was the first
               <lb/>sentiment that influenced the <name>American
               <lb/>Indian's</name> grateful breast, and to obey her
               <lb/>benefactors the chief wish of her ardent

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> found it impossible to persuade
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> to think differently, and she
               <lb/>ceased to combat her opinions. The
               <lb/>appearance of <persName>Courtenay</persName>, and his un­
               <lb/>paralleled and unpardonable insults and
               <lb/>barbarity, had again disturbed her return­
               <lb/>ing tranquillity: yet amidst all the an­
               <lb/>guish that oppressed her, she had one gra­
               <lb/>tifying source of consolation, the unshaken
               <lb/>rectitude and faithful zeal of her domes­
               <lb/>tics, that no money could bribe—no temp­
               <lb/>tation allure, to betray her to <persName>Courtenay</persName>
               <lb/>by willingly admitting him. Since he
               <lb/>had thus artfully intruded himself, she
               <lb/>never suffered herself to be alone, as she
               <lb/>thought it most prudent to be prepared
               <lb/>for the worst events, though she did not
               <lb/>anticipate what was alarming.
            </p>
            <p>Again she repeated her caution to <persName>Ro­
               <lb/>bin</persName>, to avoid letting any strangers enter at

               <lb/>with her, to remain in the apartment till
               <lb/>she requested him to go, as <persName>Dolly</persName> was her
               <lb/>companion when <persName>Kamira</persName> was unavoidably
               <lb/>absent.

            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> was the only person to whom
               <lb/>she had resolution to disclose the infamous
               <lb/>and brutal conduct of <persName>captain Courtenay</persName>,
               <lb/>and the horror he had inspired her with,
               <lb/>as she erroneously thought such treatment
               <lb/>degraded her. It was insupportable to
               <lb/>her feelings that any one should know she
               <lb/>had been so grossly insulted by such un­
               <lb/>equivocal offers, to make her hateful to
               <lb/>herself, and contemptible in the eyes of her
               <lb/>friends. She had often heard others cen­
               <lb/>sured very illiberally for making dis­
               <lb/>closures of this description, and unavoid­
               <lb/>able compulsion only would make her
               <lb/>willing to unbosom herself, except to her
               <lb/>mother or sister.

               <lb/>wept at the reflection that he had ever
               <lb/>been valued by her: yet with all his
               <lb/>crimes, she wished that his own upbraid­
               <lb/>ing conscience would be his punishment,
               <lb/>and that none of her relations might im­
               <lb/>brue their hands in his guilty blood. Were
               <lb/>she to make his brutality known, she was
               <lb/>assured her father or brother would avenge
               <lb/>her cause, and the severest sufferings she
               <lb/>would rather encounter than be the inno­
               <lb/>cent occasion of risking lives so beloved
               <lb/>and precious. Even the laws of her coun­
               <lb/>try would protect her, if he presumed to
               <lb/>molest her any more, as from the barba­
               <lb/>rous assault she had personally sustained,
               <lb/>she could with justice assert her life was
               <lb/>threatened. To add to her horror, he had
               <lb/>several times exclaimed, during their last
               <lb/>fatal interview—<said>Oh, if I had but an op­
               <lb/>portunity—if I had but a favourable op­
               <lb/>portunity of having you completely in my
               <lb/>power!</said> The truth was, his vanity flatter­
               <lb/>ed itself that so tenderly did she love him
               <lb/>that he could never offend beyond for­

               <lb/>giveness, and that she would pardon the
               <lb/>most brutal outrage. But with his un­
               <lb/>derstanding, he should have recollected
               <lb/>that continual ill usage weakens the
               <lb/>strongest attachment, and a constant re­
               <lb/>petition of offences exhausts the most af­
               <lb/>fectionate disposition, and insensibly pro­

               <lb/>unfeeling wound, the gentle, pure, and
               <lb/>guiltless breast, yet will its serenity revive
               <lb/>when the soothing recollection occurs, that
               <lb/>the injuries and insults they have sustain­
               <lb/>ed are unmerited. <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> reflected
               <lb/>with resignation that the past could not
               <lb/>be prevented, and it would be unreason­
               <lb/>able to grieve for what was now irreme­
               <lb/>diable. Her health was indeed impaired,
               <lb/>but her mind was strong and tranquil, as
               <lb/>not a shadow of self-reproach disturbed its
               <lb/>peace. She was not necessitated to feign
               <lb/>illness, when <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> called, as she real­
               <lb/>ly felt indisposed; otherwise she must
               <lb/>have made some excuse for constantly
               <lb/>wearing a large shawl to hide her dis­
               <lb/>coloured arms, as long sleeves were not
               <lb/>in fashion then. The appearance of the
               <lb/>injurious treatment she had suffered would
               <lb/>have excited suspicion, and obliged her to
               <lb/>explain to that lady the disagreeable oc­
               <lb/>currence that had shaken her delicate con­
               <lb/>stitution. This she wished to avoid, if
               <lb/>possible; she remembered that she had

               <lb/>reputation should not be disgraced.

            <p>When <persName>Rose</persName> was sufficiently recovered
               <lb/>to walk in the garden, she requested <persName>Ka­
               <lb/>mira</persName> would prepare to accompany her,
               <lb/>and went up stairs to put on her walking
               <lb/>dress. It was severely cold, but she con­
               <lb/>sidered that the air and exercise would
               <lb/>refresh and strengthen her. They walked
               <lb/>briskly till the snow, which had threaten­
               <lb/>ed a heavy fall, began to descend very
               <lb/>fast, and hurried them towards the house,
               <lb/>on account of <persName>Rose</persName>, who <persName>Kamira</persName> feared
               <lb/>might get cold; had the <name>Indian</name> been
               <lb/>alone, she would have preferred remaining
               <lb/>in the garden, as she was delighted to walk
               <lb/>in the snow. A voice exclaimed, as they
               <lb/>were hastening forward—<said>Stop!</said> They
               <lb/>turned their heads to look round, at this
               <lb/>exclamation, and imagine the consterna­
               <lb/>tion of <persName>Rose</persName>, and indignant fury of <persName>Kami­

            <p>At the sight of her daring persecutor,
               <lb/><persName>Miss Douglas</persName> was so appalled and thun­
               <lb/>derstruck that she stood immovable for a

               <lb/>her foot, and her steps being unsteady,
               <lb/>flung her on the ground. The violence
               <lb/>of the fall, the exertion of running in her
               <lb/>weak state, united with the horror of
               <lb/>seeing him, all contributed to deprive her
               <lb/>of sense; and when <persName>Kamira</persName> hastened to
               <lb/>raise her up, she discovered <persName>Rose</persName> had faint­

               <lb/>wringing her hands, <said>you be dead—you
               <lb/>be gone where no wicked cruel man tor­

               <lb/>gave him such a violent blow on the sto­
               <lb/>mach that he staggered; the colour fled
               <lb/>from his face, and he was obliged to sup­
               <lb/>port himself against a tree and take breath.
               <lb/>Yet faulty as he was, he had a great deal
               <lb/>of courage, and a blow could not intimi­
               <lb/>date him. When he was recovered, he
               <lb/>advanced again, but in a posture of de­
               <lb/>fence, at the moment that <persName>Kamira</persName> had
               <lb/>lifted <persName>Rose</persName> from the ground.—<said>Curse

            <p><said>Be calm, <persName>Kamira</persName>,</said> said <persName>Courtenay</persName>; <said>I

               <lb/>forgiveness for my ill conduct, of which I
               <lb/>seriously repent, and never will offend, or

               <lb/>loved, who demanded her gratitude, and
               <lb/>to revenge them, that <persName>Kamira's</persName> passions
               <lb/>were furious and ungovernable—on every
               <lb/>other occasion she was mild and docile:
               <lb/>her understanding was naturally good,
               <lb/>which made her reflect, that although she
               <lb/>possessed great bodily strength, it could
               <lb/>not equal <persName>Courtenay's</persName>, and she had no
               <lb/>offensive weapon to defend <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>
               <lb/>with, which would have put her more on
               <lb/>an equality with him. These reflections
               <lb/>influenced her to desist from opposing him
               <lb/>any more, but she would not permit him
               <lb/>to assist her in bearing the insensible <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>into the mansion. As the faithful <persName>Kami­
               <lb/>ra</persName> bore the inanimate form in her arms to
               <lb/>the library, she reflected with deep regret
               <lb/>that <persName>Robin</persName> was absent on a message, and
               <lb/><persName>Dolly</persName> engaged in a distant part of the
               <lb/>house.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Courtenay</persName> had followed them to the li­

               <lb/>ken <name>English</name>, and at other moments in the
               <lb/>language of her native country. Perceiv­
               <lb/>ing that she did not evince any symptoms
               <lb/>of returning life, the poor <name>Indian</name> was quite
               <lb/>frantic, as she thought her beloved mistress
               <lb/>was really dead, and groaned and shrieked
               <lb/>in the most dreadful manner. While she
               <lb/>thus bemoaned herself, and beat her breast
               <lb/>and forehead, instead of endeavouring by
               <lb/>any application to restore her senses (from
               <lb/>ignorance), <persName>Courtenay</persName> flew to procure wa­
               <lb/>ter, and meeting <persName>Dolly</persName>, who had heard
               <lb/><persName>Kamira's</persName> shrieks, obtained some hartshorn
               <lb/>also. By the application of the hartshorn
               <lb/>and water, <persName>Rose</persName> gave evident signs of re­
               <lb/>turning animation, and gently sighed.
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> was now as mad with joy as be­
               <lb/>fore wild with sorrow, and they were
               <lb/>forced to tell her, her mistress would die, if
               <lb/>she was not calm, to make her the least
               <lb/>composed. The large shawl which enve­
               <lb/>loped the beautiful form of <persName>Rose Douglas</persName>
               <lb/>had fallen off, and <persName>Courtenay</persName> beheld with

               <lb/>pression on her white arms, which was the
               <lb/>consequence of his vicious and intemperate
               <lb/>passion.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Kamira</persName>, now that her dear mistress was
               <lb/>nearly recovered, grossly insulted and re­
               <lb/>viled him, which he supported calmly with­
               <lb/>out resentment, knowing he deserved it.
               <lb/>Before she was quite sensible of his being
               <lb/>in the room, he retreated into a closet, that
               <lb/>the sudden sight of him might not cause
               <lb/>her to relapse into insensibility. Pre­
               <lb/>viously he entreated <persName>Dolly</persName> and <persName>Kamira</persName> to
               <lb/>prepare her for speaking to him, as, what­
               <lb/>ever might be the event, he was resolved
               <lb/>to obtain her forgiveness, and would not
               <lb/>depart without it. <persName>Kamira</persName> could not en­
               <lb/>dure to look at him—he was abhorrent to
               <lb/>her sight; she thirsted for revenge, and
               <lb/>her eyes flashed fire when she gazed at
               <lb/>him; yet she had the good sense to submit
               <lb/>to what he had proposed, as there was no
               <lb/>alternative. When <persName>Rose</persName> was happily quite
               <lb/>restored, and had drank a glass of wine,
               <lb/>the <name>Indian</name> mentioned that <persName>Courtenay</persName> was

               <lb/>in the room, and what he had desired her
               <lb/>to say. An involuntary tremor pervaded
               <lb/>her whole frame, and before she had power
               <lb/>to articulate, <persName>Courtenay</persName> advanced from his
               <lb/>concealment, and threw himself at her feet.
            </p>
            <p>The melancholy expression of his coun­
               <lb/>tenance, pale with emotion, and the re­
               <lb/>pentance he evinced, softened her terror.
               <lb/>Resentment, therefore, that was never long
               <lb/>an inmate of her forgiving bosom, entirely
               <lb/>vanished. In a convulsed and faltering
               <lb/>voice he implored her pardon for a brutal­
               <lb/>ity of behaviour that he could never for­
               <lb/>give himself for, which proceeded from
               <lb/>excess of fondness and the dread of losing
               <lb/>her for ever, that had nearly turned his
               <lb/>brain, and in the vehement fury of his
               <lb/>passion he had acted like a madman.

               <lb/>—it is quite swearing. The greatest affec­

            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> hung down her head abashed,

               <lb/><said>how can you be so inhuman, so cruel,

               <lb/>need not request that favour, for your own
               <lb/>good sense will represent the impropriety

            <p><said>You may imagine what I feel,</said> said
               <lb/><persName>Courtenay</persName>, <said>though I cannot express it.
               <lb/>Can I survive the thought of not seeing
               <lb/>you? No! I must come, if I am married.
               <lb/>I shall remember the happy moments we

               <lb/>braced and kissed her; then, without
               <lb/>daring to look at her again, hurried away
               <lb/>before she had recovered from the emotion
               <lb/>his behaviour caused. He was gone with

               <lb/>enthusiasm of an artless ardent mind, and
               <lb/>while she regretted he had proved himself
               <lb/>worthless, she yet felt the trial severe
               <lb/>that gave him to another. To reconcile
               <lb/>herself to her loss, she recalled his endea­
               <lb/>vours to make her vicious and to corrupt
               <lb/>her mind, and that to marry a man with
               <lb/>so vile a disposition would be to devote
               <lb/>her life to wretchedness. <persName>Rose</persName> consoled
               <lb/>herself with the idea that his union with
               <lb/><persName>Miss Manson</persName> would protect her from
               <lb/>his importunities, as notwithstanding his
               <lb/>boasting that he would visit her, she con­
               <lb/>sidered that he must value his reputation
               <lb/>as a married man too highly to endanger
               <lb/>it by shewing her attention, more par­
               <lb/>ticularly as his intended wife had great
               <lb/>expectations from a wealthy father, who
               <lb/>would be displeased if he was attentive to
               <lb/>any other woman than his daughter.
            </p>
            <p>These just reflections calmed her per­
               <lb/>turbed spirits, and enabled her to support
               <lb/>with more fortitude than she would other­

               <lb/>This cheerful sound was soon accompa­
               <lb/>nied by the addition of a band of music,
               <lb/>striking up, at a short distance from <placeName>Tre­
               <lb/>harne</placeName>, the most gay and lively tunes. The
               <lb/>musicians passed through the valley, and
               <lb/>continued to play as they ascended the
               <lb/>hills, which had a very pleasing effect.—
               <lb/><said>What can all this merriment and re­
               <lb/>joicing be for?</said> said <persName>Rose</persName> to <persName>Kamira</persName>.
               <lb/><said>Go, if you please, and ask <persName>Dolly</persName>, for she
               <lb/>generally knows all the news in the neigh­
               <lb/>bourhood, and even as far as <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> left the room, and was absent a
               <lb/>very long time. At last she returned,
               <lb/>but with an altered countenance, as if she
               <lb/>had received disagreeable intelligence, and
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName>, not observing the alteration, ex­
               <lb/>claimed—<said>Have you heard, <persName>Kamira</persName>, the
               <lb/>occasion of this unexpected gaiety? It is
               <lb/>not usual for us to have music in this re­
               <lb/>tired spot.</said>

               <lb/>know it. It is because of that big mon­

               <lb/>that they make that noise. You tell me

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> turned very pale, and before she
               <lb/>could answer, <persName>Dolly</persName> came into the room

               <lb/>said she, <said>I have seen one of <persName>lord Mor­

               <lb/>which he brought from <placeName>Exeter</placeName>; and he

            <p><persName>Dolly</persName> might have talked for ever with­
               <lb/>out any interruption from <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>,
               <lb/>who was too much overcome with painful
               <lb/>emotion to converse. Though she was
               <lb/>prepared for this event, she did not meet
               <lb/>it with the tranquillity she had hoped.
               <lb/>The shock, though softened, was severe.
               <lb/>Wicked as he was, she had once truly loved
               <lb/>him, as an amiable character, for his vices
               <lb/>were veiled from her. Successful in his
               <lb/>villany, fortune now smiled on him, and
               <lb/>overwhelmed her with its frowns. Even
               <lb/>her sister, to whom she could have con­
               <lb/>fided her feelings, and been consoled by
               <lb/>her, was absent and unhappy, as every
               <lb/>letter she received informed her; and in
               <lb/>one of them she appeared so discontented
               <lb/>with her present situation, that she ad­
               <lb/>vised <persName>Rose</persName> never to marry. The re­

               <lb/>draught <persName>Courtenay</persName> had made her drink
               <lb/>alone sweetened its bitterness. The ac­
               <lb/>count of his marriage, though expected,
               <lb/>renewed all the cruel sensations she had
               <lb/>banished, and, agonized, she knelt down
               <lb/>and prayed to Heaven to be enabled to
               <lb/>sustain, with more calmness, the anguish
               <lb/>that oppressed her.
            </p>
            <p>Her mind became gradually serene af­
               <lb/>ter this fervid and pious address to the
               <lb/>supreme and beneficent Being, who, if
               <lb/>they are deserted by every earthly friend,
               <lb/>never forsakes the victims of sorrow that
               <lb/>confide in him. The gloom that depressed
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> dispersed: she recollected that her
               <lb/>sorrows were unmixed with guilt, and
               <lb/>though now dejected and unhappy, they
               <lb/>would be transient, because her conscience
               <lb/>was clear—while it remained unspotted,
               <lb/>she could endure adversity and injustice
               <lb/>with courage and resignation. A sigh
               <lb/>sometimes heaved her pure bosom, and a
               <lb/>tear would fall; yet she exerted herself to
               <lb/>support her calamities with patience and

               <lb/>humility. The keenest disappointments
               <lb/>are soothed and mitigated by patience,
               <lb/>which enables us to cheerfully submit to
               <lb/>our misfortunes, and by resignation les­
               <lb/>sens them. To the benevolent Creator
               <lb/>of the universe she daily addressed her
               <lb/>prayers, who watches over us with paren­
               <lb/>tal care, and causes every turbulent emo­
               <lb/>tion to cease. Thus, she regained her na­
               <lb/>tural vivacity and contentment, and sup­
               <lb/>porting with composure this difficult trial,
               <lb/>was prepared for every vicissitude she
               <lb/>might experience. Constant employment
               <lb/>likewise assisted to divert her thoughts
               <lb/>from pensive inquietude.

            <p>A few days after <persName>Courtenay's</persName> nuptials
               <lb/>had taken place, <persName>Rose</persName> had received a let­

               <lb/>had not been to visit her and her sister,
               <lb/>as it would have pained her to impart the
               <lb/>news of the approaching marriage. She
               <lb/>was undecided how to act, and feared, if
               <lb/>she came, and concealed the painful cir­
               <lb/>cumstances, they might accuse her of du­

               <lb/>plicity; but now that the event must be
               <lb/>known to them, she was anxious to visit
               <lb/><placeName>Treharne</placeName>, as they were to quit the Castle
               <lb/>in a few days; but her ladyship, who had
               <lb/>been very ill-humoured ever since <placeName>Cour­
               <lb/>tenay's</placeName> wedding, would not allow her to
               <lb/>come, to her great chagrin.—<quote>However,</quote>
               <lb/>continued <persName>Louise</persName>, <quote>one consoling idea
               <lb/>reconciles me to quitting the country
               <lb/>without seeing you, which is, that we are
               <lb/>to return to <placeName>Morrington</placeName> very early in the
               <lb/>spring, when I hope to meet you very
               <lb/>often. The general and <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>
               <lb/>will, I flatter myself, be returned by that
               <lb/>time, and <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> is so great a fa­

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> directly answered this letter, and
               <lb/>regretted in her epistle that she had not
               <lb/>seen her friend before her departure. She
               <lb/>was concerned that <persName>Louise</persName> had staid
               <lb/>away, that she might not witness her suf­
               <lb/>ferings at the intelligence of the union

               <lb/>that was to be celebrated at the Castle.
               <lb/>The consciousness that she had not merited
               <lb/><placeName>Courtenay's</placeName> deception and perfidiousness
               <lb/>had strengthened her to support his base
               <lb/>desertion with more fortitude than she
               <lb/>imagined she possessed. But, on this
               <lb/>heart-wounding subject, she should in fu­
               <lb/>ture be for ever silent, and requested
               <lb/><persName>Louise</persName> would never again mention his
               <lb/>name to her. <persName>Rose</persName> added, that she should
               <lb/>now look eagerly forward to spring, as it
               <lb/>was to restore her to her agreeable society.
            </p>
            <p>As <persName>Rose</persName> was writing, she reflected on
               <lb/>the consolations friendship offered, and
               <lb/>how soothing was its balm. Our deepest
               <lb/>sorrows seem to lose their sting when
               <lb/>communicated to a faithful friend.

            <p>Peace was once more an inmate at <placeName>Tre­
               <lb/>harne</placeName>, and tranquillity reigned undis­

            <p><persName>Jane</persName> had lately made her sister one
               <lb/>visit, and sympathized in all the vexa­
               <lb/>tions that afflicted her, and from which
               <lb/>she was at present recovered. To visit
               <lb/>her in return, <persName>Mrs. Guilford</persName> did not so­
               <lb/>licit her sister, as she confessed she had
               <lb/>discovered another trait of an unpleasant
               <lb/>nature in her husband's character, which
               <lb/>was extreme parsimony in every thing
               <lb/>that related to those who lived with him,
               <lb/>though often extravagant in what contri­
               <lb/>buted to his gratification solely. Visitors
               <lb/>of any description at his house he did not
               <lb/>approve, as he considered them too expen­
               <lb/>sive. <persName>Jane</persName> looked melancholy, and appa­
               <lb/>rently mournfully, repented the step she
               <lb/>had taken in estranging herself from her
               <lb/>paternal mansion. To see her sighing for
               <lb/>a home she once contemned and ridiculed,
               <lb/>assisted to make <persName>Rose</persName> resigned to her lot,

            <p><persName>Miss Herbert</persName>, who had been at <placeName>Bath</placeName>,
               <lb/>was now returned. She told <persName>Rose</persName> that
               <lb/>she thought the town magnificently hand­
               <lb/>some, and the country around beautiful.
               <lb/>Altogether she liked the place very much,
               <lb/>and if place alone was necessary to happi­
               <lb/>ness, she considered it would be an enchant­
               <lb/>ing residence; but she confessed she did not
               <lb/>like any large town but <placeName>London</placeName>, nor did she
               <lb/>think the air pure. <persName>Miss Herbert</persName> added,
               <lb/>that she was with her father at a board­
               <lb/>ing-house, which was quite new and plea­
               <lb/>sant to her, as the boarders only met at
               <lb/>dinner, and she was entertained beyond
               <lb/>expression. Before she left <placeName>Bath</placeName>, their
               <lb/>number was reduced to a <rs type="properAdjective">Scotch</rs> doctor,
               <lb/>with a cunning face and excellent temper,
               <lb/>and his wife, a fat, broad, comic, good-na­
               <lb/>tured woman. Their droll stories almost
               <lb/>killed her with laughing, and she thought
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> would be much amused with the
               <lb/>novelty of a boarding-house.

               <lb/>was very pleasing and flattering, and she
               <lb/>expressed her gratitude to <persName>Mary Herbert</persName>
               <lb/>for her kind intention. <persName>Mary</persName> likewise
               <lb/>brought intelligence of the departure of

               <lb/>She did not express any surprise at <persName>Jane's</persName>
               <lb/>absence, as there was nothing uncommon
               <lb/>in her going on a visit; yet she lamented
               <lb/>the dulness her friend <persName>Rose</persName> must feel at
               <lb/>being left alone in that great house.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> particularly admired, in such a
               <lb/>lovely girl as <persName>Mary Herbert</persName>, her indiffer­
               <lb/>ence to her own beauty. She had a tame
               <lb/>pigeon, of which she was exceedingly
               <lb/>fond, and was caressing it one day, as she
               <lb/>stood with <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> on the mount
               <lb/>in the garden at <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, from whence
               <lb/>they could be seen by any one passing
               <lb/>by. Some ladies and gentlemen on horse­

               <lb/>back rode near at that instant, and, at­
               <lb/>tracted by the striking loveliness of <persName>Mary</persName>,
               <lb/>exclaimed—<said>What a pretty creature!</said>
               <lb/>for she looked the emblem of innoncence
               <lb/>with the white pigeon.
            </p>
            <p>Instead of thinking it was herself that
               <lb/>was the object of admiration, as many
               <lb/>vain persons would have done, she sup­
               <lb/>posed it was a compliment to her favou­
               <lb/>rite, and turning with an animated face
               <lb/>to <persName>Rose</persName>, that made her beauty more daz­
               <lb/>zling, said, in a voice of delight—<said>You
               <lb/>see how my pigeon is admired.</said>
            </p>
            <p>This unaffected unconsciousness of her
               <lb/>charms quite pleased <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>, and
               <lb/>made her appear, in her opinion, still more
               <lb/>beautiful, as, although she knew she was
               <lb/>handsome, she was indifferent about it,
               <lb/>and placed no value on her personal at­
               <lb/>tractions.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> had one unspeakable source of
               <lb/>satisfaction, as every letter she received
               <lb/>from <placeName>Scotland</placeName> informed her of the im­

               <lb/>air was so pure, though cold, at the resi­
               <lb/>dence of <persName>sir James Douglas</persName>, that, not­
               <lb/>withstanding the anxiety <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>
               <lb/>suffered at being separated from her chil­
               <lb/>dren, her health was much amended.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Sir James</persName> continued in the same state,
               <lb/>but was grown very fond of his brother, to
               <lb/>whom he had already made several hand­
               <lb/>some presents. He talked, if he recovered,
               <lb/>of having his nieces on a visit to <placeName>Towie
               <lb/>Craigs</placeName>, as well as his brother and wife.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> observed, that this dreary
               <lb/>habitation would then become most cheer­
               <lb/>ful to her. If enlivened by the presence
               <lb/>of the dear objects of her maternal affec­
               <lb/>tion, it was of little consequence to her
               <lb/>where she lived, while those she loved
               <lb/>were with her.

            <p>The pleasure of seeing <persName>Mary Herbert</persName>
               <lb/>was, one morning when she called, seri­
               <lb/>ously damped by hearing she was going
               <lb/>to <placeName>London</placeName>, and came then to take leave

               <lb/>drew <persName>Mary</persName>, in the character of <name>Innocence</name>,
               <lb/>with a lamb. The resemblance was strik­
               <lb/>ing, and the picture looked so lovely and

               <lb/>it.—<said>I hope, my loved <persName>Mary</persName>,</said> said <persName>Rose</persName>,
               <lb/><said>that you will ever retain that interesting
               <lb/>artlessness of disposition I so much ad­
               <lb/>mire. I tremble for fear the world should
               <lb/>alter it, as you are now going to be intro­

               <lb/>my apprehension of danger, but it is my
               <lb/>mother who has infused this dread into
               <lb/>my mind. She has told me, that she has
               <lb/>often known characters, who appeared
               <lb/>perfectly amiable, quite corrupted by mix­
               <lb/>ing in society, where, amidst a variety of
               <lb/>beings, an unamiable one has gained an
               <lb/>improper influence over the artless dispo­
               <lb/>sition unacquainted with mankind, and
               <lb/>caused them to imbibe their sentiments,

            <p><said>They must have little stability who

               <lb/>with the truest affection.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>It would make me very miserable if
               <lb/>you did forget me,</said> said <persName>Rose</persName>, <said>as con­
               <lb/>stancy in every thing is my motto. I am
               <lb/>not easily captivated, but when once I
               <lb/>take a liking to a person, I am attached to
               <lb/>them for ever, unless they use me very
               <lb/>ill indeed. But I am older than you, and
               <lb/>my character is therefore more fixed.</said>
            </p>

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> watched the industrious bee, as
               <lb/>it sipped the honeyed sweetness from the
               <lb/>odoriferous blooming plants, and listened
               <lb/>to their drowsy hum as they frolicked
               <lb/>from flower to flower with busy wing.
            </p>
            <p>The mild warmth in the middle of the
               <lb/>day allowed her to visit her hermitage,
               <lb/>and remain there a short time, while she
               <lb/>tied up nosegays to diffuse fragrance, and

            <p>In the hermitage she likewise kept
               <lb/>some greenhouse plants, as the situation
               <lb/>was warm and sheltered; and in the grove
               <lb/>near it she was entertained by the war­
               <lb/>bling of various tuneful birds, who sung
               <lb/>harmoniously among the trees. The
               <lb/>cheerful note of the cuckoo often broke
               <lb/>on the ear, and told that summer was ap­

               <lb/>stantly in her apartment, where they had
               <lb/>been undisturbed, till one night soon after
               <lb/>she received her mother's last letter. It
               <lb/>was midnight, and the gloomy stillness that
               <lb/>always reigns then was interrupted by
               <lb/>the same loud noises and confused voices
               <lb/>that had before banished rest. The heavy
               <lb/>trampling of horses as formerly was also
               <lb/>heard; but the sound soon died away.
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> was very much alarmed, but her
               <lb/>mistress was perfectly tranquil. Since she
               <lb/>had last been disturbed by these noctur­
               <lb/>nal visitors, <persName>Rose</persName> had experienced so much
               <lb/>real sorrow, that she could not think of
               <lb/>making imaginary evils, as nothing seri­
               <lb/>ously dangerous or disagreeable had been
               <lb/>the consequence of the noises that molest­
               <lb/>ed them. However, she exerted herself
               <lb/>to calm the terrors that overwhelmed the
               <lb/><name>Indian</name>, who said, that sometimes when
               <lb/>she passed near the cellars in the evening,
               <lb/>at the bottom of the tower where <persName>Mr.

               <lb/>and frightful sounds. It was only from

               <lb/>that she had not mentioned it till now.

               <lb/>plained. In my opinion, it is caused by
               <lb/>water-rats, who are very numerous in the

               <lb/>have informed me that they walk quite

            <p>Delighted with this permission, <persName>Kamira</persName>
               <lb/>fell fast asleep; <persName>Rose</persName> soon followed her
               <lb/>example, and her slumbers were unruffled
               <lb/>as her spotless soul was serene.
            </p>
            <p>From the period of <persName>Courtenay's</persName> marriage,
               <lb/>her mind had imperceptibly regained its
               <lb/>composure. The certainty of one's fate,
               <lb/>however heartrending, is better than being
               <lb/>in a state of suspense: when every thing
               <lb/>is decided and cannot be revoked, the good
               <lb/>and patient disposition will slowly recover
               <lb/>its energy. Had he been estimable, the
               <lb/>recollection of his worth would have add­
               <lb/>ed poignancy to the pang of losing him;
               <lb/>but now that she remembered his treachery,
               <lb/>his cruelty, the memory of his fascinating
               <lb/>manners faded away, and only the recollec­
               <lb/>tion of his vices remained. It is true, he
               <lb/>had expressed contrition for his savage be­
               <lb/>haviour, and she had forgiven him; yet it
               <lb/>was impossible for her to forget such bar­

               <lb/>barous usage, and she felt grateful that she
               <lb/>had escaped the most severe of all misfor­
               <lb/>tunes, a worthless husband. It was happi­
               <lb/>ness to reflect that she was no longer sub­
               <lb/>ject to his sudden intrusion and insults,
               <lb/>whenever the whim seized him to visit
               <lb/>her: protected by his marriage from be­
               <lb/>ing the object of his caprice, all her native
               <lb/>cheerfulness was restored, and her mind re­
               <lb/>covered its elasticity.
            </p>
            <p>When night again arrived, which was
               <lb/>the time appointed by <persName>Rose</persName> for visiting
               <lb/>the cellars, <persName>Kamira</persName> eagerly reminded her
               <lb/>of her promise. <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> told the <name>In­
               <lb/>dian</name> to procure a lanthorn, and place a can­
               <lb/>dle in it, as the damp of the unexplored
               <lb/>vaults might extinguish the light. <persName>Kami­
               <lb/>ra</persName> soon returned with the lanthorn, and
               <lb/>they proceeded to that part of the building
               <lb/><persName>Eustace</persName> had inhabited. They descended
               <lb/>some old broken stone steps near the tower,
               <lb/>at the bottom of which was a worm-eaten
               <lb/>wooden door. This had never been open­
               <lb/>ed since the general's residence at <placeName>Treharne

               <lb/>Hall</placeName>, as they made use of some large con­
               <lb/>venient cellars, situated on the opposite
               <lb/>side of the mansion, near the kitchens.
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> lifted a rusty latch, and pushing it
               <lb/>with her utmost strength, the door gave
               <lb/>way, and they entered a cellar, filled with
               <lb/>ancient implements and weapons of war;
               <lb/>two suits of armour, corroded with rust,
               <lb/>lay on the ground, near ensigns-armorial
               <lb/>of the <name>Treharne</name> family; and in one corner,
               <lb/>in a heap, were deposited broken swords,
               <lb/>old guns, and pikes.

            <p><said>They appeared formerly to think more
               <lb/>of fighting than drinking, by the contents

               <lb/>neither casks, barrels, or bottles, to hold
               <lb/>liquor.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Me suppose we shall see them further
               <lb/>on,</said> replied <persName>Kamira</persName>, <said>for there is a low
               <lb/>door opposite.</said>
            </p>
            <p>They went forward, and attempted to
               <lb/>unclose it; but it resisted their efforts. <persName>Ka­
               <lb/>mira</persName> now exerted every nerve to succeed,

               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName>, it fell off its hinges to the floor with
               <lb/>a tremendous crash. They were quite
               <lb/>startled, and breathless with the exertion
               <lb/>for some minutes. On examining the
               <lb/>door, they discovered that it had been
               <lb/>propped behind with some heavy lumber,
               <lb/>being quite worn off its hinges, and with­
               <lb/>out a fastening. This vault was small, and
               <lb/>empty of every thing except a sailor's
               <lb/>jacket, quite new, and a straw hat, such as
               <lb/>seamen wear.
            </p>
            <p><said>I am quite surprised,</said> exclaimed <persName>Rose</persName>,
               <lb/><said>at finding the door secured withinside,
               <lb/>and a modern jacket and hat lying on
               <lb/>the ground; it is very mysterious: but let
               <lb/>us go on, if we can discover any method
               <lb/>of proceeding, though I perceive no outlet
               <lb/>in this place.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> looked cautiously round, and
               <lb/>being very quicksighted, advanced to some
               <lb/>rubbish piled up, and removing it hastily,
               <lb/>a trapdoor met their view. They raised
               <lb/>it with ease, and discovered half-a-dozen
               <lb/>stairs, which they stepped down, and found

               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">138</mw>
               <lb/>they conducted to a long narrow passage,
               <lb/>which bore evident traces of people having
               <lb/>passed lately through, from several trifles
               <lb/>dropped by the way. It was so low in
               <lb/>several places, that they were obliged to
               <lb/>creep on their hands and knees. They
               <lb/>conjectured that it extended very far, as
               <lb/>they were quite fatigued when they reach­
               <lb/>ed the end, and would not have continued
               <lb/>to advanced, had not a glimmering light at
               <lb/>the extremity tempted them to go on.
            </p>
            <p>The passage likewise grew gradually
               <lb/>wider as they approached the latter part,
               <lb/>allowed them to walk upright, till they
               <lb/>gained a door half open. They peeped
               <lb/>through, as it was ajar, and to their inex­
               <lb/>pressible astonishment beheld a solid mar­
               <lb/>ble table, on which a lamp was placed, that
               <lb/>disclosed to their amazed sight a large ca­
               <lb/>vern, the extent of which the faint light
               <lb/>of the lamp did not permit them to see.
               <lb/>All was still and silent as the deep recesses
               <lb/>of a tomb; and as they neither saw or
               <lb/>heard the footstep or voice of a living
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">creature,</mw>

               <lb/>creature, curiosity enticed them to go for­
               <lb/>ward, and trembling they entered the ca­
               <lb/>vern. The sides and top of this cave ap­
               <lb/>peared composed of rock and grey slate;
               <lb/>part of it was covered with short fine moss,
               <lb/>and seemed very dry; yet that side where
               <lb/>the table stood, and was evidently inha­
               <lb/>bited, was lined with matting of a very
               <lb/>thick texture. In one corner was a screen,
               <lb/>which they removed, and found it con­
               <lb/>cealed a small bedchamber, scooped out
               <lb/>of the rock, and furnished with every com­
               <lb/>fort, as if a person of a superior description
               <lb/>slept in it.
            </p>
            <p>In a distant part of the cave they ob­
               <lb/>served three doors, which they were pre­
               <lb/>paring to unclose one after the other, when
               <lb/>a loud whistle, followed by the discharge
               <lb/>of a gun very near, terrified them so much,
               <lb/>that they instantly desisted, and retreated
               <lb/>to the passage. They gently shut the
               <lb/>door they had found open after them, and
               <lb/>returned back much quicker than they
               <lb/>advanced towards the cave. Overcome

               <lb/>with terror, they darted through the two
               <lb/>cellars, rather than walked, and after fast­
               <lb/>ening the door at the bottom of the stairs
               <lb/>as well as they could, they eagerly ascend­
               <lb/>ed the broken staircase, and felt relieved
               <lb/>from the fear that agonized them. Their
               <lb/>terrors were softened, yet they could not
               <lb/>feel in perfect security, as they were con­
               <lb/>vinced that the cavern which communi­
               <lb/>cated with <placeName>Treharne Hall</placeName> was inhabited.
               <lb/>It was consequently a very alarming con­
               <lb/>sideration, that whoever lived in it had it
               <lb/>in their power to enter the mansion when­
               <lb/>ever they judged proper.

               <lb/>that every suspicion may be lulled,
               <lb/>though it is impossible to guess what may

               <lb/>what manner to act for the best. Perhaps

               <lb/>cavern, connected with our family, of
               <lb/>which I am ignorant. At all events, I
               <lb/>think it will be most prudent to conceal
               <lb/>from <persName>Robin</persName> and <persName>Dolly</persName> the discovery we
               <lb/>have made, as should they be frightened
               <lb/>at hearing that the subterraneous vaults
               <lb/>have inhabitants, they may not like to re­
               <lb/>main with us, and it will be difficult to ob­
               <lb/>tain two servants equally good, and on
               <lb/>whose fidelity I could rely; nor should I

            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> acquiesced, as she was generally

               <lb/>of the same opinion as <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>.
               <lb/><persName>Robin</persName> was dispatched by the first dawn of
               <lb/>morning for a carpenter, and by the fol­
               <lb/>lowing night the cellar-door was strongly
               <lb/>secured, in such a manner as must take
               <lb/>many hours to force an entrance by that
               <lb/>inlet. <persName>Rose</persName> and <persName>Kamira</persName> felt quite happy
               <lb/>at having shut out their nightly intruders,
               <lb/>as whoever it was that molested them
               <lb/>could not now easily come into the house.
               <lb/>They invented a plausible excuse to <persName>Ro­
               <lb/>bin</persName> and <persName>Dolly</persName>, for having the cellar-door
               <lb/>mended and fastened up, and it was not
               <lb/>difficult to impose on them, as they were
               <lb/>simplicity itself.
            </p>
            <p>A few days after they had discovered
               <lb/>the cavern, <persName>Rose</persName> walked with <persName>Kamira</persName> to
               <lb/>the wood, where she had once met <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>since her marriage. A profusion of wild
               <lb/>flowers scented the vernal gale, and the
               <lb/>embowering trees sheltered them from the
               <lb/>ardent beams of the sun. Many birds
               <lb/>were busily engaged constructing their
               <lb/>nests, while others, who had completed

               <lb/>theirs a long time, and deposited their eggs,
               <lb/>were seated on them, to hatch their little
               <lb/>progeny. <persName>Rose</persName> hoped that the boys would
               <lb/>not disturb those harmless birds, who did
               <lb/>a great deal of good, by feeding on the
               <lb/>insects. However, <persName>Kamira</persName> was quite
               <lb/>childish, for she would have pillaged all the
               <lb/>nests they met with for the sake of the eggs,
               <lb/>having been accustomed in <placeName>America</placeName> to go
               <lb/>out a bird-nesting; and it was with great
               <lb/>difficulty <persName>Rose</persName> could make her desist.
            </p>
            <p>Followed by <persName>Kamira</persName>, she had just reach­
               <lb/>ed the most distant and retired part of the
               <lb/>wood, where the underwood was very
               <lb/>thick on each side the path, when they
               <lb/>found themselves surrounded by a party
               <lb/>of ill-looking men, who roughly seized hold
               <lb/>of them. They both shrieked, till a pistol
               <lb/>was presented by one of the ruffians, who
               <lb/>said, if they screamed again, or spoke, he
               <lb/>would shoot them instantly dead. <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>immediately desired <persName>Kamira</persName> to be silent,
               <lb/>and not attempt resistance, as it would an­
               <lb/>swer no purpose. Two men were station­

               <lb/>ed on each side of them, and rather drag­
               <lb/>ged than led them to the border of <placeName>Tre­
               <lb/>harne</placeName> wood. Here the wicket-gate that
               <lb/>conducted to the road was ready opened,
               <lb/>and a shabby old coach with two horses
               <lb/>waiting outside the wood, with the blinds
               <lb/>all drawn up.
            </p>
            <p>The men lifted them into the carriage,
               <lb/>and then got in after, and thus were they
               <lb/>completely secured, with two ruffians to
               <lb/>guard them on either side. <persName>Kamira</persName> gazed
               <lb/>anxiously at her mistress, who was oppo­
               <lb/>site, and, unable any longer to resist speak­
               <lb/>ing, turned to the most gentle-looking of
               <lb/>the men, and exclaimed—<said>Why you take
               <lb/>us away? women do no harm; we no hurt

            <p><said>Hold your jaw,</said> said one of the most
               <lb/>ferocious of the ruffians, whose thick, black,
               <lb/>bushy eyebrows hung over his eyes, as

            <p>Poor <persName>Kamira</persName>, accustomed now for many
               <lb/>years to the voice of kindness only, was
               <lb/>petrified, and spoke no more. The horses
               <lb/>went very fast, and, from the time they
               <lb/>were travelling, <persName>Rose</persName> supposed, as the coach
               <lb/>stopped, they had journeyed three or four
               <lb/>miles. When the door of the carriage was
               <lb/>opened, her surprise was great at finding
               <lb/>they were on the sea-beach. Seaweeds
               <lb/>were scattered over the sand, thrown up
               <lb/>by the foaming billows, and it was appa­
               <lb/>rently a lonely desolate spot. The men
               <lb/>did not allow her time to look about; but
               <lb/>taking her from the coach, hurried her
               <lb/>along between them as before, till they ar­
               <lb/>rived at an old ruinous-looking house, built
               <lb/>under a rock, at a short distance from the
               <lb/>dreary shore.
            </p>
            <p>As they hastened forward with her, <persName>Miss
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> looked back to see if <persName>Kamira</persName> was
               <lb/>following with the other ruffians, but per­

               <lb/>and concluded she was detained in the
               <lb/>coach. On entering the ruinous house,
               <lb/>they dragged her hastily up stairs to the
               <lb/>first floor, pushed her into a back-room,
               <lb/>and then locked her in. This room was
               <lb/>lighted by a sky-light, and as she could not
               <lb/>discern any thing, she was left to ruminate
               <lb/>uninterruptedly on what could be the
               <lb/>cause of her being carried off with her ser­
               <lb/>vant in this extraordinary manner.
            </p>
            <p>Had <persName>Kamira</persName> been suffered to accom­
               <lb/>pany her, she would have felt less unhappy;
               <lb/>but deprived of her company, she was al­
               <lb/>most distracted, fearful of any severe cala­
               <lb/>mity happening to her faithful and affec­
               <lb/>tionate attendant, who she knew would
               <lb/>be as miserable on her account.
            </p>
            <p>In this melancholy place, <persName>Rose</persName> remained
               <lb/>an hour, unable to refrain from weeping,
               <lb/>more from the apprehension of losing her
               <lb/>dear <name>Indian</name>, than from her own misfor­
               <lb/>tunes, when a gentle footstep coming up
               <lb/>the stairs attracted her attention. The
               <lb/>door soon after was unlocked, and a decent-

               <lb/>looking woman, though very dirty, en­
               <lb/>tered, and dropped a respectful curtsey.
               <lb/>Nervous and intimidated, from the terror
               <lb/>she had encountered, <persName>Rose</persName> started, and
               <lb/>uttered an exclamation of fear, when the
               <lb/>woman came in.
            </p>
            <p><said>Don't be scared, Miss,</said> said she,
               <lb/><said>though I can't wonder at your being so
               <lb/>timbersome in this dull room. But I've
               <lb/>come to put you where you will na be
               <lb/>so dismal;</said> and with these words she con­
               <lb/>ducted her into a front room with a bed
               <lb/>in it, that faced the sea.
            </p>
            <p>As the woman seemed very talkative,
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> ventured to ask if she had seen any
               <lb/>thing of a young woman, her servant?
            </p>
            <p>The woman answered very sharply, that
               <lb/>she knew nothing of such a young wo­
               <lb/>man, and going directly out of the room,
               <lb/>shut the door violently, and locked it.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> perceived she had committed an
               <lb/>error in questioning her, who was cer­
               <lb/>tainly an accomplice with whoever con­
               <lb/>fined her. The woman's countenance was

               <lb/>the most expressive of deceit she had
               <lb/>ever noticed. Though not an old woman,
               <lb/>it was covered with wrinkles, and quite
               <lb/>puckered up about the eyes when she
               <lb/>smiled, which gave her a very deceitful
               <lb/>look. <persName>Rose</persName> conjectured, that since she
               <lb/>was good-natured and respectful on other
               <lb/>subjects, this cross-grained behaviour was
               <lb/>assumed, to inform her it would be use­
               <lb/>less to ask questions, and to desist in fu­
               <lb/>ture.
            </p>
            <p>The sun glittered on the blue-green
               <lb/>waves, and she descried a vessel in the
               <lb/>offing, from which a boat was sent, and
               <lb/>was advancing to the shore. Fishermen's
               <lb/>nets were spread out to dry on the grass
               <lb/>near the house, which made her suspect
               <lb/>that her present habitation was the resi­
               <lb/>dence of fishermen. The beach seemed a
               <lb/>very good one for walking, and the sea,
               <lb/>opening into the land, formed a commo­
               <lb/>dious sheltered bay. At each extremity
               <lb/>of the beach, lofty cliffs and rocks uprear­
               <lb/>ed their craggy heads. The white sea­
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">gull</mw>
               <pb/>
               <milestone unit="sig" n="H3r"/>
               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">149</mw>
               <lb/>gull hovered over the jutting cliffs and
               <lb/>crags, and flew backwards and forwards
               <lb/>with airy wing across the swelling bil­
               <lb/>lows.
            </p>
            <p>When the boat she had seen quitting
               <lb/>the vessel approached the shore, the men
               <lb/>in it soon after landed, and <persName>Rose</persName> watched
               <lb/>them till they drew near the ruinous
               <lb/>house and entered it. Among them she
               <lb/>observed the four ruffians who had car­
               <lb/>ried her and <persName>Kamira</persName> off. The quietness
               <lb/>that prevailed throughout this lonesome
               <lb/>abode was now vanished. An hour elaps­
               <lb/>ed, and she concluded they had been
               <lb/>feasting and drinking, as their voices
               <lb/>were raised to the highest point. The
               <lb/>brandy and juniper-berry now circulated
               <lb/>through their veins, and seemed very
               <lb/>operative, as they laughed aloud, and
               <lb/>sung, or rather roared out, the most noisy
               <lb/>songs.
            </p>
            <p>About six o’clock the woman again
               <lb/>visited her, and appeared as if her good-
               <lb/>humour had also been heightened by a

               <lb/>cheerful glass. With a low curtsey she
               <lb/>said—<said>If it is agreeable, Miss, I will
               <lb/>come and drink a cup of tea with you, as
               <lb/>you must want some refreshment all these
               <lb/>hours. I seldom drinks tea so late, but
               <lb/>I have been very busy to-day, as our men
               <lb/>have been fishing all this blessed day at
               <lb/>t'other part of the coast, and as they
               <lb/>wanted their dinner, I've been forced to
               <lb/>cook it. I keeps no sarvant now. I have
               <lb/>had a great many, but they all turned
               <lb/>out so bad that I had rather do the work
               <lb/>myself. When my husband, <persName>master Nay­
               <lb/>lor</persName>, is at home, then he will tend and help
               <lb/>me a bit, when he is in the humour for
               <lb/>it. I always calls him <persName>master Naylor</persName>,
               <lb/>because we've two prentice-boys to larn
               <lb/>to be fishermen, and if I called him by
               <lb/>his <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> name, <persName>John</persName>, they would be
               <lb/>calling him so too, and that would not be
               <lb/>respectful; so he always calls me <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Naylor</persName>, and I always calls him <persName>master
               <lb/>Naylor</persName>. There's nothing like pretty be­

               <lb/>stead of that, I met with this one. I was

               <lb/>good lady, a clargyman's wife, who was

               <lb/>tress used to tell me to be careful of the
               <lb/>men. My master, though she was such
               <lb/>a good lady, went astray with others, and
               <lb/>would with me, but I said to him—<said rend="pre(‘)post()">No,

               <lb/>and all kinds of things, and wash myself
               <lb/>thoroughly two or three times in the
               <lb/>course of the summer with scented soap,
               <lb/>such as ladies use, and rose-water I distil
               <lb/>myself.</said>

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> was astonished to hear a woman,

               <lb/>She was convinced, from this circum­

               <lb/>and detected her very shortly in many

               <lb/>down stairs, <persName>Rose</persName> tried to open the win­
               <lb/>dow, thinking, when it was quite dark, to
               <lb/>escape, when all was hushed at midnight,
               <lb/>that way; but, to her disappointment, it
               <lb/>was strongly nailed down. She remarked
               <lb/>that the house became as quiet after dark
               <lb/>as before, and conjectured that the men
               <lb/>were gone out.
            </p>
            <p>The wind now began to howl loudly,
               <lb/>the night was obscure, and the melancholy
               <lb/>roaring of the waves, dashing against the
               <lb/>shore, diffused the deepest gloom, while
               <lb/>the mournful scream of the sea-birds in­
               <lb/>spired pensive ideas, and seemed to pre­
               <lb/>sage horrible events. Rain poured down
               <lb/>in torrents, and the blast blew so strong
               <lb/>and loud, that <persName>Rose</persName> lamented the fate of
               <lb/>the poor seamen who were doomed to en­
               <lb/>counter the pitiless storm. About eleven
               <lb/>o’clock, when the tempest raged with re­

               <lb/>doubled fury, she heard signal guns fired,
               <lb/>as if some ship was in distress, and likely
               <lb/>to be wrecked, as from the sound of the
               <lb/>fire-arms the vessel was apparently at a
               <lb/>short distance from the bay.
            </p>
            <p>Two hours passed away, and at near
               <lb/>one o’clock a great bustle and confusion
               <lb/>appeared to take place in the house, and
               <lb/>she heard many people running up and
               <lb/>down stairs. Soon after, <persName>Mrs. Naylor</persName>
               <lb/>came in with clean sheets to put on the
               <lb/>bed, saying—<said>Bless your dear soul, Miss!
               <lb/>I have been so busy that I quite forgot
               <lb/>you till now, begging your pardon.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> perceived instantly that she was
               <lb/>very much intoxicated, and begged her
               <lb/>not to trouble herself to make the bed, as
               <lb/>she should only lie down outside, with­
               <lb/>out undressing. In fact, she had an in­
               <lb/>vincible repugnance to repose in such a
               <lb/>dirty uncomfortable place, and did not,
               <lb/>till quite exhausted, recline on it.
            </p>
            <p>Worn out with anxiety, she fell fast
               <lb/>asleep, and slept soundly till it was very

               <lb/>late in the morning, and <persName>Mrs. Naylor</persName> en­
               <lb/>tered with breakfast. She made many
               <lb/>apologies for not coming before, being oc­
               <lb/>cupied with getting <persName>master Naylor's</persName> and
               <lb/>the men's breakfasts, who were gone out
               <lb/>to fish with their nets and fishing-tackle.
            </p>
            <p><said>It has been a stormy night,</said> said
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName>; <said>I am afraid, <persName>Mrs. Naylor</persName>, some

               <lb/>blows nobody good. We get many good
               <lb/>things by them,</said> and she winked her eye
               <lb/>as she spoke, adding—<said>the sea throws
               <lb/>up many valuable articles.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> was horror-struck, but she said no
               <lb/>more, from directly suspecting that <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Naylor</persName> and her husband were those de­
               <lb/>scription of people that plunder wrecks,
               <lb/>and steal the property of the unfortunate
               <lb/>beings the waves have spared. Even the

               <lb/>they had riches, were often sacrificed by
               <lb/>these miscreants for the sake of their mo­
               <lb/>ney or jewels, and buried in the sand, as
               <lb/>she had frequently heard related.
            </p>
            <p>The fury of the tempest was abated,
               <lb/>but the weather continued stormy. Some­
               <lb/>times the waves swelled mountains high,
               <lb/>and roughly beat against the shore, and
               <lb/>dashing to a prodigious height among the
               <lb/>rocks, spread their white foam around in
               <lb/>snowy showers. <persName>Rose</persName> enjoyed this dis­
               <lb/>mal scene; it was more in unison with
               <lb/>her wounded mind than a glaring sun­
               <lb/>shine, that, while it cheered the face of
               <lb/>nature, would have appeared to mock her
               <lb/>woes. Several vessels she perceived at a
               <lb/>distance seemed to be struggling with the
               <lb/>agitated green billows, and suggested to
               <lb/>her feeling heart how many dangers the
               <lb/>intrepid sailor has to encounter, consign­
               <lb/>ed frequently, after all his sufferings, to a
               <lb/>premature and watery grave.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Naylor</persName> returned for the tea-things,
               <lb/>and began talking immediately of her

               <milestone unit="sig" n="H7v"/>

               <lb/>shape, saying she wished she was as good
               <lb/>a figure as <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>, on purpose that
               <lb/>she might praise the symmetry of her
               <lb/>form. She was actually very well shaped,
               <lb/>had not the slovenliness of her appearance
               <lb/>disguised her; and <persName>Rose</persName> pretended to ad­
               <lb/>mire her figure as the best she had ever
               <lb/>seen, complimenting her at the same time
               <lb/>so highly, that with all her cunning she
               <lb/>was quite thrown off her guard. <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>would not have flattered her vanity, had
               <lb/>she not been in her power, for she abhor­
               <lb/>red the shadow of deceit; but on such oc­
               <lb/>casion, when she expected, by praising her,
               <lb/>to find means of escaping, she hoped it was
               <lb/>excusable.
            </p>
            <p>Intoxicated with the incense of flattery,
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Naylor</persName> was reluctant to quit her; she
               <lb/>was never tired of hearing herself compli­
               <lb/>mented, nor of being the subject of her
               <lb/>own conversation. Inadvertently, as they
               <lb/>were conversing, she disclosed that they
               <lb/>were alone together in the house, and soon
               <lb/>after quitted the room with the tea-tray.

               <lb/>Giddy with the adulation she had received,
               <lb/>that flattered her voracious self-love, <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Naylor</persName> neglected to lock the door after
               <lb/>her. <persName>Rose</persName> observed this, but waited a
               <lb/>quarter of an hour to see if she recollected
               <lb/>the circumstance. Finding she did not
               <lb/>remember the omission, she considered
               <lb/>that this would be an excellent opportu­
               <lb/>nity to try to escape. <persName>Rose</persName> put on her
               <lb/>bonnet and shawl, and gently opening the
               <lb/>door, crept down the stairs as softly as pos­
               <lb/>sible. She moved with so much gentle­
               <lb/>ness, that <persName>Mrs. Naylor</persName> did not hear her,
               <lb/>though she was standing at the front-door
               <lb/>that led to the beach, with her back to­
               <lb/>wards her.
            </p>
            <p>There was no escape that way, but per­
               <lb/>ceiving another door open on the side,
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> stole out, and found herself in a long
               <lb/>narrow passage between two rocks, and a
               <lb/>large stone rolled at the end. Here she
               <lb/>perceived no chance of getting out of dan­
               <lb/>ger, and stood ruminated what she should

               <pb/>
               <milestone unit="sig" n="H8v"/>
               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">160</mw>
               <lb/>do, when suddenly she saw the great stone
               <lb/>move, and the men who had waylaid and
               <lb/>taken her from the wood advanced from
               <lb/>behind it.—<said>Ho! ho!</said> one of these men
               <lb/>directly called out—<said>so you want to run
               <lb/>away, I suppose? We will make you rest
               <lb/>quiet, so come with us;</said> and with these
               <lb/>words they dragged her through a door
               <lb/>that was behind the stone, which was raised
               <lb/>by a mechanical power, though a great
               <lb/>weight, yet not so heavy as it appeared.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> made no opposition, and they
               <lb/>ceased to force her along, while three of
               <lb/>them walked first, whom she followed, and
               <lb/>one walked behind her. They proceeded
               <lb/>onwards among dismal hollow places and
               <lb/>dreary dens, only lighted by fissures in the
               <lb/>rocks, till they reached an opening which
               <lb/>conducted to a cavern, resembling the sub­
               <lb/>terraneous cave near <placeName>Treharne</placeName>.
            </p>
            <p>Here she beheld a lady and gentleman
               <lb/>seated, in earnest discourse. The lady
               <lb/>turned round at the noise of their entrance,
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">frowned,</mw>

               <lb/>frowned, and looking ferociously at the
               <lb/>men, exclaimed—<said>Why did you bring
               <lb/>her to this place?</said>
            </p>
            <p>The ruffians replied, in a grumbling tone
               <lb/>of voice, that she was going to escape, and
               <lb/>knowing no other secret habitation where
               <lb/>she would be in security till she was fetch­
               <lb/>ed, had conducted her to the cavern—<said>But
               <lb/>by good luck,</said> they continued, <said>she will
               <lb/>be off for good to-night, and we shall have

            <p><said>T'other's safe enough,</said> cried one of

            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> shuddered at this last speech, as
               <lb/>she thought her poor <persName>Kamira</persName> had resisted
               <lb/>and been killed. Nearly fainting at the
               <lb/>idea, she glanced at that moment at the
               <lb/>lady, as she leaned against the side of the
               <lb/>cavern, and discovered, to her extreme
               <lb/>astonishment, that this lady was her old
               <lb/>acquaintance, <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>. This discovery
               <lb/>at first delighted her, as seeing any one
               <lb/>she knew, however worthless and disagree­
               <lb/>able, revived hope, and might lead, she
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">flattered</mw>

               <milestone unit="sig" n="H9v"/>

               <lb/>flattered herself, ultimately to her release
               <lb/>from the hands of these terrific ruffians.
               <lb/>But these pleasing expectations vanished,
               <lb/>when she reflected on her familiarity with
               <lb/>such low wicked men. However, though
               <lb/>she looked more forbidding and morose
               <lb/>than she used to do, <persName>Rose</persName> summoned cou­
               <lb/>rage to address this woman, and asked her
               <lb/>to have the goodness to explain why she
               <lb/>had been carried off and confined.
            </p>
            <p><said>You will know to-night,</said> replied <persName>Mrs.
               <lb/>Price</persName>, with a diabolical smile, <said>and you
               <lb/>must bridle your curiosity till then. I do
               <lb/>not wish to have any thing to say to you:
               <lb/>your sister has often told me,</said> added this
               <lb/>woman, with a demoniac expression of
               <lb/>countenance, <said>that I was not a favourite
               <lb/>of yours; you cannot hope, therefore, as­
               <lb/>sistance from a person you disliked, and I
               <lb/>assure you there is no love lost between
               <lb/>us.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> made no answer, as she perceived
               <lb/>she was inflexible; and turning to the
               <lb/>gentleman, attempted to soften him. She
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">entreated</mw>
               <pb/>
               <milestone unit="sig" n="H10r"/>

               <lb/>entreated in the most moving accents that
               <lb/>he would restore her to liberty, and while
               <lb/>she was addressing him, the ruffians re­
               <lb/>tired. A cold shivering apparently shook
               <lb/>his frame while she was speaking, his arms
               <lb/>were folded, and he then pulled his large
               <lb/>hat over his face, to shade it more effec­
               <lb/>tually, that she might not clearly discern
               <lb/>his features.
            </p>
            <p>After a silence of a moment, he waved
               <lb/>his hand for her to be gone, in a manner
               <lb/>expressive of disapprobation. <persName>Rose</persName> could
               <lb/>only distinguish, from the lamp burning
               <lb/>in the cavern, that he was fair, and some­
               <lb/>thing in the lower part of his face seemed
               <lb/>familiar to her. He now rose from his
               <lb/>seat, and motioning to his companion, they
               <lb/>both left her. <persName>Rose</persName> remarked that he was
               <lb/>very tall, and limped as he walked; a loose
               <lb/>cloak enwrapped his majestic figure, and
               <lb/>though he did not listen to her with com­

               <lb/>and noticed that before he quitted the ca­

            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> remained till evening without re­
               <lb/>freshment in this dismal cavern; she had
               <lb/>tried the doors at each outlet, and found
               <lb/>them strongly fastened, and could with
               <lb/>difficulty avoid giving way to despair.
               <lb/>Another tempest, she imagined, had arisen,
               <lb/>as the wind whistled through the clefts
               <lb/>and chasms in the rocks, and she heard
               <lb/>peals of thunder loud and awfully re­
               <lb/>sounding with appalling crash. Nearly
               <lb/>sinking into despondency, she trembled
               <lb/>for fear the lightning should split the rocks
               <lb/>that the cavern was hewn out of, and, bu­
               <lb/>ried in the ruins, her fate become for ever
               <lb/>unknown to her beloved relations—no
               <lb/>parent's tear bedew her humble grave, or
               <lb/>affectionate brother mourn a sister that
               <lb/>tenderly loved him. She might even, she
               <lb/>reflected, innocent as she was, be con­
               <lb/>demned, and her flight considered as vo­
               <lb/>luntary. While these reflections occupied

               <lb/>many hours made her extremely ill. She
               <lb/>felt sick and was nearly fainting, when
               <lb/>one of the doors unexpectedly opened.
               <lb/>The fresh air admitted by the door revived
               <lb/>her, and she beheld the most good-natured
               <lb/>looking of the men who had carried her
               <lb/>off enter.

            <p>He placed his finger on his lip, as a sign
               <lb/>for her to be silent, and approaching near,
               <lb/>whispered to her—<said>If you will solemnly
               <lb/>swear never to divulge what has passed to
               <lb/>any person whatsoever, nor disclose the se­

               <lb/>have discovered, I will restore you safe to
               <lb/>your home. But mind, first religiously
               <lb/>swear you will not betray me—swear, and
               <lb/>you shall be rescued from further horrors
               <lb/>now awaiting if you remain, and I will

               <lb/>vern, and having eat and drank a little,
               <lb/>she was quite refreshed. The man now
               <lb/>desired her to follow him; they went down
               <lb/>the passage by which she had entered the
               <lb/>cavern a little distance, then turning up
               <lb/>on the left side, it conducted them into an
               <lb/>extensive hollow recess, scooped, like the

               <lb/>extended on the ground! By his dress he
               <lb/>appeared to be a <name>Moor</name> or <name>Turk</name>; his turban
               <lb/>had fallen off, and revealed to her horror­
               <lb/>struck sight many deep and bloody gashes
               <lb/>on his head, which, contrasted with the pale

               <lb/>there was no time to be lost, if she wished
               <lb/>to leave this dreary abode. She must
               <lb/>instantly, he added, exert herself, if she
               <lb/>desired to quit her prison, and pointed,
               <lb/>as he hastily spoke, to some steps cut in
               <lb/>the stony sides of this recess, by which they
               <lb/>could ascend to the top. All her courage
               <lb/>now returned, from eagerness to get out of
               <lb/>this den of murder and desolation. Sup­
               <lb/>ported by the man, she quickly mounted
               <lb/>the steps, and on reaching the roof of this
               <lb/>hollow recess, her companion lifted a trap­
               <lb/>door, and led her from it into a small
               <lb/>woody copse. He threw some brambles
               <lb/>over the opening through which they had
               <lb/>passed, and conducted her a few yards to
               <lb/>where a horse was tied to a tree. The

               <lb/>up by the roots, and broken branches
               <lb/>strewed the ground, which was so soft and
               <lb/>wet, that her shoes were quite soaked with
               <lb/>the damp; and it was so slippery that she
               <lb/>would have several times fallen down, had
               <lb/>she not held by the strong arm of her com­
               <lb/>panion. When they had got clear of the

               <lb/>not perceive him.

            <p>No lights appeared in any part of the
               <lb/>house; all was dark and gloomy, and she
               <lb/>began to be very impatient, as she was
               <lb/>weary and wet, at not perceiving any per­

               <lb/>time since she announced her arrival by

               <lb/>bugle with her utmost force, which might
               <lb/>have been heard at a great distance, and
               <lb/>soon after one of the first floor windows
               <lb/>cautiously opened, and three heads looked
               <lb/>out together. Imagine her joy when she

               <lb/>ant. <persName>Rose</persName> now desired them to prepare

               <lb/>the circumstances of her escape from the
               <lb/>power of the ruffians. <persName>Kamira</persName> replied,
               <lb/>that directly after they had conveyed her
               <lb/>mistress to the ruinous house, they took
               <lb/>her from the carriage, and leading her to
               <lb/>the sea-side, placed her in a boat, which
               <lb/>rowed to a vessel at anchor, where they
               <lb/>carried her on board. As evening ad­
               <lb/>vanced, the vessel approached the shore,
               <lb/>and when it was quite night, anchored very
               <lb/>near the land. All day they detained <persName>Ka­

               <lb/>which raged so furiously; but when the
               <lb/>tempest was in some degree lulled, she
               <lb/>entreated them to let her go on deck for a
               <lb/>little fresh air, as she felt very ill, from
               <lb/>being confined so many hours in a small
               <lb/>cabin. Elevated with the liquor they had
               <lb/>been plentifully drinking, they were in
               <lb/>tolerable good-humour, and granted her
               <lb/>request. A thought had suggested itself
               <lb/>to her mind when she asked this favour,
               <lb/>that made her hope to effectually escape.

               <lb/>She could swim exceedingly well, having
               <lb/>been accustomed from her earliest youth

               <lb/>herself overboard, and by this means gain
               <lb/>the shore.

            <p>Soon after <persName>Kamira</persName> got on deck, the

               <lb/>rope was fastened to the side of the ship,
               <lb/>which she noticed with satisfaction. The
               <lb/>boy in a short interval fell fast asleep, and
               <lb/>the men were merrily carousing, when
               <lb/><persName>Kamira</persName> gently pulled off her upper gar­
               <lb/>ments, that they might not incumber her
               <lb/>in the design she meditated. Throwing
               <lb/>them into the water, she now let herself
               <lb/>down into the sea by the rope, and in a
               <lb/>few minutes swam safely to land. that
               <lb/>a woman could swim was unsuspected by
               <lb/>these wretches, which had thrown them

               <lb/>road that led from the desolate beach,
               <lb/>drenched with rain, and almost beat down
               <lb/>with the wind, as the storm commenced
               <lb/>again with redoubled fury. She was nearly
               <lb/>undressed, and the few clothes she had on
               <lb/>were wet with the salt-water; but she
               <lb/>heeded not the raging tempest, nor her
               <lb/>uncomfortable state, from the rapture she
               <lb/>felt at being freed from the clutches of the
               <lb/>monsters who had made her a prisoner.
            </p>
            <p>About a mile from the coast she was
               <lb/>overtaken by a countryman, who pitied
               <lb/>her, when she told him she had been rob­
               <lb/>bed and stripped by thieves. He was
               <lb/>going near <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, and humanely offer­
               <lb/>ed her shelter in his covered cart. Having
               <lb/>conveyed her within a few yards of the
               <lb/>house, he drove off, and <persName>Kamira</persName> reached
               <lb/>the Hall in security. Old <persName>Robin</persName> and
               <lb/><persName>Dolly</persName> were enraptured at the sight of her,
               <lb/>being unable to guess the cause of their
               <lb/>having disappeared; he was afraid to quit
               <lb/>the mansion with only <persName>Dolly</persName> in it, or to

               <lb/>return, whether their absence was volun­
               <lb/>tary or otherwise. <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> had called
               <lb/>on the day of their unwilling departure to
               <lb/>the sea-side, and being told that <persName>Miss
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> was gone to take a walk, would
               <lb/>not come in, but left a kind message for
               <lb/>her; and no other visitors had been since.

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> now entreated that <persName>Robin</persName>, <persName>Kami­
               <lb/>ra</persName>, and <persName>Dolly</persName>, would preserve an inviolable
               <lb/>secrecy respecting all that had occurred
               <lb/>these three last days; urgent reasons, she
               <lb/>told them, obliged her to solicit them to
               <lb/>be silent on the subject, as it was not only
               <lb/>her own life that would be endangered, if
               <lb/>the events that had lately taken place were
               <lb/>known publicly. They all promised to
               <lb/>faithfully retain the secret, in considera­
               <lb/>tion of their own safety, as well as hers,
               <lb/>though they were so faithfully attached to
               <lb/>her, that they would have saved her life at
               <lb/>the expence of theirs, had it been required.

               <lb/>had beheld, and from the excessive pertur­
               <lb/>bation she had suffered. Every sudden
               <lb/>noise made her start and tremble violent­
               <lb/>ly; it was, however, a soothing consola­
               <lb/>tion, that she could converse with <persName>Kamira</persName>
               <lb/>on the mysterious incidents that had hap­
               <lb/>pened. When the conversation turned
               <lb/>on the circumstance of their being borne
               <lb/>away to the dreary beach, they were both
               <lb/>of opinion that the ruffians subsisted by
               <lb/>robberies of every description, and plun­
               <lb/>dering the vessels wrecked on the coast;
               <lb/>that they did not scruple murder, when
               <lb/>any considerable booty was in view, she
               <lb/>was convinced, from the mangled dead
               <lb/>body she had seen in the rocky recess, and
               <lb/>she was grateful to Providence that had
               <lb/>benignly rescued them from the hands of
               <lb/>these sanguinary unprincipled assassins.
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> likewise suspected that there was
               <lb/>some inlet from the cavern near the sea,

               <lb/>cated with <placeName>Treharne Hall</placeName>. Various con­

               <lb/>jectures perplexed her; and, quite bewilder­
               <lb/>ed with endeavouring to explain the mys­
               <lb/>tery, she found she must trust to time to
               <lb/>develop it. She concluded, on reasonable
               <lb/>grounds, that the ruffians were instigated
               <lb/>and employed by another person to force
               <lb/>her away, for some motive she could not
               <lb/>penetrate. The appearance of <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>
               <lb/>with the unknown gentleman, who looked
               <lb/>superior and elegant, notwithstanding his
               <lb/>disguise, heightened her suspicion.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Fane</persName>, when she visited <persName>Rose</persName>, was
               <lb/>surprised and concerned at seeing her again
               <lb/>looking exceedingly ill, which she attri­
               <lb/>buted to a violent cold she had really
               <lb/>caught in walking through the damp wood.
               <lb/>She was glad to make this excuse, as she
               <lb/>could not, consistent with her promise or
               <lb/>secrecy, confide what had passed—at least
               <lb/>she was undecided how to act till she had
               <lb/>consulted her father and mother, and was
               <lb/>resolved to remain passive till she could
               <lb/>have the advantage of their judgment and
               <lb/>advice.

            <p>Apprehensive of any additional at­
               <lb/>tempts to ensnare and carry her off, she
               <lb/>never walked out, if only in the garden,
               <lb/>without <persName>Robin</persName> accompanying her, as well
               <lb/>as <persName>Kamira</persName>. Instead of walking as fre­
               <lb/>quently as formerly, she went an airing in
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Fane's</persName> carriage, and visited that lady
               <lb/>often, accepting her kind invitations more
               <lb/>than she had hitherto done, as she felt se­
               <lb/>cure when rambling in her garden and
               <lb/>grounds. <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> was much gratified
               <lb/>with her constant visits, and she had the
               <lb/>satisfaction of pleasing her worthy old
               <lb/>friend, and feeling herself protected and
               <lb/>amused.
            </p>
            <p>But an event that now happened was a
               <lb/>source of the truest gratification; it re­
               <lb/>newed her vivacity, and was the sweetest
               <lb/>balm to heal her wounded breast. This
               <lb/>was a letter from her brother, to whom
               <lb/>she was so ardently attached, in which he
               <lb/>informed her he had just landed from <placeName>Ire­
               <lb/>land</placeName>, and would be at <placeName>Treharne</placeName> in a few
               <lb/>days. The expectation of seeing him was

               <lb/>a consolation for all her sufferings. <persName>Felix</persName>
               <lb/>even mentioned the evening and hour he
               <lb/>intended to arrive, and have the happiness
               <lb/>of embracing his sisters; adding, that he
               <lb/>had heard from his mother all the particu­
               <lb/>lars of hers and his father's residence, for
               <lb/>so long a period, at <placeName>Towie Craigs</placeName>. The de­
               <lb/>light of <persName>Rose</persName> at the prospect of meeting
               <lb/>her dear brother, who had been absent for
               <lb/>such a length of time, is almost indescrib­
               <lb/>able. Unaccustomed for some months to
               <lb/>the emotions of joy, the pleasing estranged
               <lb/>sensations quite agitated her.
            </p>
            <p>Every hour appeared an age till the day
               <lb/>arrived, at whose close that loved brother
               <lb/>was to appear. As the evening and time
               <lb/>approached, each moment seemed to move
               <lb/>on leaden wings. It was a fine calm night,
               <lb/>when <persName>Rose</persName> stood at the hall-door in anx­
               <lb/>ious expectation. The moon gently rose
               <lb/>over the hills, and irradiated with its beams
               <lb/>the ancient turrets of <placeName>Treharne Hall</placeName>, and
               <lb/>silver waters of the river that washed its

               <lb/>glided, reflecting the bright orb of the bril­
               <lb/>liant luminary; the sky was spangled with
               <lb/>innumerable stars; and <persName>Rose</persName> admired,
               <lb/>though her mind was occupied, the lumi­
               <lb/>nous sparkling bodies that shone in the
               <lb/>nocturnal scene: by their soft light she
               <lb/>listened to the tuneful sweet modulation
               <lb/>of the nightingale, whose harmonious war­
               <lb/>blings were distinctly heard. In the soli­
               <lb/>tary grove near the hermitage, she had fre­
               <lb/>quently been entertained in summer with
               <lb/>this enchanting evening songstress, who
               <lb/>frequented sequestered coppices and shady
               <lb/>spots.
            </p>
            <p>The pleasing anxiety that agitated her
               <lb/>was soon removed, by the sound of car­
               <lb/>riage-wheels rattling at a little distance,
               <lb/>which announced the approach of <persName>Felix</persName>.
               <lb/><persName>Robin</persName> was waiting on the other side of
               <lb/>the river in readiness to attend him, and
               <lb/>soon did the postchaise appear in sight.
               <lb/>It stopped near the banks of the river, and
               <lb/>with unutterable joy she saw her brother,
               <lb/>dressed in regimentals, spring from the

               <lb/>carriage. He then waited a moment, till
               <lb/>a gentleman got out with his assistance,
               <lb/>who leaned upon his arm for support, as if
               <lb/>he was ill. <persName>Felix</persName> now appeared to desire
               <lb/><persName>Robin</persName> to bear him up on the other side,
               <lb/>and between them he was placed in the
               <lb/>boat, leaving the postillion with the lug­
               <lb/>gage, till <persName>Robin</persName> could return to help him
               <lb/>to bring it over. When they entered,
               <lb/>where <persName>Rose</persName> stood eager to receive them,
               <lb/>she flew to embrace her brother, who affec­
               <lb/>tionately returned her testimonies of re­
               <lb/>gard with fraternal affection. The stranger
               <lb/>kept back, leaning on <persName>Robin</persName>, till the first
               <lb/>emotion of joy at meeting after so long an
               <lb/>interval had subsided; and <persName>Felix</persName>, turning
               <lb/>to him, said—<said>Forgive me, if in the de­
               <lb/>light of seeing my sister, I have neglected
               <lb/>you for an instant.—<persName>Rose</persName>,</said> he continued,
               <lb/><said>I must now entreat your immediate care
               <lb/>and attention for this gentleman, whom I
               <lb/>have had the good fortune to rescue from
               <lb/>a gang of wretches, who have wounded
               <lb/>him, but I hope not dangerously.</said>

            <p><persName>Rose</persName> now looked at the stranger, who
               <lb/>bowed to her, and apologized for her inat­
               <lb/>tention to him, from being so much en­
               <lb/>gaged with the pleasure of seeing her bro­
               <lb/>ther. He looked very pale and exhausted,
               <lb/>and she requested he would accompany
               <lb/>her to the drawing-room, where he could
               <lb/>recline on a sofa, till an apartment was pre­
               <lb/>pared, and have any assistance or relief he
               <lb/>required or wished. Leaning on <persName>Robin</persName>
               <lb/>and <persName>Felix</persName>, he attended her, and placing
               <lb/>the cushions of the sofa in such a manner
               <lb/>as would allow him to repose with ease and
               <lb/>comfort, he gladly rested his weakened
               <lb/>frame, feeling very faint, from having lost
               <lb/>a great deal of the vital stream of life.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Felix</persName> left the room, and <persName>Rose</persName> being dis­

               <lb/>one with equal admiration and interest.
               <lb/>He was tall, and finely proportioned, with
               <lb/>a face of manly beauty, and about five or
               <lb/>six-and-twenty years of age. <persName>Rose</persName> was so

               <lb/>whenever she could do it unperceived, and
               <lb/>though, if his mind equalled his person,
               <lb/>he must be perfection itself. He was
               <lb/>dressed in the regimentals of an officer of
               <lb/>the Guards, and his two epaulets proved
               <lb/>he was of no inferior rank. The wounds
               <lb/>he had received were in his shoulder and
               <lb/>breast, and the stains on his white waist­
               <lb/>coat and pantaloons were evident traces of
               <lb/>the injuries he had received. <persName>Rose</persName> asked
               <lb/>if he would not wish to retire to rest,
               <lb/>as he should occupy her brother's apart­
               <lb/>ment, which was ready, and another could
               <lb/>be arranged for him? but he thanked her
               <lb/>in a faint voice, and declined her kind and
               <lb/>polite offer, saying, he would rather wait
               <lb/>where he was, till he had seen the surgeon
               <lb/><persName>Mr. Douglas</persName> had been so good as to dis­
               <lb/>patch his servant for before their arrival,

               <lb/>mour Delavalle</persName>. Within a mile of <placeName>Tre­
               <lb/>harne</placeName>, as he was driving on rapidly, with
               <lb/>his servant (a soldier of his regiment) in the
               <lb/>postchaise with him, they perceived, by the
               <lb/>light of the moon, a very unequal combat.
               <lb/><persName>Sir Eglamour</persName>, with two privates, and three
               <lb/>or four other men, were bravely defend­
               <lb/>ing themselves against a party of at least
               <lb/>twenty sailors, and ill-looking fellows.
               <lb/><persName>Felix</persName> was well armed with a sword and
               <lb/>loaded pistols, and his man had likewise
               <lb/>another pair charged. With more cou­
               <lb/>rage than prudence, as the affray was so
               <lb/>disproportionate, he ordered the postboy
               <lb/>to stop, and jumping out, ranged himself
               <lb/>with his man on the side of his brother-
               <lb/>officer, whose military dress prejudiced
               <lb/>him in his favour. When the rascals,
               <lb/>who had the advantage in numbers, per­
               <lb/>ceived that their opponents had addition­
               <lb/>al support, though small, they cowardly
               <lb/>fled, after <persName>Felix</persName> and his servant had dis­
               <lb/>charged their pistols.

               <lb/>very expeditiously, <persName>Felix</persName> addressed the
               <lb/>officer, and finding he was wounded, beg­
               <lb/>ged to be allowed to accommodate him
               <lb/>with a place in the postchaise, and that he
               <lb/>would also partake of the hospitality the
               <lb/>home he was going to afforded. The
               <lb/>officer, who was delighted with the intre­
               <lb/>pidity of <persName>Felix</persName>, whose courageous inter­
               <lb/>ference had most probably saved his life,
               <lb/>wished to be acquainted with him, and
               <lb/>was also happy to receive so speedy an
               <lb/>accommodation, as there was neither house
               <lb/>or cottage near the spot where they had
               <lb/>been engaged; he therefore accepted his
               <lb/>proposal with gratitude, and <persName>Felix</persName> dis­
               <lb/>patched his own servant directly, on <persName>sir
               <lb/>Eglamour's</persName> horse, for a surgeon.

            <p>As they travelled slowly, <persName>Felix</persName> was in­
               <lb/>formed by his companion that the men
               <lb/>who had retreated on his appearance to as­
               <lb/>sist him and his party, were smugglers,
               <lb/>and considered as very daring characters.
               <lb/>They were proceeding to one of their places

               <lb/>tity of contraband goods, when they
               <lb/>unexpectedly encountered three custom­
               <lb/>house-officers, who had the imprudence
               <lb/>to order the smugglers to surrender them­
               <lb/>selves and property. It was an indiscre­
               <lb/>tion nearly allied to madness, as their op­
               <lb/>ponents were much more than double their
               <lb/>number, and not inclined to give them­
               <lb/>selves up to the punishment of the law,
               <lb/>as they belonged to the same gang who
               <lb/>had some time before murdered two ex­
               <lb/>cise and one customhouse-officer. Hi­
               <lb/>therto they had eluded the vigilance of
               <lb/>justice, and had nearly overpowered these
               <lb/>indiscreet men, when <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>, who
               <lb/>was stationed with part of the <name>Coldstream
               <lb/>Guards</name> at <placeName>Exeter</placeName>, happened to pass by,
               <lb/>with two of his soldiers, and knowing one
               <lb/>of the men who were engaged against the
               <lb/>smugglers, came forward, attended by his
               <lb/>soldiers, in defence of the weakest party:
               <lb/>but valour and skill in all likelihood would
               <lb/>have availed them little, had not <persName>Felix</persName> and

               <lb/>becoming victims to the power of these
               <lb/>atrocious, lawless wretches. The smug­
               <lb/>glers were apprehensive, as their enemies'
               <lb/>numbers were increased, though in a tri­
               <lb/>fling degree, that one of them might alarm
               <lb/>the country, and bring down a large body
               <lb/>of people against them, which would have
               <lb/>fatal consequences: this consideration oc­
               <lb/>casioned their giving up the contest, and
               <lb/>flying from the scene of action. <persName>Felix</persName>
               <lb/>added, that <persName>Robin</persName> had been telling him
               <lb/>that a band of these desperate fellows had
               <lb/>infested the neighbourhood for some years,
               <lb/>nor could the magistrates ever discover
               <lb/>where they concealed themselves, or been
               <lb/>able to secure one of them, notwithstand­
               <lb/>ing the most diligent search had been
               <lb/>made; he was therefore of opinion, that
               <lb/><persName>sir Eglamour</persName> and himself had fortunately
               <lb/>escaped from such successful ruffians.

            <p><persName>Mr. Addison</persName> the surgeon now arrived.
               <lb/>He was a skilful man, and resided at a large
               <lb/>village about two miles and-a-half from

               <lb/><persName>Brown</persName>, <persName>Mr. Douglas's</persName> servant, had very
               <lb/>properly requested his attendance, as the
               <lb/>delay would be greater if he proceeded to
               <lb/>the city for another professional gentleman.
               <lb/><persName>Felix</persName> and his sister, who were both more
               <lb/>interested in favour of their guest than
               <lb/>they had ever been for any other stranger,
               <lb/>now heard, with the highest satisfaction,
               <lb/>that his wounds were not dangerous. <persName>Mr.
               <lb/>Addison</persName>, however, recommended that, <persName>sir
               <lb/>Eglamour</persName> should not be removed from
               <lb/><placeName>Treharne</placeName> for a week at least, as he was in­
               <lb/>clined to be feverish, though slightly
               <lb/>wounded, and very much enfeebled from
               <lb/>the loss of blood.
            </p>
            <p>When <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> had retired, <persName>Felix</persName>
               <lb/>eagerly asked why he had not see <persName>Jane</persName>,
               <lb/>what was the reason, and if she was up
               <lb/>stairs ill? <persName>Rose</persName> felt great pain at being
               <lb/>reduced to the cruel necessity of acquaint­
               <lb/>ing her brother with the distressing cir­
               <lb/>cumstances, relative to her sister, that had
               <lb/>occurred, yet softened, as much as possible,

               <lb/>caution did not prevent him from think­
               <lb/>ing she had acted incorrectly, and he dis­
               <lb/>cerned much to blame in her conduct.
            </p>
            <p><said>Indiscreet girl!</said> he exclaimed; <said>I al­
               <lb/>ways predicted your fate, from the ex­
               <lb/>treme levity and perverseness of your dis­
               <lb/>position: yet do I not the less lament the
               <lb/>misery that I am assured you have en­
               <lb/>tailed on yourself, and the uneasiness you
               <lb/>will cause my father and mother. But I
               <lb/>hope with you, <persName>Rose</persName>, that her afflictions
               <lb/>may have a good effect, by amending her
               <lb/>temper. When she finds most characters
               <lb/>in the world very different from her fond
               <lb/>indulgent parents, it will probably induce
               <lb/>her to correct her errors.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I am convinced,</said> replied <persName>Rose</persName>, <said>that
               <lb/>the indifference of <persName>colonel Guilford</persName>, which
               <lb/>is in my opinion even worse than jealousy
               <lb/>or severity, will cause a surprising revolu­
               <lb/>tion in her character. <persName>Jane</persName> possesses na­
               <lb/>tural good sense, which will influence her
               <lb/>to reform and improve. Had she married

               <lb/>recting her errors, she would perhaps have
               <lb/>indulged them, till they became too deeply
               <lb/>rooted for amendment; I trust, therefore,
               <lb/>my dear brother, that when you see her,
               <lb/>you will be affectionate, and not make any
               <lb/>unkind remarks: but I need not say this,
               <lb/>as your good heart has dictated the pro­
               <lb/>priety of being lenient to the failings of so
               <lb/>near and dear a relation.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Felix</persName> assured her he was not the least
               <lb/>inclined to be harsh, and only regretted
               <lb/>that <persName>Jane</persName> had sought such an unhappy
               <lb/>destiny. He proposed going to see her
               <lb/>very shortly, and desired <persName>Rose</persName> would write
               <lb/>to acquaint her with his arrival. <persName>Colonel
               <lb/>Guilford's</persName> dislike to visitors he did not
               <lb/>think worthy of attention, observing, that
               <lb/>it would give <persName>Jane</persName> consequence in his
               <lb/>eyes, when he found that her relations did
               <lb/>not desert her, though she had not con­
               <lb/>sulted them respecting her marriage, and
               <lb/>that she had a spirited brother to defend
               <lb/>her, if ill used. <persName>Rose</persName> admired her bro­

               <lb/>and the manly energy he displayed, and
               <lb/>felt herself transformed to a different being,
               <lb/>now that she enjoyed the consolation of
               <lb/>his society and protection. It seemed as
               <lb/>if no danger could approach, while he re­
               <lb/>sided with her.

            <p>During the period that <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> was
               <lb/>a resident of <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, <persName>Rose</persName> imparted to
               <lb/>her brother the various events that had
               <lb/>happened since their parents were in <placeName>Scot­
               <lb/>land</placeName>. The only incident she concealed
               <lb/>from him was <persName>Courtenay's</persName> perfidy and at­
               <lb/>tachment. Previous, however, to this con­
               <lb/>fidence, she made him promise that what­
               <lb/>ever she entrusted to him should remain a
               <lb/>secret. He sympathized in her terror and
               <lb/>anxiety, when she described her dreadful
               <lb/>adventure in the subterraneous abode.
               <lb/>For what purpose they had borne her to
               <lb/>the cavern, and by whom employed, he
               <lb/>could not imagine. The only part of the
               <lb/>mystery he thought he could penetrate
               <lb/>was, that there existed a connexion be­
               <lb/>tween the smugglers who had wounded

               <lb/><persName>sir Eglamour</persName>, and the ruffians who con­
               <lb/>veyed her to the ruinous house. He like­
               <lb/>wise suspected that there was some subter­
               <lb/>raneous passage that connected the cavern
               <lb/>at <placeName>Treharne</placeName> with the one nearer the sea.

            <p><persName>Felix</persName> and <persName>Rose</persName>, while they lamented
               <lb/>the accident that had caused <persName>sir Egla­
               <lb/>mour's</persName> wounds and sufferings, could not
               <lb/>avoid at the same time rejoicing that this
               <lb/>unfortunate circumstance had introduced
               <lb/>him to their acquaintance. United to a
               <lb/>manly beauty that is rarely seen, he pos­
               <lb/>sessed the finest understanding, with the
               <lb/>most exquisite refinement of manners, and
               <lb/>pleasing address. Though so uncommonly
               <lb/>handsome, he did not appear to place the
               <lb/>least value on his personal attractions. He
               <lb/>was lively, humane, and the bravest among
               <lb/>those distinguished for courage. His dis­
               <lb/>position and that of <persName>Felix</persName> were very simi­
               <lb/>lar, and they directly formed one of those
               <lb/>ardent friendships, produced in feeling and
               <lb/>kind hearts in early life, with all the un­
               <lb/>sophisticated warmth of noble minds. No

               <lb/>cold suspicion, the growth of advanced
               <lb/>years, prevented them from enjoying the

            <p>On the third day after his reception at
               <lb/>the Hall, <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> left his apartment,
               <lb/>and passed the succeeding hours in the so­
               <lb/>ciety of <persName>Felix</persName> and his sister. They tasted
               <lb/>together those delightful moments, which
               <lb/>sometimes occur in existence, though not
               <lb/>frequently, and are like gleams of bright­
               <lb/>est sunshine. They are remembered as
               <lb/>instants of happiness, that have glided
               <lb/>without alloy, like a blissful dream. <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>was captivated with <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>, from
               <lb/>the first evening she beheld him, and the
               <lb/>object of her admiration received the same
               <lb/>impression in her favour. Though writh­
               <lb/>ing with acute pain, he thought, as he
               <lb/>gazed on her perfect form, that she was
               <lb/>the most lovely woman he had ever seen.
               <lb/>Every additional hour that he passed in
               <lb/>her company heightened the prepossession.
               <lb/>He discovered that her manners were

               <lb/>charming and fascinating, and her disposi­
               <lb/>tion as estimable as her person was beau­
               <lb/>tiful. Each day they admired and mu­
               <lb/>tually esteemed the character and perfec­
               <lb/>tions that distinguished the other, and in
               <lb/>one little week became truly and ardently
               <lb/>attached.
            </p>
            <p>But perfect felicity is too transient in
               <lb/>general, and by its loss we feel severely
               <lb/>the deprivation we have sustained. En­
               <lb/>deared to each other with the fondest af­
               <lb/>fection, they viewed the expiration of this
               <lb/>eventful week with real regret. Their
               <lb/>new-born attachment made them keenly
               <lb/>feel the bitterness of separation. They
               <lb/>were conscious of the ardent regard that
               <lb/>glowed in either faithful bosom, though
               <lb/>neither of them had pronounced the word

               <lb/>leaving <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, <persName>Felix</persName> said he should
               <lb/>accompany him to his lodgings, and visit
               <lb/>him afterwards in a few days, as he should
               <lb/>be anxious to know how his health was;
               <lb/>and if it continued to improve, <persName>Rose</persName> add­
               <lb/>ed that she hoped they should soon have
               <lb/>the pleasure of seeing him again.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Sir Eglamour</persName> looked expressively at
               <lb/>her, and replied—<said>I must lose all recol­
               <lb/>lection of what is most pleasing and inte­
               <lb/>resting in existence, if you do not see me
               <lb/>very shortly at your door.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> blushed, and attended him and
               <lb/>her brother to the hall, as they were going
               <lb/>off, when he uttered those last words. She
               <lb/>stood on the steps gazing after them, till
               <lb/>they entered the postchaise; and while she
               <lb/>admired the graceful figure of her lover,
               <lb/>could not help thinking that two such
               <lb/>elegant handsome young men were sel­
               <lb/>dom seen together. <persName>Sir Eglamour</persName> kissed
               <lb/>his hand to her from the window of the
               <lb/>carriage, and <persName>Rose</persName> returned into the house

               <lb/>quite dejected. The hopes and fears that
               <lb/>agitate the mind of those who really love
               <lb/>assailed her by turns. He was gone to a
               <lb/>place where there was a great number of
               <lb/>pretty women, who might banish the re­
               <lb/>membrance of her. That he was much
               <lb/>interested and pleased with her, she had,
               <lb/>without vanity, important reasons to be­
               <lb/>lieve, from several little incidents that
               <lb/>had taken place, and unequivocally disco­
               <lb/>vered his passion.
            </p>
            <p>But all these anxious doubts and fears
               <lb/>that tormented <persName>Rose</persName> were quickly re­
               <lb/>moved by a letter from <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> the
               <lb/>following day. How soothing were his
               <lb/>professions of unerring regard, and that his
               <lb/>love was not a transitory flame, but as
               <lb/>steady as it was passionate, being enkin­
               <lb/>dled not only by the beauty, but worth of
               <lb/>its object! After this frank avowal of his
               <lb/>attachment, he concluded by candidly of­
               <lb/>fering himself as her future protector, ob­
               <lb/>serving, that he should rely on the gentle­

               <lb/>ness and sensibility of her nature, to spare
               <lb/>him the misery of being long in a state of
               <lb/>uncertainty with respect to her sentiments.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> loved him too well (whose excel­
               <lb/>lence she considered as unrivalled) to keep
               <lb/>him a moment in suspense, and answered
               <lb/>his letter immediately. With a frankness
               <lb/>like his own, she confessed her predilec­
               <lb/>tion, and that she should be perfectly happy
               <lb/>to unite her destiny with his, with the ap­
               <lb/>probation of her father and mother. If
               <lb/>their consent was obtained, and their union
               <lb/>should be effected, <persName>Rose</persName> ingenuously
               <lb/>avowed that she should feel the utmost so­
               <lb/>licitude to promote his happiness, and it
               <lb/>would be her study, by complying with
               <lb/>his wishes, to make him never regret that
               <lb/>he had chosen her for his wife. When
               <lb/>she had finished this letter, she dispatched
               <lb/>it by <persName>Brown</persName> to <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>, and then
               <lb/>prepared to accompany <persName>Felix</persName> on a visit to
               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName>, who was apprized the day before of
               <lb/>their intention. With that habitual con­

               <lb/>distinguished <persName>Rose</persName>, she had thought it
               <lb/>right to inform her sister they were com­
               <lb/>ing, to avoid her being surprised, as she
               <lb/>feared it might agitate her in her interest­
               <lb/>ing critical situation.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Felix</persName> and <persName>Rose</persName> set off on horseback,
               <lb/>and the road which conducted to the resi­
               <lb/>dence of <persName>Jane</persName> was quite new to them.
               <lb/>They had to ascend very steep hills in the
               <lb/>beginning of their ride, which command­
               <lb/>ed delightful picturesque views, when they
               <lb/>gained their summits. The ground after­
               <lb/>wards became more level, and they rode
               <lb/>through shady lanes, where the wild rose
               <lb/>blushed in the hedges, and scented the
               <lb/>air. In the meadows the haymakers were
               <lb/>actively employed, and the fragrant per­
               <lb/>fume of the new-mown hay was wafted
               <lb/>to them by the gentle breeze that played
               <lb/>among the foliage of the embowering trees.
               <lb/>They had some difficulty in finding the
               <lb/>way that led to <placeName>Hemeridge Cottage</placeName>, where
               <lb/><persName>Mrs. Guilford</persName> resided, when they were
               <lb/>within two miles of it, as the villagers

               <lb/>who lived in the nearest hamlet were ig­
               <lb/>norant of such a place being in the neigh­
               <lb/>bourhood. As they were making further
               <lb/>inquiries, a labourer luckily overheard
               <lb/>them, who had worked in the colonel's
               <lb/>garden, and directed them to enter a wood
               <lb/>half-a-mile further, which conducted to
               <lb/>the spot.
            </p>
            <p>Having reached the place he had pointed
               <lb/>out, they entered a path cut through the
               <lb/>trees, which winding continually, brought
               <lb/>them, after riding a mile and a half, to a
               <lb/>low building in the cottage style. It had
               <lb/>no upper apartments, all the rooms being
               <lb/>on the ground-floor. Impenetrable thick­
               <lb/>ets and tall trees enclosed the garden, in
               <lb/>the middle of which it stood, on all sides,
               <lb/>excepting the entrance to it, which made
               <lb/>the cottage appear as if to be shut out from
               <lb/>every living creature. From being built
               <lb/>so exceedingly low, it had the appearance
               <lb/>as if it was sunk beneath the branching
               <lb/>oaks, lofty elms, and thick-leaved ash and
               <lb/>sycamores, that flourished luxuriantly near.

               <lb/>They rang the bell, which was answer­
               <lb/>ed by a young woman whose countenance
               <lb/>was expressive of anxiety. Having asked
               <lb/>for <persName>Mrs. Guilford</persName>, they were informed
               <lb/>she was extremely ill. This made them
               <lb/>the more eager to see her, and, instantly
               <lb/>alighting, <persName>Felix</persName> fastened the horses to the
               <lb/>gate, and as they hastily entered the gar­
               <lb/>den, told the servant they were <persName>Mrs. Guil­

            </p>
            <p><persName>Felix</persName> remained in a small parlour while
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> was conducted to her sister's apart­
               <lb/>ment.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> was seated in an arm-chair, with
               <lb/>an old woman near her, who looked like
               <lb/>a nurse. The moment <persName>Rose</persName> entered, she
               <lb/>got up, curtsied respectfully, and left the
               <lb/>chamber, saying, as she went out—<said>You
               <lb/>will ring when you want me, ma'am.</said>
            </p>
            <p>Hardly could <persName>Rose</persName> command her ago­
               <lb/>nized feelings at the sight of her altered
               <lb/>sister, and it required the strongest men­
               <lb/>tal efforts to conceal her anguish. She
               <lb/>trembled for her life when she saw her

               <lb/>look so pale and wan. Her round rosy
               <lb/>cheeks, colourless now, were fallen in, and
               <lb/>her lips were blue, instead of being like
               <lb/>coral, as they used to be before she was
               <lb/>married. The redness of her eyes shewed
               <lb/>she had been weeping, and her whole
               <lb/>countenance was haggard and mournful.
            </p>
            <p>When the old woman was out of hear­
               <lb/>ing, <persName>Jane</persName> said–<said>I have scarcely strength
               <lb/>to speak, I feel so very ill; but it is a
               <lb/>great comfort to me to see you, for I do
               <lb/>not think we shall meet again―I feel
               <lb/>as if I had not long to live.―That good
               <lb/>woman who has left us is my nurse―
               <lb/>From what she says, I expect hourly to
               <lb/>be confined.―That I can outlive the
               <lb/>event, I fear, is not possible.―If my
               <lb/>child survives its guilty mother―I be­
               <lb/>queath it to your care――Supply my
               <lb/>place when I am gone―lost for ever.</said>
            </p>
            <p>Here loud sobs interrupted her; her
               <lb/>head fell back, and nearly fainting, she
               <lb/>could not then articulate another word.
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> gave her a glass of water, which

               <lb/>wretched at witnessing this affecting scene,
               <lb/>she conquered her feelings, and assumed a

               <lb/>dejected and nervous, situated as you are.
               <lb/>I do not feel the least uneasiness on your
               <lb/>account.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Oh, <persName>Rose</persName>, you do not know the cause.
               <lb/>I was very well and cheerful till yester­
               <lb/>day―then I received my death-blow.
               <lb/>―I have hardly courage or strength to
               <lb/>mention it―but it is necessary you
               <lb/>should know it―however painful the
               <lb/>disclosure.</said>
            </p>
            <p>Here <persName>Jane's</persName> breath grew very short;
               <lb/>she sighed deeply, while her sister implor­
               <lb/>ed her not to speak any more at present
               <lb/>on the subject, as it agitated her too
               <lb/>much.

            <p>After a silence of some minutes, <persName>Jane</persName>

               <lb/>any painful recollections. <persName>Jane</persName> informed
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName>, that <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> had lately been
               <lb/>very frequent in her visits, though she
               <lb/>discouraged them as much as she possibly
               <lb/>could without being uncivil. Yesterday,
               <lb/>when she came, she conversed without
               <lb/>restraint, in an unchaste and improper
               <lb/>manner, and betrayed so gross a neglect
               <lb/>of elegant decency, to which <persName>Mrs. Guil­
               <lb/>ford</persName> had always been accustomed, that it
               <lb/>was quite offensive to her feelings, and
               <lb/>she gently expressed her disapprobation
               <lb/>of this kind of conversation. <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>
               <lb/>was quite enraged that one so much
               <lb/>younger should dare to disapprove any
               <lb/>thing she said, and with the countenance
               <lb/>of a fury marched up to her with her fist
               <lb/>doubled, which she shook at her, and with
               <lb/>an eye of such malignity, that the impres­
               <lb/>sion could never be forgotten; though
               <lb/>a light blue, her eyes were inflamed to
               <lb/>that degree with rage, that they glared
               <lb/>like a vivid fire. She made use of lan­
               <lb/>guage the most opprobrious and vulgar

               <lb/>(which it would be impossible for her to
               <lb/>repeat), and then said, with a sneering
               <lb/>laugh, she need not pique herself on her
               <lb/>virtue and propriety, as she was only <persName>co­
               <lb/>lonel Guilford's</persName> mistress, making use of a
               <lb/>very coarse expression at the same time.
               <lb/>—<said>He has a wife,</said> added <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>,
               <lb/><said>that he is honourably married to.</said>

            <p>This heart-rending discovery, united to

               <lb/>matized by the disgraceful epithet <persName>Mrs.

               <lb/>an effect, that she was instantly seized
               <lb/>with violent hysteric fits. These pro­
               <lb/>duced symptoms very alarming, and the
               <lb/>maid, who was a good sort of girl, being
               <lb/>uneasy at seeing her suffer, sent directly
               <lb/>for the nurse, who had this morning or­

            <p>Confirmed in effrontery and wicked­

            <p>Had <persName>colonel Guilford</persName> been at home,
               <lb/>she would not have presumed to insult
               <lb/>her, for though churlish and violent in his
               <lb/>conduct to her himself, he would not
               <lb/>have allowed this depraved abandoned
               <lb/>woman to triumph over and treat her
               <lb/>with insolence. Unfortunately, the colo­

               <lb/>ticular business, which he expected would
               <lb/>detain him some weeks longer, and of
               <lb/>this circumstance, with which she was
               <lb/>acquainted, she had taken advantage, like
               <lb/>a worthless being as she was, to trample
               <lb/>upon the depressed unoffending <persName>Jane</persName>.
               <lb/>Her intention was to completely corrupt

               <lb/>had an aversion to low and improper con­
               <lb/>versation. She resolved, in revenge, to
               <lb/>mortify her, and too effectually succeeded.
            </p>
            <p>The internal sufferings of <persName>Rose</persName>, as her
               <lb/>sister related these cruel events, were ago­
               <lb/>nizing and deeply wounded; her mental
               <lb/>exertions were great to conceal the an­
               <lb/>guish that overwhelmed her.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane's</persName> mind seemed relieved by the com­

               <lb/>married to a worthless character; you
               <lb/>would have been always miserable, since

               <lb/>is on the list of his intimate friends. As

               <lb/>by fraudulently mocking you with a false
               <lb/>marriage. The undeserved treachery you
               <lb/>have encountered, and the insults you have
               <lb/>sustained, only make me love you the more.
               <lb/>This artful imposition is a disgrace to them
               <lb/>and none to you: no longer shall you be

               <lb/>already revived by her sister's kindness,
               <lb/>who went and imparted to <persName>Felix</persName>, in a con­
               <lb/>cise manner, every thing that had occur­
               <lb/>red. He shared in the affliction which

               <lb/>but approved of all his favourite sister had
               <lb/>done and intended. In compliance with
               <lb/>her wish, he returned home immediately,
               <lb/>without seeing <persName>Jane</persName>, and escaped the pain­
               <lb/>ful sensations such a meeting would have
               <lb/>occasioned.

            <p>As the experienced nurse had predict­

               <lb/>troduced a fine little girl into the world,
               <lb/>without her life being endangered. <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>felt indescribable joy at this fortunate ter­
               <lb/>mination of an event that she had dreaded,
               <lb/>from her being previously so ill and deject­
               <lb/>ed. As she gazed with affection at the
               <lb/>pretty chubby little babe, she could not
               <lb/>help wishing, from the melancholy circum­
               <lb/>stance of its birth, that it had been a boy,
               <lb/>as it would be shielded from many dan­
               <lb/>gers that await a female, and more easily

               <lb/>provided for. But her sister was well, and
               <lb/>that consideration consoled her mind, and
               <lb/>would not suffer her to feel a regret on
               <lb/>any other subject. On the following even­
               <lb/>ing she returned to <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, to commu­
               <lb/>nicate the good news to her brother, and
               <lb/>consult with him, as it was necessary to
               <lb/>procure a confidential person to take the
               <lb/>charge immediately of her sister's infant.
               <lb/><persName>Felix</persName> was much pleased to hear that all
               <lb/>their anxiety respecting <persName>Jane's</persName> health was

               <lb/>him that <persName>dame Brownson</persName> would be an ex­
               <lb/>cellent person, she thought, to have the
               <lb/>care of the child, as she was a good wo­
               <lb/>man, he was quite delighted with the
               <lb/>idea, and proposed a walk to her cottage
               <lb/>the next morning.

               <lb/>child, and she resolved to apply to her.
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> continued, that it was not to occa­
               <lb/>sion her any additional fatigue, as she
               <lb/>would pay for the dame's keeping another

               <lb/>maid, besides the girl who now managed
               <lb/>the dairy, and did the household work; it
               <lb/>would be therefore an amusement for her
               <lb/>to superintend the management of the
               <lb/>infant.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Dame Brownson</persName> said she should have
               <lb/>been happy to oblige her, even if what she
               <lb/>proposed had not been agreeable; but she
               <lb/>assured her she was delighted at the
               <lb/>thought of having the little babe; it would
               <lb/>be an entertainment, and pass away many
               <lb/>a dull hour. Her master (meaning her
               <lb/>husband) was very fond of those young
               <lb/>things: when they had children of their
               <lb/>own, he was always playing with them;
               <lb/>but now they were all dead and gone long
               <lb/>ago, or she might have had a grandchild
               <lb/>to dandle on her knee; and she wiped a
               <lb/>tear from her aged eyes as she spoke.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Felix</persName> and <persName>Rose</persName> respected her sorrows,
               <lb/>as they reflected it must be heart-break­
               <lb/>ing, after the trouble, expence, and anx­
               <lb/>iety of rearing children, to be deprived of
               <lb/>them, and childless, when the ravages of

               <lb/>time have made them require their affec­
               <lb/>tion and support to soften their declining
               <lb/>years. <persName>Rose</persName> agreed to bring or send the
               <lb/>infant to her in a few days, and felt her
               <lb/>mind quite relieved at having arranged
               <lb/>the reception of the infant to her satisfac­
               <lb/>tion, where she knew the greatest atten­
               <lb/>tion would be paid to its infantine wants.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Felix</persName> rode every other day to inquire
               <lb/>after <persName>Jane</persName>, who continued exceedingly
               <lb/>well; it was the balm of sisterly kindness,
               <lb/>and unbosoming herself to her, that sooth­
               <lb/>ed the acute miseries that had oppressed
               <lb/>her heart, and threatened her existence.
               <lb/>All this period <persName>Rose</persName> enjoyed not only the
               <lb/>sweet reflection of having by humanity
               <lb/>and tenderness saved her sister's life, and
               <lb/>acted with the strictest principle towards
               <lb/>her, but the pure and blissful happiness
               <lb/>of receiving daily the most pleasing and
               <lb/>affectionate letters from <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>. She
               <lb/>relied with implicit faith on his attach­
               <lb/>ment; and the felicity of being beloved by

               <lb/>men, would have fully compensated, she
               <lb/>thought, for years of anguish.
            </p>
            <p>By this frequent and interesting inter­
               <lb/>change of their sentiments, which was flat­
               <lb/>tering to their love and wishes, they soften­
               <lb/>ed the tediousness of absence, as they were
               <lb/>not to meet till <persName>Rose</persName> had placed her sis­
               <lb/>ter's child in the hands of <persName>dame Brownson</persName>.
               <lb/>On the morning appointed, <persName>Rose</persName> drove to
               <lb/><placeName>Hemeridge Cottage</placeName> in a postchaise, to
               <lb/>fetch the infant, and was much affected at
               <lb/>perceiving that <persName>Jane</persName> poignantly suffered
               <lb/>the severest pain at parting from her child.
               <lb/>Though it wounded <persName>Rose</persName> to witness her
               <lb/>affliction, she was gratified at discovering
               <lb/>she possessed so much affection and feel­
               <lb/>ing. <persName>Rose</persName> endeavoured to console and
               <lb/>reconcile her to this separation, by observ­
               <lb/>ing what a pleasant walk it would be for
               <lb/>them to <persName>dame Brownson's</persName> cottage, and
               <lb/>how gratifying it would be to watch the
               <lb/>little infant's improvement. Sometimes
               <lb/>she should request the dame to bring it to
               <lb/>them, and it would be so pleasant to have
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">it</mw>

               <milestone unit="sig" n="K12r"/>
               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">215</mw>
               <lb/>it for a whole day! <persName>Rose</persName> perceived the
               <lb/>tear of maternal regard glisten in her sis­
               <lb/>ter's eye as she spoke, and warmly entreat­
               <lb/>ed <persName>Jane</persName> to set off for <placeName>Treharne</placeName> as soon as
               <lb/>she was well enough to undertake the jour­
               <lb/>ney, as she was fearful it would not be in
               <lb/>her power to visit her again.
            </p>
            <p>The innocent babe was now placed in
               <lb/>the arms of <persName>Rose</persName>, who kissed it with af­
               <lb/>fectionate regard; more attached to the
               <lb/>child from the misfortune of its birth, she
               <lb/>resolved that the tenderest care should be
               <lb/>taken of it. It slept soundly during the
               <lb/>journey from <placeName>Hemeridge</placeName> to the dame's re­
               <lb/>sidence, and when she reached her clean
               <lb/>and pleasant abode, she resigned the in­
               <lb/>fant with confidence to her care.
            </p>
            <p>The only abatement to the happiness <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>experienced at this period, was the length­
               <lb/>ened absence of her valued parents; had
               <lb/>they been restored to her, she would have
               <lb/>tasted the most exquisite felicity. Her
               <lb/>brother, that she tenderly loved, was with
               <lb/>her; she expected soon to enjoy the society

               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">216</mw>
               <lb/>of her sister, much improved by adversity;
               <lb/>and the man she would have chosen from
               <lb/>a thousand others, superior in fortune, she
               <lb/>was shortly to have the delight of seeing.
               <lb/>That he was deserving her attachment,
               <lb/>who loved her with the truest tenderness,
               <lb/>was a sweet, a delightful reflection. In
               <lb/>goodness and every excellence that enno­
               <lb/>bles the human heart, his character shone
               <lb/>conspicuously; securely could she confide
               <lb/>in him, who preferred her prosperity and
               <lb/>tranquillity to his own, so truly did he
               <lb/>love her.
            </p>
            <p>To her friend <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> she had dis­
               <lb/>closed in confidence every thing that had
               <lb/>lately passed relative to her sister, as she
               <lb/>was acquainted with the commencement
               <lb/>of this unfortunate affair. <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> quite
               <lb/>approved her conduct and management
               <lb/>respecting the infant, and said she should
               <lb/>herself sometimes go and see it. To re­
               <lb/>ceive her approbation was infinitely flat­
               <lb/>tering, as she esteemed and admired her
               <lb/>mother's worthy old friend. But emotions

               <lb/>of a different description now agitated the
               <lb/>affectionate bosom of <persName>Rose Douglas</persName>. The
               <lb/>moment appointed by <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> in his
               <lb/>last letter for their interview approached;
               <lb/>her heart palpitated with mingled sensa­
               <lb/>tions of pleasure and confusion, at the pro­
               <lb/>spect of her expected happiness.
            </p>
            <p>The fine bloom that usually glowed in
               <lb/>the cheeks of <persName>Rose</persName>, when sorrow had not
               <lb/>stolen it away, was not a little heightened
               <lb/>when <persName>sir Eglamour's</persName> curricle appeared in
               <lb/>sight, driven by his footman. It stopped
               <lb/>opposite the mansion, and from the draw­
               <lb/>ing-room window, where she was stand­
               <lb/>ing, she observed with satisfaction, that he
               <lb/>did not get out with that languor and
               <lb/>feeble manner which she had remarked
               <lb/>with concern when he left <placeName>Treharne</placeName>. He
               <lb/>caught her gazing at him, and nodded
               <lb/>and smiled with a happy animated ex­
               <lb/>pression.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Sir Eglamour</persName> was much improved in
               <lb/>his looks since they last met: he was al­
               <lb/>ways handsome and engaging, even when

               <lb/>indisposed, but returning health added to
               <lb/>his personal attractions, and made him
               <lb/>more impressively captivating. Their mu­
               <lb/>tual felicity seemed to irradiate their coun­
               <lb/>tenances, and made them appear more
               <lb/>lovely than ever. Seldom did a form so
               <lb/>graceful and handsome as <persName>sir Eglamour's</persName>
               <lb/>meet the sight, or such a beautiful elegant
               <lb/>girl as <persName>Rose</persName> charm the admiring eye.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Sir Eglamour</persName> assured her that he had
               <lb/>impatiently anticipated this blissful mo­
               <lb/>ment: had he been pre-engaged when he
               <lb/>first knew her, and not allowed to love,
               <lb/>the kind attentions he had received, her
               <lb/>politeness and pleasing manners, would
               <lb/>have spoilt him for enduring to live
               <lb/>alone. To call it living, was wrong—
               <lb/>breathing only, he would allow it was—a
               <lb/>mere respiration, and nothing more. The
               <lb/>day after he had parted from her he knew
               <lb/>not how to describe—in a word, it was <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="fr">en­
               <lb/>nui</foreign> from morning till night.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Sir Eglamour</persName> then alluded to their fu­
               <lb/>ture union, and mentioned his fervent

               <lb/>wishes to be soon allowed, by the dearest
               <lb/>and nearest of all ties, to be enabled to
               <lb/>constantly watch over her happiness.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> replied, that she should be very
               <lb/>reluctant for that event to take place, un­
               <lb/>less it was sanctioned by the presence of
               <lb/>either her father or mother. It was suffi­
               <lb/>cient for her merely to hint at the disposi­
               <lb/>tion of her mind and inclinations, for him
               <lb/>to assent to whatever she chose to dictate,
               <lb/>who he judged could never err; no
               <lb/>one, he affirmed, in the language of sin­
               <lb/>cerity, was more desirous to promote her
               <lb/>views of happiness and prosperity, and the
               <lb/>certainty of effecting her felicity would
               <lb/>give him heartfelt delight. It was true,
               <lb/>he added, that his friendship and love ap­
               <lb/>peared to be yet in embryo, but he hoped,
               <lb/>that with lengthened days his wishes
               <lb/>would put forth white blossoms, and yield
               <lb/>delicious fruit. <said>You smile at my flowery
               <lb/>description just now, and that is what I

            <p>Thus, in expressions of tender and sin­
               <lb/>cere attachment on the part of <persName>sir Egla­
               <lb/>mour</persName>, and in confiding truth and real af­
               <lb/>fectionate sentiments, breathed by the in­

               <lb/>in pure and unalterable bliss; they sepa­

               <lb/>ting quality, that rendered their regard in­

                  <lb/>quit <placeName>Hemeridge Cottage</placeName>, she wrote a let­
                  <lb/>ter to <persName>colonel Guilford</persName> previous to her de­
                  <lb/>parture. In this letter she informed him
                  <lb/>of the discovery <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> had grossly
                  <lb/>made of the cruel deception that had been
                  <lb/>practised to ruin her peace for ever. To
                  <lb/>see him any more, was not consistent,
                  <lb/>she said, with her ideas of rectitude; he

                  <lb/>would be surprised to hear her say this,
                  <lb/>who had acted giddily and with impru­
                  <lb/>dence, but the moral precepts inculcated
                  <lb/>from her earliest youth had not been for­
                  <lb/>gotten. She might be thoughtless, but
                  <lb/>never willingly would she be criminal, and
                  <lb/>the most distant thought of continuing to
                  <lb/>reside with a married man thrilled her
                  <lb/>mind with unspeakable horror. She had
                  <lb/>been heedless, unsteady, and violent, but
                  <lb/>her severe misfortunes, she hoped, would
                  <lb/>correct her errors. Though she would not
                  <lb/>reproach him, she wished that the intelli­
                  <lb/>gence of his having another wife had been
                  <lb/>imparted to her in a manner less insolent
                  <lb/>and disgusting than the indelicate method
                  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName> took to undeceive her. The
                  <lb/>only favour she now requested was, that
                  <lb/>he would allow her an annual sum for the
                  <lb/>support of her child. If he conducted
                  <lb/>himself with liberality in this respect, she
                  <lb/>should never evince any resentment, but
                  <lb/>let all that had passed between them be
                  <lb/>buried in oblivion; she would try to for­

                  <lb/>get that she had considered herself as a
                  <lb/>married woman, and hoped that very few
                  <lb/>persons would be acquainted with that
                  <lb/>unfortunate circumstance.

               <p>Having sent off this letter, and arranged
                  <lb/>every thing for her little journey, she en­
                  <lb/>tered the postchaise, and in two hours and
                  <lb/>a half arrived at the paternal mansion, from
                  <lb/>which she had voluntarily banished her­
                  <lb/>self, and been ever since a stranger to tran­
                  <lb/>quillity. <persName>Rose</persName> received her with a cheer­
                  <lb/>ful and animated face, expressive of plea­
                  <lb/>sure, and <persName>Kamira</persName> jumped and danced

                  <lb/>like sunbeams on the water; he tall as the

                  <lb/>your sister, very good, very sweet indeed
                  <lb/>—you must see him soon.</said>
               </p>
               <p><persName>Jane</persName> smiled at this rhapsody of <persName>Kami­
                  <lb/>ra's</persName>; she looked at <persName>Rose</persName>, not having heard
                  <lb/>her mention this new lover, and her blushes
                  <lb/>confirmed the truth of what <persName>Kamira</persName> had
                  <lb/>said. <persName>Rose</persName> now conducted her to a small
                  <lb/>room, which she had fitted up for her when
                  <lb/>she wrote word she was coming, and wish­
                  <lb/>ed to be quite retired and not see any com­
                  <lb/>pany. It commanded a delightful view,
                  <lb/>and was more comfortable, from being
                  <lb/>comparatively small to the other large,
                  <lb/>lofty, old-fashioned apartments. <persName>Jane</persName> was
                  <lb/>much pleased with her sister's attention,
                  <lb/>and rallied her on the new admirer <persName>Kami­
                  <lb/>ra</persName> had talked of, observing that she was
                  <lb/>rejoiced another lover had succeeded in
                  <lb/>making her forget the unworthy <persName>Courte­
                  <lb/>nay</persName>.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Rose</persName> now related to her without dis­
                  <lb/>guise the disagreeable event that had in­
                  <lb/>troduced <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> to her, which had

                  <lb/>fortunately terminated well, and his sub­
                  <lb/>sequent attachment to her, which she had
                  <lb/>encouraged, from knowing him to be the
                  <lb/>most estimable of men. She likewise so­
                  <lb/>licited <persName>Jane</persName> to allow him to see her, and
                  <lb/>consider her as a friend; his society would
                  <lb/>amuse, as she intended, under the plea of
                  <lb/>ill-health, to excuse herself from receiving
                  <lb/>any visitors but <persName>Mrs. Fane</persName>.
               </p>
               <p>Though <persName>Jane</persName> persisted in being se­
                  <lb/>cluded from society, <persName>Rose</persName> at length per­
                  <lb/>suaded her to suffer <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> to be
                  <lb/>admitted to her retirement, as she wished
                  <lb/>him to entertain a friendship for her sister.
                  <lb/>As <persName>Jane</persName> viewed him with interest, she
                  <lb/>could not do otherwise than own, that in
                  <lb/>this instance <persName>Rose</persName> had displayed exquisite
                  <lb/>taste and discernment. The striking at­
                  <lb/>traction of his fine person, his mental en­
                  <lb/>dowments, and winning manners, quite en­
                  <lb/>chanted her.

               <p><persName>Felix</persName> informed them that he had seen

                  <lb/>mour</persName>, from several distinguished military
                  <lb/>men, was, that he possessed boldness and
                  <lb/>intrepidity in the greatest dangers; to
                  <lb/>this he joined an invincible patience and
                  <lb/>firmness in supporting excessive fatigue,
                  <lb/>and a settled resolution to die sword in
                  <lb/>hand, rather than be vanquished, as his
                  <lb/>constancy and bravery in battle surpassed
                  <lb/>the courage of most men. To hear the
                  <lb/>praise of the man she loved, and which he
                  <lb/>justly merited, was music to the ear of
                  <lb/><persName>Rose</persName>, who could listen for hours to
                  <lb/>her brother, when he spoke of him.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Sir Eglamour</persName> traced, in the emaciated
                  <lb/>form and faded face of <persName>Jane Douglas</persName>, the
                  <lb/>evident remains of beauty. He thought
                  <lb/>she must have been very lovely before
                  <lb/>illness had impaired her charms, and dim­
                  <lb/>med their lustre. Yet handsome, as he
                  <lb/>imagined she formerly was, she did not
                  <lb/>appear to him to have ever been so beau­
                  <lb/>tiful and engaging as his gentle <persName>Rose</persName>. He
                  <lb/>felt convinced, that if indisposition was to
                  <lb/>reduce her to a shadow of her former self,

                  <lb/>the goodness that beamed in her expres­
                  <lb/>sive countenance, and the knowledge of
                  <lb/>her excellent disposition, would always en­
                  <lb/>dear her to him.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Jane</persName> did not envy her sister's happiness,
                  <lb/>but reproached herself for having lost all
                  <lb/>hope of being truly valued by a worthy
                  <lb/>character, when she witnessed the sincere
                  <lb/>looks, and ardent expressions of pure and
                  <lb/>real love that passed between <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>
                  <lb/>and <persName>Rose</persName>. These lovers seemed only to
                  <lb/>breathe for each other; every object and
                  <lb/>scene was pleasing to them, because view­
                  <lb/>ed through the perspective glass of ge­
                  <lb/>nuine love, which embellishes the dullest
                  <lb/>prospect, the most insipid company.
               </p>
               <p>When <persName>Jane</persName> was alone in her retreat, she
                  <lb/>would exclaim with bitter agony—<said>Had I
                  <lb/>not imprudently sacrificed myself, I might
                  <lb/>have been happy, like my sister, with some
                  <lb/>amiable man who truly loved me, and not
                  <lb/>the deserted wretched dupe of a dissolute
                  <lb/>libertine, and, what is still more afflicting,
                  <lb/>a married man. Alas! how shall I have

                  <lb/>courage to meet my father and mother?
                  <lb/>Though they are strangers to my folly,
                  <lb/>yet the consciousness of my weakness will
                  <lb/>make me tremble before them.</said>
               </p>
               <p>Thus constantly blaming herself, and
                  <lb/>nourishing her grief in solitude, which
                  <lb/>made her dejected and unhappy, her health
                  <lb/>became gradually undermined. She never
                  <lb/>walked out, except to <persName>dame Brownson's</persName>
                  <lb/>cottage, to visit her child, which only
                  <lb/>made her more miserable, as she dared not
                  <lb/>indulge her wish to caress it, with all the
                  <lb/>ardour she secretly felt. The good dame
                  <lb/>was thunderstruck at perceiving such an
                  <lb/>alteration in the lively <persName>Miss Jane</persName>, who was
                  <lb/>grown quite serious, and shaking her head,
                  <lb/>observed that she did not like to see such
                  <lb/>a change in a young person; it seemed as
                  <lb/>if they had been crossed in love, and she
                  <lb/>hoped no false-hearted gentleman had been
                  <lb/>deceiving her.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Rose</persName> evaded the subject, by saying it
                  <lb/>was a dangerous illness that had caused
                  <lb/>her sister to be so different from what she
                  <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">used</mw>
                  <pb/>

                  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">229</mw>
                  <lb/>used to be, and that her spirits would re­
                  <lb/>vive when her health was restored.
               </p>
            <p>This explanation appeared very natural,
               <lb/>as she was grown exceedingly thin, and a
               <lb/>hollow cough shook her wasted frame.
               <lb/>The dame sometimes brought the infant
               <lb/>to <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, and remained with it the
               <lb/>whole day; then did <persName>Jane</persName> enjoy all the
               <lb/>luxury of woe: shut up with it in her so­
               <lb/>litary apartment, she desired her sister not
               <lb/>to interrupt her, that she might enjoy the
               <lb/>pleasure of caressing and playing with her
               <lb/>infant undisturbedly. <persName>Rose</persName> indulged her,
               <lb/>and respecting her maternal affection, was
               <lb/>careful she should not be molested; but
               <lb/>had she known that while she fondled the
               <lb/>innocent creature, she wept bitterly, and
               <lb/>bathed its cherub face with her tears, she
               <lb/>would not have suffered her to be unin­
               <lb/>terrupted. When the baby slept, she con­
               <lb/>tinued to lament over it, almost in a state

               <lb/>ful consolation, if she knew the emotion it
               <lb/>created.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Fane</persName> had left the country soon
               <lb/>after <persName>Jane's</persName> return, on a visit to one of her
               <lb/>children in <placeName>London</placeName>. Had she seen her
               <lb/>thus gradually wasting, she would have
               <lb/>pointed out to her brother and sister the
               <lb/>alarming alteration, who from being with
               <lb/>her constantly, did not perceive the melan­
               <lb/>choly change. The return of <persName>Felix</persName> to <placeName>Tre­
               <lb/>harne</placeName> had restored it to part of its usual
               <lb/>gaiety, though not quite so cheerful as
               <lb/>when the general and his lady were there,
               <lb/>and <persName>Jane</persName> formed one of the party. To all
               <lb/>inquiries respecting her, the answer was,
               <lb/>that she had been for some time indisposed,
               <lb/>and continued quite an invalid.
            </p>
            <p>The <name>Morrington</name> family were returned,
               <lb/>and brought down with them, on another
               <lb/>visit, the <persName>count de Fontenai</persName>. <persName>Felix</persName> called
               <lb/>on <persName>lord Morrington</persName>, and was introduced
               <lb/>to the count, who visited <placeName>Treharne</placeName> a few
               <lb/>days afterwards. He was apparently much
               <lb/>disappointed at not seeing <persName>Miss Jane</persName>, and

               <lb/>anxiously inquired of <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> after
               <lb/>her health. When he was informed she
               <lb/>was ill, he evinced a sensibility that pleased
               <lb/>and interested her, which made <persName>Rose</persName> sus­
               <lb/>pect that he actually felt a real attachment
               <lb/>to her sister. From this observation, she
               <lb/>was determined to do all in her power,
               <lb/>when <persName>Jane</persName> was a little recovered, to per­
               <lb/>suade her to have an interview with <persName>De
               <lb/>Fontenai</persName>, and give him encouragement,
               <lb/>as he was a man of superior rank and for­
               <lb/>tune; and from the feeling he displayed, it
               <lb/>was evident his heart was not defective.
            </p>
            <p>The count was not deficient in under­
               <lb/>standing, though guilty of many follies,
               <lb/>and foppish, as most young <name>Frenchmen</name>
               <lb/>are, from their extreme vivacity, and are
               <lb/>rarely the least rational till more than
               <lb/>thirty. <persName>Rose</persName> expressed to <persName>Jane</persName> the good
               <lb/>opinion she entertained of him, and her
               <lb/>suspicion of his ardent regard for her.
               <lb/>From the favourable manner in which she
               <lb/>listened to the encomiums bestowed on the
               <lb/>count, <persName>Rose</persName> hoped that in time she might

               <lb/>be persuaded to see him; if he truly loved
               <lb/>her, she imagined that he would not be
               <lb/>the less attached, when informed of her
               <lb/>having been deceived by a false marriage,
               <lb/>as her ideas were too noble and correct to
               <lb/>think of practising any deception, should
               <lb/>he make <persName>Jane</persName> a regular offer of his hand.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> now informed her sister, that she
               <lb/>had observed, ever since <persName>lady Morrington's</persName>
               <lb/>return, the figure of a gentleman, whose
               <lb/>form resembled the count's, walking every
               <lb/>day near the Hall, and looking all over it,
               <lb/>as if he wished to catch a glance of some
               <lb/>person; and from what <persName>Rose</persName> had just men­
               <lb/>tioned, she thought it was indeed <persName>De Fon­
               <lb/>tenai</persName>, who walked by with the hope of
               <lb/>seeing her by chance at the window.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Miss Wizzle</persName> and her worthy brother

               <lb/>ther chained by the leg to the apotheca­

               <lb/>not pretend to do all these gentlemen talk
               <lb/>of; I must leave it wholly to your brother
               <lb/><persName>Mars</persName> to accomplish with <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>
               <lb/>our ardent desires. They have full liberty

               <lb/>rural entertainment <persName>lord Morrington</persName> in­
               <lb/>tended to give the following week. <persName>Felix</persName>
               <lb/>and his sisters were invited, but <persName>Rose</persName> de­
               <lb/>clined going, as her sister was ill; yet <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>and herself persuaded their brother to be of
               <lb/>the party, as his pleasures and enjoyments
               <lb/>were a source of gratification to them.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Sir Henry Arundel</persName> was now a frequent
               <lb/>visitor. He always admired <persName>Miss Douglas</persName>,
               <lb/>and thinking she was disengaged, allowed
               <lb/>his passion and admiration for her to im­
               <lb/>perceptibly increase: it was nourished by
               <lb/>continual interviews, which he obtained
               <lb/>under the pretext of visiting her brother,
               <lb/>to whom he was very attentive. <persName>Rose</persName> was
               <lb/>delighted to perceive his growing friend­
               <lb/>ship for <persName>Felix</persName>, knowing that he might be
               <lb/>of service in procuring promotion in the
               <lb/>army for her brother, as his connexions
               <lb/>were high in rank, and had great interest
               <lb/>with persons who could serve him.

            <p>The increasing indisposition of <persName>Jane</persName>
               <lb/>daily grew more evident, and became at
               <lb/>length perceptible to her brother and sis­

               <lb/>ter. It poisoned the happiness <persName>Rose</persName> would
               <lb/>otherwise have enjoyed, as a letter received
               <lb/>from her mother for the first time created
               <lb/>a hope of her and her father's speedy re­
               <lb/>turn. At the period of her writing, <persName>sir
               <lb/>James</persName> was taken more alarmingly and
               <lb/>dangerously ill. <persName>Jane</persName> had never received
               <lb/>any answer to the letter which she had
               <lb/>written to <persName>colonel Guilford</persName>, and this cir­
               <lb/>cumstance both surprised and afflicted her.
               <lb/>Her sister had proposed devoting half of
               <lb/>the sum allowed them yearly by the ge­
               <lb/>neral for their clothes and pocket-money,
               <lb/>to the support of the child, which joined
               <lb/>together, would be sufficient for its main­
               <lb/>tenance while an infant; yet she could not
               <lb/>endure the reflection of depriving <persName>Rose</persName> of
               <lb/>the money she required to appear as a lady,
               <lb/>though she had assured her, that with strict
               <lb/>economy she could manage extremely
               <lb/>well. From <persName>Guilford's</persName> continued silence,
               <lb/><persName>Jane</persName> concluded that, tired of her, he was
               <lb/>glad to get rid of an expensive encum­
               <lb/>brance, and this cruel thought, by increas­

               <lb/>ing her indisposition, slowly injured her
               <lb/>constitution.

            <p>The little babe had been christened and
               <lb/>named <persName>Caroline</persName>, after their mother. <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>had it more frequently brought to <placeName>Tre­
               <lb/>harne</placeName>, with the hope of gratifying and
               <lb/>amusing her sister, not suspecting that the
               <lb/>sight of it added to her anguish. It daily
               <lb/>improved in health and beauty, being care­
               <lb/>fully nursed, under the watchful eye of
               <lb/><persName>dame Brownson</persName>, who doted on it, as well
               <lb/>as the honest miller, her husband. <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>grew every day more attached to the in­
               <lb/>fant, and parted from it with reluctance.
               <lb/>It was a perfect model of infantine loveli­
               <lb/>ness, and so good-tempered, that it scarce­
               <lb/>ly ever cried. <persName>Rose</persName> sketched a little draw­
               <lb/>ing of it, which she gave to <persName>Jane</persName>, who
               <lb/>said, as she received it—<said>I wish I had
               <lb/>died at her age; then I should have been

               <lb/>she replied, <said>that you did not die at <persName>Ca­

            </p>
            <p><persName>Sir Eglamour</persName>, who was very fond of
               <lb/>children, tossed and danced it about conti­
               <lb/>nually, being particularly interested for the
               <lb/>pretty <persName>Caroline</persName>, as he understood it was
               <lb/>the orphan child of a friend that <persName>Rose</persName> va­
               <lb/>lued. He was quite enlivened, when the
               <lb/>intelligence of the general and his lady's
               <lb/>expectation of soon returning was commu­
               <lb/>nicated to him; it inspired the sweet
               <lb/>hope that he would soon have it in his
               <lb/>power to call his lovely friend his own.
               <lb/>With the anxiety of a mind truly attach­
               <lb/>ed, he was apprehensive that if their mar­
               <lb/>riage did not speedily take place, some un­
               <lb/>foreseen event might deprive him of the
               <lb/>dear object of his faithful regard. If the
               <lb/>battalion of his regiment to which he be­
               <lb/>longed should unexpectedly be ordered
               <lb/>abroad, he trembled to leave her, unless
               <lb/>their fates were united. He beheld her
               <lb/>admired and loved, even by those of the

               <lb/>highest rank and fortune, which made him
               <lb/>miserable, till she was irrevocably his.
               <lb/>Devoid of vanity, he was not conscious
               <lb/>that all those who caused him an uneasy
               <lb/>moment were considerably inferior to him
               <lb/>in every respect, and that he had no cause
               <lb/>to doubt her fidelity, who considered him
               <lb/>superior to the whole world, and whose
               <lb/>faith the greatest temptations could not
               <lb/>shake or alter.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Sir Eglamour</persName> had lately been deprived
               <lb/>of the felicity of seeing her as often as he
               <lb/>wished, from being engaged on a trouble­
               <lb/>some and disagreeable duty. Very great
               <lb/>depredations had been committed in the
               <lb/>neighbourhood, and by the sea-side; houses
               <lb/>and cottages had been plundered, and se­
               <lb/>veral travellers robbed and wounded. Sus­
               <lb/>picion was directed to a gang of smugglers,
               <lb/>that had infested the sea-shore and adja­
               <lb/>cent places for many years. <persName>Sir Eglamour</persName>
               <lb/>and his soldiers were employed in watch­
               <lb/>ing and scouring the country for some
               <lb/>miles round, in search of them. Not one

               <lb/>of them had ever been apprehended, and
               <lb/>the party which <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> commanded
               <lb/>was ordered to be augmented by govern­
               <lb/>ment, and to be active in their exertions
               <lb/>to discover the haunts and retreat of these
               <lb/>desperate marauders.
            </p>
            <p>These smugglers were reckoned the
               <lb/>most vigilant and daring band that had
               <lb/>ever been known. It was reported that
               <lb/>they were so ferocious and sanguinary,
               <lb/>that not one of them would be taken with­
               <lb/>out a furious resistance, which made <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>very unhappy, fearful any accident might
               <lb/>happen to her lover, as the wretches lay in
               <lb/>ambush, and fired, without being found
               <lb/>out, very frequently at the soldiers.
            </p>
            <p>One day, when <persName>Felix</persName> was absent at
               <lb/><placeName>Morrington Castle</placeName>, and <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> en­
               <lb/>gaged in this perilous duty, which had de­
               <lb/>tained him from her for some time, <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>was conversing with <persName>Jane</persName>, in her retired
               <lb/>apartment, in nearly as melancholy a mood
               <lb/>as herself. It is true, she heard every day

               <lb/>few hurried lines, that poorly compensated
               <lb/>for the loss of his beloved and captivating
               <lb/>society, and did not reconcile her to the
               <lb/>dangers he was likely to encounter.
            </p>
            <p>Their gloomy conversation was inter­
               <lb/>rupted by <persName>Kamira</persName>, who gave <persName>Miss Doug­
               <lb/>las</persName> a note, saying, the gentleman who de­
               <lb/>livered it waited in the library for an an­
               <lb/>swer. Imagine her astonishment, when
               <lb/>she perused the note, to find it was from
               <lb/><persName>colonel Guilford</persName>, who said he wished to
               <lb/>have the honour of speaking to her, as he
               <lb/>was afraid, if he had asked incautiously for
               <lb/>her sister first, it would have alarmed her,
               <lb/>as he understood, with sorrow, that she
               <lb/>was not in good health. As <persName>Rose</persName> perused
               <lb/>this, she felt indescribable horror at the
               <lb/>idea of beholding the man who had been
               <lb/>the cause of <persName>Jane's</persName> severe sufferings, and
               <lb/>perhaps eventually her destroyer. Very
               <lb/>reluctantly she arose to go and meet him.
               <lb/>Absorbed in her own melancholy reflec­
               <lb/>tions, <persName>Jane</persName> did not notice her sister's trepi­

               <lb/>dation, who, with slow and reluctant steps,
               <lb/>reached the library.
            </p>
            <p>Here she found a person, apparently in
               <lb/>the meridian of life, neither handsome or
               <lb/>ugly, who had a gentlemanly air. He
               <lb/>apologized politely for intruding, after the
               <lb/>deception he had been guilty of, which he
               <lb/>knew was exceedingly reprehensible; but
               <lb/>he hoped she would allow (after an expla­
               <lb/>nation) that he was not so much to blame
               <lb/>as she had probably hitherto thought.
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> begged him to be seated, saying, she
               <lb/>should be happy to hear any justifiable ex­
               <lb/>tenuation of a conduct that she feared
               <lb/>would prove fatal to her sister; and as she
               <lb/>pronounced these words, she could not re­
               <lb/>frain from shedding involuntary tears,
               <lb/>overcome with excessive depression at see­
               <lb/>ing the man who had irreparably injured
               <lb/>poor <persName>Jane</persName>, and entailed affliction on herself
               <lb/>and family.
            </p>
            <p>He changed countenance, and betrayed

               <lb/>was affected, and faltered out, that it would
               <lb/>agonize him to hear that her sister's life
               <lb/>was endangered. <persName>Rose</persName> sighed, and said
               <lb/>she hoped not, though she could not re­
               <lb/>press the acuteness of her feelings when
               <lb/>she beheld a striking alteration for the
               <lb/>worse every day.

            <p><said>For Heaven's sake let me go to her!</said>
               <lb/>he exclaimed. <said>Perhaps, when she learns
               <lb/>I repent that I have ruined her peace, she
               <lb/>may forgive me, and it may sooth her to
               <lb/>think I am not so black a villain as I have
               <lb/>appeared.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> secretly flattered herself, that an
               <lb/>interview with him might be advantageous
               <lb/>to <persName>Jane</persName>, recollecting that she had pined
               <lb/>and mourned, not only for having been
               <lb/>ungenerously deceived, but at his cruel and
               <lb/>unfeeling neglect of her and his child.
               <lb/>Though she detested the sight of this per­
               <lb/>fidious man, <persName>Rose</persName> desired <persName>colonel Guilford</persName>
               <lb/>to remain in the library till she sent for

               <lb/>by gentle degrees communicated who was
               <lb/>in the house, and wished to see her. In

               <lb/>hysteric fits shook her fragile form; but
               <lb/>when she recovered, and her agitation was

            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> now dispatched <persName>Kamira</persName> for <persName>colo­
               <lb/>nel Guilford</persName>, and he was introduced in a
               <lb/>few minutes into the presence of the
               <lb/>young unfortunate creature he had bar­
               <lb/>barously injured. Her complexion was
               <lb/>transparent with illness; the blue veins
               <lb/>were distinctly seen in her white temples,
               <lb/>and the most beautiful hectic bloom tinted
               <lb/>her cheek—it was too brilliant for health;
               <lb/>and her large dark-blue eyes, where the
               <lb/>tear of sensibility still glistened, were like
               <lb/>violets glittering with the early dew of
               <lb/>morning.
            </p>
            <p>His frame shook with unutterable sen­
               <lb/>sations of remorse, at viewing the dread­

               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">249</mw>
               <lb/>ful change, that had occasioned an altera­
               <lb/>tion in her personal appearance that must
               <lb/>touch every feeling mind; and neither of
               <lb/>them could articulate for some minutes.
               <lb/>When he had recovered fortitude and re­
               <lb/>collection, he thus addressed her—<said>I ac­
               <lb/>knowledge my behaviour to you has been
               <lb/>very criminal; but I hope you will consi­
               <lb/>der it as some excuse, that when I was
               <lb/>very young, and quite a soldier of fortune,
               <lb/>I became thoughtlessly entangled with
               <lb/>some worthless brother-officers, who led
               <lb/>me into great dissipation and extravagance.
               <lb/>I was so deeply involved in debt, that I
               <lb/>married a woman of large fortune, much
               <lb/>older than myself, to extricate me from
               <lb/>these severe difficulties. We never lived
               <lb/>happily together, and have been separated
               <lb/>many years. Considering myself, for so
               <lb/>long a period, as a single man, I yielded
               <lb/>imprudently to the impression you made
               <lb/>on me; but I should never have imposed
               <lb/>a pretended marriage on you, had it not
               <lb/>been from the persuasions of <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>,

               <lb/>whom I liberally paid for her advice and
               <lb/>assistance in this guilty affair. It may be
               <lb/>truly observed, that when a woman is vi­
               <lb/>cious and unworthy, she conducts herself
               <lb/>with more depravity than the most aban­
               <lb/>doned man. I have known her a long
               <lb/>time as the mistress of a particular friend
               <lb/>of mine; and though she committed that
               <lb/>error, I really did not judge her with se­
               <lb/>verity, nor imagine she was so wicked.
               <lb/>It irritates me to madness, to reflect that
               <lb/>she had dared to so grossly insult you.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> now related to him every particu­
               <lb/>lar of <persName>Mrs. Pryce's</persName> insolence and vulgarity,
               <lb/>which she could not clearly and minutely
               <lb/>explain in a letter. This diffuse and
               <lb/>shocking detail of her brutality, which
               <lb/>might have been attended with more fatal
               <lb/>consequences in her then interesting situ­
               <lb/>ation, apparently overwhelmed him with
               <lb/>horror and grief. He assured <persName>Jane</persName>, while
               <lb/>he expressed his deep concern for what
               <lb/>had passed, that if he became a widower,
               <lb/>and she would deign to accept him, it

               <lb/>would be the whole study of his future
               <lb/>life to make her happy. He likewise, as
               <lb/>an excuse for his ill-temper and violence
               <lb/>when they resided together, confessed that
               <lb/>it proceeded from the gnawings of his con­
               <lb/>science, that constantly reproached him
               <lb/>for the base part he was acting, which
               <lb/>made him churlish and passionate, though
               <lb/>he was severely to be condemned for vent­
               <lb/>ing his discontent and irascible humour
               <lb/>on his innocent victim.
            </p>
            <p>To this penitent confession <persName>Jane</persName> made
               <lb/>no reply, but began talking of their in­
               <lb/>fant. <persName>Colonel Guilford</persName> said he should
               <lb/>very much like to see it, and <persName>Jane</persName> then
               <lb/>shewed him the picture <persName>Rose</persName> had painted
               <lb/>of <persName>Caroline</persName>. He was enraptured with the
               <lb/>infant beauty, and repeatedly kissed it,
               <lb/>entreating, as the greatest favour, that she
               <lb/>would make a copy of it for him. <persName>Miss
               <lb/>Douglas</persName> promised she would, and inform­
               <lb/>ed him where <persName>Caroline</persName> was at nurse, that
               <lb/>he might go and visit his child, as a rela­
               <lb/>tion of its deceased parents. He mention­
               <mw type="sig" rend="break(yes)align(center)">M6</mw>

               <lb/>ed also, that he should pay the dame for
               <lb/>the expence of the infant being under her
               <lb/>care, which relieved <persName>Jane</persName> from a great
               <lb/>deal of anxiety.
            </p>
            <p>After more interesting conversation, he
               <lb/>proposed, in the most pleasing and insi­
               <lb/>nuating manner, that <persName>Jane</persName> should return
               <lb/>to <placeName>Hemeridge Cottage</placeName>, as he thought the
               <lb/>change of air and scene would be of ser­
               <lb/>vice, in her critical state of health. She
               <lb/>could there, without any restraint, walk
               <lb/>about the garden and wood, nor fear be­
               <lb/>ing observed by any of her acquaintance,
               <lb/>and he would visit her daily, merely as a
               <lb/>friend, nothing more, as he should not feel
               <lb/>an hour's peace of mind till her health was
               <lb/>re-established. At <placeName>Hemeridge</placeName> he could
               <lb/>frequently take her out an airing in a car­
               <lb/>riage, and fetch little <persName>Caroline</persName> to entertain
               <lb/>her, which would contribute effectually,
               <lb/>he considered, to her complete recovery.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> was evidently inclined to comply
               <lb/>with this proposal of <persName>colonel Guilford's</persName>,
               <lb/>had not her sister looked expressively at

               <lb/>her, with a glance that evinced her disap­
               <lb/>probation. Then turning to <persName>Guilford</persName>,
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> thus addressed him—<said>I shall un­
               <lb/>doubtedly incur your displeasure for inter­
               <lb/>fering; but that I must risk, and entreat,
               <lb/>if you have the least attachment and re­
               <lb/>gard for my sister's happiness, to refrain
               <lb/>from persuading her to again place herself
               <lb/>under your protection. Your proposition
               <lb/>would ultimately lead to it; be friends,
               <lb/>therefore, at a distance, and do not entan­
               <lb/>gle yourselves in a situation that will only
               <lb/>end in misery. Should any change occur,
               <lb/>and you find yourself free, you will then
               <lb/>be at liberty to make amends for past mis­
               <lb/>conduct, and I shall feel delighted to ac­
               <lb/>knowledge you as a relation. I have a
               <lb/>right to disclose my sentiments, from hav­
               <lb/>ing been a severe sufferer in this unfortu­
               <lb/>nate affair, and from loving <persName>Jane</persName> sincerely.
               <lb/>This affection makes me solicitous to shield
               <lb/>her from additional misfortune, by not al­
               <lb/>lowing her, if possible, to commit a second
               <lb/>fault. The first error, caused by inexpe­

               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">254</mw>
               <lb/>rience and giddiness, is to be forgiven; but
               <lb/>if she errs again, wilfully and willingly, I
               <lb/>must disclaim her as a sister, and, however
               <lb/>painful, renounce her for ever.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Colonel Guilford</persName> calmly endured her
               <lb/>remonstrances, which she did not expect.
               <lb/>He knew that her observations were just,
               <lb/>and that it would be of little avail to op­
               <lb/>pose them at that moment, as <persName>Jane</persName> was
               <lb/>evidently inclined then to be governed by
               <lb/>her sister's opinion. He soon after took
               <lb/>an affectionate farewell of <persName>Jane</persName>, to the
               <lb/>great relief of <persName>Rose</persName>, who, though she had
               <lb/>summoned courage to address him, was
               <lb/>frightened mentally at what she had said.
               <lb/>She dreaded <persName>Guilford's</persName> anger; but her sis­
               <lb/>ter's virtue and peace were at stake—the
               <lb/>tranquillity and honour of the whole fa­
               <lb/>mily, and this gave her resolution, though
               <lb/>trembling, to brace the fury her spirited
               <lb/>behaviour might excite; but, fortunately,
               <lb/>his composure agreeably disappointed her.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> thanked her sister for having saved
               <lb/>her, by her sensible interposition, from

               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">255</mw>
               <lb/>greater evil than she had yet known, add­
               <lb/>ing, that if she had been persuaded by
               <lb/><persName>Guilford</persName> to act erroneously again, she
               <lb/>would have been guilty without an ex­
               <lb/>cuse, and erred with her eyes open. It
               <lb/>was mere want of thought, she observed,
               <lb/>that made her at first not object to his pro­
               <lb/>posal, which, on reflection, she considered
               <lb/>as exceedingly artful, and was intended,
               <lb/>she suspected, to plunge her into the abyss
               <lb/>of guilt, from which she had happily been
               <lb/>rescued. <persName>Jane</persName> concluded with saying,
               <lb/>that she wished always in future to be
               <lb/>guided by <persName>Rose</persName>, and was determined on
               <lb/>every occasion to consult her, as she should
               <lb/>ever distrust her own judgment. From
               <lb/>the period of her interview with <persName>Guilford</persName>,
               <lb/>her spirits daily grew better, though her
               <lb/>health continued very precarious, from the
               <lb/>shock her constitution had encountered.
               <lb/>It was a consolation to <persName>Jane</persName>, to discover
               <lb/>that she was not despised or neglected by
               <lb/>the man in whom she had placed unlimit­

               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">256</mw>
               <lb/>ed confidence, and that he resented and
               <lb/>abhorred the low brutality of <persName>Mrs. Pryce</persName>.
            </p>
            <p>The native gaiety that distinguished the
               <lb/>disposition of <persName>Rose</persName> was now restored and
               <lb/>exhilarated by the renewed cheerfulness
               <lb/>of her sister. She had persuaded <persName>Jane</persName> to
               <lb/>accompany her to the drawing-room, where
               <lb/>the windows commanded a view of who­
               <lb/>ever approached the house. No visitors
               <lb/>could enter without being ferried over,
               <lb/>and she would have time to retreat, if any
               <lb/>person called that she did not wish to see.
               <lb/><persName>Rose</persName> was conversing, with her usual
               <lb/>sprightliness, as she sat working at one of
               <lb/>the windows, till all at once she ceased
               <lb/>speaking. <persName>Jane</persName> asked her a question, to
               <lb/>which she did not reply, but starting up,
               <lb/>suddenly exclaimed—<said>He is come!</said> and
               <lb/>ran directly out of the room.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> approached the window to disco­
               <lb/>ver the cause of this agitation, and smiled
               <lb/>at perceiving <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> alight from his
               <lb/>horse, which was an explanation of her

               <lb/>precipitate departure and unexpected per­
               <lb/>turbation. That she might not interrupt
               <lb/>their felicity, <persName>Jane</persName> hastily retired, con­
               <lb/>scious that the presence of a third person
               <lb/>is gladly dispensed with, when two lovers
               <lb/>have been separated a long time—at least
               <lb/>what appears to them a tedious interval,
               <lb/>when they are sincerely attached. Two
               <lb/>hours she remained alone, without seeing
               <lb/>or hearing any thing of her sister. Tired
               <lb/>of reading and playing on her lute, she
               <lb/>began to wish for her company, as she was
               <lb/>seldom, when at home, so long absent, even
               <lb/>if engaged with the object of her most
               <lb/>tender affection.
            </p>
            <p>While these reflections occupied her
               <lb/>mind, she heard her sister's well-known
               <lb/>footsteps on the stairs. <persName>Rose</persName> entered—
               <lb/>but how changed! Vanished was the enli­
               <lb/>vened countenance, expressive of purest
               <lb/>happiness and vivacity; her blooming face
               <lb/>was white as the <rs type="properAdjective">Parian</rs> marble, and her

               <lb/>of enjoyment! My sister is destined to feel
               <lb/>they are indeed fleeting.</said> Instead of arti­
               <lb/>culating a single word, she threw herself
               <lb/>on the sofa, and wept anew; then sobbed
               <lb/>as if her heart would break.
            </p>
            <p><said>What is the cause of this sorrow?</said>
               <lb/>asked, <persName>Jane</persName>, who had never seen her so
               <lb/>suddenly and violently affected before.
            </p>
            <p><said>Oh, <persName>Jane</persName>! he's gone! he's torn from
               <lb/>me!—the best, the handsomest, the most
               <lb/>noble and affectionate of men!</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Whom do you mean?</said> replied <persName>Jane</persName>.
               <lb/><said>I am astonished to hear you, who have
               <lb/>talked so much about fortitude and resig­
               <lb/>nation, behave in this vehement incohe­
               <lb/>rent manner. You betray more weakness
               <lb/>than I could have imagined. This is but
               <lb/>a poor example for me: it is easy, I per­
               <lb/>ceive, to preach and give advice, when our
               <lb/>feelings are not concerned.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> spoke thus harshly, on purpose to
               <lb/>rouse her from her excessive grief. It
               <lb/>appeared to have an effect, for <persName>Rose</persName> im­
               <lb/>mediately dried her tears, and exclaimed,

               <lb/><said>Whom could I mean but <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>?
               <lb/>Do I love another?</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Once you did—you wept bitterly for
               <lb/><persName>Courtenay's</persName> loss.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Was he good, like him I am now at­
               <lb/>tached to?—would he have sacrificed any
               <lb/>thing for me?—No! but <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>
               <lb/>would devote his existence—would dis­
               <lb/>grace himself—would sacrifice his honour,
               <lb/>brave and virtuous as he is, to please me,
               <lb/>though his character, his integrity, are
               <lb/>dearer to him than life.</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> was delighted to think that, by an
               <lb/>appearance of ill-nature and severity, she
               <lb/>had dispelled the agonizing sensations of
               <lb/>anguish that overwhelmed her sister.
               <lb/>When she was restored to composure, she
               <lb/>confessed that the intelligence of <persName>sir Eg­
               <lb/>lamour's</persName> being ordered to embark with
               <lb/>his battalion for <placeName>Holland</placeName> in a few days
               <lb/>was the occasion of her frantic sorrow, as
               <lb/>she pictured to herself the dangers he
               <lb/>might have to encounter, which would
               <lb/>perhaps deprive her of him for ever. That

               <pb/>
               <milestone unit="sig" n="M10v"/>
               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">260</mw>
               <lb/>agonizing reflection made her nearly dis­
               <lb/>tracted. <persName>Rose</persName> added, that in the midst
               <lb/>of her grief <persName>Felix</persName> entered. Though he
               <lb/>scolded her very much for yielding to
               <lb/>sadness, and having so little resolution,
               <lb/>which made her unworthy to be a soldier's
               <lb/>wife, he kindly insisted that <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>
               <lb/>should reside at <placeName>Treharne</placeName> during the short
               <lb/>time he was to remain at <placeName>Exeter</placeName>, before
               <lb/>he set off on his intended expedition.
            </p>
            <p>In consequence of this invitation from
               <lb/><persName>Felix</persName>, <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> was gone to the city to
               <lb/>make the proper arrangements, and order
               <lb/>what was requisite. In the evening he was
               <lb/>to return to <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, where he would
               <lb/>continue till the morning he commenced
               <lb/>his march to the place of embarkation.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> concluded with observing, that
               <lb/>the kindness of <persName>Felix</persName> in inviting her
               <lb/>lover to their house was a balsam to her
               <lb/>wounded bosom.
            </p>
            <p>It was now that <persName>Jane</persName> assumed the
               <lb/>painful office of comforter to <persName>Rose</persName>, and
               <lb/>administered that soothing consolation

               <pb/>
               <milestone unit="sig" n="M11r"/>
               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">261</mw>
               <lb/>she had received from her in the moment
               <lb/>of distress. She mingled the tears of sym­
               <lb/>pathy with her when she wept the ap­
               <lb/>proaching loss of her beloved and excel­
               <lb/>lent <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>. <persName>Jane</persName> represented to
               <lb/>her that this expedition to the coast of
               <lb/><placeName>Holland</placeName>, in which <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> was en­
               <lb/>gaged, and ordered to embark with the
               <lb/>rest of the troops, would probably remain
               <lb/>there only two or three months. This
               <lb/>consoling suggestion, which inspired the
               <lb/>hope that he would soon be restored to
               <lb/>her, was the greatest relief to her affec­
               <lb/>tionate and ardent mind.
            </p>
            <p>Three days did <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> pass en­
               <lb/>tirely at <placeName>Treharne</placeName>. Too soon did those
               <lb/>delicious hours glide away like an en­
               <lb/>chanting dream, though shaded with sad
               <lb/>regret, when occasionally the recollection
               <lb/>obtruded in their moments of exquisite
               <lb/>happiness, that they were shortly to part.
               <lb/>While the lovers were together, it seemed
               <lb/>as if misfortune dared not approach them;
               <lb/>but on the morning of the fourth day,
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">when</mw>
               <pb/>
               <milestone unit="sig" n="M11v"/>
               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">262</mw>
               <lb/>when <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> was to quit her as
               <lb/>early as five o’clock, all their felicity va­
               <lb/>nished, while the remembrance of the
               <lb/>blissful days they had enjoyed heightened
               <lb/>the pangs of separation; yet each conceal­
               <lb/>ed their sufferings, to avoid increasing the
               <lb/>misery the other felt.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Rose</persName> was dressed at four o’clock, and
               <lb/>had breakfast prepared for her lover to
               <lb/>refresh him before he began his march;
               <lb/>but neither of them could eat.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Felix</persName> conversed cheerfully on a variety
               <lb/>of indifferent subjects, to divert them from
               <lb/>thinking of their situation. His sister
               <lb/>knew his kind nature, and courageously
               <lb/>checked the convulsive grief that inwardly
               <lb/>rent her agitated bosom; but she would
               <lb/>not trust herself to speak, fearful that her
               <lb/>faltering voice would shake <persName>sir Eglamour's</persName>
               <lb/>fortitude. When he was to set out, she
               <lb/>would walk with him and <persName>Felix</persName> to the
               <lb/>spot where he was to join his men; it
               <lb/>was about a mile from <placeName>Treharne</placeName>, by the
               <lb/>side of a road that was on their march,
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">where</mw>
               <pb/>
               <milestone unit="sig" n="M12r"/>
               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">263</mw>
               <lb/>where his servant waited for him with his
               <lb/>horse.
            </p>
            <p>Before they reached this place of des­
               <lb/>tination, <persName>Miss Douglas</persName> heard at a distance
               <lb/>the sound of the drums and other instru­
               <lb/>ments of martial music. She turned very
               <lb/>pale at these signals, which gave notice of
               <lb/>their approaching separation, and unable,
               <lb/>if she remained longer with her lover, to
               <lb/>suppress the keenness of her feelings, she
               <lb/>told him she should not proceed any far­
               <lb/>ther. They snatched a hasty embrace,
               <lb/>and not daring to venture a second look
               <lb/>at each other, <placeName>sir Eglamour</placeName> pursued his
               <lb/>route with <persName>Felix</persName>, and <persName>Rose</persName> returned to
               <lb/><placeName>Treharne</placeName> with <persName>Kamira</persName>, who had followed
               <lb/>them when they left home, according to
               <lb/>her young lady's desire.
            </p>
            <p>When they arrived at their ancient
               <lb/>abode, <persName>Jane</persName> was waiting to receive them,
               <lb/>being anxious to learn how her sister had
               <lb/>supported this trying scene. <persName>Rose</persName> re­
               <lb/>clined her head on her shoulder, and for
               <lb/>the first time indulged her sorrow, weep­

               <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">264</mw>
               <lb/>ing and lamenting the deprivation of her
               <lb/>amiable lover with all the luxury of un­
               <lb/>feigned woe and sincerity of a truly-at­
               <lb/>tached heart.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Kamira</persName> now related to <persName>Miss Jane Doug­
               <lb/>las</persName> with what fortitude and calmness <persName>Rose</persName>
               <lb/>had behaved, that she might not unman
               <lb/>and afflict <persName>sir Eglamour</persName> with the sight of
               <lb/>her distress.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Jane</persName> praised her for this exemplary be­
               <lb/>haviour in the most energetic terms. She
               <lb/>admired a conduct so devoid of selfishness,
               <lb/>that from regard for him conquered the
               <lb/>anguish that oppressed her.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Felix</persName> came back in an hour, and like­
               <lb/>wise applauded the command over her
               <lb/>feelings, which had spared <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>
               <lb/>a severe conflict and many torturing sensa­
               <lb/>tions. Her brother also commended the
               <lb/>spirit and sentiments of an <name>Irishwoman</name>,
               <lb/>one of the soldiers' wives, who, as she
               <lb/>took leave of her husband, exhorted him
               <lb/>to behave bravely for the credit of his
               <lb/>king and country, saying, she would ra­

               <lb/>ther hear he was dead, than learn that he
               <lb/>had behaved cowardly. <persName>Sir Eglamour</persName>
               <lb/>and his brother-officers praised her as she
               <lb/>merited, and the soldiers cheered her as
               <lb/>she went off.
            </p>
            <p>Several days had elapsed since the depar­
               <lb/>ture of <persName>sir Eglamour</persName>, when about twelve
               <lb/>o’clock one night, the moon shone bright
               <lb/>and clear, and all the family at <placeName>Treharne
               <lb/>Hall</placeName> having retired early to rest, were bu­
               <lb/>ried in the arms of sleep. At this period,
               <lb/>when silence and tranquillity reigned un­
               <lb/>disturbed, the wheels of a postchaise, at
               <lb/>some distance, were distinctly heard, from
               <lb/>the stillness of the night, rattling rapidly
               <lb/>along. The chaise was driven with swift­
               <lb/>ness till it reached the banks of the little
               <lb/>river that meandered till it flowed near
               <lb/>and washed the walls of the old mansion
               <lb/>where <persName>Felix</persName> and his sisters at present
               <lb/>calmly reposed.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName> was in this postchaise,
               <lb/>with <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName>, a <rs type="properAdjective">Scotch</rs> gentleman,

               <lb/>a particular friend of the general's, who
               <lb/>being obliged to remain at <placeName>Edinburgh</placeName>,
               <lb/>had confided his lady to the care of this
               <lb/>friend. They both arrived, much fatigued,
               <lb/>opposite the habitation of <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>,
               <lb/>from which she had been so long ba­
               <lb/>nished.
            </p>
            <p>Eagerly she desired the postillion to
               <lb/>stop, as her heart beat high with rapture
               <lb/>to think she should soon behold her loved
               <lb/>children, and enfold them in her maternal
               <lb/>embrace: but too transitory was this
               <lb/>sweet emotion; consternation, horror, and
               <lb/>affliction, overwhelmed her, when she
               <lb/>viewed aghast, by the light of the moon,
               <lb/>which caused every surrounding object to
               <lb/>be plainly seen, a volume of smoke aris­
               <lb/>ing from that wing of <placeName>Treharne Hall</placeName> that
               <lb/>was generally uninhabited. <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>
               <lb/>uttered an affecting cry of anguish and
               <lb/>terror, and while <persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> looked at
               <lb/>her with mingled pity and concern, that
               <lb/>side of the building became enveloped in
               <mw type="catch" rend="break(yes)align(right)">flames,</mw>

               <lb/>flames, which burst out from the win­
               <lb/>dows.
            </p>
            <p>The conflagration appeared to be spread­
               <lb/>ing rapidly, and threatened destruction to
               <lb/>the whole edifice, while the red reflection
               <lb/>in the horizon announced that the man­
               <lb/>sion was on fire.
            </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Moncrief</persName> implored <persName>Mrs. Douglas</persName>
